Ignore it completely, and opportunities are missed. Success is had by finding the sweet spot between logic-based decision-making and that inner voice.\n\nParker's career is a master class on living in that harmonious balance. Even when her hand might have been forced or a decision was made that she was in complete disagreement with, Parker always prevailed. Maybe not immediately, either. But in time, Parker always came out on top.\n\nIn this instance, there is no summit. Certainly not in the way Parker envisioned.\n\nBut one thing about Parker, she always has understood timing.\n\nOn the court, Parker's elite sense of timing has lent itself well to perfectly placed passes behind her back or between defenders' legs, flawlessly guiding teammates to the rim. Or, in her strategic hesitations, masterfully misleading her opponents before embarrassing them with a driving layup.\n\nThis skill also has led to major life moments such as her decision to leave Tennessee and turn pro after three seasons and two NCAA titles. Or, 13 years later, when she left the Sparks -- who drafted her with the No. 1 overall pick in 2008 -- to sign with the Sky, her hometown franchise.\n\nIt's no wonder then that in her retirement, Parker's keen sense, too, played a role. After 16 years in the WNBA, 10 surgeries and a slew of records and accolades, it's over.\n\nThe ending wasn't perfect. A nagging foot injury requiring another surgery might have forced her hand. Regardless, it was time, and Parker did it her way -- as she always has.\n\n\"Candace has never liked to be put in a box,\" Parker's mother, Sara, said. \"No matter what it is. Tell her she can't do something and watch.\"\n\nParker fully committed to basketball at 13 after years of playing soccer and a couple more as a middle hitter in volleyball.\n\nBut when she fell in love with Spalding's orange ball, she fell hard.\n\n\"I remember going to pick her up after practice her freshman year,\" Sara Parker said. \"I told her, 'The car is leaving. If you want to walk home, then you can stay in here.'\u2009\"\n\n\"Well, I have to get 10 free throws in a row,\" Parker shot back.\n\nOnce Parker had a goal in mind, she couldn't leave the gym until she accomplished it -- even if that meant walking home. Parker's pleas for five more minutes happened \"all the time.\" She may not have won those negotiations, but her parents knew it meant she was hooked on the game.\n\nFrom the outset, she played it her way.\n\nAt that time, players with Parker's height were banished to the block, forced to play with their back to the basket. In the Parker household, versatility was the highest form of currency.\n\nIt didn't matter that as she progressed, coaches would continue to try to force her inside. Instead, she forced them to see she was positionless before it was trendy.\n\nShe created the trend and, as a result, is the only player in WNBA history to rank in the top 10 in career points, rebounds, assists and blocks.\n\n\"The one [play] that stands out as one of my favorites is when Naperville Central played Regina in the state championship,\" Parker's father, Larry, recalled. \"She dribbled the length of the floor, went through all five of the players, behind her back and up to the basket.\"\n\nTen days before her 22nd birthday, Parker was selected by the Sparks 15 hours after winning her second NCAA title at Tennessee, where she played for legendary coach Pat Summitt.\n\nDespite having another year of eligibility, Parker knew it was time.\n\nParker was the consensus No. 1 pick for the 2008 WNBA Draft. The Sky, heading into their third season, undoubtedly wanted to bring the former Naperville Central star \"home,\" and there were whispers that they would get it done.\n\nUltimately, they kept the No. 2 pick, and the Sparks, who were coming off a 10-24 season, the worst in franchise history, stayed at No. 1. Parker was L.A.'s future, and she had the baton passed directly to her from one of the game's greats -- Lisa Leslie.\n\nParker lived up to the hype immediately, leading the Sparks to a 20-14 record in her rookie season. She became the first player in WNBA history to be named MVP and Rookie of the Year in the same season. A feat no player has accomplished since.\n\nIn 2009, Leslie retired, officially marking a transition of power, not only in Los Angeles but also in the league.\n\nThe years that followed included box-office playoff meetings between Parker's Sparks and Maya Moore's formidable Minnesota Lynx, who featured Lindsay Whalen, Seimone Augustus, Rebekkah Brunson and Sylvia Fowles.\n\nIn 2016, Parker and the Sparks finally landed on the winning side of championship history.\n\nIt was a career-defining year.\n\nMonths earlier, she suffered quite an affront when she was left off the 2016 Olympic roster. She already had helped Team USA win gold medals in 2008 and 2012 and was coming off a stellar camp, during which she said coach Geno Auriemma told her, \"You're trying to be the best player in the world.\"\n\nAnd yet, she was omitted.\n\nIn the interviews that followed, including in recent years, Parker has spoken at length about the aspects of that decision that bothered her most. Lost time always has been among her answers.\n\n\"I was mad at my time spent away from my family,\" Parker said in an interview with ESPN for her documentary, ''Unapologetic.''\n\nThree months later, she led the Sparks past the Lynx with a dominant 28-point, 12-rebound performance in Game 5, which helped her earn Finals MVP.\n\n\"Her play in that game was huge,\" former teammate Chelsea Gray said. \"People need to go back and watch that game.\"\n\nOver the next four seasons, the WNBA landscape shifted again. After facing the Lynx in the Finals in 2017, the Seattle Storm, anchored by young point forward Breanna Stewart -- another emulator of Parker's playing style -- won two titles in three years.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sky were piecing together a contender. When former coach/general manager James Wade joined the organization in 2018, he knew he had a special team.\n\nOver the next couple of years, rumors circulated that Parker was open to leaving Los Angeles. Wade thought about making a play for her, but the team wasn't ready yet. He believed there were players who still needed time to develop and find themselves.\n\nIn 2021, the franchise still wasn't ready for Parker.\n\nThe Sky were practicing out of a public recreation center in Deerfield, the same one they still practice out of today. Their arena and locker room were, and still are, shared with DePaul. But the roster was ready, and she just happened to be from Naperville. Had Parker grown up in Indiana, Connecticut, Seattle or New York, WNBA free agency could've had a different look in 2021.\n\nThere was also the aspect of retiring a Spark, but when she answered questions about what she needed, wanted and deserved, her decision was made.\n\n\"One thing I'll say about Candace is that she gets cut from the Olympic team and turns around and wins a WNBA title,\" said Justine Brown, VP of creative development and talent relations at TOGETHXR. \"She gets benched in the playoffs, switches teams and turns around and wins another title.\"\n\nAlongside Courtney Vandersloot, Allie Quigley and Kahleah Copper, her second WNBA title was within reach. Her work ethic, habits and mentality -- all of which have made her teammates better at every stage of her career -- brought the title to fruition.\n\n\"She's a cyborg,\" Wade said of her habits.\n\nParker suffered an ankle injury at the start of the 2021 season. While she was out, the Sky went on a seven-game skid. When she returned, the Sky flipped it to a seven-game winning streak.\n\nQuietly in the background during that season, Parker was flying on her own dime to see different trainers and specialists to help keep her body ready for peak performance. Without fail, Wade said she'd be the first to practice, oftentimes walking in with the coaching staff.\n\n\"To go back home,\" Kahleah Copper said, \"she took a risk. She went [for it], but she [expletive] won. She won.\"\n\nParker's timing may have never looked more perfect than in the waning seconds of the Sky's Game 4 win over the Phoenix Mercury in the Finals. With four seconds left, her team up by six, Parker leaped in the air and grabbed Brittney Griner's missed three-pointer with her right hand.\n\nAs time expired, she dribbled the ball down the left side of the court. When she reached halfcourt, she picked the ball up and broke into a full sprint toward her family sitting courtside. It was poetic that Parker closed the game\n\nwith the ball in her hands.\n\n\"When Candace decides she's going to do something, she does it,\" Sara Parker said.\n\nParker decided she was going to leave Los Angeles to win another title. The tears that fell on the shoulders of her mother and her wife, Anna, as she hugged them at that moment were testaments to the fact that she once again lived up to her word.\n\nIf Parker wanted her retirement to be perceived as perfect, she would have hung it up after that 2021 title. It's hard to top standing on a scorer's table, arms outstretched, as confetti rains and thousands watch.\n\nThe competitor in Parker brought her back for the 2022 season in an effort to win back-to-back titles in Chicago. After the Sky failed in one of the most shocking playoff collapses in WNBA history, the competitor once again pulled Parker back.\n\nParker gave birth to her daughter, Lailaa, after her rookie season. She has been her mom's shadow at every stage of her career. When Parker decided to return for the 2023 season, being close to her home in Los Angeles as Lailaa began high school was the most important factor.\n\nThe Las Vegas Aces were able to provide proximity, an opportunity to compete for another title and the professional-athlete experience that had eluded Parker her entire WNBA career. For the first time, Parker had her own locker. One that could house her belongings for days, weeks or months if she wanted with her name etched on a placard.\n\nThroughout her career, she spoke about leaving the game better than she found it. Her season in Las Vegas was an opportunity for her to see firsthand the reality of that being accomplished.\n\nThe Aces already were a juggernaut before Parker signed. Her addition made them nearly unbeatable. They went 19-2 to open the season, averaging 94 points while holding opponents to 78.6.\n\nParker played 18 games that season from May to July. In her last game, a two-point loss to the Dallas Wings, Parker had 10 points and six rebounds.\n\nShe had been playing on an 89% fractured left foot. An injury to her right ankle, which required an MRI exam, prompted her to get one on her foot, too. The Aces went on to make history, becoming the first team to win back-to-back titles since the Sparks in 2001 and 2002.\n\nParker became the first player in WNBA history to win titles with three teams.\n\nThe truth is, there is no perfect retirement story. Kobe Bryant scoring 60 points in his final game or Derek Jeter's walk-off single in his last at-bat at home might be close. Neither of those seasons, however, ended with a playoff appearance, let alone a title.\n\nThe players who have come closest to the picturesque retirement are the ones with the best sense of time.\n\nFor years, Parker has played through pain, willing her body to give just a little bit more to the game that gave her everything. Even now, she wanted to do it again.\n\n\"When she was a freshman at Tennessee, we went down there, and they were showing us X-rays,\" Larry Parker said. \"When they told us she needed surgery, she sighed and said, 'So now I'm going to have to sit around and walk around on crutches to every game.'\u2009\"\n\nParker never wanted to be looked at with pity.\n\nShe always has been that way. It's one of the reasons last season was so challenging. Yes, the Aces won back-to-back titles, and Parker contributed significantly to that accomplishment. But she didn't contribute the way she wanted to.\n\nIt's also one of the reasons a farewell tour was never in the cards. Parker never wanted people's default admiration or forced celebration because her career was ending.\n\nShe wanted to be able to walk off the court with her loved ones, all of them knowing it was over and that fans showed up and applauded, not because it was her last game. But because she was great.\n\nThe reason Parker's career appears as though it's filled with moments of perfect timing is because she worked to make it so.\n\nHer decision to leave college after three seasons doesn't look perfect if she doesn't put the work in to become the two-time league MVP, three-time WNBA champion and seven-time All-Star, a trailblazer for women's sports and one of the greatest players of all time.\n\nThere's no silver lining to being left off the Olympic roster if Parker doesn't lead the Sparks to a WNBA title.\n\nSigning with the Sky doesn't have the makings of a movie if Parker doesn't push her body to its absolute limit to stay healthy.\n\nRight now, Parker's retirement might not look perfect. But if her career has indicated anything, it's that she's working so that one day it does.", "source": {"uri": "chicago.suntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Sun-Times"}, "authors": [],

Parker, No. 533871/2023 in the Supreme Court of the State of New York County of Kings.\n\nIn 2019, Parker proposed legislation that would make prison inmates eligible to vote while they are behind bars, according to Breitbart News.\n\nHowever, the outlet said at the time that \"Parker's proposal is getting heat from his fellow Democrats, who argue that voting is a right that should be taken away if incarcerated.\"\n\nIn 2018, Parker, who was sponsoring a bill that would require potential gun owners to submit to social media background checks, told a Republican aide online to \"kill\" herself after she accused him of misusing a parking placard, according to Breitbart News.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amy_furr@breitbart.com", "name": "Amy Furr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_Survivors_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adult Survivors Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WCBS-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WCBS-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breitbart News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute of limitations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/05/GettyImages-1241754908.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543625", "eventUri": "eng-9543625", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Clark's first preseason game is tonight.\n\nClark's bringing record-breaking college scoring numbers -- not to mention record jersey sales, television ratings and ticket demand -- along for the ride.\n\nPeople hang on every word at her news conferences. She can't take a step without someone recording whom she's following on social media, whom she's dating or what outfit she's wearing.\n\nClark has entered a rare realm of celebrity status enjoyed, or maybe dreaded, by very few. It's a Taylor Swift kind of status where every move is monitored.\n\nSomehow, though, I feel like I've seen this before. A less aggressive version of it, anyway.\n\nTwenty years ago, Candace Parker was like Caitlin Clark. At least to the level it was possible without TikTok, Instagram or whatever Twitter is called these days.\n\nDuring her time at Naperville Central, especially after her legendary dunk as a sophomore in 2001, Parker was nationally known. She was hounded for autographs after games and made high profile media appearances with an amazing level of savvy and grace for someone still a teenager.\n\nSound familiar? Twenty years before anyone heard of Clark, Parker was lifting women's basketball onto her shoulders and carrying it into a new era of exposure.\n\nParker did it with a primary focus on winning. Naperville Central rolled to two IHSA state titles, including a 35-0 record her junior year. She garnered USA Today, Gatorade and Naismith national player of the year honors.\n\nParker went on to play at Tennessee under legendary coach Pat Summitt, earning more player of the year awards and leading the Volunteers to two national titles. In three seasons she scored more than 2,100 points.\n\nParker won two Olympic gold medals and, after being the No. 1 overall pick in the 2008 draft, won three WNBA titles. One came with the Chicago Sky in 2021 during a triumphant return to the area.\n\nShe even became the first women's basketball player to appear on the cover of the NBA2K video game. She signed multimillion dollar deals with Adidas and Gatorade.\n\nSound familiar? Clark is trying to open doors for other women's basketball players, much in the same way Parker did years ago.\n\nI'm forever grateful for the opportunity to cover Parker a handful of times when she was at Naperville Central. Every game was a marquee event because you might be watching the greatest women's basketball player of all time.\n\nLooking at the scrutiny surrounding Clark, I can't help but wonder if Parker considers herself lucky for missing out on that level of microscopic attention.\n\nClark seems to embrace her role as the rising tide lifting all boats in women's basketball, but she also seems like someone who just wants to play ball and win titles.\n\nAs much attention as Parker drew as a superstar, the intense social media scrutiny didn't exist 20 years ago. On the other hand, the world instantly knows when Clark blocks Antonio Brown on social media.\n\nImagine being watched that closely.\n\nParker got a taste of it, at a younger age no less. Can you imagine the number of Parker's high school highlights that would've bombarded YouTube had it existed?\n\nIt's something we need to remember as Clark continues on her own journey.", "source":

Although he was acquitted, the incident emerged in the press around the release of \"The Birth of a Nation,\" a film which many expected to win awards. Parker responded then saying he was \"falsely accused\" and had been \"vindicated\" by the court.\n\nA remorseful Parker was seated alongside Spike Lee, who is supporting the film, and producers Mark Burg and Tarak Ben Ammar hours before his new film premieres at the festival to some 650 people.\n\n\"I'm still learning and growing and still feeling the need to make films that speak to things that need to change in our country and the world,\" Parker said. \"And this topic was very dear to me.\"\n\nThe new film, \"American Skin,\" stars Parker as an ex-Marine who sees his unarmed 14year-old son murdered by a police officer during a traffic stop. When the courts fail to hold the officer responsible, Parker's character Lincoln Jefferson decides to seek justice in his own way. Parker was inspired to write the film after Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\n\"I haven't had a film that's affected me this deeply in a while,\" said Lee, who offered to help Parker in any way that he could. \"This is a very important film and I wanted to be part of it ... Art can affect people's behavior good or bad. And it is my hope that this film deals with the very serious problem with police and brown and black people in the United States of America.\"\n\nLee said he had no reservations putting his name behind Parker's.\n\n\"It's a move forward. Nate is in here. He's not hiding. He's answering all questions,\" Lee said. \"This is only Nate's second feature film, there's a lot more in him.\"\n\nThe producers didn't hesitate to back a film from Parker either, even considering the fact that \"The Birth of a Nation\" fizzled in theaters and didn't even make back its acquisition price. Next week, they'll take the film to the Toronto International Film Festival to screen for distributors in hope of securing a release plan.\n\n\"In Europe we didn't know what was going on with Nate Parker,\" Ammar said, who called Parker's agent after being moved by \"The Birth of a Nation.\" \"All I cared about is the power of the filmmaker, actor, writer, director.\"\n\nBurg added that, \"Nate is one of if not the most talented director\" and that this \"was a story that needs to be told.\"\n\nIn the film, Parker brings together all sides to have a \"real conversation\" between those supporting the police and those feeling persecuted by law enforcement.\n\n\"What I wanted to do was really force the conversation,\" he said. \"This film isn't about those two sides. It's about being the bridge between those two sides ... and being able to talk on the level about what they see and what they feel every day.\"\n\nHe also hopes that audiences don't misinterpret \"American Skin\" as being pessimistic.\n\n\"It's my reality,\" he said. \"When Spike and I go home and we get off the plane and get in the car, guess what? We're not going to be safe.\"\n\nParker held back tears when a reporter asked about the legacy he wants to leave.\n\n\"I do have a lot of stories I want to tell because I feel like the world is broken,\" Parker said, mentioning gun violence, indigenous people, and the plight of women globally.\n\n\"It is my prayer that I'll be able to tell more stories. All I can control is what I can control. And I hope moving forward that I get that opportunity.\"", "source": {"uri": "sfltimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South Florida Times: Miami , Broward, Palm Beach, Breaking News & Weather at

It was a \"get Trump\" scheme, to open the door for the E. Jean Carroll lawsuit, but like all things \"get Trump\" it has backfired...spectacularly.\n\nBecause, at the eleventh hour before the act was set to expire, a young woman (Olga Jean-Baptiste) accused Parker of forcibly raping her in 2004, so now, Parker is calling the law \"unconstitutional.\"\n\nFurthermore, according to a local report, Parker called the accusation \"absolutely untrue.\" Huh, interesting response; so am I to understand that he's accusing Jean-Baptiste of lying about the alleged assault?\n\nNow, it's not like I expect the case to go anywhere, but since he's basically labeling his accuser a liar -- perhaps she's a mentally-ill hag with a ludicrous series of events who's been obsessing over him for years, because in that case, I would be more inclined to believe Parker -- he too should be subject to an $83.3 million fine, for the sake of optics and an even-handed application of the law and punitive measures of course. Because, as precedent dictates, this is \"defamation\" and that's a very serious issue. (Heaven help him if he ever tried to implement an NDA or pay Jean-Baptiste a \"hush money\" sum to go away.)\n\nAs I mentioned above, Parker isn't a merit hire, so allow me to point to the fatal flaw in the legislation that he endorsed -- this is a case of a poorly-written and inarticulate law. (Perhaps all the DIE lawyers hired for legislative counsel are to blame? This was clearly a \"get Trump\" initiative, but the bill's text read that the law could be used against \"any party\" accused of a \"sexual offense\" (as defined by state code elsewhere). Naturally, this was going to ensnare more Democrat politicians than anything (Andrew Cuomo, Eric Adams, now Parker) since they are the preeminent (and bona fide) abusers, so they really should have been a little smarter, and instead of writing the bill to allow \"any party\" to be subjected to a lawsuit, they should have been clearer and more specific; see a suggested draft below:\n\n[E]very civil claim or cause of action brought against [Donald J. Trump]...which would constitute a sexual offense...which is barred as of the effective date of this section because the applicable period of limitation has expired...is hereby revived....\n\nSure, it seems unconstitutional, but that didn't stop them before!", "source": {"uri": "americanthinker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Thinker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Parker_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Parker (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_Survivors_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adult Survivors Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Jean_Carroll", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "E.

In the video, Parker is playing with his brand-new lightsabers! He picks up the glowing blue lightsabers and lines them up next to each other. Then he grabs one and lifts it up, touching the glowing blade like he wants to lose a hand Luke Skywalker-style.\n\n\"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....\" scrolling text over the video reads. It's set to the main title of the movies, with this one called \"Episode II The Rise of Parker.\"\n\n\"On this May the 4, we gather to celebrate the second orbit of young Parker James Scott, a Jedi Knight in training destined for greatness. As the twin sons rise over the horizon, young Scott prepares to fulfill his destiny as the first-born brother.\"\n\nThe text went on to say that Parker \"will overcome any obstacle that stands in his path\" with the help of \"wise mentors\" and his \"steadfast family.\"\n\n\"So let the celebration begin, with lightsabers ignited and hearts full of hope,\" it continued. \"For on this day, we honor the journey of a young hero, destined to leave an indelible mark on the galaxy.\" It ends by wishing Parker a happy birthday and saying, \"May the Force be with you, always.\"\n\nIn addition to Parker's birthday, it was also Scott and wife Linda Phan's anniversary! He shared a heartfelt tribute to his wife, who is currently pregnant with their second son. \"14 years together, 6 years married, 2 babies and a lifetime to go. I love you more and more each day. Happy anniversary, Lindy! \u2764\ufe0f\" he wrote.\n\nPhan shared her own tribute to her relationship and to her son Parker. \"so much to celebrate today and everyday,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"being on this earth together. face masks that don't fit. hand dimples... \ud83e\udd70 Parky really knew when to make his entrance into this world. He teaches us so much about love \u2764\ufe0f\u2728.\" Aww!\n\nOne of her pictures gave a glimpse of Parker's birthday celebration. He had a white cake decorated with strawberries and a \"Happy 2 Birthday Parker!\" flag. The table also had delicious looking cupcakes and a number \"2\" decoration that looked like a friendly dragon. Parker wore a felt dragon hat and a dragon shirt under a khaki vest for the cute outdoor party.\n\nThere was also a photo of Parker trying to change a baby doll's diaper (getting ready for that little sibling!) and a close-up of his sweet little hand.

It's made a huge difference to my quality of life,' she said.\n\n'Before, the seizures were incapacitating me, leaving black spots in my memory. Thanks to LITT I've been able to get on with my life and worry less about my epilepsy.\n\nAbout 600,000 people are living with epilepsy in the UK, equivalent to nearly one in 100 people.\n\nWhile most people can take medication to help stop or reduce seizures, about a third of patients can't control their seizures with drugs alone.\n\nFor many of these patients neurosurgery to remove the epilepsy-causing part of the brain is the only option.\n\nAlison Fuller, director of Health Improvement and Influencing at Epilepsy Action, welcomed the NHS announcement.\n\n'This new therapy is an exciting ray of hope for the many people with epilepsy whose lives are being impacted by the harsh reality of uncontrolled seizures,' she said.\n\n'Research shows that around three in 10 people with epilepsy have seizures which do not respond well to standard treatment with epilepsy medication.\n\n'This means many continue to face significant challenges in other areas of life, from education to employment.'\n\nThere's around 600,000 people living with epilepsy in the UK, that's nearly one in 100 people\n\nLey Sander, Medical Director at the Epilepsy Society and Professor of Neurology at University College London (UCL) said: 'This non-invasive form of neurosurgery could be groundbreaking for some people with brain lesions whose seizures do not respond to conventional treatment options, including more invasive epilepsy surgery.\n\n'It will make surgery safer and faster and dramatically cut the recovery period for individuals.

They are also given immunosuppressant drugs for a year to ensure their immune system doesn't reject the stem cells.\n\nThe therapy doesn't work immediately because the transplanted cells need five to seven months to start producing GABA in sufficient quantities.\n\nAll the people in the recent trial, which began back in 2022, had a common type of epilepsy -- mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.\n\nWhile four have improved with the treatment, one has not -- but none in the study group has experienced severe side-effects.\n\nA larger study of 30 patients is being planned for next year.\n\nCommenting on the research, Matthew Walker, a professor of neurology at University College London, said: 'This new trial shows exciting preliminary results. It could provide an alternative to surgical interventions in this type of epilepsy and for those who do not respond to medication.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0393-Aminobutyric_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "\u0393-Aminobutyric acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stem cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epilepsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Academy of Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_anaesthetic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General anaesthetic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic resonance imaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amnesia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Visual impairment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Institutes of Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interneuron", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interneuron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_lobe_epilepsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temporal lobe epilepsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunosuppressive_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immunosuppressive drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University College London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adverse effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell_Biology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell Biology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Immunology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Immunology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/06/21/84525771-0-image-a-67_1715028480479.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543686", "eventUri": "eng-9543686", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The research team found that people who experienced nocturnal hypoxia, which occurs when oxygen saturation falls below 80 percent, were three times more likely to develop late-onset epilepsy compared to those who did not. Additionally, study participants who reported themselves as having sleep apnea later in life were twice as likely to develop late-onset epilepsy as those without the sleep disorder.How Does This Affect Prevention Strategies?Though sleep apnea has been linked to other detrimental effects, the connection to epilepsy has not been noted until now. Sleep apnea's link to nocturnal hypoxia could mean that chronic low oxygen levels during sleep could change the brain enough to trigger seizures. The research team noted that the study could not determine whether treating or preventing sleep apnea could reduce the risk of epilepsy. Still, it does suggest it could be a target for reducing the risk of late-onset epilepsy.\n\nCurrently, there is no cure for late-onset epilepsy, but there are treatments available to help manage the condition. According to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, about seven in 10 people with epilepsy can control their seizures with medications or surgery. Such medications work by reducing how often brain cells send excessive or confusing electrical signals that can provoke seizures. Many individuals can also manage their condition with diet therapy, with many utilizing the keto or modified Atkins diet.\n\n\"Discovering a reversible cause for the development of any type of idiopathic epilepsy is an aspirational goal for epilepsy researchers or clinician,\" Dr. Christopher Carosella, the study's lead researcher and assistant professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins University, said in the press release. \"We hope this study might be a small first step in that direction and also an encouragement to evaluate and treat sleep disorders in patients with epilepsy.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hypoxia (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_apnea", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sleep apnea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epilepsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_saturation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen saturation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Institutes of Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_inhibitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enzyme inhibitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ketone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neuron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johns Hopkins University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sleep disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2020/05/08/man2-apnea-700x420.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543686", "eventUri": "eng-9543686", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

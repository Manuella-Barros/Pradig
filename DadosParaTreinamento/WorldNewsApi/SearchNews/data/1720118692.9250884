I wish him all the very best.\" \"In addition, I am pleased to announce the new appointments of two new commissioners, Angela Dixon and Talia Anderson-Town who will both join the board on 1 June.\" The board plays a significant role for New Zealanders in our communities. They promote, organise, and conduct New Zealand lotteries, make rules regulating the conduct of those lotteries, and distribute all profits to sporting, cultural and other community recipients via the Lotteries Grants Board. The board has a commitment to continue to responsibly grow its profits and maximise its distributions to the Lottery Grants Board. \"I have previously expressed to the board that it is paramount that minimal harm is created from Lotto NZ's products, and that any impact created from its products can be sufficiently monitored.\" \"It is important that Lotto NZ employs responsible and efficient financial management to ensure that returns to the community are maximised.

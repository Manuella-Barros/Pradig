The \"PacMan\" who is the only fighter in the history of the sport to win twelve major world titles in eight different weight divisions, was rumoured to be planning a comeback to professional boxing at the age of 45, and was touted as a possible opponent for American fighter Mario Barrios for a shot at the interim WBC super-welterweight belt. Pacquiao had also held talks about a potential showdown with Conor Benn - son of British hero Nigel - earlier in the year. He last stepped into the ring in August 2021, when he fell short in a tilt for the WBA welterweight title in a points loss to Cuban boxer Yordenis Ugas, but, did get past DK Yoo in an exhibition via a unanimous decision in December 2022. But the Filipino hero has now signed up for a \"Special Standing Bout\" at the Super RIZN event held at the Saitama Super Arena in Japan on July 28. The bout will consist of three, three-minute rounds with the fighters allowed to weigh in at a maximum limit of 150 pounds. His opponent Suzuki is undefeated in his last eight contests in RIZN and will warm up for his meeting with Pacquiao by taking on fellow Japanese fighter Takanori Gomi in an boxing match on June 23, Pacquiao himself confirmed his participation in the event by appearing in the ring during the RIZN 47 show on Sunday. He said: \"Next month I am going to fight here in Japan and I hope that everyone will come to watch the fight. It's going to be a good fight with a lot of action.\"", "summary": "The Filipino legend won 62 of his 72 professional bouts between 1995 and 2021, winning world honours in eight different divisions.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/boxing/manny-pacquiao-announces-boxing-return-32992558", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32992671.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Knockout-Chaos-Anthony-Joshua-v-Francis-Ngannou-Fight-Night.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:23:33", "author": "Anthony Evans", "authors": ["Anthony Evans"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.115}

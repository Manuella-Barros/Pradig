A Minnesota effort aims to change that", "text": "WABASHA, Minn. \u2014 Can you name the national bird of the U.S? Technically, there isn\u2019t one. Minnesota DFL Sen. Amy Klobuchar is co-author of legislation to change that. The proposed legislation is a bipartisan effort to designate the bald eagle as the official bird of the U.S. The regal raptor has long been a symbol of the country. In 1782, the Continental Congress placed the bald eagle on the front of the great seal of the U.S., which is seen on the back of the dollar bill. However, there\u2019s been no official action identifying the bald eagle as the national bird. In announcing the proposal, Klobuchar notes Minnesota is home to a large population of bald eagles. The state is also home to the National Eagle Center in Wabasha. \u201cThe bald eagle is a symbol of our country\u2019s freedom and strength,\u201d said Klobuchar in a statement announcing the proposal. \u201cMy bipartisan legislation will officially designate the bald eagle as our country\u2019s National Bird.\u201d Sens. Klobuchar and Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, along with Reps. Brad Finstad, a Republican, Angie Craig, a DFLer, both of Minnesota, are leading the legislative effort. \u201cSince the founding of our nation, the bald eagle has existed as a symbol of our country\u2019s independence, strength and freedom,\u201d Finstad said in a statement announcing the proposal. \u201cI am proud to introduce this legislation which will officially classify the bald eagle as the national bird \u2014 its proper place of honor as an integral part of our national identity.\u201d The National Eagle Center is endorsing the effort. \u201cWhile most people assume the bald eagle is our nation\u2019s official bird, the fact is our country doesn\u2019t have an official bird,\u201d Preston Cook, co-chair of the National Bird Initiative for the National Eagle Center said in a statement backing the proposed legislation. \u201cThe bison is the national mammal, the rose is the national flower, and the oak is the national tree. It\u2019s time the bald eagle, long revered as our national symbol, finds its rightful place as our country\u2019s official national bird.\u201d The initiative also has the support of the Midwest Alliance of Sovereign Tribes, which represents 36 indigenous nations and four tribal organizations.

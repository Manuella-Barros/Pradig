The licence fee mop-up climbed 3.76% sequentially to Rs 5,637 crore while SUC collections rose 2.85% on-quarter to Rs 869 crore, data collated by the regulator showed.\n\nTelcos annually pay 8% of AGR as licence fees while the overall SUC payout is around 0.5% of AGR after the government had said airwaves acquired from the last 5G auction onwards won't attract any SUC.\n\nOverall, the broadband subscribers (wireline+wireless) in the country increased by 2.16% to 924.07 million at the end of March.

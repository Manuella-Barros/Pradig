The Men In Blue looked impressive on Wednesday as they kicked off their campaign with a routine win over Ireland that saw Rohit Sharma and Rishabh Pant make short work of a target of 97. With just one win from seven in their previous T20 World Cup encounters with India, Pakistan's T20 World Cup track record is far from great against their old foes, and their preparations for this key match have been less than perfect. The out-of-form Shaheens crashed to a seismic shock defeat to co-hosts the USA in their opening game, and skipper captain Babar Azama will be demanding a big response from his teammates in a match after that humbling.

How to watch online from anywhere using a VPN If you find yourself unable to view this T20i locally, you may need a different way to watch this match -- that's where using a VPN can come in handy. A VPN is also the best way to stop your ISP from throttling your speeds on game day by encrypting your traffic. It's also a great idea if you're traveling and find yourself connected to a Wi-Fi network, and you want to add an extra layer of privacy for your devices and logins. With a VPN, you're able to virtually change your location on your phone, tablet or laptop to get access to the game. Most VPNs, like our Editors' Choice, ExpressVPN, make it really easy to do this. Using a VPN to watch or stream sports is legal in any country where VPNs are legal, including the US, UK and Australia, as long as you have a legitimate subscription to the service you're streaming. Be sure your VPN is set up correctly to prevent leaks: Even where VPNs are legal, the streaming service may terminate the account of anyone it deems to be circumventing correctly applied blackout restrictions.

Quick tips for streaming India vs. Pakistan using a VPN With four variables at play -- your ISP, browser, video streaming provider and VPN -- your experience and success when streaming this T20i match live may vary.If you don't see your desired location as a default option for ExpressVPN, try using the \"search for city or country\" option.If you're having trouble getting the game after you've turned on your VPN and set it to the correct viewing area, there are two things you can try for a quick fix. First, log into your streaming service subscription account and make sure the address registered for the account is in the correct viewing area. If not, you may need to change the physical address on file with your account. Second, some smart TVs -- like Roku -- don't have VPN apps you can install directly on the device itself. Instead, you'll have to install the VPN on your router or the mobile hotspot you're using (like your phone), so that any device on its Wi-Fi network now appears in the correct viewing location.All of the VPN providers we recommend have helpful instructions on their main site for quickly installing the VPN on your router. In some cases with smart TV services, after you install a cable network's sports app, you'll be asked to verify a numeric code or click a link sent to your email address on file for your smart TV. This is where having a VPN on your router will also help, since both devices will appear to be in the correct location. And remember, browsers can often give away a location despite using a VPN, so be sure you're using a privacy-first browser to log into your services.

The incident, which occurred in Chennai's Thousand Lights area, has prompted authorities to take strict action to enhance safety measures.\n\nThe revised rules now mandate that pets must be leashed and muzzled when inside public parks. Additionally, pet owners are permitted to bring only one pet to the park at a time. Furthermore, obtaining a pet license has become obligatory as per the notification issued by the Chennai Corporation. The notification explicitly states, \"Companion and pet dogs will be checked for license compliance.\"\n\nThe unfortunate attack on the young girl, Sudaksha, transpired on Sunday, as she was playing in the park. Two unleashed Rottweilers targeted her, inflicting severe injuries. Dr. J Radhakrishnan, Commissioner of the Greater Chennai Corporation, revealed that the child sustained an 11-inch scalp laceration. Sudaksha is currently undergoing treatment at a private hospital in the city, with the Corporation committing to covering all medical expenses.\n\nSubsequent to the incident, the city police arrested three individuals, including the owner of the dogs and two others involved. However, all three have been released on bail from the police station, as the offenses are bailable. Investigations have revealed that the dogs were not sterilized, raising suspicions of their involvement in commercial breeding activities.\n\nIn a related development, in March, the Central Government urged states to prohibit the sale and breeding of 23 aggressive dog breeds, including Rottweilers, Pitbull Terriers, American Bulldogs, and Mastiffs.

In a distressing incident last night in Chennai, a five-year-old girl named Sudaksha suffered serious injuries in an attack by two Rottweiler dogs at a public park in Chennai's Thousand Lights area. This unfortunate occurrence has reignited the ongoing debate surrounding the ownership of dogs of aggressive breeds as pets.\n\nAccording to authorities, the dogs, belonging to a local resident, were let loose in the park when they attacked Sudaksha. Allegations suggest that the owner failed to intervene promptly, only doing so when the child's parents rushed to her aid and raised an alarm. Sudaksha's father, who is employed as a security guard at the park, was also present during the incident.\n\nSenior police officer Shekhar Deshmukh confirmed the arrest of the dog owner and the initiation of legal proceedings against two individuals responsible for the care of the dogs and said, \"We have arrested the owner and registered a case against two others who take care of the dogs.\"\n\nSudaksha is currently undergoing treatment at a private hospital for her injuries. It has been revealed that the owner of the Rottweilers had not sterilized the animals, raising concerns about responsible pet ownership.\n\nThis tragic event has once again brought attention to the issue of pet ownership, particularly concerning breeds known for their aggressive tendencies. In March, the Central Government urged states to prohibit the sale and breeding of 23 such breeds, which include Pitbull Terriers, American Bulldogs, Rottweilers, and Mastiffs.\n\nAdditionally, pet owners with existing animals of these breeds have been instructed to sterilize them without delay.

The girl's father Raghu is working as a watchman in the park and he went to attend a funeral in Villupuram at the time of the incident.\n\nThe injured were identified as Sonia and her 5-year-old daughter Sudhak Shah. They live in a small room in the park. Last evening a person named Pugazhendi, who lives nearby, went to the park with two Rottweiler dogs that he is raising. Sudhak Shah, the guard's daughter, who was playing inside the park, was severely bitten by the two dogs.\n\nPeople who were there at that time said that the owner of the dog saw this and was doing nothing to stop the attack. The mother, who came running after hearing the child's cries, was also bitten by two dogs. It is said that the owner of the dog did not do anything and ran away leaving the dogs there. In this case, the child suffered serious head injuries. The neighbors fought and chased away the dogs, rescued the child and the mother and sent them to the Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital.\n\nAfter receiving information, the police of the thousand lamps arrived at the scene and took the owner of the dog, Pugazhendi, to the police station for questioning. Later, the dogs owner assured to take care of the child's treatment at his own expense. The child was immediately shifted from the Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital to the Thousand Lights Area Apollo Children's Hospital where the child is currently being treated.\n\nEyewitnesses of the incident said, \"Yesterday evening when he brought the dogs to the park, the canines were not on a leash. And he did not put any protective shield on the mouths of the dogs. When he entered the park, the two dogs bit the child who was playing there.\" The owner of the dogs is running a blood bank in this area. He breeds Rottweiler dogs and sells their puppies. Both dogs have already bitten people in the area twice, locals said.\n\nThe child's relatives have accused the police of trying to save the owner of the dog.

The recent gruesome incident of two Rottweilers causing grievous injuries to a child in the city had sparked concerns among the residents and civic activists.\n\nSharing experiences of growing guard dog, Shankar (name changed), a Rottweiler pet parent, in Tiruvallur district said, \"The central government has not banned foreign breed dogs for lame reasons, but the dogs are ferocious, and it is not advisable to keep them in the city. Instead, the owners should maintain the dogs in the outskirts without causing harm to the public. The local veterinarians, who are aware of dogs' aggressive behaviour, should caution the owners on the same. Dogs like Pitbull, Rottweiler, and German Shepard are guarding breeds and they are ferocious. They should be trained and maintained properly\". He also mentioned that the behaviour of the dog can be controlled based on the training given by the owner.\n\nReferring to the recent episode of the dog attack, R Ramesh, a resident of Old Washermenpet said, \"It is not an accident because the dogs follow the one-man command. The owners might have failed to some issues earlier thus leading to violent episodes. Besides the pet animals, the local body fails to address the stray dog menace that often endangers the lives of school kids.\" The public opined that they witness first-time pet owners deciding to parent breeds such as Rottweilers, Pit Bulls, Great Danes, Huskies, etc. without prior experience. Do not go for the bigger breeds unless you have a large open area within the confines of your home. They added that the bigger space will ensure these pedigree dogs run and exercise to keep themselves healthy.\n\n\"Getting a Rottweiler and restricting his movements by tying him outside the house for the entire day in these extreme climatic conditions will make the animal ferocious. Eventually, they tend to discharge all the accumulated energy resulting in attacks. Even stray dogs tend to bite the residents during extreme weather conditions,\" commented activist C Raghukumar.\n\nThe 23 foreign-breed dogs that are ferocious should be banned in the country, the guideline issued by the Department of Animal Husbandry and Animal Welfare Board of India to prevent illegal breeding reads. Since there is an interim stay following the ban on foreign-breed dogs in the country, the local body is struggling to curb the sales and breeding of dogs in the capital city.\n\n\"Internationally, the 23 foreign breed dogs are identified as ferocious, so the dog owners should monitor these breeds regularly if they find any abnormal behavioural changes. The enforcement authority should create awareness of rearing breeds unsuitable for tropical weather conditions,\" said M Ravikumar, the former secretary of the Animal Welfare Board of India. He further mentioned the significance of vaccinating dogs regularly.\n\nMeanwhile, GCC commissioner J Radhakrishnan urged the pet owners to get a license from the local body and ensure regular vaccination. \"We appeal to the stakeholders especially pet owners and activists to ensure that the public is not harmed. Owners should take responsibility and vaccinate pets to reduce the incidence of zoonotic infections,\" he said. \"Understanding animal behaviour is crucial and animal lovers should take accountability.

Srinivas.\n\nHe says all dogs, irrespective of the breed, will have the intrinsic characteristic of having evolved from the wolves and that aggressive instinct may get manifested any moment. Therefore, it is expected of the owners to have the patience and eagerness to get well trained before beginning to rear dogs.\n\nIn so far as the corporation park incident is concerned, he says, no pet owner should be allowed to take a dog to a public place without a leash. Those who unleash their dogs in places such as parks, where children play and are susceptible to get scared by the sight of the animals, must be penalised heavily.\n\nMr. Srinivas points out dogs can be reared either with aggressive instinct, by keeping them aloof from outsiders, or made to be very friendly by letting them mingle with as many people as possible. They have highly pliable characteristics and therefore it is up to the owners to mould them accordingly.\n\n\"It is a crime to rear dogs without getting trained properly to do so. The very fact that a gentleman, residing near the park, was able to save the girl from the two Rottweilers is evidence enough to prove that the animals could have been controlled but the owners were miserably ill equipped to handle them,\" he adds.\n\nContending that a majority of the dog bites happen only because of stray dogs, he says, the strays lack human touch. When they cannot scavenge enough food, they return to their wolf instinct of hunting in packs with one of them serving as the ring leader and the others falling in line to create a chain of command.\n\n\"Pet dogs are different. They can be controlled and their characteristics can be changed completely but people should not rear dogs just because they have money and can spend it on the animals. They should also have the inclination to learn the techniques of controlling the animals,\" he advices.\n\nAnimal rights activist S. Muralidharan too contends that one cannot brand certain dog breeds to be \"ferocious\" solely because of their looks. He says, Rottweilers are basically guard dogs which induce fear in a person because of their sheer size, weight and looks but they can be friendly too.\n\n\"The look of the dog may terrorise you but moulding its characteristic completely depends upon the owner. There are owners who pet and sing songs for Rottweilers. They behave like a baby. They will never hurt you. The problem with the corporation park incident is improper rearing,\" he says.\n\nAnimals know to differentiate between kids and adults. Dogs or cats, that are taken care of properly by their owners, will even make sure that their nails do not hurt kids when they play with them. \"Those two Rottweilers who mauled the kid in the park must certainly be suffering from issues in rearing,\" he feels.\n\nStating a leash and a muzzle are a must when pet owners take their dogs to public places, he says, \"The owners of the two Rottweilers should have been booked under more stringent provisions of the Indian Penal Code so that it sends a strong signal to all other pet owners and avoid such incidents.\"\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_breed", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dog breed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rottweiler", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rottweiler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Chennai_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greater Chennai Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madras High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_breeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dog breeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nungambakkam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nungambakkam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nungambakkam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-ranging_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free-ranging dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molding_(process)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Molding (process)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scavenger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scavenger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leash", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guard dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Penal_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian Penal Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animal rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats_and_Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats and Dogs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal_Assisted_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal Assisted Therapy", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/news/national/dhwv3h/article68148989.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/Dogs_02.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542319", "eventUri": "eng-9542319", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 113, "textEnd": 118}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

The Committee has identified the following breeds of dogs as ferocious which are dangerous for human life,\" the letter states.\n\nThe committee also recommended that the dog breeds listed be banned from being imported, bred and sold.\n\nIt said the Department of Animal Husbandry shall not issue any licenses or permit for sale, breeding of the animals.\n\nIt also said local bodies could issue guidelines. The letter added that those having such breeds as pets must ensure they are sterilised.\n\nAnimal activists too support the recommendation.\n\nThe People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) too had filed a petition in the Delhi High Court in March urging that nearly two dozen dog breeds be banned.\n\n\"This order is key toward providing vital protection for both humans and dogs and sends a strong, clear message that pit bulls and other such breeds are bred to be used as weapons. Pit bulls and related breeds are the most commonly abandoned dogs in India, and this action can prevent a great deal of suffering for the dogs,\" the organisation wrote in its writ petition.\n\nIndia isn't alone in acting to ban or restrict certain breeds.\n\nA number of countries including Ecuador, Bermuda, France, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Spain, Qatar, Ukraine, Malaysia - as well as several US states - have banned Rottweilers.\n\nPitbulls, meanwhile, are outlawed in 30 countries including the UK, Denmark, Colombia, Norway, Germany, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Malta, Spain, France, Australia, Singapore, and New Zealand.\n\nUkraine, Australia, Denmark, Hong Kong, Israel, and New Zealand have all banned the Dogo Argentino.\n\nAustralia, Bermuda, Colombia, Denmark, Germany, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Puerto Rico, Qatar, Singapore, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates have outlawed or limited Terriers.\n\nBermuda, Malaysia, Qatar, and Singapore have prohibited or restricted keeping Mastiffs as pets.\n\nBut are certain dog breeds inherently dangerous?\n\nWhat do experts say?\n\nExperts say that even some good-natured dogs can go after humans if mistreated.\n\n\"Every dog, even a Retriever or a Labrador, which are known to be extremely human-friendly, can become aggressive if not exercised or kept in good living conditions,\" Delano Henriques, a Mumbai-based dog trainer and behaviourist, told Mint.\n\nThey recommend that people choose their dogs carefully, that choosing a dog is a huge decision and that dogs tend to behave like their parents.\n\nAs per The Conversation, some warning signs people can look for are:\n\n\"Every dog and breed is different and people should do their homework thoroughly before taking them home. They need to first figure out what they are looking for in a pet -- a companion, friend or a guard. Every dog has a different temperament and different ways of letting off steam,\" Manoj Poovanniyil of Rottweiler Chennai kennel told The Times of India.\n\n\"Rottweilers were originally used to pull carts to the market, herd animals and guard the home and farm. They were used as working dogs,\" animal activist Mini Vasudevan added. \"For many, their dark and sturdy features can come across as a bit terrifying. But I would say that Rottweilers are a breed that is gravely misunderstood. Rotts can be fiercely loyal to the family.\"\n\nA Soundararajan, who has 20 years of experience in the Coimbatore police's Dog Squad, sounded a word of caution.\n\n\"Rottweilers are ferocious breeds, especially the ones abroad, which is why they are banned in many countries. They are aggressive dogs with powerful jaws and they have the tendency to not release their victims from their hold. They need to be trained from a very young age to acclimate themselves to their surroundings.\"\n\nOthers argue that a blanket ban makes little sense.\n\nJiby, a Rottweiler breeder from Kochi pointed out to Mint that thousands of people across India work in the dog breeding industry employs thousands of people across India.\n\nSuch restrictions would put an end to several businesses and cost people their jobs.\n\n\"Instead of a blanket ban, regulating breeding would be a better idea,\" Jiby added.\n\nHenriques also pointed out that some people may simply abandon their pets as a result of the ban,\n\n\"There will be a whole new problem that we will have to deal with,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

It is important for the owners to vaccinate their pet dogs and get a licence from the corporation,\" stated the commissioner.\n\nMeanwhile, the GCC has planned to install green shelters giving shade for the public following the meteorological department predicted that the maximum temperature is likely to record around 40 degree Celsius in the city.\n\nDue to gusty winds the process to set up the shelter was delayed. Now, steps have been taken to provide strong shelter.\n\n\"The green shelters will be installed in 10 places including Rajamuthaiah Salai, EVR Periyar Road Junction, Valluvar kottam high road, New Avadi Road and Anna Nagar Roundtana with police approval in the next three days,\" added Radhakrishnan.", "source": {"uri": "dtnext.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "dtNext.in"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_Lights_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thousand Lights Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Chennai_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greater Chennai Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Cooperation_Council", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Cooperation Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennel_club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kennel club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immunization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animal welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birth control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiruvalluvar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thiruvalluvar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meteorology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Nagar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anna Nagar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anna Nagar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avadi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avadi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Avadi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Dogs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats_and_Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats and Dogs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal_Assisted_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal Assisted Therapy", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dtnext-prod.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/h-upload/2024/05/06/820910-gcccommisioner.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542319", "eventUri": "eng-9542319", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chennai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

The civic body, by itself, does not have the resources to take custody of dogs and maintain them, except at the Animal Birth Control facilities where dogs undergo surgeries and are then released back into the areas they come from.\n\n\"The family had taken due permission and they have also been asked to send us photographs of the dogs every day for the next 10 days to monitor any signs of rabies as per protocol,\" said a senior corporation official. The plan initially was for the corporation authorities to secure the dogs and take them to a sequestered spot for observation.\n\nWhile there is a call for stricter pet licensing implementation in the aftermath of the issue, the authorities said pet licenses only help the city corporation enumerate and keep track of the pets in the city and their vaccination records. \"While we are revisiting the stray dog population strategies, it is important to ensure responsible pet ownership.\n\nOwners should be mindful of the fears of the public and not take any risks as far as safety is concerned.

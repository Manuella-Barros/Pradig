It comes after a study by Loughborough University found that one in five players \u2013 both male and female \u2013 currently uses snus, nicotine pouches or both. Of the 628 male players surveyed, 18% from Premier League or EFL clubs and admitted using them, while it was 22% from the 51 Women\u2019s Super League players. The report, commissioned by the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association (PFA), states that the true figure is \u201clikely\u201d to be even higher due to players not wanting to disclose use. It found users often started using it in a bid to fit in with other, often more senior, team-mates \u2013 for male players, 56% gave this as a reason, rising to 73% among women. What is snus? Snus is a smokeless tobacco product and commonly comes in small pouches containing tobacco. They are not actually legally available to buy in the UK. More commonly used by footballers is tobacco-free nicotine pouches (although, confusingly, these are often commonly referred to as \u2018snus\u2019 too) which are legal to buy. \u201cNicotine pouches contain nicotine, water, sweeteners and flavourings. It is taken the same way as snus but the main difference between the two methods is that nicotine pouches do not contain tobacco leaf,\u201d explains Carolina Goncalves, superintendent pharmacist at Pharmica. In both products the nicotine is is absorbed into your bloodstream through the mucous membranes of your mouth, as the pouches are usually placed between the upper lip and the gums. How addictive is it? \u201cBoth snus and nicotine patches are substantially addictive due to their nicotine content,\u201d Goncalves says. They also contain \u201cnumerous other carcinogens that can increase the risk of cancers affecting the pancreas and mouth.\u201d These risks are empirically backed by studies published in prominent journals such as the International Journal of Cancer, she adds. \u201cSnus is thought to be potentially more addictive than nicotine patches [often used by smokers to quit cigarettes] because it administers nicotine more quickly to the user. \u201cPut simply, snus enables rapid absorption of nicotine into the bloodstream, which can increase the probability of addiction since it offers a quicker \u2018hit\u2019 than alternatives.\u201d What are the health risks? \u201cIt\u2019s often thought that using snus is safer than smoking, when in fact this is incorrect,\u201d says Goncalves. \u201cWhile it is true that snus does not harm the lungs as much as smoking, given that it is a smokeless product, it still poses health risks to the gums, mouth, and other organs. \u201cThe health implications of snus with tobacco differ from those of smoking cigarettes or vaping, given that it delivers nicotine to the bloodstream through the gums, as opposed to involving the inhalation of smoke or vapour. \u201cStudies have shown that snus which contains tobacco can increase the risk of pancreatic cancer due to the presence of tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) in the product. \u201cTSNAs have carcinogenic properties associated with the curing and fermentation of tobacco before it is placed inside snus pouches. Certain TSNAs are directly linked to the development of pancreatic cancer, according to current research,\u201d she says. What about oral health? Nyree Whitley, chief clinical officer at mydentist, said: \u201cWhile snus may initially seem like an alternative to smoking or vaping, it could, like other nicotine-based products, have detrimental effects on your oral health. \u201cBy holding the pouch against your gums for extended periods of time, the risk of developing gum disease and tooth loss is much higher than in those who don\u2019t use nicotine-based products, and it\u2019s a common misconception that smokeless forms of nicotine come with less risk. More common side effects of nicotine pouches may include gum irritation, receding gums, yellowed or stained teeth, and ulcers,\u201d she adds. \u201cIf gum disease has already become apparent as a result of nicotine pouches, it may be more difficult to reverse these side effects. \u201cTobacco in any form can lead to life-altering conditions such as mouth cancer.\u201d Can they be used to stop smoking? They are sometimes used as an alternative to cigarette smoking to help people quit by curbing cravings. \u201cThe release of nicotine from these products reduces the craving and withdrawal symptoms experienced by smokers trying to quit, allowing them to satisfy their nicotine needs without inhaling smoke,\u201d says Goncalves. However, nicotine patches may be a more effective choice for quitting, she says. \u201cNicotine patches are designed to provide a slow and steady dose of nicotine, with their primary purpose being to help reduce withdrawal symptoms in individuals who are trying to stop using nicotine, such as by quitting smoking.\u201d", "summary": "From your teeth to cancer risks, the pouches pose a danger to health.", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/premier-league-super-league-efl-loughborough-university-studies-b2553236.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/29/14/29132815-f0d92e4f-867d-4a20-9d07-166dd14c2497.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:24:08", "author": "Lauren Taylor", "authors": ["Lauren Taylor"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.187}

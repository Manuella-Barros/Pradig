The Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars 17-9. / Corey Perrine/Florida Times-Union / USA\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars made the biggest commitment to a player in franchise history last week, signing Trevor Lawrence to a top of the market deal that ties him to the team through 2030.\n\nBut with the Lawrence deal now official after over a year of speculation, what kind of impact could Lawrence's contract have on the rest of the market?\n\nThat question is as prevalent as ever today with other quarterbacks up for deals like Miami Dolphins' Tua Tagovailoa, Green Bay Packers' Jordan Love and Dallas Cowboys' Dak Prescott. And Sports Illustrated's Albert Breer has some insight on just what Lawrence's deal will look like for the next wave of quarterbacks.\n\n\"My first thought on the Trevor Lawrence deal: The contract has a really strong set of guarantees that shows commitment to the quarterback. The Jacksonville Jaguars have essentially locked in his first three years, which add up to $170 million. Most of his fourth year is fully guaranteed at signing, with the rest vesting a year early. All of his fifth year is guaranteed for injury now and will vest as fully guaranteed a year early. That's a big bet on a QB.\n\nMy second thought on the Lawrence deal: If the Miami Dolphins are worried at all about Tua Tagovailoa's health, or the Green Bay Packers are worried about Jordan Love's short track record, those guys wanting Lawrence's guarantee structure could be a pretty significant problem.\"\n\nThe Jaguars agreed to terms with the quarterback and former No. 1 pick on Thursday evening, agreeing to a five-year deal worth $275 million with $200 million in guarantees and $142 million fully guaranteed.\n\nLawrence's deal will pay him an average of $55 million a season, which ties him with Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow as the highest-paid player on an annual basis in the NFL.\n\nSince being drafted No. 1 in 2021, Lawrence has started 50 regular season games. Lawrence ranks fourth in franchise history in passing yards with 11,770 and is fourth in touchdown passes with 58.\n\nSince being drafted, Lawrence has been voted as a team captain by his teammates each year of his NFL career and was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2022 after recording 387 completions for 4,113 passing yards and 25 touchdowns with a passer rating of 95.2.\n\nDuring the 2023 season, he completed 370 passes becoming the only quarterback in franchise history to start his career with three seasons of at least 300 completions and the second quarterback in team history to record at least 300 completions in three consecutive seasons. He has been named AFC Offensive Player of the Week three times in his career, twice in 2022 (Week 3 and 12) and once in 2023 (Week 11).\n\nIn his career, Lawrence has also posted 205 rushing attempts for 964 yards and 11 touchdowns.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Lawrence_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Lawrence (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tua_Tagovailoa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tua Tagovailoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Florida_Times-Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Florida Times-Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passer rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Franchising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Franchising", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5990,h_3369,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/01j0kjmpp9q7t03tbyjx-354437f6c4c993be28d9bd5029d74872.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661492", "eventUri": "eng-9661492", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-09-", "textStart": 149, "textEnd": 157}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

Lawrence mentioned winning a championship three times on Thursday morning where he made his massive contract extension official.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nLawrence's deal, a five-year, $275 million deal that includes $142 million in guarantees, is the largest in franchise history by a sizable margin. His $55 million annual average is tied with Bengals star Joe Burrow's deal for the highest in NFL history.\n\n\"The team goes as you go and I know that and that's a big responsibility. So, I'm not going to add any pressure to myself, just based on getting this contract,\" Lawrence said. \"It doesn't really change what I expect of myself and what the team expects of me. Whether this got done or not, Mr. Khan (Shad Khan), Trent (General Manager Trent Baalke), Doug, (Head Coach Doug Pederson), everyone, all the coaches expect me to play well and to bring a championship here eventually.\n\n\"I know that's the end goal and that's what I'm here for. So, now that this is done, it doesn't really change that, but like I said, maybe from the outside it does, a little bit, but not for me.\"\n\nRELATED\n\nCommentary: Look at the context, not just the numbers\n\nCommentary: Was extension the right move for Jaguars?\n\nTrevor Lawrence agrees to massive contract extension\n\nResidents divided over Trevor Lawrence's new deal\n\nIs Trevor Lawrence worth $275 million?\n\nLawrence's life-changing deal ties him to Jacksonville through 2030. It's a five-year pact but it technically doesn't start until 2026. Lawrence is entering the fourth year of his rookie contract, and the team has already picked up his fifth-year option in 2025.\n\n\"To be able to say we're going to be here and have confidence and know that, that means a lot to us,\" Lawrence said. \"And we love it here, it's become home. Our families love it, families love visiting here. And we've really settled in. This is home for us.\"\n\nLawrence said that he and wife, Marissa, who accompanied him Thursday to the signing and press conference, have fallen in love with the city. Lawrence was the No. 1 overall pick in 2021 and said shortly after he was drafted that he and Marissa wanted to be in Jacksonville.\n\nNow, Lawrence has the financial security of a long-term deal and expectations of a Super Bowl in that span. The structure of his contract doesn't handcuff the Jaguars financially.\n\n\"I mean, it doesn't really change too much,\" he said. \"But it does feel good to have it done. That was a goal that the team and myself and my team wanted to get done is to have it ... finished by the time training camp came around, so we could just put everything towards this year and in getting ready to go bring a championship here.\"\n\nLawrence's contract is notable for several reasons.\n\nFirst, the size of the deal is a headline grabber. It is the largest contract handed out in franchise history, and by a wide margin. It eclipses previous No. 1 Josh Allen's five-year, $141.25 million deal ($88 million guaranteed). Allen's deal averages $28.25 million annually. Lawrence's comes in at $55 million annually. Quarterback Nick Foles, who signed a four-year, $88 million deal in 2019, held the previous record for a Jaguars quarterback.\n\nJacksonville wasn't silent in its desire to extend Lawrence at the first opportunity it had, and that came this year. Both Baalke and head coach Pederson endorsed Lawrence as the franchise quarterback, something Jacksonville hasn't had since Mark Brunell and later, David Garrard. Lawrence said that the big deal doesn't change anything in his mind, but knows that the big number could shift what others expect from him.\n\n\"Playing quarterback in this league is pressure anyways. So, I guess on the outside there's going to be a bigger expectation with the long-term deal and being the franchise quarterback, having the contract to say that it might change how other people look at it,\" he said. \"For me I think I've kind of carried that responsibility anyways, being a starting quarterback in this league is a big responsibility.\"\n\nThe Jaguars went 4-13 in Lawrence's rookie season, a disaster all around during the brief tenure of Urban Meyer. Under Pederson in 2022, Lawrence figured things out and was one of the best quarterbacks in the league in the second half of that year. That included a torrid finish to win the AFC South title and one of the biggest comebacks in playoff history in a 31-30 win over the Chargers.\n\nUnder major expectations, including some that pegged Jacksonville as a fringe Super Bowl contender, Lawrence and the Jaguars imploded. Jacksonville started 8-3 and was actually the No. 1 seed in the AFC. It collapsed in spectacular fashion, a 1-5 finish that resulted in missing the playoffs. Even during that 8-3 start, Lawrence never looked comfortable. He was sacked a career-high 35 times in 16 games and committed a league-high 21 turnovers last year. Lawrence struggled with ankle, knee, shoulder and concussion issues.", "source": {"uri": "news4jax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News 4 Jax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_barney@news4jax.com", "name": "Justin Barney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Lawrence_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Lawrence (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shahid Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Pederson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Doug Pederson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Allen_(quarterback)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Allen (quarterback)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Garrard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Garrard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_South", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC South"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Brunell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Brunell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Meyer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urban Meyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Foles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Foles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Franchising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Franchising", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/6BTR6JN6C5ETBDEXLSQICQH3QY.jpg?_a=ATAPphC0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661492", "eventUri": "eng-9661492", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

However, since then, Lawrence and the Jaguars have taken strides forward and he went to the 2022 Pro Bowl and the playoffs.\n\n\"Obviously, it's a place we love to live in and we know that because we've had some good and some bad times as far as football goes.

To get us through the offseason, we'll be taking a closer look at every team in the NFL, in order of projected 2024 win totals. Up next: the Jaguars.\n\nIt appeared Trevor Lawrence was well on his way to exceeding the lofty expectations that were placed on him as the obvious No. 1 pick in the 2021 NFL draft.\n\nLawrence had the Jaguars in first place in the AFC South with an 8-3 record, but then was helped off the field with an ankle injury, leading to a disastrous 1-5 finish to the 2023 season and missing the playoffs. Once again, the Jaguars had an up-and-down season with Lawrence. They did make the postseason in '22, but that was after the team brushed off a slow start and benefited from a weak division.\n\nAfter three seasons, the Jaguars could be wanting more from Lawrence on the field, but the flashes of greatness were enough for the team to hammer out a massive five-year contract extension reportedly worth $275 million to make Lawrence the highest-paid quarterback on a yearly average. Technically, he's tied with Joe Burrow at $55 million per year, but Burrow might get the tiebreaker based on his lone trip to the Super Bowl a few years back.\n\nLawrence and the Jaguars have had shortcomings the past three seasons, but they paid their star signal-caller because of his high potential and what could come in the next five years. For 2024, the organization is banking on a few bold decisions this offseason to possibly help Lawerence reach elite status.\n\nThe Jaguars let Calvin Ridley walk in free agency but signed Gabe Davis and drafted Brian Thomas Jr. The team also splurged for veteran defensive tackle Arik Armstead to improve a disappointing defense last season.\n\nMany are talking about the Houston Texans in the AFC South, but the Jaguars could quickly contend again if Lawrence delivers an MVP-worthy season.\n\nBiggest gamble this offseason: Letting Ridley walk in free agency\n\nThere are pros and cons to the Jaguars letting Ridley leave for the Tennessee Titans after he only played one season in Jacksonville. The team didn't overspend for a receiver who has had availability and consistency issues as he heads into his age-30 season. But Ridley played at a high level toward the end of the season when the Jaguars dealt with injuries amid their losing streak. Now Lawrence is left without a No. 1 wide receiver while Ridley could help improve an AFC South rival, and their promising second-year quarterback Will Levis.\n\nThe Jaguars adjusted by signing Davis, but they might have overspent for a player who has had consistency issues, similar to what they wanted to avoid with Ridley. But Davis's contract was $39 million over three years compared to Ridley's four-year, $92 million deal in Tennessee. Also, the Jaguars used a first-round pick on Thomas. Perhaps Jacksonville's new receiving corps will lead to better results, with Lawrence having two downfield threats (Christian Kirk, Thomas) and a physical wideout known for occasional clutch performances (Davis).\n\nToughest stretch of the season: Weeks 1 to 4\n\nJacksonville opens the season with four consecutive games against playoff teams from last season. The Jaguars start with a road matchup against the high-scoring Miami Dolphins before returning home to face the Cleveland Browns and their dominant defense. From there, Jacksonville has back-to-back road games vs. the Buffalo Bills and Texans-two teams considered to be Super Bowl contenders. The Jaguars' tough stretch could extend as far as Week 7 because they face the Indianapolis Colts at home before back-to-back games in London vs. the Chicago Bears and New England Patriots.\n\nBreakout player to watch: LB Devin Lloyd\n\nAfter a forgetful rookie season, Lloyd reminded the Jaguars last season why they drafted him No. 27 in the 2022 draft. The Utah product turned into an elite defender against the run, showed improvement in coverage and recorded 127 tackles. If Lloyd continues to ascend, the Jaguars could have one of the best inside linebacker tandems in the league with Foyesade Oluokun, the league leader in tackles the past two seasons.\n\nBest-case scenario: Lawrence earns his money, delivers MVP-worthy season\n\nThere's no question Lawrence has an elite skill set, but heading into his fourth season, the Jaguars are still waiting for their quarterback to develop into a yearly MVP candidate. The organization clearly believes Lawrence will eventually become an elite quarterback after handing him a contract extension with $200 million guaranteed. The team might have gained a small bargain by paying Lawrence before Jordan Love, Dak Prescott and Tua Tagovailoa agreed to new contract extensions with their respective teams. The new deal, however, could be worth every penny in a few months if Lawrence is the favorite to win the MVP and has the Jaguars in position to win the AFC South and clinch the No. 1 seed in the postseason. The title of highest paid often changes in the NFL, but not many can compete with Lawrence when it comes to highest potential. He could put it all together in 2024.\n\nWorst-case scenario: The Jaguars' offseason moves turn into a disaster\n\nThe Jaguars made a few questionable signings with the additions of Armstead (three years, $43.5 million), center Mitch Morse (two years, $10.5 million), Davis (three years, $39 million) and the re-signing of offensive guard Ezra Cleveland (three years, $24 million), whom the team acquired in an October trade with the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nArmstead was a standout enforcer in the middle of the San Francisco 49ers' defensive line, but his best days could be behind him as he heads to his age-31 season. The same can be said about Morse at age 32. Cleveland struggled during his three and a half seasons in Minnesota, and Davis was inconsistent during four seasons in Buffalo. The Jaguars need all of these players to step up in 2024 or they might regret all of these decisions during the season.\n\nThe pressure is on Pederson and Lawrence to make Jacksonville contenders. Lawrence needs to step up after amassing just 4,016 yards with 21 touchdowns against 14 interceptions in 2023. -Matt Verderame\n\nFantasy sleeper pick: Lawrence\n\nLawrence was expected to break out last season, but it didn't happen. He did finish a respectable 12th in fantasy points among quarterbacks, but Lawrence was also held under 16 points in nearly half of his games. He'll also have to gain a rapport with Thomas and Davis, so it wouldn't be a surprise if his numbers don't improve. -Michael Fabiano\n\nBest bet: Lawrence over 3,800.5 passing yards (+100) at FanDuel\n\nWhat am I missing here? Lawrence passed for 4,000-plus yards in both 2022 and '23. He didn't have Ridley in '22, and he had a bum ankle for the last six games of '23. A full season of Kirk and some shootouts with the Colts and Texans should help us grab this plus money. -Jennifer Piacenti\n\nGame odds refresh periodically and are subject to change.\n\nIf you or

The full terms of the agreement were not released, but it's reportedly a $275 million extension that includes $200 million guaranteed ($142 million at signing).\n\nAfter Lawrence's new deal was announced, the former Clemson star said in a statement that he's \"beyond grateful to be able to continue my career in Jacksonville.\"\n\n\"My family and I love this city - it has become home to us and this solidifies that even more. We can't thank Mr. (Shad) Khan, and everyone involved for their belief in me,\" Lawrence said, via Jaguars.com.\n\n\"I know that the best is yet to come and this is only the beginning. The drive to bring a championship to Duval is bigger than ever. Let's get it done.\"\n\nKhan, the Jaguars' owner, said in a statement he's \"delighted\" that Lawrence and the organization were able to reach a long-term deal.\n\n\"Trevor and Trent Baalke both deserve immense credit for their determination over the offseason to reach a deal that will provide long-term benefits to our football team, the Jacksonville community and our fans everywhere,\" Khan said. \"To get it done comfortably and amicably ahead of training camp, as with the long-term agreement we reached in April with Josh Allen, is a further statement that the Jacksonville Jaguars are committed to winning now and for many seasons to come.\"\n\nA 2022 Pro Bowler, Lawrence has completed 63.8 percent of his passes for 11,770 yards and 58 touchdowns with 39 interceptions in 50 career starts over the first three years of his NFL career.\n\nLast season, Lawrence battled through multiple injuries but only missed one game (the first missed game of his NFL career) in 2023, when he completed 65.6 percent of his passes for 4,016 yards and 21 touchdowns with 14 interceptions.\n\nLawrence, who will turn 25 in October, helped lead the Jaguars to the AFC South title and a wild-card victory in 2022. He is a three-time AFC Offensive Player of the Week and has been voted as a team captain by his teammates each year of his NFL career.\n\nJaguars general manager Trent Baalke also commented on the extension for the 2021 No. 1 overall draft pick.\n\n\"With this five-year extension, the vision we had when we selected Trevor first overall in 2021 has become a reality,\" Baalke said in a statement. \"Our objectives have always been aligned. As an organization, we have consistently messaged the importance of extending our core players and Trevor is a foundational talent that we will continue to build around in our quest for a championship.\n\n\"With his talent, work ethic, leadership, and competitive drive we are confident the best is yet to come and are thrilled that he and Marissa will continue to make Jacksonville their home.\"\n\nA limited number of signed footballs from Clemson's 2022 class are still available.

That's a big responsibility, so I'm not going to add any pressure to myself just based on getting this contract. It doesn't really change what I expect of myself and what the team expects of me.\"\n\nLawrence would have signed the deal last week, but it got done hours before a vacation with his wife and in-laws. He and his wife Marissa returned to the stadium Thursday to sign amid little fanfare; coach Doug Pederson and most of his teammates were out of town.\n\nNonetheless, Lawrence's deal is the latest move in what could provide long-term stability for the small-market franchise.\n\n[Read more: What Trevor Lawrence's extension means for Jaguars' contention in 2024 and beyond]\n\nPass rusher Josh Allen signed a five-year, $141 million deal in April that included a $32 million signing bonus, and the Jaguars and the city are on the verge of getting final approval on a $1.4 billion stadium renovation.\n\nThose are significant changes for a team that spent the past 15 years dealing with relocation rumors and had only re-signed two first-round picks -- quarterback Blake Bortles and defensive lineman Tyson Alualu -- drafted since 2007.\n\nThe two sides worked on contract details for months as the quarterback broke ground on a new house in the area.\n\n\"We love it here; it's become home,\" Lawrence said. \"Our families love it. Families love visiting here, and we've really settled in. ... The way the organization's going and the direction that we're heading on the football side, that makes it obviously a no-brainer for us.\n\n\"I want to be the quarterback here. I want to bring a championship to Jacksonville. That's my goal, and I really know that we can accomplish that.\"\n\nLawrence will get an average of $55 million annually over the life of the extension, tying him with Cincinnati's Joe Burrow for the most in NFL history. Lawrence is now the sixth QB making more than $50 million a year, and he's the youngest on the list.\n\nThe 24-year-old is 21-31 as a three-year starter, including 1-1 in the playoffs, and has a whopping 60 turnovers -- a number he needs to trim to become the player the Jags believe he can be.\n\nThe Jaguars point to a 19-game stretch spanning the 2022-23 season in which Lawrence was at his best. He threw for 4,713 yards, with 29 touchdowns and 11 interceptions, as Jacksonville went 14-5 during that span. General manager Trent Baalke and Pederson believe it's a glimpse of what Lawrence can do when healthy and humming.\n\n\"I'm excited for the future with Trevor,\" Pederson said. \"He's excited based on the conversations we've had since the season. I just know that our guy is the right guy. He's got the right demeanor. He's got the right leadership. It's our job as coaches now to make sure he takes that next step.\"\n\nLawrence is coming off an injury-filled season in which he missed the first game of his professional career because of a sprained throwing shoulder and significant practice time because of a sprained left knee, a sprained right ankle and a concussion.\n\nThe injury woes played a part in the worst late-season collapse in franchise history. The Jaguars (9-8) dropped five of their final six games and missed the postseason after spending three months atop the AFC South.\n\nBaalke responded by revamping Lawrence's offensive line and receiving group. He re-signed left guard Ezra Cleveland and added veteran center Mitch Morse in free agency and then drafted a potential future starter with fourth-round pick Javon Foster out of Missouri.\n\nBaalke also replaced receivers Calvin Ridley, Zay Jones and Jamal Agnew with first-round speedster Brian Thomas Jr., former Buffalo starter Gabe Davis and Devin Duvernay.\n\n\"I think this is definitely the best team that we've had here in my eyes just at this point in the year,\" Lawrence said. \"I feel very confident in that. ... We have good people here and that's important to having success.\"\n\nReporting by The Associated Press.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [],

Lawrence is signed for the next seven seasons through 2030. He was drafted by the team with the first-overall pick in 2021.\n\n\"It felt like we all won,\" Lawrence said shortly after signing the deal.\n\nDue to how the contract's cash flow will operate, Lawrence's deal will enable the team to continue investing in players either in-house or via outside free agency at least for a couple of more years.\n\n\"That was something that was important to me because it wasn't worth it to me to sacrifice being able to have a good team just so I can make some money,\" Lawrence later added.\n\nICYMI: Trevor Lawrence agrees to $275M contract extension with Jaguars, now NFL's highest-paid QB\n\nUltimately, though, Lawrence is happy to remain in Jacksonville, the place that took a chance on him in 2021.\n\n\"To be able to say that we're going to be here and have confidence and know that, that means a lot to us. We love it here, it's become home. Our families love it, families love visiting here and we've really settled in, this is home for us, so we wanted to be here long term,\" said Lawrence, referencing his wife Marrisa's family as well.\n\n'Best team that we've had': Trevor Lawrence 'excited' about direction Jaguars are headed\n\nAs Lawrence gets set to enter his fourth season with the Jaguars, he feels as though it's the best team they've had since he was drafted in 2021.\n\n\"I think this is definitely the best team that we've had here in my eyes just at this point in the year from what I've seen. I feel very confident in that,\" Lawrence said.\n\nThe Jaguars went out and signed a slew of free agents to supplement the talent on the team, including receiver Gabe Davis, defensive lineman Arik Armstead, center Mitch Morse and defensive back Darnell Savage, among others. The team also drafted receiver Brian Thomas Jr. in the first round to add to the firepower.\n\nBut, those additions aren't the only thing that gave Lawrence confidence and the desire to stay with the team long-term.\n\n\"I love our head coach. Coach [Doug] Pederson's done a great job, Press [Taylor], our offensive coordinator, the staff that we have had in place. I feel really confident in the system,\" Lawrence explained when asked what gave him the confidence to sign a deal now with the team. \"I feel like every year I've gotten better and better in the system, and I know this year is going to be a big year to keep improving, but I feel really confident in that.\"\n\nThough 50 regular-season games, Lawrence has completed 63.8% of his passes for 11,770 yards, 58 touchdowns and 39 interceptions. He's also added 21 total fumbles through that span.\n\nOver the last two years under Pederson, however, Lawrence completed 65.9% of his passes for 8,129 yards, 46 touchdowns and 22 interceptions. Lawrence has a lot of room to grow, but is headed in the right direction. He doesn't necessarily feel any added pressure after signing the deal.\n\n\"Being a starting quarterback in this league is a big responsibility and the team goes as you go and I know that's a big responsibility. So, I'm not going to add any pressure on myself just based on getting this contract. It doesn't really change what I expect of myself and what the team expects of me,\" said Lawrence.\n\nTo continue moving in the right direction, Lawrence will be getting together with a couple of guys in town to work out with. In years past, Lawrence has hosted several Jaguars receivers on extravagant trips. In 2022, he took receivers on a trip to the Bahamas, for example.\n\nThis year, Lawrence is set to compete in the American Century Championship golf tournament in Lake Tahoe from July 10-14. Pederson will also be in the field.\n\nMoving forward for Lawrence, he looks to continue earning the respect of his teammates by what he shows on the field, not necessarily just because of a new contract.\n\n\"You can respect people, but you're only going to listen to someone so much if they're not holding up their end of the deal on the field. So, I understand that those two things go hand in hand, is to earn respect and having the work ethic to back it up and then producing,\" Lawrence said.\n\n\"So those are the two things that I want to do more consistently, but I feel like I have done [that] and have proven myself to my teammates and proven the leader that I am, so I have a lot of confidence in that.\"\n\nTrevor Lawrence was anticipating a contract extension soon after mandatory minicamp\n\nWhile Lawrence was not at mandatory minicamp, part of the 30 veterans given an excused absence through the three-day affair, he was anticipating a contract agreement with the team imminently.\n\nHis agent, Jay Courie of MGC Sports, kept Lawrence appraised on the inner workings of the negotiations.\n\nWhile planning for a vacation with his wife's family, Lawrence said he received a call at home last Thursday that the contract was agreed to. He said he knew the two sides were getting close to hammering home a deal.\n\n\"I knew we were getting pretty close, so I felt confident that it would get done. Didn't exactly when, those things are kind of, it's weird, it's kind of like nothing, nothing, nothing and then ramps up last minute,\" Lawrence explained. \"But, I felt good that we were going to get that done. Not necessarily last week, but that week I knew that we were headed in the right direction.\"\n\nLawrence said that he and the team's goal was to have the deal done by training camp so he and the team could put everything toward this year and bringing a championship home to Jacksonville.\n\nAsked about the unique length of the goal, Lawrence joked that the deal was originally set to be for 15 years, but then explained that he and his agent were looking for a four to five-year deal.\n\n\"I knew we wanted to be here and then there's always a balancing act of however many years you do. Sometimes that can put the team in a better position, which is great,\" Lawrence said. \"That was our goal, which I'm glad I feel like we were able to accomplish,\" said Lawrence, later describing the deal as a balancing act.\n\n\"Obviously, there was a certain amount that, as a player, you want to make and you want to be in the market value, all those things, but you always want to keep the team in a good position to where we can pay other guys and have players around me and do all those things,\" he added.\n\nLawrence's cap hits remain relatively low until the 2027 season when it jumps to $35 million.\n\n\"I'm grateful that they see the value in me and I really feel confident in what we can accomplish here,\" said Lawrence.\n\n'A huge blessing': Trevor Lawrence says money won't change him\n\nThough Lawrence is set to make the most money he's ever made in his life, he says it won't change him. Lawrence added that he has a great support system and has been fortunate to already have acquired wealth through his time in the league, gaining an understanding of just how to manage it.\n\n\"I've always said it's a blessing and I don't want to sound insensitive because to people that maybe don't have the finances, it is a big deal and it means a lot and it gives you freedom. But, at the end of the day, it's just money,\" said Lawrence.\n\n\"You can buy stuff with it and you can help people, but it doesn't change who you are as a person ... at the end of the day, what are you going to do? You can buy more stuff with it, I'm grateful, though. I don't want to sound insensitive to people who might struggle and don't have the finances, but at the end of the day, I think that's a good perspective to have.\"\n\nThe money, Lawrence says, will set him and his family up for the future, the rest of their lives. But, it's the stability he was seeking to remain in Jacksonville for the long haul.\n\n\"I think even more than that is the stability of being here for the long term. However many years it ends up being, I guess it could be seven, could be however many it ends up being, that's a long time. To be able to say we're going to be here and have confidence, that means a lot to us,\" Lawrence said.\"\n\nThough money won't change him, it could evoke some funny moments during training camp for the young QB.\n\n\"They're going to kill me the first few days back for [training camp],\" Lawrence said with a laugh.\n\nDemetrius Harvey is the Jacksonville Jaguars reporter for the Florida Times-Union.

It ties him with the Cincinnati Bengals' Joe Burrow as the highest-paid player in league history in regard to average annual value ($55 million per year).\n\nThe deal also includes $200 million in total guarantees, the fourth-most in the NFL, and $142 million fully guaranteed, third-most.\n\n\"I am beyond grateful to be able to continue my career in Jacksonville,\" Lawrence said last week. \"I know that the best is yet to come and this is only the beginning. The drive to bring a championship to Duval is bigger than ever.\"\n\nDon't let the numbers on the surface fool you, though. When you actually drill down, this looks like a team-friendly, franchise quarterback contract.\n\nBy extending Lawrence now, with two years remaining on his rookie deal (2024 and 2025, his fifth-year option season), the Jaguars get the former No. 1 pick under contract for the next seven seasons. He was due $45.158 million combined in 2024-25 before the extension. So across the next seven years, his true average annual value is just over $45.7 million, which is more palpable for his r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nAnd if Lawrence plays as Jacksonville hopes in 2024 (and beyond) with a revamped supporting cast, the contract could look like a bargain in the long term.\n\nQuarterback contracts are ballooning -- the first $60 million-per-year player may come this offseason -- and it would've cost the Jaguars significantly more if they had waited to pay Lawrence.\n\n\"With this five-year extension, the vision we had when we selected Trevor first overall in 2021 has become a reality,\" general manager Trent Baalke said in a statement. \"Our objectives have always been aligned. As an organization, we have consistently messaged the importance of extending our core players, and Trevor is a foundational talent that we will continue to build around in our quest for a championship. With his talent, work ethic, leadership and competitive drive, we are confident the best is yet to come.\"\n\nLawrence's cap hit for 2024 will be $15.029 million, which accounts for less than 6% of the Jaguars' salary cap. His cap number is reasonable the following three seasons as well -- at $17 million, $24 million and $35 million, respectively. That preserves Jacksonville's window of contention with the roster as currently constructed. Key contributors with large cap numbers like wide receiver Christian Kirk, tight end Evan Engram, linebacker Foye Oluokun and defensive lineman Arik Armstead are under contract through 2027.\n\nIf Lawrence progresses as expected, the Jaguars can rework his deal or give him another extension before his cap hit grows astronomical (it jumps to $47 million in 2028, then to $78.5 million). But drafting and developing is still paramount for Jacksonville over the next couple of seasons, so it can adequately replace aging veterans in the long term and contend with Lawrence approaching his 30s.\n\nDuring the offseason program, the Jags mixed young backups with starters during team drills, according to local media.\n\n\"Coach and I have talked a lot about this year's class in particular,\" Baalke said in January, referring to Doug Pederson. \"The onboarding process of them, getting them up to speed, trusting them. You're in a developmental league now. You don't have time to say that we can shelf them for a year or shelf them for two years. You have to get them up to speed quickly.\"\n\nLawrence's extension is as much about optics as it is about money.\n\nHistorically, the Jaguars have had a losing franchise. Their best-ever quarterback before Lawrence was Mark Brunnell, a fifth-round pick in the 1990s who became a three-time Pro Bowler. The Jaguars and the city of Jacksonville also have a proposed $1.4 billion deal to renovate EverBank Stadium, raising the pressure to sell tickets. Lawrence, who grew up in Georgia, represents a massive draw.\n\nSure, he hasn't fully lived up to expectations. But he has flashed greatness and led Jacksonville to back-to-back winning seasons and a playoff victory. From the franchise's point of view, there's enough there to justify the long-term investment.\n\nThe Jaguars had to pay him.\n\n\"To get it done comfortably and amicably ahead of training camp, as with the long-term agreement we reached in April with Josh Allen, is a further statement that the Jacksonville Jaguars are committed to winning now and for many seasons to come,\" owner Shad Khan said.\n\nNow, the challenge for Lawrence and the Jaguars is consistent contention for the playoffs and beyond.\n\nBen Arthur is the AFC South reporter for FOX Sports.

It might change how other people look at it. But for me, I think I've kind of carried that responsibility anyways.\"\n\nBeing a starting quarterback in this league is a big responsibility and the team goes as you go, and I know that. So, I'm not going to add any pressure to myself just based on getting this contract. It doesn't really change what I expect of myself and what the team expects of me.\"\n\nIt sure does change the bank account, though. Lawrence's five-year extension, which starts in 2026 and includes a $37.5 million signing bonus, will pay him $55 million annually and ties Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow for the largest average annual salary in NFL history. It includes $142 million fully guaranteed, which is behind only Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson ($230 million) and Burrow ($146.5 million).\n\nLawrence's 2024 salary will be $1.055 million and he'll earn $25.67 million in 2025 while playing on the fifth-year option before the extension begins. The two sides had been negotiating for months and Lawrence had hoped for a deal before training camp begins on July 24, and they finally reached an agreement on June 13.\n\n\"It does feel good to have it done,\" Lawrence said. \"That was a goal that [the Jaguars] and myself and my team wanted to get done is to have it finished by the time training camp came around so we could just put everything towards this year and getting ready to go bring championship here.\"\n\nLawrence also said he likes the direction the franchise is headed. The Jaguars drafted receiver Brian Thomas Jr. in the first round (23rd overall) and signed receiver Gabe Davis and center Mitch Morse in free agency to add to an offense that includes receiver Christian Kirk, running back Travis Etienne Jr., and tight end Evan Engram. The Jaguars also signed defensive lineman Arik Armstead, cornerback Ronald Darby and safety Darnell Savage Jr. to add to a defense that already included pass-rushers Josh Allen and Travon Walker and linebacker Foye Oluokun.\n\nLawrence led the Jaguars to the AFC South title in 2022 and rallied the team from a 27-0 deficit to a 31-30 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers in a wild-card playoff game before losing to the Kansas City Chiefs in a divisional playoff.\n\nLawrence led the Jaguars to an 8-3 start in 2023 but he battled a concussion and ankle and shoulder injuries over the final six weeks of the season and the team went 1-5 down the stretch and missed the playoffs.\n\nHowever, Lawrence also has 60 turnovers in his first three seasons, which includes an NFL-high 21 in 2023 (14 interceptions, seven lost fumbles). There are only 11 quarterbacks who have made their debut since 1978 that have turned the ball over more in their first three seasons, per the Elias Sports Bureau. That list includes three Hall of Famers -- Warren Moon (73, tied with Steve DeBerg for the most), Peyton Manning (64) and John Elway (61). It also includes Mark Sanchez and former Jaguar Blake Bortles (63 each).\n\nLawrence has 8,129 yards passing and 55 combined passing and rushing touchdowns. Only three other quarterbacks in that span have thrown for more than 8,000 yards and have 55 combined passing and rushing touchdowns, per ESPN Stats & Information research: the Kansas City Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes (9,433 yards and 72 TDs), Detroit Lions' Jared Goff (9,013 and 72) and Buffalo Bills' Josh Allen (8,589 and 86).\n\nLawrence is already fourth all-time in Jaguars history in passing yards (11,770) and passing touchdowns (58) and is 21-31 as a starter (including playoffs). He also is just the fourth of the Jaguars' 17 first-round draft pick from 2007 to 2021 to sign an extension with the team, joining defensive tackle Tyson Alualu (2010), Bortles (2014), and Allen (2019), who in April signed what at the time was the richest contract in franchise history ($141.25 million over five years with $88 million guaranteed).", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType":

The contract number doesn't mean much in the grand scheme of things, only being justified one way.\n\nNot only did Lawrence want to be in Jacksonville, he wants to bring the franchise its first Super Bowl.\n\n\"I want to be the quarterback here. I want to bring a championship to Jacksonville, that's my goal and I really know we can accomplish that,\" Lawrence said at his press conference announcing his extension on Thursday. \"I'm excited for that and it just pairs up to we happen to love living here too.\"\n\nLawrence has been maligned for his performance by pundits, but he's become one of the best quarterbacks in the Jaguars' 30-year history. He is fifth in quarterback victories in Jaguars history (20), fourth in franchise history in passing yards (11,770) and passing touchdowns (58). Lawrence's 11,770 yards passing are the fifth-most in NFL history by a player after three seasons.\n\nLawrence is coming off a season during which he led the NFL with 21 giveaways and went 0-5 in his last five starts to miss the playoffs. Lawrence has finished with 20-plus giveaways in two of his three seasons, and his 21 fumbles lost are tied with Tony Banks for the most by a player in his first three seasons (stat first tracked in 1991). Lawrence has more fumbles lost than any other player in the past three seasons.\n\nDespite the fumbles, Jacksonville decided to pay Lawrence who became the fourth quarterback to make $200 million fully guaranteed in a contract, joining Deshaun Watson (who received $230 million guaranteed in his 2022 deal), Burrow ($219.01 million guaranteed) and Justin Herbert ($218.7 million guaranteed).\n\nThe money wasn't the deciding factor for Lawrence to remain in Jacksonville. He wanted to remain with the franchise that selected him No. 1 overall four years ago.\n\n\"We wanted to be here long term, obviously,\" Lawrence said. \"It's a place we love to live in and we know that because we've had some good and some bad times -- as far as football goes. So, we kind of experienced both and we love being here.\n\n\"The way the organization's going and the direction that we're heading, on the football side, that makes it a no-brainer for us.

He proved to many -- me included -- that he can be a game-wrecker.\"\n\nBefore Trevor Lawrence's new deal last week, Allen had signed the biggest contract in franchise history this offseason, earning a five-year extension worth $141.25 million and $76.5 million in guarantees.\n\nAllen, the No. 7 pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, is the first Jaguars' first-round pick to sign an extension with the team since Blake Bortles.\n\nAllen broke the Jaguars' rookie sack record in 2019 with 10.5 sacks before breaking the single-season sack record with 17.5 sacks in 2023. Allen was one of the NFL's most productive pass-rushers in 2023, combining with Travon Walker for 27.5 sacks to lead all pass-rusher duos.\n\nIn five years with the Jaguars, Allen has recorded 45 sacks, 53 tackles for loss, nine forced fumbles, and two interceptions.\n\nAs for Lawrence, the Jaguars' franchise passer ended up ranked as the No. 10 quarterback at No, 62. Lawrence did have a steep fall from last year's list though, going from No. 23 last year to No. 62 now.\n\n\"His 2023 season was a disappointment for a lot of reasons, including injury. He threw 21 touchdown passes and 14 picks as he pressed at times. I think he bounces back -- with a hefty new contract -- and has an MVP-type of season that will vault him up this list.\"\n\nThe Jaguars agreed to terms with the quarterback and former No. 1 pick last week, agreeing to a five-year deal worth $275 million with $200 million in guarantees and $142 million fully guaranteed.\n\nLawrence's deal will pay him an average of $55 million a season, which ties him with Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow as the highest-paid player on an annual basis in the NFL.\n\nSince being drafted No. 1 in 2021, Lawrence has started 50 regular season games. Lawrence ranks fourth in franchise history in passing yards with 11,770 and is fourth in touchdown passes with 58.\n\nSince being drafted, Lawrence has been voted as a team captain by his teammates each year of his NFL career and was selected to the Pro Bowl in 2022 after recording 387 completions for 4,113 passing yards and 25 touchdowns with a passer rating of 95.2.\n\nDuring the 2023 season, he completed 370 passes becoming the only quarterback in franchise history to start his career with three seasons of at least 300 completions and the second quarterback in team history to record at least 300 completions in three consecutive seasons. He has been named AFC Offensive Player of the Week three times in his career, twice in 2022 (Week 3 and 12) and once in 2023 (Week 11).\n\nIn his career, Lawrence has also posted 205 rushing attempts for 964 yards and 11 touchdowns.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Lawrence_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Lawrence (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Allen_(quarterback)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Allen (quarterback)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travon_Walker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travon Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Bortles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blake Bortles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passer rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Franchising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Franchising", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2995,h_1684,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/01j0rehddxvsbcz8fm5a-ef00052b8e55ae87f89653f0796811d7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661492", "eventUri": "eng-9661492", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

[affiliatewidget_smgtolocal]\n\n\"I think Trevor's tremendous and just an absolute pleasure to work with, day in and day out. Everybody really respects him. He's a great leader, he's a great person, a great leader on and off the field. We're very blessed to have Trevor in Jacksonville now [and] for a long time to come, too.\"\n\nJacksonville made Lawrence the highest-paid quarterback in NFL history, alongside Cincinnati's Joe Burrow, after he led the Jaguars in 2022-23 to their first set of consecutive winning seasons since 2004-05. They went 9-8 each year and unlocked an AFC Divisional round appearance in the playoffs during the 2022 season, but missed out on postseason action in 2023.\n\nIn that stretch, Lawrence completed 65.9% of his passes for 8,129 yards with 46 touchdowns and 22 interceptions, adding nine rushing touchdowns.\n\nKhan commended Jaguars general manager Trent Baalke for his approach to building Jacksonville's roster around Lawrence in recent offseasons.\n\nSpecifically noting Baalke's three first-round trade-downs in the last two NFL drafts, Khan stated the Jaguars landed the players they wanted in offensive tackle Anton Harrison in 2023 and wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr. in 2024, all while \"stacking\" additional picks to improve the roster's depth.\n\nWith the selections netted in trading down for Harrison and Thomas, the Jaguars took defensive end Tyler Lacy, safety Antonio Johnson and defensive tackle Raymond Vohasek in 2023, and running back Keilan Robinson in 2024.\n\nJacksonville holds 2025 third and fourth-round selections from Minnesota as part of its 2024 trade-down.\n\n\"It's been a really effective strategy I think for Trent and the Jags to keep stacking up picks, bringing in young talent to build around -- we have a franchise quarterback and we have a great coach in Doug Pederson, a Super Bowl-winning head coach,\" said Khan, referencing Pederson's 2017-18 championship run with Philadelphia.\n\n\"Those are the hardest things to get in football, in my opinion, are a franchise quarterback and one of the top coaches in the sport. We have those things in Jacksonville.\"\n\nTo pair, the Jaguars signed eight free agents and extended star edge rusher Josh Allen for a combined $188 million in guaranteed money this offseason, before reaching an agreement with Lawrence.", "source": {"uri": "jaguarswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jaguars Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zach_goodall@jaguarswire.usatoday.com", "name":

To get us through the offseason, we'll be taking a closer look at every team in the NFL, in order of projected 2024 win totals. Up next: the Jaguars.\n\nIt appeared Trevor Lawrence was well on his way to exceeding the lofty expectations that were placed on him as the obvious No. 1 pick in the 2021 NFL draft.\n\nLawrence had the Jaguars in first place in the AFC South with an 8-3 record, but then was helped off the field with an ankle injury, leading to a disastrous 1-5 finish to the 2023 season and missing the playoffs. Once again, the Jaguars had an up-and-down season with Lawrence. They did make the postseason in '22, but that was after the team brushed off a slow start and benefited from a weak division.\n\nAfter three seasons, the Jaguars could be wanting more from Lawrence on the field, but the flashes of greatness were enough for the team to hammer out a massive five-year contract extension reportedly worth $275 million to make Lawrence the highest-paid quarterback on a yearly average. Technically, he's tied with Joe Burrow at $55 million per year, but Burrow might get the tiebreaker based on his lone trip to the Super Bowl a few years back.\n\nLawrence and the Jaguars have had shortcomings the past three seasons, but they paid their star signal-caller because of his high potential and what could come in the next five years. For 2024, the organization is banking on a few bold decisions this offseason to possibly help Lawerence reach elite status.\n\nThe Jaguars let Calvin Ridley walk in free agency but signed Gabe Davis and drafted Brian Thomas Jr. The team also splurged for veteran defensive tackle Arik Armstead to improve a disappointing defense last season.\n\nMany are talking about the Houston Texans in the AFC South, but the Jaguars could quickly contend again if Lawrence delivers an MVP-worthy season.\n\nThere are pros and cons to the Jaguars letting Ridley leave for the Tennessee Titans after he only played one season in Jacksonville. The team didn't overspend for a receiver who has had availability and consistency issues as he heads into his age-30 season. But Ridley played at a high level toward the end of the season when the Jaguars dealt with injuries amid their losing streak. Now Lawrence is left without a No. 1 wide receiver while Ridley could help improve an AFC South rival, and their promising second-year quarterback Will Levis.\n\nThe Jaguars adjusted by signing Davis, but they might have overspent for a player who has had consistency issues, similar to what they wanted to avoid with Ridley. But Davis's contract was $39 million over three years compared to Ridley's four-year, $92 million deal in Tennessee. Also, the Jaguars used a first-round pick on Thomas. Perhaps Jacksonville's new receiving corps will lead to better results, with Lawrence having two downfield threats (Christian Kirk, Thomas) and a physical wideout known for occasional clutch performances (Davis).\n\nJacksonville opens the season with four consecutive games against playoff teams from last season. The Jaguars start with a road matchup against the high-scoring Miami Dolphins before returning home to face the Cleveland Browns and their dominant defense. From there, Jacksonville has back-to-back road games vs. the Buffalo Bills and Texans -- two teams considered to be Super Bowl contenders. The Jaguars' tough stretch could extend as far as Week 7 because they face the Indianapolis Colts at home before back-to-back games in London vs. the Chicago Bears and New England Patriots.\n\nAfter a forgetful rookie season, Lloyd reminded the Jaguars last season why they drafted him No. 27 in the 2022 draft. The Utah product turned into an elite defender against the run, showed improvement in coverage and recorded 127 tackles. If Lloyd continues to ascend, the Jaguars could have one of the best inside linebacker tandems in the league with Foyesade Oluokun, the league leader in tackles the past two seasons.\n\nThere's no question Lawrence has an elite skill set, but heading into his fourth season, the Jaguars are still waiting for their quarterback to develop into a yearly MVP candidate. The organization clearly believes Lawrence will eventually become an elite quarterback after handing him a contract extension with $200 million guaranteed. The team might have gained a small bargain by paying Lawrence before Jordan Love, Dak Prescott and Tua Tagovailoa agreed to new contract extensions with their respective teams. The new deal, however, could be worth every penny in a few months if Lawrence is the favorite to win the MVP and has the Jaguars in position to win the AFC South and clinch the No. 1 seed in the postseason. The title of highest paid often changes in the NFL, but not many can compete with Lawrence when it comes to highest potential. He could put it all together in 2024.\n\nThe Jaguars made a few questionable signings with the additions of Armstead (three years, $43.5 million), center Mitch Morse (two years, $10.5 million), Davis (three years, $39 million) and the re-signing of offensive guard Ezra Cleveland (three years, $24 million), whom the team acquired in an October trade with the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nArmstead was a standout enforcer in the middle of the San Francisco 49ers' defensive line, but his best days could be behind him as he heads to his age-31 season. The same can be said about Morse at age 32. Cleveland struggled during his three and a half seasons in Minnesota, and Davis was inconsistent during four seasons in Buffalo. The Jaguars need all of these players to step up in 2024 or they might regret all of these decisions during the season.\n\nNo. 12: Doug Pederson (14) and Lawrence (10)\n\nThe pressure is on Pederson and Lawrence to make Jacksonville contenders. Lawrence needs to step up after amassing just 4,016 yards with 21 touchdowns against 14 interceptions in 2023. -- Matt Verderame\n\nLawrence was expected to break out last season, but it didn't happen. He did finish a respectable 12th in fantasy points among quarterbacks, but Lawrence was also held under 16 points in nearly half of his games. He'll also have to gain a rapport with Thomas and Davis, so it wouldn't be a surprise if his numbers don't improve. -- Michael Fabiano\n\nWhat am I missing here? Lawrence passed for 4,000-plus yards in both 2022 and '23. He didn't have Ridley in '22, and he had a bum ankle for the last six games of '23. A full season of Kirk and some shootouts with the Colts and Texans should help us grab this plus money. -- Jennifer Piacenti\n\nGame odds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source":

It includes $142 million fully guaranteed and a $37.5 million signing bonus.\n\n\"Being a starting quarterback in this league is a big responsibility,\" Lawrence said. \"The team goes as you go, and I know that. That's a big responsibility, so I'm not going to add any pressure to myself just based on getting this contract. It doesn't really change what I expect of myself and what the team expects of me.\"\n\nLawrence would have signed the deal last week, but it got done hours before a vacation with his wife and in-laws. He and his wife Marissa returned to the stadium Thursday to sign amid little fanfare; coach Doug Pederson and most of his teammates were out of town.\n\nNonetheless, Lawrence's deal is the latest move in what could provide long-term stability for the small-market franchise.\n\nPass rusher Josh Allen signed a five-year, $141 million deal in April that included a $32 million signing bonus, and the Jaguars and the city are on the verge of getting final approval on a $1.4 billion stadium renovation.\n\nThose are significant changes for a team that spent the past 15 years dealing with relocation rumors and had only re-signed two first-round picks -- quarterback Blake Bortles and defensive lineman Tyson Alualu -- drafted since 2007.\n\nThe two sides worked on contract details for months as the quarterback broke ground on a new house in the area.\n\n\"We love it here; it's become home,\" Lawrence said. \"Our families love it.

Lawrence is signed for the next seven seasons through 2030. He was drafted by the team with the first-overall pick in 2021.\n\n\"It felt like we all won,\" Lawrence said shortly after signing the deal.\n\nDue to how the contract's cash flow will operate, Lawrence's deal will enable the team to continue investing in players either in-house or via outside free agency at least for a couple of more years.\n\n\"That was something that was important to me because it wasn't worth it to me to sacrifice being able to have a good team just so I can make some money,\" Lawrence later added.\n\nUltimately, though, Lawrence is happy to remain in Jacksonville, the place that took a chance on him in 2021.\n\n\"To be able to say that we're going to be here and have confidence and know that, that means a lot to us. We love it here, it's become home. Our families love it, families love visiting here and we've really settled in, this is home for us, so we wanted to be here long term,\" said Lawrence, referencing his wife Marrisa's family as well.\n\n'Best team that we've had': Trevor Lawrence 'excited' about direction Jaguars are headed\n\nAs Lawrence gets set to enter his fourth season with the Jaguars, he feels as though it's the best team they've had since he was drafted in 2021.\n\n\"I think this is definitely the best team that we've had here in my eyes just at this point in the year from what I've seen. I feel very confident in that,\" Lawrence said.\n\nThe Jaguars went out and signed a slew of free agents to supplement the talent on the team, including receiver Gabe Davis, defensive lineman Arik Armstead, center Mitch Morse and defensive back Darnell Savage, among others. The team also drafted receiver Brian Thomas Jr. in the first round to add to the firepower.\n\nBut, those additions aren't the only thing that gave Lawrence confidence and the desire to stay with the team long-term.\n\n\"I love our head coach. Coach [Doug] Pederson's done a great job, Press [Taylor], our offensive coordinator, the staff that we have had in place. I feel really confident in the system,\" Lawrence explained when asked what gave him the confidence to sign a deal now with the team. \"I feel like every year I've gotten better and better in the system, and I know this year is going to be a big year to keep improving, but I feel really confident in that.\"\n\nThough 50 regular-season games, Lawrence has completed 63.8% of his passes for 11,770 yards, 58 touchdowns and 39 interceptions. He's also added 21 total fumbles through that span.\n\nOver the last two years under Pederson, however, Lawrence completed 65.9% of his passes for 8,129 yards, 46 touchdowns and 22 interceptions. Lawrence has a lot of room to grow, but is headed in the right direction. He doesn't necessarily feel any added pressure after signing the deal.\n\n\"Being a starting quarterback in this league is a big responsibility and the team goes as you go and I know that's a big responsibility. So, I'm not going to add any pressure on myself just based on getting this contract. It doesn't really change what I expect of myself and what the team expects of me,\" said Lawrence.\n\nTo continue moving in the right direction, Lawrence will be getting together with a couple of guys in town to work out with. In years past, Lawrence has hosted several Jaguars receivers on extravagant trips. In 2022, he took receivers on a trip to the Bahamas, for example.\n\nThis year, Lawrence is set to compete in the American Century Championship golf tournament in Lake Tahoe from July 10-14. Pederson will also be in the field.\n\nMoving forward for Lawrence, he looks to continue earning the respect of his teammates by what he shows on the field, not necessarily just because of a new contract.\n\n\"You can respect people, but you're only going to listen to someone so much if they're not holding up their end of the deal on the field. So, I understand that those two things go hand in hand, is to earn respect and having the work ethic to back it up and then producing,\" Lawrence said.\n\n\"So those are the two things that I want to do more consistently, but I feel like I have done [that] and have proven myself to my teammates and proven the leader that I am, so I have a lot of confidence in that.\"\n\nTrevor Lawrence was anticipating a contract extension soon after mandatory minicamp\n\nWhile Lawrence was not at mandatory minicamp, part of the 30 veterans given an excused absence through the three-day affair, he was anticipating a contract agreement with the team imminently.\n\nHis agent, Jay Courie of MGC Sports, kept Lawrence appraised on the inner workings of the negotiations.\n\nWhile planning for a vacation with his wife's family, Lawrence said he received a call at home last Thursday that the contract was agreed to. He said he knew the two sides were getting close to hammering home a deal.\n\n\"I knew we were getting pretty close, so I felt confident that it would get done. Didn't exactly when, those things are kind of, it's weird, it's kind of like nothing, nothing, nothing and then ramps up last minute,\" Lawrence explained. \"But, I felt good that we were going to get that done. Not necessarily last week, but that week I knew that we were headed in the right direction.\"\n\nLawrence said that he and the team's goal was to have the deal done by training camp so he and the team could put everything toward this year and bringing a championship home to Jacksonville.\n\nAsked about the unique length of the goal, Lawrence joked that the deal was originally set to be for 15 years, but then explained that he and his agent were looking for a four to five-year deal.\n\n\"I knew we wanted to be here and then there's always a balancing act of however many years you do. Sometimes that can put the team in a better position, which is great,\" Lawrence said. \"That was our goal, which I'm glad I feel like we were able to accomplish,\" said Lawrence, later describing the deal as a balancing act.\n\n\"Obviously, there was a certain amount that, as a player, you want to make and you want to be in the market value, all those things, but you always want to keep the team in a good position to where we can pay other guys and have players around me and do all those things,\" he added.\n\nLawrence's cap hits remain relatively low until the 2027 season when it jumps to $35 million.\n\n\"I'm grateful that they see the value in me and I really feel confident in what we can accomplish here,\" said Lawrence.\n\n'A huge blessing': Trevor Lawrence says money won't change him\n\nThough Lawrence is set to make the most money he's ever made in his life, he says it won't change him. Lawrence added that he has a great support system and has been fortunate to already have acquired wealth through his time in the league, gaining an understanding of just how to manage it.\n\n\"I've always said it's a blessing and I don't want to sound insensitive because to people that maybe don't have the finances, it is a big deal and it means a lot and it gives you freedom. But, at the end of the day, it's just money,\" said Lawrence.\n\n\"You can buy stuff with it and you can help people, but it doesn't change who you are as a person ... at the end of the day, what are you going to do? You can buy more stuff with it, I'm grateful, though. I don't want to sound insensitive to people who might struggle and don't have the finances, but at the end of the day, I think that's a good perspective to have.\"\n\nThe money, Lawrence says, will set him and his family up for the future, the rest of their lives. But, it's the stability he was seeking to remain in Jacksonville for the long haul.\n\n\"I think even more than that is the stability of being here for the long term. However many years it ends up being, I guess it could be seven, could be however many it ends up being, that's a long time. To be able to say we're going to be here and have confidence, that means a lot to us,\" Lawrence said.\"\n\nThough money won't change him, it could evoke some funny moments during training camp for the young QB.\n\n\"They're going to kill me the first few days back for [training camp],\" Lawrence said with a laugh.\n\nDemetrius Harvey is the Jacksonville Jaguars reporter for the Florida Times-Union.

(AP) - Trevor Lawrence insists his new contract, which makes him one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in NFL history, won\u00b4t create any added pressure.\n\nLawrence signed the five-year, $275 million contract extension Thursday, a week after agreeing to the deal. It includes $142 million fully guaranteed and a $37.5 million signing bonus.\n\n\"Being a starting quarterback in this league is a big responsibility,\" Lawrence said. \"The team goes as you go, and I know that. That\u00b4s a big responsibility, so I\u00b4m not going to add any pressure to myself just based on getting this contract. It doesn\u00b4t really change what I expect of myself and what the team expects of me.\"\n\nLawrence would have signed the deal last week, but it got done hours before a vacation with his wife and in-laws. He and his wife Marissa returned to the stadium Thursday to sign amid little fanfare; coach Doug Pederson and most of his teammates were out of town.\n\nNonetheless, Lawrence\u00b4s deal is the latest move in what could provide long-term stability for the small-market franchise.\n\nPass rusher Josh Allen signed a five-year, $141 million deal in April that included a $32 million signing bonus, and the Jaguars and the city are on the verge of getting final approval on a $1.4 billion stadium renovation.\n\nThose are significant changes for a team that spent the past 15 years dealing with relocation rumors and had only re-signed two first-round picks - quarterback Blake Bortles and defensive lineman Tyson Alualu - drafted since 2007.\n\nThe two sides worked on contract details for months as the quarterback broke ground on a new house in the area.\n\n\"We love it here; it's become home,\" Lawrence said. \"Our families love it. Families love visiting here, and we\u00b4ve really settled in. ... The way the organization\u00b4s going and the direction that we\u00b4re heading on the football side, that makes it obviously a no-brainer for us.\n\n\"I want to be the quarterback here. I want to bring a championship to Jacksonville. That\u00b4s my goal, and I really know that we can accomplish that.\"\n\nLawrence will get an average of $55 million annually over the life of the extension, tying him with Cincinnati\u00b4s Joe Burrow for the most in NFL history. Lawrence is now the sixth QB making more than $50 million a year, and he\u00b4s the youngest on the list.\n\nThe 24-year-old is 21-31 as a three-year starter, including 1-1 in the playoffs, and has a whopping 60 turnovers - a number he needs to trim to become the player the Jags believe he can be.\n\nThe Jaguars point to a 19-game stretch spanning the 2022-23 seasons in which Lawrence was at his best. He threw for 4,713 yards, with 29 TDs and 11 INTs, as Jacksonville went 14-5 during that span. General manager Trent Baalke and Pederson believe it\u00b4s a glimpse of what Lawrence can do when healthy and humming.\n\n\"I\u00b4m excited for the future with Trevor. He\u00b4s excited based on the conversations we\u00b4ve had since the season,\" Pederson said. \"I just know that our guy is the right guy. He\u00b4s got the right demeanor. He\u00b4s got the right leadership. It\u00b4s our job as coaches now to make sure he takes that next step.\"\n\nLawrence is coming off an injury-filled season in which he missed the first game of his professional career because of a sprained throwing shoulder and significant practice time because of a sprained left knee, a sprained right ankle and a concussion.\n\nThe injury woes played a part in the worst late-season collapse in franchise history. The Jaguars (9-8) dropped five of their final six games and missed the postseason after spending three months atop the AFC South.\n\nBaalke responded by revamping Lawrence\u00b4s offensive line and receiving group. He re-signed left guard Ezra Cleveland and added veteran center Mitch Morse in free agency and then drafted a potential future starter with fourth-round pick Javon Foster out of Missouri.\n\nBaalke also replaced receivers Calvin Ridley, Zay Jones and Jamal Agnew with first-round speedster Brian Thomas Jr., former Buffalo starter Gabe Davis and Devin Duvernay.\n\n\"I think this is definitely the best team that we\u00b4ve had here in my eyes just at this point in the year,\" Lawrence said. \"I feel very confident in that. ... We have good people here and that\u00b4s important to having success.\"\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

Trevor Lawrence may not be playing like the generational talent that he was billed as, but he is a good starting QB. So good that the Jaguars recently handed him a massive $275 million contract extension that will keep him in Jacksonville for the foreseeable future. Lawrence spoke at a press conference today about his new contract and his mindset heading into 2024.\n\n\"Obviously, financially, it's amazing and really sets us up for the future and for the rest of our lives. That's a huge blessing,\" Lawrence said during a Thursday news conference, per NFL.com's Nick Shook.\n\nLawrence spoke optimistically about the organization's future. He declared that he wants to bring a championship to Jacksonville.\n\n\"The way the organization's going and the direction that we're heading on the football side, that makes it obviously a no-brainer for us. We're headed in the right direction, and I want to be the quarterback here. I want to bring a championship to Jacksonville. That's my goal. I really know that we can accomplish that.\"\n\nThat is a lofty goal. However, Lawrence is a young QB and the Jaguars are clearly heading in the right direction. He should definitely be holding his teammates to a championship standard.\n\nLawrence noted that he will not put any extra pressure on himself despite the new contract.\n\n\"I'm not gonna add any pressure to myself just based on getting this contract,\" Lawrence told reporters on Thursday. \"It doesn't really change what I expect of myself and what the team expects of me.\"\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars have made some excellent additions to the offensive side of the ball. They have the firepower needed to have one of the better offensive units in the NFL.\n\nLet's break down some of their improvements from this past offseason.\n\nWe'll start with the trade for Mac Jones. This is a wonderful process move by the Jaguars. Jones did not work out as the franchise guy in New England, but he proved that he can be a capable starter in a pinch. That makes him an ideal backup QB for Trevor Lawrence. Jaguars fans should feel confident that the season will not be instantly over if Lawrence suffers a serious injury.\n\nThe running back room went largely unchanged, though they added a late-round rookie in Keilan Robinson. We know Etienne is great, but the question becomes will Tank Bigsby grow into the player that Jacksonville expected when they drafted him.\n\nThe wide receiver room is where things start looking great.

Because the average comes in at $55 million and, breaking news, I don't believe Jordan Love is taking less than Trevor Lawrence, just don't think he's doing it.\"\n\nLawrence signed a five-year deal worth up to $275 million, and his $55 million average annual value matches Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow for the highest in the league.\n\n\"If the (Love) deal had gotten done a few weeks ago, I could've seen that number being $52 million, $53 million, and now I see that number being north of $55 million.

Speaking to reporters, Lawrence professed his love for the city of Jacksonville and made it clear that his intention is to lead the team to their first-ever Super Bowl title.\n\n\"I think, obviously, financially it's amazing and really sets us up for the future and the rest of our lives. So, that's a huge blessing -- obviously, that's a big deal.

So, we've kind of experienced both and we love being here either way. And, obviously, the way the organization's going and the direction that we're heading on the football side, that makes it, obviously, a no-brainer for us.

Do you and your family want to eat?\n\nIt's the same in the world of NFL \"franchise\" QBs these days. If you want one, you have to pay the high cost to keep him.\n\nLawrence, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2021 draft, reached a five-year, $275 million with Jacksonville late last week. The former Clemson standout got $142 million fully guaranteed at signing and with an average annual value of $55 million ties Bengals star Joe Burrow atop the NFL's quarterback pay scale.\n\nThree years into his NFL career most would probably agree that Lawrence is kinda a franchise QB. A good quarterback but probably not a great one. Clearly not yet living up to the \"generational prospect\" standard he was held to entering the league.\n\nOver those three seasons Lawrence has a 20-30 record for the Jags, to go along with a 1-1 mark in the postseason that he reached during his sophomore campaign in 2022. He's completed 63.8 percent of his passes with 58 touchdowns and 39 interceptions for a cumulative rating of 85.0.\n\nThose numbers are actually somewhat similar to the guy who's now backing him up in Jacksonville - our ol' Foxborough pal and former Patriots starter Mac Jones. And they are closer to mediocre than they are elite.\n\nSo what does this have to do with the Patriots?\n\nWell, nothing really. But everything, kinda.\n\nLawrence is where Maye - and his agent - at the very least probably wants to be three years from now. Entrenched in his team, solidified in the starting, franchise role to the point of being worthy of more than a quarter billion dollar investment.\n\nAnd while it's maybe not the no-brainer, ideal situation, the Patriots probably want to be where the Jaguars are three years from now.\n\nSold enough on Maye to give him what will be the largest contract in franchise history.\n\nThe harsh business reality of the NFL's modern pay scale is that the days of quarterbacks taking what Tom Brady himself recently described as \"team-friendly deals\" are probably over. Sure, Patrick Mahomes is underpaid in Kansas City compared to his production and winning, but hard to complain about a 10-year, $450 million deal. And K.C. has already talked about keeping its budding Hall of Famer happy with necessary upgrades in what Gisele might describe as its appreciation of him.\n\nSo while it does feel a little crazy that Lawrence is the highest-paid player in the NFL with Mac Jones-like numbers that include a lower passer rating and worse winning percentage over the same three-year span, the fact that Jacksonville is all-in on its franchise QB is as important or more so than the actual financial investment.\n\nLawrence is the QB of the Jags. And will be for the foreseeable future. (Remember when Bill Belichick famously said that about Brady back in the pre-dynasty day? That worked out pretty well.) No further questions, your honor.\n\n\"We can't thank [Jaguars owner Shad Khan], and everyone involved for their belief in me,\" Lawrence said in the statement announcing the extension. \"I know that the best is yet to come and this is only the beginning.\"\n\nLawrence is right. He's being paid for the faith the team has in what he can and ideally will accomplish in the future. Certainly not for what he's done to date.\n\nThat's where the Patriots and Maye strive to be by 2027.\n\nAnd this isn't necessarily to expect the No. 3 overall pick in this year's draft to be Burrow. Or Mahomes. Or Josh Allen or Justin Herbert, the guys he was compared to during the pre-draft process.\n\nJust be Lawrence, at the very least. A good-enough QB who has a hold on the job and franchise to the point that he gets a contract that we can all complain about the same way we complain at the checkout line of the local market.\n\nHere's hoping that Maye is highly overpaid by the Patriots in three years.\n\nBecause that means New England will be locked in at quarterback. And that's what you need in order to find success in the NFL.

This locks up the Jags with a QB for the present and the future.\n\nJustin Barney: A necessary one.

The Jaguars took the common sense path and it was the right one.\n\nIs Lawrence worth $275 million?\n\nJSC: I mean that is a tough question. That price tag speaks more to the state of the market than he does as a player. It is basically inflation. The NFL salary cap has taken huge jumps over the last few years and so have the price tags on contracts. If you look at the cap percentage instead of the price tag Lawrence is now nearly the top-paid QB in the last few years. His contract is more comparable to what Dak Prescott got a few years back than it is to Joe Burrow.

He's been a top 10 QB at his peak, which came in the latter half of the 2022 season when Lawrence looked like he turned the corner. But the overall body of work has been inconclusive at best. The Jaguars are betting that Lawrence is closer to the peak 2022 version than he is what we saw in 2021 or 2023.\n\nIf you were in general manager Trent Baalke's seat, would you have extended Lawrence this offseason or waited to see more before a deal?\n\nJSC: This was an easy decision. The QB market is like the housing market. It will only go up. It is never going down. Getting the deal done early is always the smart move. With other top-tier QBs looking for contracts, the market could take a massive jump before the season starts. Trevor's payday looks big even though it is a very reasonable contract. But after Tua Tagovailoa and Dak Prescott get their deals it could look pretty darn reasonable. If you waited until next offseason the price tag would be even bigger. And to throw out a good what if ... what if the Jags make a playoff run and Lawrence has a great season? Then you are on the hook for paying top dollar. Not an ideal situation.\n\nJB: I get the reasoning why fans may be skeptical about handing Lawrence such a big deal, but I would have extended Lawrence this year, too. Why, you ask. Did you see the jump in salary cap this year? It increased 13.6%, from $224.8 million to $225.4 million per team. It was the largest increase since the cap was created. It won't jump like that every year but let's say it moves up 6 or 7% each of the next two years. Agents tend to mold deals after other players at the position sign new contracts. Behind Lawrence for new deals are Tua Tagovailoa, Jordan Love and Dak Prescott, and you can bet they get contracts that push the numbers higher. San Francisco's Brock Purdy, Mr. Irrelevant from the 2022 draft, becomes eligible for a new deal next offseason. And he will top Lawrence's number. A top 10 quarterback costs top of the market money. Jacksonville had to pay it or start all over again in a year or two to try and find its next franchise quarterback. Lawrence is the best option and the Jaguars paid him like it.", "source": {"uri": "news4jax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News 4 Jax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_barney@news4jax.com", "name": "Justin Barney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_USFL_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2022 USFL season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Baalke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Baalke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Purdy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brock Purdy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Love", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tua_Tagovailoa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tua Tagovailoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Irrelevant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mr. Irrelevant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Extreme_Sports/Base_Jumping", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Extreme Sports/Base Jumping", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rope_Skipping", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rope Skipping", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Jumps", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Jumps", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/gmg/HJTJ3LAZNZEI3ANYP3XJCLLW6A.jpg?_a=ATAPphC0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661492", "eventUri": "eng-9661492", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The oft-overlooked leader of the Jaguars, Lawrence is perhaps one of the greatest current examples of the disconnect between box score scouting and actually watching him play -- which is part of what makes this deal so great for Jacksonville.\n\nLawrence's contract will end up being worth $40.4M in Average Annual Value (AAV) when accounting for guarantees and bonuses. It makes him the 11th highest-paid quarterback in the league in AAV, despite being a former No. 1 pick and the latest to join the second contract club.\n\nIt's been easy for casual fans to overlook just how prolific a passer Lawrence has become. Outside of his disastrous rookie season under Urban Meyer, Lawrence has evolved into a reliable 4,000+ yard passer who is efficient with the ball (completing over 65% of passes in each of the last two years), while having an incredible two-year TD/INT ratio of 46/22. He's also done all this without having an All-World receiving corps with Calvin Ridley as his No. 1, and Christian Kirk in the No. 2 spot.\n\nNow as he enters 2024 we're seeing a Jaguars team with more receiving talent spread around the field and focused less on one individual player. There's little doubt that losing Ridley is tough, but the Jaguars mitigated the loss by forming a true, three-deep corps with Christian Kirk, Gabe Davis, and rookie Brian Thomas Jr. The combination of Davis and Thomas Jr. should be more than enough to exceed Ridley's production, but more importantly give a process thrower like Lawrence more targets around the field -- which is always a good thing.\n\nThat's where we get to the brass tacks of this deal. Trevor Lawrence is on the precipice of truly breaking out. Doug Pederson is growing more and more comfortable with extending the Jaguars' routes and having Lawrence throw deeper, and his performance hasn't dropped off as a result. From 2022 to 2023 he lifted his Intended Air Yards from 7.4 to 8.2 yards per attempt, all while keeping his completions within 1 percent of accuracy. This is a predictor for a player who is able to shoulder a bigger load, and that should lift again in 2024.\n\nIn each of the last two years he's also had to contend with a unit that drops A LOT of passes -- 64 to be precise, which is almost on par with how many drops Patrick Mahomes has had to contend with in Kansas City, throwing to his island of misfit toys.\n\nSo, if we work under the assumption that Lawrence will take a step forward again this year (which is a fair bet), it would put him around the 4,300 passing yard mark, with anywhere between 25 and 30 passing touchdowns. This would put him on par with the best quarterbacks in the NFL.\n\nAgain, this is a guy who is being paid the 11th highest yearly salary among quarterbacks. When you are in a position where a 24-year-old QB is on his second contract, locked in for five years, playing on par with the top-5 at his position, but paying him less -- that's a huge win. Here's where Lawrence slots in among the highest paid QBs:\n\nIt's difficult to make a strict comparison between players operating in difference offenses, with differing personnels -- but anecdotally you could make an easy argument for Lawrence over Kirk Cousins, Deshaun Watson, or Daniel Jones, while pitching a decent case that he's better than Jared Goff and Jalen Hurts.\n\nAll this at fairly low AAV money which seems like splitting hairs right now, but will be magnified with a growing cap where quarterbacks will be paid more than Lawrence, which will allow for the Jaguars to out-spend on other positions.\n\nJacksonville got in on the ground floor to get this deal done early, and it was smart as hell. In two or three years we'll be wondering how Lawrence was inked for so little, much like the Bills did with Josh Allen and his extension.\n\nWhen a front office is smart for long enough the wins follow. The Jaguars are on the precipice of something special.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_dator@sbnation.com", "name": "James Dator", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Lawrence_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Lawrence (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Kirk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian Kirk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Meyer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Urban Meyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabe_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gabe Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Pederson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Pederson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Ridley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Calvin Ridley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Jones_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Jones (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Hurts", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Hurts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jared Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Allen_(quarterback)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Allen (quarterback)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Throws", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Throws", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Government_Contracting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Government Contracting", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eKU2uNbSDZtJAXEjGRFJe2u6LNs=/0x138:3423x1850/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25496591/1924993024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661492", "eventUri": "eng-9661492", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

It includes $142 million fully guaranteed and a $37.5 million signing bonus.\n\n\"Being a starting quarterback in this league is a big responsibility,\" Lawrence said. \"The team goes as you go, and I know that. That's a big responsibility, so I'm not going to add any pressure to myself just based on getting this contract. It doesn't really change what I expect of myself and what the team expects of me.\"\n\nLawrence would have signed the deal last week, but it got done hours before a vacation with his wife and in-laws. He and his wife Marissa returned to the stadium Thursday to sign amid little fanfare; coach Doug Pederson and most of his teammates were out of town.\n\nNonetheless, Lawrence's deal is the latest move in what could provide long-term stability for the small-market franchise.\n\nPass rusher Josh Allen signed a five-year, $141 million deal in April that included a $32 million signing bonus, and the Jaguars and the city are on the verge of getting final approval on a $1.4 billion stadium renovation.\n\nThose are significant changes for a team that spent the past 15 years dealing with relocation rumors and had only re-signed two first-round picks -- quarterback Blake Bortles and defensive lineman Tyson Alualu -- drafted since 2007.\n\nThe two sides worked on contract details for months as the quarterback broke ground on a new house in the area.\n\n\"We love it here; it's become home,\" Lawrence said. \"Our families love it. Families love visiting here, and we've really settled in. ... The way the organization's going and the direction that we're heading on the football side, that makes it obviously a no-brainer for us.\n\n\"I want to be the quarterback here. I want to bring a championship to Jacksonville. That's my goal, and I really know that we can accomplish that.\"\n\nLawrence will get an average of $55 million annually over the life of the extension, tying him with Cincinnati's Joe Burrow for the most in NFL history. Lawrence is now the sixth QB making more than $50 million a year, and he's the youngest on the list.\n\nThe 24-year-old is 21-31 as a three-year starter, including 1-1 in the playoffs, and has a whopping 60 turnovers -- a number he needs to trim to become the player the Jags believe he can be.\n\nThe Jaguars point to a 19-game stretch spanning the 2022-23 seasons in which Lawrence was at his best. He threw for 4,713 yards, with 29 TDs and 11 INTs, as Jacksonville went 14-5 during that span. General manager Trent Baalke and Pederson believe it's a glimpse of what Lawrence can do when healthy and humming.\n\n\"I'm excited for the future with Trevor. He's excited based on the conversations we've had since the season,\" Pederson said. \"I just know that our guy is the right guy. He's got the right demeanor. He's got the right leadership. It's our job as coaches now to make sure he takes that next step.\"\n\nLawrence is coming off an injury-filled season in which he missed the first game of his professional career because of a sprained throwing shoulder and significant practice time because of a sprained left knee, a sprained right ankle and a concussion.\n\nBroncos hire Shaw\n\nENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- Former Stanford football coach David Shaw is returning to the NFL as a senior personnel executive with the Denver Broncos.\n\nShaw, who coached the Cardinal from 2011-22, will help evaluate college and pro players and assist general manager George Paton in roster evaluation.\n\nBefore coaching at Stanford, where he won three Pac-12 titles, Shaw, 51, was an assistant coach for the Eagles, Raiders and Ravens, and he's been trying to get back into the NFL for a couple of years.\n\nHe interviewed for the Chargers' and Titans' head coaching vacancies last winter and also was a candidate for the Broncos job that went to Sean Payton in 2023.\n\nShaw and Paton kept in contact afterward and they recently started to create a role for Shaw in the personnel department that's similar to the one Gary Kubiak held after stepping down as Broncos head coach at the end of the 2016 season.", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@omaha.com", "name":

His 4,113 yards and 25 touchdowns passing respectively ranked No. 9 and No. 10 in the league that year.\n\nThe Jaguars might have gone 9-8 that season, as Gagnon noted, but he omitted the team's AFC Divisional round appearance in the playoffs after ripping off six consecutive victories between Week 14 and the Wild Card round.\n\nJacksonville also got off to an 8-3 start in 2023 with Lawrence completing 67.9% of his passes for 3,004 yards with 14 touchdowns and seven interceptions over his first 12 games, posting a 100+ point passer rating in seven of those contests.\n\nHowever, Lawrence suffered a high-ankle sprain in the fourth quarter of Week 13 against Cincinnati. The Jaguars went on to lose to the Bengals, 34-31, kicking off a 1-5 slide to end the season.\n\nLawrence played through the hurt the next week and endured two more, a Week 15 concussion and a Week 16 sprained A/C joint in his throwing shoulder, over the Jaguars' final five matchups.\n\nHe missed one game, Week 17 against Carolina, and completed 60% of his passes for 1,012 yards with seven touchdowns and seven interceptions in the four bouts he appeared in.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Passer rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9hQec4eokjPIrYYVYYqcfQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/jacksonville_jaguars_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_630/559a680b427bb165351c1274bdf00d50", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661492", "eventUri": "eng-9661492", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

It includes $142 million fully guaranteed and a $37.5 million signing bonus.\n\n\"Being a starting quarterback in this league is a big responsibility,\" Lawrence said. \"The team goes as you go, and I know that. That's a big responsibility, so I'm not going to add any pressure to myself just based on getting this contract. It doesn't really change what I expect of myself and what the team expects of me.\"\n\nLawrence would have signed the deal last week, but it got done hours before a vacation with his wife and in-laws. He and his wife Marissa returned to the stadium Thursday to sign amid little fanfare; coach Doug Pederson and most of his teammates were out of town.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Burton) among stars in FCA All-Star Game Chesterfield County schools employee charged with possessing child porn\n\nNonetheless, Lawrence's deal is the latest move in what could provide long-term stability for the small-market franchise.\n\nPass rusher Josh Allen signed a five-year, $141 million deal in April that included a $32 million signing bonus, and the Jaguars and the city are on the verge of getting final approval on a $1.4 billion stadium renovation.\n\nThose are significant changes for a team that spent the past 15 years dealing with relocation rumors and had only re-signed two first-round picks -- quarterback Blake Bortles and defensive lineman Tyson Alualu -- drafted since 2007.\n\nThe two sides worked on contract details for months as the quarterback broke ground on a new house in the area.\n\n\"We love it here; it's become home,\" Lawrence said. \"Our families love it. Families love visiting here, and we've really settled in. ... The way the organization's going and the direction that we're heading on the football side, that makes it obviously a no-brainer for us.\n\n\"I want to be the quarterback here. I want to bring a championship to Jacksonville. That's my goal, and I really know that we can accomplish that.\"\n\nLawrence will get an average of $55 million annually over the life of the extension, tying him with Cincinnati's Joe Burrow for the most in NFL history. Lawrence is now the sixth QB making more than $50 million a year, and he's the youngest on the list.\n\nThe 24-year-old is 21-31 as a three-year starter, including 1-1 in the playoffs, and has a whopping 60 turnovers -- a number he needs to trim to become the player the Jags believe he can be.\n\nThe Jaguars point to a 19-game stretch spanning the 2022-23 seasons in which Lawrence was at his best. He threw for 4,713 yards, with 29 TDs and 11 INTs, as Jacksonville went 14-5 during that span. General manager Trent Baalke and Pederson believe it's a glimpse of what Lawrence can do when healthy and humming.\n\n\"I'm excited for the future with Trevor. He's excited based on the conversations we've had since the season,\" Pederson said. \"I just know that our guy is the right guy. He's got the right demeanor. He's got the right leadership. It's our job as coaches now to make sure he takes that next step.\"\n\nLawrence is coming off an injury-filled season in which he missed the first game of his professional career because of a sprained throwing shoulder and significant practice time because of a sprained left knee, a sprained right ankle and a concussion.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!

So get mad at me.\"\n\nAllen took Lawrence's former No. 23 spot on Prisco's list this year after entering 2023 unranked. [affiliatewidget_smgtolocal]\n\nIn addition to his top 100 inclusion, Allen earned a five-year, $141.3 million contract extension from the Jaguars this offseason for the career performance he put together last year.\n\n\"[Allen] had his breakout season with 17 1/2 sacks in 2023, earning him a big contract extension from the team. He is a relentless pass rusher, who is good against the run as well. He proved to many -- me included -- that he can be a game-wrecker. (Last season: Not ranked)\"\n\nAllen also recorded single-season personal bests of 17 tackles for loss and 33 quarterback hits, leading to his second career Pro Bowl selection. His 45 career sacks rank second in Jaguars history, with the No. 1 mark, 55 by Tony Brackens, in sight.\n\nWhile Lawrence fell almost 40 spots down this year's list compared to last, Prisco believes the 2021 No. 1 overall draft pick is bound to bounce back in 2024 after receiving his own mega-extension from the Jaguars. Jacksonville gave Lawrence a five-year deal worth $275 million on Thursday.\n\nThe Jaguars opened the 2023 season 8-3, while Lawrence completed 67.9% of his passes for 3,004 yards with 14 touchdowns and seven interceptions in nearly 12 games, before suffering his first of three considerable injuries near the end of the year.\n\nHe went down with a high-ankle sprain in the fourth quarter of Week 13, suffered a concussion in Week 15 and sprained the A/C joint in his throwing shoulder during Week 16, forcing him out of Week 17 before returning for the season finale.\n\nLawrence completed 60% of his passes for 1,012 yards with seven touchdowns and seven interceptions in the four games he played through injury.\n\n\"[Lawrence's] 2023 season was a disappointment for a lot of reasons, including injury.

It's fair to suggest he's not a big fan of the deal.\n\nThe first of his 10 listed \"recent blockbuster\" deals NFL teams are \"likely to regret,\" Gagnon wrote Wednesday that Jacksonville took a risk paying Lawrence considering the quarterback's performance in 2023 and Gagnon's belief that the Jaguars don't possess a roster capable of contending. [affiliatewidget_smgtolocal]\n\nWhy they gave it to him: Lawrence was entering the final year of his rookie deal, the Jaguars obviously believe in him, and they'd prefer to save cap space in the short term with the long-term flexibility associated with a new contract.\n\nWhy they might regret it: They aren't exactly positioned to win in the short term anyway. They still have yet to finish above 9-8 with Lawrence, who was the league's 21st-highest-rated passer during a disappointing third pro season in 2023. There's a good chance that the 2021 No. 1 overall pick never lives up to his draft hype.\n\nWhile Gagnon's brief analysis of Lawrence's play makes note of his underwhelming, 88.5 passer rating from last season, it doesn't mention his 95.2 passer rating from 2022, which ranked No. 9 in the NFL. His 4,113 yards and 25 touchdowns passing respectively ranked No. 9 and No. 10 in the league that year.\n\nThe Jaguars might have gone 9-8 that season, as Gagnon noted, but he omitted the team's AFC Divisional round appearance in the playoffs after ripping off six consecutive victories between Week 14 and the Wild Card round.\n\nJacksonville also got off to an 8-3 start in 2023 with Lawrence completing 67.9% of his passes for 3,004 yards with 14 touchdowns and seven interceptions over his first 12 games, posting a 100+ point passer rating in seven of those contests.\n\nHowever, Lawrence suffered a high-ankle sprain in the fourth quarter of Week 13 against Cincinnati. The Jaguars went on to lose to the Bengals, 34-31, kicking off a 1-5 slide to end the season.\n\nLawrence played through the hurt the next week and endured two more, a Week 15 concussion and a Week 16 sprained A/C joint in his throwing shoulder, over the Jaguars' final five matchups.\n\nHe missed one game, Week 17 against Carolina, and completed 60% of his passes for 1,012 yards with seven touchdowns and seven interceptions in the four bouts he appeared in.\n\nBehind Lawrence's contract on Gagnon's list were:\n\nQB Kirk Cousins' four-year, $180 million contract with Atlanta EDGE Rashan Gary's four-year, $96 million contract with Green Bay QB Justin Herbert's five-year, $262.5 million contract with the Los Angeles Chargers QB Jalen Hurts' five-year, $255 million contract with Philadelphia QB Lamar Jackson's five-year, $260 million contract with Baltimore QB Daniel Jones' four-year, $160 million contract with the New York Giants DL Justin Madubuike's four-year, $98 million contract with Baltimore QB Aaron Rodgers' three-year, $112.5 million contract with the New York Jets DL Christian Wilkins' four-year, $110 million contract with Las Vegas\n\nDo you agree with Gagnon's analysis?

Pictures taken from USA TODAY Sports and The GM Shuffle\n\nTrevor Lawrence's eye-watering 5-year, $275 million contract has sent shockwaves through the NFL quarterback market. While his talents undoubtedly warrant a lucrative deal, the Jaguars' decision to make him the league's highest-paid signal-caller will undoubtedly pile immense pressure on the QB. Interestingly, Michael Lombardi believes the weight of expectations will bear heavily on HC Doug Pederson as well.\n\nIn a recent segment on DraftKings' \"GM Shuffle,\" the former NFL executive unpacked the effects of Lawrence's newly signed contract on the Jaguars and their head coach. In Lombardi's opinion, \"the pressure is on Pederson,\" because although the NFL world has witnessed Lawrence's offensive prowess under Pederson's tutelage, the statistics tell a different story.\n\nLawrence has played 50 games for the Jaguars in his career, during which he has turned over the ball a staggering 54 times, including 33 fumbles and 21 interceptions. Therefore, Lombardi believes Pederson will need to rally the QB and the team to justify the astronomical figures of the contract.\n\nThis urgency stems from Lawrence's tendencies to improvise with the play call, which often exposes him to opportunistic defenses determined to disrupt his mobility.\n\n\"I know there's a perception that he (Trevor Lawrence) has played better with Doug Pederson, But I don't think that's accurate,\" Lombardi said. \"He's going to have to find a way to work the ball down... I think the pressure is on Pederson to really deliver... It's a contract they had to do because what's the alternative? But to me, if you're (Trent) Baalke, you're saying, 'I'm counting on Doug to get this right.'\"\n\nPederson's arrival in 2022 undoubtedly revitalized the Jaguars, guiding them from a dismal 4-13 record in the previous season to a respectable 9-8 mark. However, this season, the stakes are even higher, with the head coach expected to elevate the improved roster to championship contenders, all while managing the expectations that come with a $55 million quarterback.\n\nLombardi's concern regarding Lawrence's penchant for turning the ball over is palpable, as no one would expect the league's highest-paid quarterback to fumble the ball as frequently as Lawrence has. The former NFL executive suggests that the Jacksonville Jaguars must urgently address this issue.\n\nWhile not all fumbles can be attributed solely to Lawrence, as some may occur due to deflections off other players, Lombardi believes the team must develop a more effective strategy.\n\nFor Lombardi, the $275 million contract might seem manageable on paper, but for the Jaguars to justify such a substantial investment, the team must rally around Lawrence and elevate their performance accordingly.\n\nDespite the fumbling woes, Lawrence's accomplishments thus far are impressive. He currently ranks fifth in quarterback wins for the Jaguars with 20 victories and is fourth in the franchise's history for both passing yards (11,770) and touchdowns (58). Remarkably, those 11,770 passing yards place him fifth all-time in NFL history for a player's first three seasons.\n\nTherefore, it can be said with certainty that the Jaguars thoroughly considered their decision before committing to Lawrence with the league's top quarterback salary.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yagya_bhargava@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Yagya Bhargava", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lombardi_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Lombardi (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Pederson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Doug Pederson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Lawrence_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Lawrence (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/06/d6cb5317-yagya-fis-2024-06-18t185809.384.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661492", "eventUri": "eng-9661492", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

trying to get back into the NFL for a couple of years.\n\nHe interviewed for the Chargers' and Titans' head coaching vacancies last winter and also was a candidate for the Broncos job that went to Sean Payton in 2023.\n\nShaw and Paton kept in contact afterward and they recently started to create a role for Shaw in the personnel department that's similar to the one Gary Kubiak held after

His best season was in 2022 when he rushed for 1,040 yards and five TDs.

It includes $142 million fully guaranteed and a $37.5 million signing bonus.\n\n\"Being a starting quarterback in this league is a big responsibility,\" Lawrence said. \"The team goes as you go, and I know that. That's a big responsibility, so I'm not going to add any pressure to myself just based on getting this contract. It doesn't really change what I expect of myself and what the team expects of me.\"\n\nLawrence would have signed the deal last week, but it got done hours before a vacation with his wife and in-laws.

Both signed $275M deals and make $55M per year. However, Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes has the richest QB deal in NFL history (10 years, $450M.)\n\nPackers general manager Brian Gutekunst appears to be all-in on locking up Love to a long-term contract, and he recently told 97.3 The Game that his goal was to get the contract done before training camp.\n\nRelated: Packers Star Says Jordan Love Is Better Than 'A Lot Of Starting Quarterbacks'", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_gallagher@postandcourier.com", "name": "Michael Gallagher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Lawrence_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Lawrence (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Love", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Hurts", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Hurts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long_Distance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long Distance", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Government_Contracting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Government Contracting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/84/1845350f-93ba-55c7-abe5-132b6a7dbd9c/6672554f9676b.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661492", "eventUri": "eng-9661492", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Lawrence and the Jaguars agreed to a five-year, $275 million contract extension last week worth up to $282.5 million through incentives. The deal has $200 million in guarantees, of which $142 million is fully guaranteed at signing.\n\nLawrence, who had two years remaining on his rookie contract, ties Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow as the league's highest-paid player at $55 million per year despite a 2023 season in which the 2021 first overall pick and the Jaguars didn't live up to expectations. The Jaguars imploded down the stretch by losing five of the last six games to miss the playoffs after being in control of the AFC South with an 8-3 record.\n\nThe natural inclination for Jordan Love and Tua Tagovailoa's representatives will be to immediately think that Lawrence's $55 million should be the salary floor for their respective quarterback clients. It may not actually come to fruition, especially for Tagovailoa.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins have seemingly cleared the deck for a new Tagovailoa deal. A $22.102 million franchise tag wasn't placed on defensive tackle Christian Wilkins, which paved the way for him to sign a four-year, $110 million contract averaging $27.5 million per year with the Las Vegas Raiders in free agency. Robert Hunt also found riches on the open market. He became the fourth member of the exclusive $20 million-per-year offensive guard club by signing a five-year, $100 million deal with the Carolina Panthers.\n\nTagovailoa threw for a career high and league-leading 4,624 yards in 2023. He also set career highs with 29 touchdown passes and a 69.3% completion percentage, both ranking fifth in the NFL. Tagovailoa's 101.5 passer rating was also the league's fifth-best mark. A Pro Bowl berth was earned for the first time in Tagovailoa's career.\n\nTagovailoa, who is scheduled to make a fully guaranteed $23.171 million in 2024 on his fifth-year option, expressed confidence in getting a new deal at the Pro Bowl Games in February. He used \"antsy\" to describe how he was feeling when asked about his contract situation earlier this month. Tagovailoa also added that \"the market is the market.\"\n\nAnother recent quarterback data point in the market besides Lawrence is Jared Goff. The Detroit Lions signed Goff to a four-year, $212 million extension, making him the NFL's second-highest paid player at $53 million per year. Goff is now third after Lawrence's signing.\n\nGoff's deal contains $170,611,832 in guarantees, where $113,611,832 was fully guaranteed at signing. The $113,611,832 includes an NFL-record $73 million signing bonus.\n\nTua riskier investment than other QBs seeking new deal\n\nThere are durability concerns for Tagovailoa that don't exist for other quarterbacks who have signed lucrative contracts recently or are in line for new deals. A dislocated right hip and posterior wall fracture cut short his final season at the University of Alabama in 2019. Tagovailoa's 2022 NFL season ended prematurely because of multiple concussions.\n\nHealth wasn't an issue for Tagovailoa in 2023. Tagovailoa was on the field for 1,045 of Miami's 1,098 offensive plays last season.\n\nTagovailoa's injury history, especially the concussions, may make the Dolphins reluctant to give him the type of security typically associated with high-end quarterback contracts. The average guarantees for the five highest-paid quarterbacks are slightly under $195 million with a little less than $135 million fully guaranteed at signing. The average yearly salary for these five deals is $53.5 million with the average contract length being 4.8 new years. The average guarantees drop to just under $185 million with slightly less than $125 million fully guaranteed at signing for the 10 highest-paid quarterbacks. Their deals on average are 5.2 new years for almost $50 million per year.\n\nIt's hard to imagine any Tagovailoa deal that doesn't put him in the $50 million-per-year quarterback club. Eclipsing the five-year, $255 million extension (worth as much as $270 million because of salary escalators) averaging $51 million per year Jalen Hurts signed with the Philadelphia Eagles in April 2023 could have some significance to Tagovailoa. Hurts finished his college career at the University of Oklahoma after losing his quarterback job to Tagovailoa at Alabama after starting for two straight years.\n\nHurt's deal currently puts him sixth in the NFL hierarchy. In order to crack the top five, Tagovailoa would need to top the $52 million per year Lamar Jackson received from the Baltimore Ravens several days after Hurts signed his deal. Jackson has $185 million in guarantees, where $135 million was fully guaranteed at signing.\n\nLove could command bigger extension than Lawrence landed\n\nLove probably has better chance of surpassing Lawrence's deal. Both Love and the Green Bay Packers seem intent on reaching an agreement before veterans report to training camp on July 21.\n\nLove is scheduled to make $11 million in 2024 after signing a one-year, $13.5 million contract extension worth up to $22.5 million through salary escalators in May 2023. The deal was in lieu of the Packers making a decision about picking up the 2020 first-round pick's fully guaranteed $20.272 million fifth-year option for 2024.\n\nLove took a big step forward over the second half of the 2023 season. He performed at an elite level, which translated into team success. Love completed 70.3% of his passes for 2,150 yards with 18 touchdowns and just one interception to post a 112.7 passer rating while the Packers went 6-2 to secure a playoff berth. Overall, Love completed 64.2% of his passes for 4,159 yards with 32 touchdowns and 11 interceptions to post a 96.1 passer rating. He ranked second and seventh respectively in the NFL for touchdown passes and passing yards last season.\n\nLove was the best quarterback on the field in Green Bay's shocking wild-card game win over the Dallas Cowboys with 2023 NFL MVP runner-up Dak Prescott as his counterpart. He more than held his own in a divisional playoff loss against the San Francisco 49ers. The opposing quarterback, Brock Purdy, was also an NFL MVP finalist.\n\nThe Packers aren't strangers to having the NFL's highest-paid player. It was done with Aaron Rodgers' 2013, 2018 and 2022 deals. Most notably, Love outperformed Rodgers' last season with the Packers in 2022 as a first-year starter last season. Coming off back-to-back NFL MVP seasons, 2022 was a down year by a then-39-year-old Rodgers' standards. He completed 64.6% of his passes for 3,695 yards with 26 touchdowns and 12 interceptions for a 91.1 passer rating. The Packers missed the playoffs with an 8-9 record. Rodgers' request to be traded to the New York Jets was granted following the season.\n\nLawrence's contract could be the impetus for Love being at the top of NFL salary totem pole, especially if the Packers feel his performance over the second half of the 2023 season and the playoffs is a sign of things to come.\n\nHurts, Jackson and Justin Herbert each took a turn as the NFL's salary king in 2023 before Burrow signed. The smallest increase among the four quarterbacks who become the league's highest paid player was Herbert getting 0.96% more than Jackson's $52 million per year. Burrow got the biggest jump. His deal is 4.76% more than Herbert's $52.5 million per year with the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nThe average increase was 2.3%. Should the Packers be inclined to do something similar for Love, his extension could average $56.25 million per year.\n\nPresumably, the Packers will make the major structural accommodation to Love that was consistently done for Rodgers in order to consummate a deal. Generally, Green Bay is in the dark ages when it comes to structuring contracts for veteran players. The only guaranteed money in Green Bay veteran contracts is a signing bonus and/or a roster bonus payable within a few days of signing. The bigger deals contain an unsecured third or fifth day of the league year roster bonus in the second and third years. The roster bonuses are supposed to be substitutes for additional contract guarantees. The overall guarantees in Packers contracts are less than comparable deals on other teams.\n\nRodgers has been the lone exception. His 2013, 2018 and 2022 deals had traditional salary guarantees.\n\nPrescott enters contract year in unique situation\n\nLawrence's contract isn't particularly relevant to Prescott's situation. If anything, Lawrence's deal confirms that Prescott's contract demands are justified because he is a much more accomplished and consistent quarterback.\n\nPrescott, who is in a contract year, is in a unique situation because of the nature of the four-year, $160 million deal averaging $40 million per year he signed in March 2021. He has leverage in any substantive negotiations for a contract extension despite a subpar performance when Dallas was upset by Green Bay in the wild card playoff round as the NFC's No. 2 seed. Prescott has a no-trade clause in his contract. He also has a provision preventing Dallas from designating him as a franchise or transition player in 2025 should he play out his contract. There also isn't a legitimate starting quarterback alternative currently on Dallas' roster.\n\nThanks to four different contract restructures strictly to create salary cap room since signing the $40 million deal in 2021, the Cowboys will have a $40.46 million 2025 salary cap charge if Prescott plays out his contract and tests the open market in 2025 free agency. The Cowboys would get a 2026 third-round compensatory pick at best from Prescott's departure in this manner.\n\nThere haven't been any serious discussions about a new deal despite Cowboys owner Jerry Jones stating he wants to keep Prescott. Wide receiver CeeDee Lamb, who is also in a contract year, has been thought to be the negotiating priority. ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported a few days ago that the Cowboys would like to get a deal done with Prescott first.\n\nPrescott received some criticism after saying he didn't play for money several weeks ago. More importantly, Prescott also stated he would leave it to the business people to decide his value. This suggests that Prescott is empowering his representatives to do what they see fit given his circumstances. Presumably, Prescott didn't fight for the no-trade clause and franchise/transition tag prohibition not to use the provisions to his advantage in negotiations.\n\nPrescott's camp attempting to fully exploit leverage could mean initially insisting on Joe Burrow's contract adjusted for the 13.61% growth in the salary cap from last year when he did his deal. This would essentially put Prescott at $62.5 million per year.\n\nBurrow got an extremely player-friendly structure from the Bengals in which his three new contract years average $61,320,327 per year. This will likely be used by Prescott's camp to justify at least a $60 million-per-year deal. Overall, the top of the quarterback market increased in 2023 by 9.41% from 2022. A $60 million-per-year extension would be a 9.09% increase over Burrow and Lawrence's deals.\n\nPrescott probably doesn't want to give more than four new years, just like he did with his current contract, although signing for five new years has become the norm at the top of the quarterback market. Goff's four-year extension is an anomaly among players making at least $50 million per year. Removal of the no-trade clause or provision preventing a franchise or transition designation would likely be deal-breakers for Prescott.\n\nStrong contract guarantees would be also be a necessity. Getting at least $150 million fully guaranteed at signing and more in total guarantees than Deshaun Watson's fully guaranteed $230 million contract with the Cleveland Browns might be important benchmarks for Prescott's camp.\n\nPersonally, I would like to see Prescott play out his contract and become an unrestricted free agent in 2025. I'm curious to see what Prescott could command on the open market as long as he didn't have a stunning collapse in 2024 along the lines of Russell Wilson's first season with the Denver Broncos after being acquired from the Seattle Seahawks in a 2022 offseason trade.\n\nA healthy Pro Bowl-caliber quarterback in his prime is never available on the open market. A fully guaranteed contract could be conceivable for Prescott, who turns 31 at the end of July, with strong interest from at least two teams.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news",

With Trevor Lawrence now sitting on a $55 million deal, Tua Tagovailoa's upcoming contract is expected to be even higher now. And NFL insider Tom Pelissero thinks this $50m+ has now become the most basic package.\n\nGetting a blockbuster deal, Lawrence signed a five-year extension with the Jaguars, for $275 million. That's big money for a quarterback who doesn't have much to show from last year. Players like Tua and Dak, on the other hand, had one of their best seasons. This, Pelissero thinks, is going to complicate matters. He opined,\n\n\"Now if you have a debate whether Tua's contract should be closer to a $50 million or $60 million, his agent is probably going to say, '55 is the floor, and we wanna beat that.' Because Trevor Lawrence statistically has not done what Tua has done... We went from 40 to 45 to 50 to now 55 is really going to be the baseline for all these deals to get done.\"\n\nLawrence is now tied with Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow for the highest annual average salary in the NFL. The Dolphins and Cowboys are likely going to really regret not signing Tua and Dak to an extension before Lawrence's deal reset the market and their expectations in this fashion.\n\nAdditionally, Lawrence's contract has strong guarantees. If Tua's agent looks to bolster his client with those guarantees, it could prove even more challenging for the team. Unless a team decides to correct the market. But would a franchise be willing to do that and fracture their relationship with their QB?\n\nThe QB market has truly been going crazy over the past couple of years, as the NFL insider noted. While agents are going to ask for the highest number, what is stopping the franchise from denying it? Apart from wanting to retain their top player, teams don't really have much of a reason.\n\nSo, unless they're really desperate to retain their QB, they can just refuse the extension.\n\n\"There is the relation with the player and the locker room dynamics but...there's teams that are going to look at this and say 'we're not comfortable going there...There's even been talks among some NFL owners about a quarterback cap where you want quarterback numbers to not go over a certain percentage of your salary cap.\"\n\nHowever, Pelissero says this has not really gotten much traction and is not likely to go anytime anywhere soon. But Trevor Lawrence's contract could just be the stick that breaks the camel's back, as he is getting paid at a high level, without necessarily performing at a high level.\n\nAnother possibility could be that a quarterback decides to take a salary cut, as many have over the years like Brady and Mahomes, for the greater good. But QBs playing at a high level are going to look for commitment from their teams, so those numbers will have to be on offer.\n\nIs the quarterback market only going to go up from here or is a team going to put its foot down and disrupt this trajectory?", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Lawrence_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Lawrence (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Associations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/60abf62c-yagya-fis-2024-05-21t132935.178.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661492", "eventUri": "eng-9661492", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

So, I'm excited for that.\"\n\nLawrence didn't quite want to characterize his feelings now that the deal is done as relief, but he noted that all parties involved wanted to have the matter settled before training camp.\n\n\"To have it done and behind us where we can move forward and just play and get ready for training camp instead of thinking in the back of your mind it didn't get done ... every season's big but it feels good to know I'm going to be here and have that stability,\" Lawrence said. \"It doesn't really change too much, but it does feel good to have it done. That was a goal that the team and myself and my team wanted to get done, is to have it finished by the time training camp came around so we could just put everything toward this year and get ready to go bring a championship here.\"\n\nLawrence added that it feels good to be backed by the organization's top brass for years to come.\n\n\"Just grateful for them that they see that in me and they want me to be the quarterback here,\" Lawrence said. \"And, obviously, that's what I want, but it takes two to tango. So I'm grateful that they see the value in me and I really feel confident in what we can accomplish here.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Lawrence_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Lawrence (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/North America", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long_Distance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long Distance", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a4e039c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1080+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8b%2F42%2Fc564d0384cef9826066d030ebaa6%2Fhttps-api-imagn.com%2Frest%2Fdownload%2FimageID%3D23585168", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661492", "eventUri": "eng-9661492", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Despite a below-standard season in Jacksonville, the team still won nine games.\n\nThis year, oddsmakers are giving the Jags a 53.4% chance to win nine or more games.\n\nThe Jaguars will hope that Lawrence will be fully healthy, and the team can cash in on a new-look skill position group that features first-round pick Brian Thomas Jr. and offseason signing Gabe Davis.\n\nMeanwhile, the defense will look to continue to be stout as the AFC South continues to evolve.\n\nWhile the Houston Texans are now the hunted in the division after going from worst to first last season, just like the Jaguars had done the year prior, the Colts will hope that second-year pro Anthony Richardson can stay healthy and make an impact. Meanwhile, the Tennessee Titans are entering a rebuild under first-year head coach Brian Callahan.\n\nQuickly, Lawrence has become the most seasoned veteran in the division.\n\nThe reason for the Jaguars' subdued win total projection is likely due to the schedule, which begins with playing four straight playoff teams (Dolphins, Browns, Bills, Texans). The team will face Houston again later on in the season, in addition to the Packers, Eagles, and Lions. It's worth mentioning that Jacksonville draws the Jets on its schedule as well.\n\nHowever, with a healthy Lawrence, the Jags have proven to be a divisional threat and one that can win a playoff game.

The $50 Million Club has a new member, Trevor Lawrence, who on Thursday officially signed a five-year, $275 million extension to keep him in Jacksonville through 2031.\n\nThough the No. 1 overall pick from the 2021 draft is coming off a subpar year by the lofty standards that accompany top picks, Lawrence has played well for a coach regarded as a quarterback whisperer. Since Doug Pederson arrived in 2022, Lawrence has posted back-to-back 4,000-yard seasons with a 46:22 touchdown-to-interception ratio. In addition, he has guided the Jaguars to back-to-back winning seasons and a playoff victory after the franchise hadn't had a season above .500 in 13 of the 14 years before his arrival.\n\nSurveying the list of the highest-paid quarterbacks, Lawrence now commands $50 million-plus annually along with Joe Burrow ($55 million), Justin Herbert ($52.5 million), Lamar Jackson ($52 million), and Jalen Hurts ($51 million). While Lawrence does not possess a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that rivals his predecessors in the club, his accomplishments are on par with the majority of the next tier of passers on the list, including Kyler Murray ($46.1 million), Deshaun Watson ($46 million) and Kirk Cousins ($45 million).\n\nIf you're wondering where Patrick Mahomes ranks on that list, the three-time Super Bowl champion raised the bar for quarterback pay with a 10-year, $450 million contract in 2020 that ushered in a wave of blockbuster deals for the position.\n\n[READ MORE: What Trevor Lawrence's extension means for Jaguars' contention in 2024 and beyond]\n\nWith Lawrence taking the position to another level on the pay scale, the football world is paying close attention to the next collection of quarterbacks poised to break the bank. Tua Tagovailoa, Jordan Love and Dak Prescott are in line to sign deals that could push them past the doormen at the $50 Million Club, potentially even before next season. The trio has earned a golden ticket with their stellar play in a league that revolves around the quarterback.\n\nTagovailoa is coming off the best season of his career, with an NFL-best 4,624 passing yards and top-five finishes in completion percentage (69.3%), touchdowns (29) and passer rating (101.5). The Dolphins star is scheduled to play on a fifth-year option that will pay him $23.1 million in 2024.\n\nGiven how well Tagovailoa meshes with Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle in an offense built around quick-rhythm passing concepts that accentuate the quarterback's strengths as an RPO (run-pass option) master, the Dolphins must open up the checkbook to keep their QB1 in the fold and remain competitive in a loaded AFC.\n\nDespite the injury concerns that have followed Tagovailoa -- dislocated right hip and posterior wall fracture at Alabama and multiple concussions in 2022 -- the fifth-year pro has excelled in Mike McDaniel's system. Tagovailoa has posted back-to-back seasons averaging eight-plus yards per attempt (8.9 and 8.3, respectively, in 2022 and 2023), at least 25 passing touchdowns (25 and 29) and a passer rating above 100.0 (105.5 and 101.1).\n\nConsidering the Dolphins have earned playoff berths each of those seasons, Tagovailoa can point to Lawrence's contract as a starting point based on their comparable numbers and achievements.\n\nLove can make a similar argument based on his emergence as a top-10 quarterback following an impressive debut campaign as a starter. The fourth-year pro posted a 4,000-yard season after replacing a four-time league MVP in Green Bay. Love finished 2023 with a 64.2% completion rate, 4,159 passing yards, a 32:11 touchdown-to-interception ratio and a 96.1 passer rating.\n\nWith a sensational finish over the last seven games -- including a 70% completion rate, 2,150 pass yards, and an 18:1 touchdown-to-interception ratio (112.7 passer rating) during that span to push the Packers into the postseason -- Love flashed the blue-chip potential that GM Brian Gutekunst and coach Matt LaFleur wanted to see in their new franchise quarterback.\n\nLove will seek a hefty raise over the $11 million on the books for the 2024 season and based on his top-10 quarterback talent status, his admittance into the $50 Million Club is only a matter of time.\n\nIn that club reserved for the best of the best, Prescott could have an exclusive spot in the VIP section as the NFL's first $60 million player. In 2024, he'll play out the last season of a four-year, $160 million contract. While some Cowboys fans would like to see a new quarterback in Dallas, Prescott will draw a lot of interest on the open market as a three-time Pro Bowler with a 73-41 career record (64.0%) and three seasons with at least 4,000 passing yards and 30 touchdowns.\n\nConsidering he has hit those marks in every season in which he has played at least 16 games since 2019, Prescott could see his value skyrocket with a stellar 2024. He possesses the leadership qualities and intangibles team-builders covet in a franchise quarterback, and his game meshes with any system. Though naysayers will point to his 2-5 playoff record as an area of concern, he owns the same postseason mark as Lamar Jackson, and the two-time MVP got the bag from the Baltimore Ravens last year after a contentious contract negotiation.\n\nOn the free-agent market at age 31, Prescott will have enough suitors to push the money into the $60 million range based on his performance, production and potential as a franchise player.\n\nWhile some in the football world are struggling with the exploding quarterback market, the $50 Million Club is on the verge of gaining a few new members.\n\nBucky Brooks is an NFL analyst for FOX Sports.

After taking some time to adapt to the NFL, Walker used lessons learned from watching Lawrence and Allen to have a great end to the 2023 season. The Jags may need Walker to avoid a troubling start and put their disappointing finish last year behind them.\n\nNew Jacksonville Jaguars' defensive tackle Arik Armstead made waves recently by saying he believed one of his fellow defenders could, in time, become the best edge defender in the NFL. That's because he wasn't talking about Josh Allen, but 23-year-old Travon Walker.\n\nBack in 2022, the Jaguars selected Walker No. 1 overall instead of Aidan Hutchinson -- the Detroit Lions happily scooped up the Michigan product with the next pick -- because they believed he, despite being a more raw prospect, had higher upside. As expected, Hutchinson was the better immediate producer, but Walker closed the gap in year two. And ahead of his third season, he's drawing motivation from a new source.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on NFL Network's The Insiders, Walker pointed to recent extensions for the aforementioned Allen and franchise quarterback Trevor Lawrence as another reason for him to keep fine-tuning his game in an attempt to live up to Armstead's hefty projection.\n\nIt's definitely fuel to the fire for me... I mean, who wouldn't want to follow in those footsteps to be in that position one day?\n\nLast season, Walker reached double-digit sacks for the first time. He notched just five QB takedowns in Weeks 1-14, but posted that same total in the campaign's final four games while snagging at least one in each of those contests.\n\nRelated Jarvis Landry Calls Jaguars Rookie 'Elite' After Minicamp Performance\n\nJarvis Landry is looking to get back in the league and recently took part in a Jaguars mini-camp. He left particularly impressed by a rookie WR.\n\nWalker Attributes His Improvement To Lawrence And Allen He got better by watching them, and now wants to help others in the same way\n\n\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" Whether you consider it a saying or a mantra, Walker is utilizing the methodology in his work. He credited the way Lawrence and Allen go about their business each day as a big factor in his end-of-season success, and hopes to share their path as a tone-setter in that respect as he steps into his own leadership role.\n\nThey show you a lot... inside the building, on the field and off the field, just from them being one of the first people in [to] being one of the last people [out]... [they show what] you probably won't get from a game unless you put in that extra (time).\n\nI have guys counting on me... guys looking up to me, to go out there and handle my business. So obviously, this offseason, I've been trying to get better.\n\nWalker mentioned being \"a lot more comfortable in the scheme\" as a reason for his hot final month, saying football is \"[now] more of a mental game [than phyiscal]\" for him. New defensive coordinator Ryan Nielsen runs a different system than former coordinator Mike Caldwell, but believes it will help the Jags be a more complete unit.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat : Despite getting a combined 27.5 sacks from Allen and Walker, Jacksonville finished with the eighth-fewest sacks in the league (40) last season.\n\nI definitely can say the defense is headed in a great direction... it lets a lot of the guys up front and within the box just play a lot more free, not a lot of thinking.\n\nAs the offense implements new playmakers at wide receiver and the defense adjusts to Nielsen's presence, Jacksonville could come out of the gate a bit slow. They face four of the AFC's 2023 playoff teams to open the season, and are the visiting team against three of them. Walker making another leap may be necessary for them to emerge from that stretch in a solid position to make a postseason push after last year's disappointing end.\n\nSource: NFL Network\n\nAll statistics courtesy of Pro Football Reference unless stated otherwise.\n\nRelated Jaguars, City Of Jacksonville Agree To $1.4 Billion Stadium Deal\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars will be developing a new stadium plan at a hefty $1.4 billion price with assistance from the taxpayer.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travon_Walker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travon Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Allen_(quarterback)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Allen (quarterback)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Lawrence_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Lawrence (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidan_Hutchinson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aidan Hutchinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarvis_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jarvis Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arik_Armstead", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arik Armstead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutchinson,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hutchinson, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hutchinson, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Bank_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Bank Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-Football-Reference.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro-Football-Reference.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldwell,_Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caldwell, Idaho"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Games", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mixcollage-20-jun-2024-02-10-pm-9660.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9661492", "eventUri": "eng-9661492", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

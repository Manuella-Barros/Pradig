The international experts wanted to examine the site, but were kept waiting outside in their car for around an hour, according to several people briefed on the visit.\n\nWhen they were finally let into the building, it was empty. They found no trace of banned chemicals.\n\n\"Look, there is nothing to see,\" said the general, known to the inspectors as Sharif, opening the door.\n\nSo why were the inspectors kept waiting? The Syrians said they were getting the necessary approval to let them in, but the inspectors had a different theory. They believed the Syrians were stalling while the place was cleaned out. It made no sense to the team that special approval was needed for them to enter an empty building.\n\nThe incident, which was not made public, is just one example of how Syrian authorities have hindered the work of inspectors and how the international community has failed to hold Syria to account, according to half a dozen interviews with officials, diplomats, and investigators involved in eliminating Syria's weapons of mass destruction.\n\nA promise by Syria in 2013 to surrender its chemical weapons averted U.S. air strikes. Many diplomats and weapons inspectors now believe that promise was a ruse.\n\nThey suspect that President Bashar al-Assad's regime, while appearing to cooperate with international inspectors, secretly maintained or developed a new chemical weapons capability. They say Syria hampered inspectors, gave them incomplete or misleading information, and turned to using chlorine bombs when its supplies of other chemicals dwindled.\n\nThere have been dozens of chlorine attacks and at least one major sarin attack since 2013, causing more than 200 deaths and hundreds of injuries. International inspectors say there have been more than 100 reported incidents of chemical weapons being used in the past two years alone.\n\n\"The cooperation was reluctant in many aspects and that's a polite way of describing it,\" Angela Kane, who was the United Nation's high representative for disarmament until June 2015, told Reuters. \"Were they happily collaborating? No.\"\n\n\"What has really been shown is that there is no counter-measure, that basically the international community is just powerless,\" she added.\n\nThat frustration was echoed by U.N. war crimes investigator Carla del Ponte, who announced on Aug. 6 she was quitting a U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria. \"I have no power as long as the Security Council does nothing,\" she said. \"We are powerless, there is no justice for Syria.\"\n\nThe extent of Syria's reluctance to abandon chemical weapons has not previously been made public for fear of damaging international inspectors' relationship with Assad's administration and its backer, Russia, which is giving military support to Assad. Now investigators and diplomatic sources have provided telling details to Reuters:\n\n- Syria's declarations about the types and quantities of chemicals it possessed do not match evidence on the ground uncovered by inspectors. Its disclosures, for example, make no mention of sarin, yet there is strong evidence that sarin has been used in Syria, including this year. Other chemicals found by inspectors but not reported by Syria include traces of nerve agent VX, the poison ricin and a chemical called hexamine, which is used to stabilise sarin.\n\n- Syria told inspectors in 2014-2015 that it had used 15 tonnes of nerve gas and 70 tonnes of sulphur mustard for research. Reuters has learned that inspectors believe those amounts are not \"scientifically credible.\" Only a fraction would be needed for research, two sources involved in inspections in Syria said.\n\n- At least 2,000 chemical bomb shells, which Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons and either used or destroyed, are unaccounted for, suggesting that they may still be in the hands of Syria's military.\n\n- In Damascus, witnesses with knowledge of the chemical weapons programme were instructed by Syrian military officials to alter their statements midway through interviews with inspectors, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international agency overseeing the removal and destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, conceded serious questions remain about the completeness and accuracy of Syria's disclosures.\n\n\"There are certainly some gaps, uncertainties, discrepancies,\" OPCW Director General Ahmet Uzumcu, a Turkish diplomat, told Reuters.\n\nBut he rejected criticism of his leadership by Kane and some other diplomats. Kane told Reuters that Uzumcu should have turned up the pressure on Syria over the gaps in its reporting and done more to support his inspectors. Uzumcu countered that it was not his job \"to ensure the full compliance\" of treaties on chemical weapons, saying that the OPCW was mandated to confirm use of chemical weapons but not to assign blame.\n\nSyria's deputy foreign minister, Faisal Meqdad, insisted that Syria was completely free of chemical weapons and defended the country's cooperation with international inspectors.\n\n\"I assure you that what was called the Syrian chemical weapons programme has ended, and has ended with no return. There are no more chemical weapons in Syria,\" he told Reuters in an interview.\n\nSharif did not respond to requests for comment about the incident at the warehouse.\n\nSARIN ATTACK\n\nOn Aug. 21, 2013, hundreds of people died in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta, a district on the outskirts of Damascus. The colourless, odourless nerve agent causes people to suffocate within minutes if inhaled even in small amounts. Assad's forces were blamed by Western governments. He has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons and blames insurgents for the attack.\n\nIn the wake of the atrocity, the United States and Russia brokered a deal under which Assad's government agreed to eradicate its chemical weapons programme. As part of the deal, Syria joined the OPCW, based in the Hague, Netherlands, promising to open its borders to inspectors and disclose its entire programme - after previously denying it had any chemical weapons.\n\nSyria declared it had 1,300 tonnes of chemical weapons or industrial chemical stocks, precisely the amount that outside experts had estimated. In an OPCW-led operation, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, that stockpile was shipped overseas for destruction with the help of 30 countries, notably the United States.\n\nBut there were two significant problems. First, inspections did not go smoothly. Days after the Ghouta sarin attack, OPCW inspectors heading for the area came under sniper fire. They made it through to Ghouta eventually and were given just two hours by Syrian authorities to interview witnesses and take samples. The team confirmed that sarin had been used.\n\nAnd in May 2014 a joint United Nations-OPCW convoy was hit by explosives and AK-47 fire while attempting to get to the site of another chemical attack in the northern town of Kafr Zita. That mission was aborted. On the return journey some of the team were detained for 90 minutes by unidentified gunmen. Syria's foreign ministry issued a statement blaming terrorists for attacking the convoy.\n\nReuters was unable to determine exactly how many times the work of inspectors has been hampered, but Syrian tactics have included withholding visas, submitting large volumes of documents multiple times to bog down the process, last-minute restrictions on site inspections and coercing certain witnesses to change their stories during interviews, four diplomats and inspectors involved in the process told Reuters.\n\nThe OPCW team has carried out 18 site visits since 2013, but has now effectively given up because Syria has failed to provide sufficient or accurate information, these sources said.\n\nThe second problem was a switch of tactics by Assad's forces. While the United Nations and OPCW focused on ridding Syria of the stockpile it admitted having, Assad's forces began using new, crude chlorine bombs instead, according to two inspectors. As many as 100 chlorine barrel bombs have been dropped from helicopters since 2014, they said. Syria has denied using chlorine.\n\nAlthough less poisonous than nerve gas and widely available, chlorine's use as a weapon is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention that Syria signed when it joined the OPCW, an intergovernmental agency that works with the United Nations to implement the convention. If inhaled, chlorine gas turns into hydrochloric acid in the lungs and can kill by drowning victims in body fluids.\n\nA source involved in monitoring Syria's chemical weapons for the OPCW said Damascus began using chlorine as \"a weapon of terror\" to gain a battlefield advantage when one of its bases in Kafr Zita was threatened with being overrun in 2014.\n\n\"The base was surrounded by opposition. The government forces wanted to depopulate the area. That's why they started using chlorine,\" said the source.\n\nA senior official who has worked with United Nations and OPCW investigators said two helicopter squadrons dropped chlorine barrel bombs, drums filled with chlorine canisters, from two air bases. To produce such a quantity must have required technical staff and logistical support, suggesting the operation was overseen by senior commanders, the official said.\n\nThe introduction of a new type of chemical weapon came at an awkward time for the OPCW, said the source involved in studying Syria's chemical weapons for the weapons monitoring group. It was keen to remove Syria's declared stockpile and reluctant to start a probe into alleged government violations that could jeopardise Syrian cooperation. The goal of removing the stockpile, which Western governments feared could fall into the hands of Islamic State, took precedence over the chlorine attacks, the source said.\n\nOPCW head Uzumcu denied there had been a reluctance to investigate reports of chlorine attacks, pointing out that in 2014 he set up a fact finding mission to look into them. This mission was not tasked with assigning blame, however. It concluded that the use of chlorine was systematic and widespread.\n\nUzumcu said the team's conclusions were handed to the OPCW executive council. It condemned the use of chlorine and passed the findings to the United Nations. A spokesman for the United Nations said it was the role of the OPCW to determine whether or not a member state was in breach of the chemical weapons ban.\n\nKane, the former U.N. high representative for disarmament, told Reuters that Uzumcu should have tackled Syria over its lapses in reporting to the OPCW, including undeclared chemicals and a failure to report the government's Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which was, in effect, the programme's headquarters.\n\n\"Why, my God, three-and-a half years later, has more progress not been made in clearing up the inconsistencies? If I was the head of an organisation like that ... I would go to Damascus and I would confront these people,\" Kane said.\n\nUzumcu said the OPCW was constrained by its founding treaty, the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. The OPCW has no obligation to act when one of its members violates the convention, he said. Determining blame for the use of chemical weapons is the task of a separate United Nations-OPCW mission in Syria, the Joint Investigative Mechanism, established in 2015. A spokesman for the Joint Investigative Mechanism referred questions to the OPCW.\n\n\"The secretariat has fulfilled, accurately and entirely, the tasks they were asked to fulfil and will remain within our limitations as far as our mandate is concerned,\" Uzumcu said.\n\nHe said some states have suspicions that the Syrian government hid stocks of chemical precursors that might be used for the production of certain nerve agents, including sarin. But he said there was no conclusive evidence.\n\nUzumcu said he regretted that relations had broken down between Russia and the United States on the OPCW executive council, which has the power to impose restrictions on Syria's membership and report it to the U.N. Security Council for non-cooperation.\n\nUzumcu said his office was still seeking answers from the Assad administration about undeclared chemicals, aerial bombs and the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which has overseen Syria's chemical weapons since the 1970s. Syrian officials have maintained that no supporting documentation exists for the programme, which included dozens of storage, production and research facilities.\n\nPOLITICAL DEADLOCK\n\nThe Syrian crisis has had a profound effect on the way the OPCW operates. For two decades the organisation had reached consensus on most decisions, only calling on the 41-member executive council to vote on a handful of occasions. Syria marked a clear divide on the council.\n\nIn 2016, when an inquiry by the United Nations and OPCW found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks, the United States sought to impose sanctions on those responsible through the executive council, but then dropped the proposal, the details of which were not made public. A text drafted by Spain condemned the attacks but removed any reference to sanctions. It was supported by a majority, including Germany, France, the United States and Britain, but opposed by Russia, China, Iran and Sudan.\n\nThe United States has since placed sanctions on hundreds of Syrian officials it said were linked to the chemical weapons programme. President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian air base, but division on the OPCW governing body and at the United Nations has prevented collective action against the continuing attacks.\n\nWestern governments accused Moscow of trying to undermine investigations by the United Nations and OPCW in order to protect Assad; Syria says the inspection missions are being used by Western countries to force regime change.\n\nRussian officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSARIN FOUND\n\nFormer U.N. chief weapons inspector Ake Sellstrom, who is now chief scientist for the U.N.-OPCW mission, said it is critical that perpetrators of chemical attacks are put on trial to deter future use of weapons of mass destruction. His team should be reporting back to the U.N. by mid-October, he said.\n\nA key unsolved question is what happened to the 2,000 aerial bombs that Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons, a process that would be costly and time-consuming.\n\n\"To my knowledge, the Syrian government never furnished any details of where, when and how they changed the bombs' payload,\" said an OPCW-U.N. source, who took part in investigations in 2015-2016. He said there clearly was \"a real, high-level, command structure behind this.\"\n\nSyrian officials did not respond to requests for comment about the bombs.\n\nThe team is also examining the deaths of almost 100 people on April 4 when a gas attack hit Khan Sheikhoun, a town in the rebel-held province of Idlib near the Turkish border. Samples taken from people exposed to the chemicals and tested by the OPCW confirmed sarin use. Meqdad, Syria's deputy foreign minister, said in the interview that Syrian forces were not to blame, repeating earlier denials by Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem.\n\nSellstrom said the presence of sarin so long after Syria was supposed to have dismantled its chemical weapons programme posed difficult questions. \"Is there a hideout somewhere, or is there production somewhere and how much is available?\" he said, adding that the reported use of aerial bombs in Khan Sheikhoun could point to the Syrian forces keeping some strategic weapons as well.\n\nThe attack means either \"that someone can produce sarin today, or sarin has been hidden,\" Sellstrom said.\n\n(Editing By Janet McBride and Richard Woods)", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

The international experts wanted to examine the site, but were kept waiting outside in their car for around an hour, according to several people briefed on the visit.\n\nWhen they were finally let into the building, it was empty. They found no trace of banned chemicals.\n\n\"Look, there is nothing to see,\" said the general, known to the inspectors as Sharif, opening the door.\n\nSo why were the inspectors kept waiting? The Syrians said they were getting the necessary approval to let them in, but the inspectors had a different theory. They believed the Syrians were stalling while the place was cleaned out. It made no sense to the team that special approval was needed for them to enter an empty building.\n\nThe incident, which was not made public, is just one example of how Syrian authorities have hindered the work of inspectors and how the international community has failed to hold Syria to account, according to half a dozen interviews with officials, diplomats, and investigators involved in eliminating Syria's weapons of mass destruction.\n\nA promise by Syria in 2013 to surrender its chemical weapons averted U.S. air strikes. Many diplomats and weapons inspectors now believe that promise was a ruse.\n\nThey suspect that President Bashar al-Assad's regime, while appearing to cooperate with international inspectors, secretly maintained or developed a new chemical weapons capability. They say Syria hampered inspectors, gave them incomplete or misleading information, and turned to using chlorine bombs when its supplies of other chemicals dwindled.\n\nThere have been dozens of chlorine attacks and at least one major sarin attack since 2013, causing more than 200 deaths and hundreds of injuries. International inspectors say there have been more than 100 reported incidents of chemical weapons being used in the past two years alone.\n\n\"The cooperation was reluctant in many aspects and that's a polite way of describing it,\" Angela Kane, who was the United Nation's high representative for disarmament until June 2015, told Reuters. \"Were they happily collaborating? No.\"\n\n\"What has really been shown is that there is no counter-measure, that basically the international community is just powerless,\" she added.\n\nThat frustration was echoed by U.N. war crimes investigator Carla del Ponte, who announced on Aug. 6 she was quitting a U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria. \"I have no power as long as the Security Council does nothing,\" she said. \"We are powerless, there is no justice for Syria.\"\n\nThe extent of Syria's reluctance to abandon chemical weapons has not previously been made public for fear of damaging international inspectors' relationship with Assad's administration and its backer, Russia, which is giving military support to Assad. Now investigators and diplomatic sources have provided telling details to Reuters:\n\n- Syria's declarations about the types and quantities of chemicals it possessed do not match evidence on the ground uncovered by inspectors. Its disclosures, for example, make no mention of sarin, yet there is strong evidence that sarin has been used in Syria, including this year. Other chemicals found by inspectors but not reported by Syria include traces of nerve agent VX, the poison ricin and a chemical called hexamine, which is used to stabilise sarin.\n\n- Syria told inspectors in 2014-2015 that it had used 15 tonnes of nerve gas and 70 tonnes of sulphur mustard for research. Reuters has learned that inspectors believe those amounts are not \"scientifically credible.\" Only a fraction would be needed for research, two sources involved in inspections in Syria said.\n\n- At least 2,000 chemical bomb shells, which Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons and either used or destroyed, are unaccounted for, suggesting that they may still be in the hands of Syria's military.\n\n- In Damascus, witnesses with knowledge of the chemical weapons programme were instructed by Syrian military officials to alter their statements midway through interviews with inspectors, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international agency overseeing the removal and destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, conceded serious questions remain about the completeness and accuracy of Syria's disclosures.\n\n\"There are certainly some gaps, uncertainties, discrepancies,\" OPCW Director General Ahmet Uzumcu, a Turkish diplomat, told Reuters.\n\nBut he rejected criticism of his leadership by Kane and some other diplomats. Kane told Reuters that Uzumcu should have turned up the pressure on Syria over the gaps in its reporting and done more to support his inspectors. Uzumcu countered that it was not his job \"to ensure the full compliance\" of treaties on chemical weapons, saying that the OPCW was mandated to confirm use of chemical weapons but not to assign blame.\n\nSyria's deputy foreign minister, Faisal Meqdad, insisted that Syria was completely free of chemical weapons and defended the country's cooperation with international inspectors.\n\n\"I assure you that what was called the Syrian chemical weapons programme has ended, and has ended with no return. There are no more chemical weapons in Syria,\" he told Reuters in an interview.\n\nSharif did not respond to requests for comment about the incident at the warehouse.\n\nSARIN ATTACK\n\nOn Aug. 21, 2013, hundreds of people died in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta, a district on the outskirts of Damascus. The colourless, odourless nerve agent causes people to suffocate within minutes if inhaled even in small amounts. Assad's forces were blamed by Western governments. He has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons and blames insurgents for the attack.\n\nIn the wake of the atrocity, the United States and Russia brokered a deal under which Assad's government agreed to eradicate its chemical weapons programme. As part of the deal, Syria joined the OPCW, based in the Hague, Netherlands, promising to open its borders to inspectors and disclose its entire programme - after previously denying it had any chemical weapons.\n\nSyria declared it had 1,300 tonnes of chemical weapons or industrial chemical stocks, precisely the amount that outside experts had estimated. In an OPCW-led operation, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, that stockpile was shipped overseas for destruction with the help of 30 countries, notably the United States.\n\nBut there were two significant problems. First, inspections did not go smoothly. Days after the Ghouta sarin attack, OPCW inspectors heading for the area came under sniper fire. They made it through to Ghouta eventually and were given just two hours by Syrian authorities to interview witnesses and take samples. The team confirmed that sarin had been used.\n\nAnd in May 2014 a joint United Nations-OPCW convoy was hit by explosives and AK-47 fire while attempting to get to the site of another chemical attack in the northern town of Kafr Zita. That mission was aborted. On the return journey some of the team were detained for 90 minutes by unidentified gunmen. Syria's foreign ministry issued a statement blaming terrorists for attacking the convoy.\n\nReuters was unable to determine exactly how many times the work of inspectors has been hampered, but Syrian tactics have included withholding visas, submitting large volumes of documents multiple times to bog down the process, last-minute restrictions on site inspections and coercing certain witnesses to change their stories during interviews, four diplomats and inspectors involved in the process told Reuters.\n\nThe OPCW team has carried out 18 site visits since 2013, but has now effectively given up because Syria has failed to provide sufficient or accurate information, these sources said.\n\nThe second problem was a switch of tactics by Assad's forces. While the United Nations and OPCW focused on ridding Syria of the stockpile it admitted having, Assad's forces began using new, crude chlorine bombs instead, according to two inspectors. As many as 100 chlorine barrel bombs have been dropped from helicopters since 2014, they said. Syria has denied using chlorine.\n\nAlthough less poisonous than nerve gas and widely available, chlorine's use as a weapon is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention that Syria signed when it joined the OPCW, an intergovernmental agency that works with the United Nations to implement the convention. If inhaled, chlorine gas turns into hydrochloric acid in the lungs and can kill by drowning victims in body fluids.\n\nA source involved in monitoring Syria's chemical weapons for the OPCW said Damascus began using chlorine as \"a weapon of terror\" to gain a battlefield advantage when one of its bases in Kafr Zita was threatened with being overrun in 2014.\n\n\"The base was surrounded by opposition. The government forces wanted to depopulate the area. That's why they started using chlorine,\" said the source.\n\nA senior official who has worked with United Nations and OPCW investigators said two helicopter squadrons dropped chlorine barrel bombs, drums filled with chlorine canisters, from two air bases. To produce such a quantity must have required technical staff and logistical support, suggesting the operation was overseen by senior commanders, the official said.\n\nThe introduction of a new type of chemical weapon came at an awkward time for the OPCW, said the source involved in studying Syria's chemical weapons for the weapons monitoring group. It was keen to remove Syria's declared stockpile and reluctant to start a probe into alleged government violations that could jeopardise Syrian cooperation. The goal of removing the stockpile, which Western governments feared could fall into the hands of Islamic State, took precedence over the chlorine attacks, the source said.\n\nOPCW head Uzumcu denied there had been a reluctance to investigate reports of chlorine attacks, pointing out that in 2014 he set up a fact finding mission to look into them. This mission was not tasked with assigning blame, however.

The international experts wanted to examine the site, but were kept waiting outside in their car for around an hour, according to several people briefed on the visit.\n\nWhen they were finally let into the building, it was empty. They found no trace of banned chemicals.\n\n\"Look, there is nothing to see,\" said the general, known to the inspectors as Sharif, opening the door.\n\nSo why were the inspectors kept waiting? The Syrians said they were getting the necessary approval to let them in, but the inspectors had a different theory. They believed the Syrians were stalling while the place was cleaned out. It made no sense to the team that special approval was needed for them to enter an empty building.\n\nThe incident, which was not made public, is just one example of how Syrian authorities have hindered the work of inspectors and how the international community has failed to hold Syria to account, according to half a dozen interviews with officials, diplomats, and investigators involved in eliminating Syria's weapons of mass destruction.\n\nA promise by Syria in 2013 to surrender its chemical weapons averted U.S. air strikes. Many diplomats and weapons inspectors now believe that promise was a ruse.\n\nThey suspect that President Bashar al-Assad's regime, while appearing to cooperate with international inspectors, secretly maintained or developed a new chemical weapons capability. They say Syria hampered inspectors, gave them incomplete or misleading information, and turned to using chlorine bombs when its supplies of other chemicals dwindled.\n\nThere have been dozens of chlorine attacks and at least one major sarin attack since 2013, causing more than 200 deaths and hundreds of injuries. International inspectors say there have been more than 100 reported incidents of chemical weapons being used in the past two years alone.\n\n\"The cooperation was reluctant in many aspects and that's a polite way of describing it,\" Angela Kane, who was the United Nation's high representative for disarmament until June 2015, told Reuters. \"Were they happily collaborating? No.\"\n\n\"What has really been shown is that there is no counter-measure, that basically the international community is just powerless,\" she added.\n\nThat frustration was echoed by U.N. war crimes investigator Carla del Ponte, who announced on Aug. 6 she was quitting a U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria. \"I have no power as long as the Security Council does nothing,\" she said. \"We are powerless, there is no justice for Syria.\"\n\nThe extent of Syria's reluctance to abandon chemical weapons has not previously been made public for fear of damaging international inspectors' relationship with Assad's administration and its backer, Russia, which is giving military support to Assad. Now investigators and diplomatic sources have provided telling details to Reuters:\n\n- Syria's declarations about the types and quantities of chemicals it possessed do not match evidence on the ground uncovered by inspectors. Its disclosures, for example, make no mention of sarin, yet there is strong evidence that sarin has been used in Syria, including this year. Other chemicals found by inspectors but not reported by Syria include traces of nerve agent VX, the poison ricin and a chemical called hexamine, which is used to stabilise sarin.\n\n- Syria told inspectors in 2014-2015 that it had used 15 tonnes of nerve gas and 70 tonnes of sulphur mustard for research. Reuters has learnt that inspectors believe those amounts are not \"scientifically credible.\" Only a fraction would be needed for research, two sources involved in inspections in Syria said.\n\n- At least 2,000 chemical bomb shells, which Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons and either used or destroyed, are unaccounted for, suggesting that they may still be in the hands of Syria's military.\n\n- In Damascus, witnesses with knowledge of the chemical weapons programme were instructed by Syrian military officials to alter their statements midway through interviews with inspectors, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international agency overseeing the removal and destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, conceded serious questions remain about the completeness and accuracy of Syria's disclosures.\n\n\"There are certainly some gaps, uncertainties, discrepancies,\" OPCW Director General Ahmet Uzumcu, a Turkish diplomat, told Reuters.\n\nBut he rejected criticism of his leadership by Kane and some other diplomats. Kane told Reuters that Uzumcu should have turned up the pressure on Syria over the gaps in its reporting and done more to support his inspectors. Uzumcu countered that it was not his job \"to ensure the full compliance\" of treaties on chemical weapons, saying that the OPCW was mandated to confirm use of chemical weapons but not to assign blame.\n\nSyria's deputy foreign minister, Faisal Meqdad, insisted that Syria was completely free of chemical weapons and defended the country's cooperation with international inspectors.\n\n\"I assure you that what was called the Syrian chemical weapons programme has ended, and has ended with no return. There are no more chemical weapons in Syria,\" he told Reuters in an interview.\n\nSharif did not respond to requests for comment about the incident at the warehouse.\n\n(For graphic on chemical attacks, click here)\n\nOn Aug. 21, 2013, hundreds of people died in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta, a district on the outskirts of Damascus. The colourless, odourless nerve agent causes people to suffocate within minutes if inhaled even in small amounts. Assad's forces were blamed by Western governments. He has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons and blames insurgents for the attack.\n\nIn the wake of the atrocity, the United States and Russia brokered a deal under which Assad's government agreed to eradicate its chemical weapons programme. As part of the deal, Syria joined the OPCW, based in the Hague, Netherlands, promising to open its borders to inspectors and disclose its entire programme - after previously denying it had any chemical weapons.\n\nSyria declared it had 1,300 tonnes of chemical weapons or industrial chemical stocks, precisely the amount that outside experts had estimated. In an OPCW-led operation, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, that stockpile was shipped overseas for destruction with the help of 30 countries, notably the United States.\n\nBut there were two significant problems. First, inspections did not go smoothly. Days after the Ghouta sarin attack, OPCW inspectors heading for the area came under sniper fire. They made it through to Ghouta eventually and were given just two hours by Syrian authorities to interview witnesses and take samples. The team confirmed that sarin had been used.\n\nAnd in May 2014 a joint United Nations-OPCW convoy was hit by explosives and AK-47 fire while attempting to get to the site of another chemical attack in the northern town of Kafr Zita. That mission was aborted. On the return journey some of the team were detained for 90 minutes by unidentified gunmen. Syria's foreign ministry issued a statement blaming terrorists for attacking the convoy.\n\nReuters was unable to determine exactly how many times the work of inspectors has been hampered, but Syrian tactics have included withholding visas, submitting large volumes of documents multiple times to bog down the process, last-minute restrictions on site inspections and coercing certain witnesses to change their stories during interviews, four diplomats and inspectors involved in the process told Reuters.\n\nThe OPCW team has carried out 18 site visits since 2013, but has now effectively given up because Syria has failed to provide sufficient or accurate information, these sources said.\n\nThe second problem was a switch of tactics by Assad's forces. While the United Nations and OPCW focussed on ridding Syria of the stockpile it admitted having, Assad's forces began using new, crude chlorine bombs instead, according to two inspectors. As many as 100 chlorine barrel bombs have been dropped from helicopters since 2014, they said. Syria has denied using chlorine.\n\nAlthough less poisonous than nerve gas and widely available, chlorine's use as a weapon is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention that Syria signed when it joined the OPCW, an intergovernmental agency that works with the United Nations to implement the convention. If inhaled, chlorine gas turns into hydrochloric acid in the lungs and can kill by drowning victims in body fluids.\n\nA source involved in monitoring Syria's chemical weapons for the OPCW said Damascus began using chlorine as \"a weapon of terror\" to gain a battlefield advantage when one of its bases in Kafr Zita was threatened with being overrun in 2014.\n\n\"The base was surrounded by opposition. The government forces wanted to depopulate the area. That's why they started using chlorine,\" said the source.\n\nA senior official who has worked with United Nations and OPCW investigators said two helicopter squadrons dropped chlorine barrel bombs, drums filled with chlorine canisters, from two air bases. To produce such a quantity must have required technical staff and logistical support, suggesting the operation was overseen by senior commanders, the official said.\n\nThe introduction of a new type of chemical weapon came at an awkward time for the OPCW, said the source involved in studying Syria's chemical weapons for the weapons monitoring group. It was keen to remove Syria's declared stockpile and reluctant to start a probe into alleged government violations that could jeopardise Syrian cooperation. The goal of removing the stockpile, which Western governments feared could fall into the hands of Islamic State, took precedence over the chlorine attacks, the source said.\n\nOPCW head Uzumcu denied there had been a reluctance to investigate reports of chlorine attacks, pointing out that in 2014 he set up a fact finding mission to look into them. This mission was not tasked with assigning blame, however. It concluded that the use of chlorine was systematic and widespread.\n\nUzumcu said the team's conclusions were handed to the OPCW executive council. It condemned the use of chlorine and passed the findings to the United Nations. A spokesman for the United Nations said it was the role of the OPCW to determine whether or not a member state was in breach of the chemical weapons ban.\n\nKane, the former U.N. high representative for disarmament, told Reuters that Uzumcu should have tackled Syria over its lapses in reporting to the OPCW, including undeclared chemicals and a failure to report the government's Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which was, in effect, the programme's headquarters.\n\n\"Why, my God, three-and-a half years later, has more progress not been made in clearing up the inconsistencies? If I was the head of an organisation like that ... I would go to Damascus and I would confront these people,\" Kane said.\n\nUzumcu said the OPCW was constrained by its founding treaty, the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. The OPCW has no obligation to act when one of its members violates the convention, he said. Determining blame for the use of chemical weapons is the task of a separate United Nations-OPCW mission in Syria, the Joint Investigative Mechanism, established in 2015. A spokesman for the Joint Investigative Mechanism referred questions to the OPCW.\n\n\"The secretariat has fulfilled, accurately and entirely, the tasks they were asked to fulfil and will remain within our limitations as far as our mandate is concerned,\" Uzumcu said.\n\nHe said some states have suspicions that the Syrian government hid stocks of chemical precursors that might be used for the production of certain nerve agents, including sarin. But he said there was no conclusive evidence.\n\nUzumcu said he regretted that relations had broken down between Russia and the United States on the OPCW executive council, which has the power to impose restrictions on Syria's membership and report it to the U.N. Security Council for non-cooperation.\n\nUzumcu said his office was still seeking answers from the Assad administration about undeclared chemicals, aerial bombs and the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which has overseen Syria's chemical weapons since the 1970s. Syrian officials have maintained that no supporting documentation exists for the programme, which included dozens of storage, production and research facilities.\n\nThe Syrian crisis has had a profound effect on the way the OPCW operates. For two decades the organisation had reached consensus on most decisions, only calling on the 41-member executive council to vote on a handful of occasions. Syria marked a clear divide on the council.\n\nIn 2016, when an inquiry by the United Nations and OPCW found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks, the United States sought to impose sanctions on those responsible through the executive council, but then dropped the proposal, the details of which were not made public. A text drafted by Spain condemned the attacks but removed any reference to sanctions. It was supported by a majority, including Germany, France, the United States and Britain, but opposed by Russia, China, Iran and Sudan.\n\nThe United States has since placed sanctions on hundreds of Syrian officials it said were linked to the chemical weapons programme. President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian air base, but division on the OPCW governing body and at the United Nations has prevented collective action against the continuing attacks.\n\nWestern governments accused Moscow of trying to undermine investigations by the United Nations and OPCW in order to protect Assad; Syria says the inspection missions are being used by Western countries to force regime change.\n\nRussian officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFormer U.N. chief weapons inspector Ake Sellstrom, who is now chief scientist for the U.N.-OPCW mission, said it is critical that perpetrators of chemical attacks are put on trial to deter future use of weapons of mass destruction. His team should be reporting back to the U.N. by mid-October, he said.\n\nA key unsolved question is what happened to the 2,000 aerial bombs that Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons, a process that would be costly and time-consuming.\n\n\"To my knowledge, the Syrian government never furnished any details of where, when and how they changed the bombs' payload,\" said an OPCW-U.N. source, who took part in investigations in 2015-2016. He said there clearly was \"a real, high-level, command structure behind this.\"\n\nSyrian officials did not respond to requests for comment about the bombs.\n\nThe team is also examining the deaths of almost 100 people on April 4 when a gas attack hit Khan Sheikhoun, a town in the rebel-held province of Idlib near the Turkish border. Samples taken from people exposed to the chemicals and tested by the OPCW confirmed sarin use. Meqdad, Syria's deputy foreign minister, said in the interview that Syrian forces were not to blame, repeating earlier denials by Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem.\n\nSellstrom said the presence of sarin so long after Syria was supposed to have dismantled its chemical weapons programme posed difficult questions. \"Is there a hideout somewhere, or is there production somewhere and how much is available?\" he said, adding that the reported use of aerial bombs in Khan Sheikhoun could point to the Syrian forces keeping some strategic weapons as well.\n\nThe attack means either \"that someone can produce sarin today, or sarin has been hidden,\" Sellstrom said.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label":

Other chemicals found by inspectors but not reported by Syria include traces of nerve agent VX, the poison ricin and a chemical called hexamine, which is used to stabilise sarin.\n\n- Syria told inspectors in 2014-2015 that it had used 15 tonnes of nerve gas and 70 tonnes of sulphur mustard for research. Reuters has learned that inspectors believe those amounts are not \"scientifically credible.\" Only a fraction would be needed for research, two sources involved in inspections in Syria said.\n\n- At least 2,000 chemical bomb shells, which Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons and either used or destroyed, are unaccounted for, suggesting that they may still be in the hands of Syria's military.\n\n- In Damascus, witnesses with knowledge of the chemical weapons programme were instructed by Syrian military officials to alter their statements midway through interviews with inspectors, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international agency overseeing the removal and destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, conceded serious questions remain about the completeness and accuracy of Syria's disclosures.\n\n\"There are certainly some gaps, uncertainties, discrepancies,\" OPCW Director General Ahmet Uzumcu, a Turkish diplomat, told Reuters.\n\nBut he rejected criticism of his leadership by Kane and some other diplomats. Kane told Reuters that Uzumcu should have turned up the pressure on Syria over the gaps in its reporting and done more to support his inspectors. Uzumcu countered that it was not his job \"to ensure the full compliance\" of treaties on chemical weapons, saying that the OPCW was mandated to confirm use of chemical weapons but not to assign blame.\n\nSyria's deputy foreign minister, Faisal Meqdad, insisted that Syria was completely free of chemical weapons and defended the country's cooperation with international inspectors.\n\n\"I assure you that what was called the Syrian chemical weapons programme has ended, and has ended with no return. There are no more chemical weapons in Syria,\" he told Reuters in an interview.\n\nSharif did not respond to requests for comment about the incident at the warehouse.\n\nSARIN ATTACK\n\nOn Aug. 21, 2013, hundreds of people died in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta, a district on the outskirts of Damascus. The colourless, odourless nerve agent causes people to suffocate within minutes if inhaled even in small amounts. Assad's forces were blamed by Western governments. He has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons and blames insurgents for the attack.\n\nIn the wake of the atrocity, the United States and Russia brokered a deal under which Assad's government agreed to eradicate its chemical weapons programme. As part of the deal, Syria joined the OPCW, based in the Hague, Netherlands, promising to open its borders to inspectors and disclose its entire programme - after previously denying it had any chemical weapons.\n\nSyria declared it had 1,300 tonnes of chemical weapons or industrial chemical stocks, precisely the amount that outside experts had estimated. In an OPCW-led operation, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, that stockpile was shipped overseas for destruction with the help of 30 countries, notably the United States.\n\nBut there were two significant problems. First, inspections did not go smoothly. Days after the Ghouta sarin attack, OPCW inspectors heading for the area came under sniper fire. They made it through to Ghouta eventually and were given just two hours by Syrian authorities to interview witnesses and take samples. The team confirmed that sarin had been used.\n\nAnd in May 2014 a joint United Nations-OPCW convoy was hit by explosives and AK-47 fire while attempting to get to the site of another chemical attack in the northern town of Kafr Zita. That mission was aborted. On the return journey some of the team were detained for 90 minutes by unidentified gunmen. Syria's foreign ministry issued a statement blaming terrorists for attacking the convoy.\n\nReuters was unable to determine exactly how many times the work of inspectors has been hampered, but Syrian tactics have included withholding visas, submitting large volumes of documents multiple times to bog down the process, last-minute restrictions on site inspections and coercing certain witnesses to change their stories during interviews, four diplomats and inspectors involved in the process told Reuters.\n\nThe OPCW team has carried out 18 site visits since 2013, but has now effectively given up because Syria has failed to provide sufficient or accurate information, these sources said.\n\nThe second problem was a switch of tactics by Assad's forces. While the United Nations and OPCW focused on ridding Syria of the stockpile it admitted having, Assad's forces began using new, crude chlorine bombs instead, according to two inspectors. As many as 100 chlorine barrel bombs have been dropped from helicopters since 2014, they said. Syria has denied using chlorine.\n\nAlthough less poisonous than nerve gas and widely available, chlorine's use as a weapon is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention that Syria signed when it joined the OPCW, an intergovernmental agency that works with the United Nations to implement the convention. If inhaled, chlorine gas turns into hydrochloric acid in the lungs and can kill by drowning victims in body fluids.\n\nA source involved in monitoring Syria's chemical weapons for the OPCW said Damascus began using chlorine as \"a weapon of terror\" to gain a battlefield advantage when one of its bases in Kafr Zita was threatened with being overrun in 2014.\n\n\"The base was surrounded by opposition. The government forces wanted to depopulate the area. That's why they started using chlorine,\" said the source.\n\nA senior official who has worked with United Nations and OPCW investigators said two helicopter squadrons dropped chlorine barrel bombs, drums filled with chlorine canisters, from two air bases. To produce such a quantity must have required technical staff and logistical support, suggesting the operation was overseen by senior commanders, the official said.\n\nThe introduction of a new type of chemical weapon came at an awkward time for the OPCW, said the source involved in studying Syria's chemical weapons for the weapons monitoring group. It was keen to remove Syria's declared stockpile and reluctant to start a probe into alleged government violations that could jeopardise Syrian cooperation. The goal of removing the stockpile, which Western governments feared could fall into the hands of Islamic State, took precedence over the chlorine attacks, the source said.\n\nOPCW head Uzumcu denied there had been a reluctance to investigate reports of chlorine attacks, pointing out that in 2014 he set up a fact finding mission to look into them. This mission was not tasked with assigning blame, however. It concluded that the use of chlorine was systematic and widespread.\n\nUzumcu said the team's conclusions were handed to the OPCW executive council. It condemned the use of chlorine and passed the findings to the United Nations. A spokesman for the United Nations said it was the role of the OPCW to determine whether or not a member state was in breach of the chemical weapons ban.\n\nKane, the former U.N. high representative for disarmament, told Reuters that Uzumcu should have tackled Syria over its lapses in reporting to the OPCW, including undeclared chemicals and a failure to report the government's Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which was, in effect, the programme's headquarters.\n\n\"Why, my God, three-and-a half years later, has more progress not been made in clearing up the inconsistencies? If I was the head of an organisation like that ... I would go to Damascus and I would confront these people,\" Kane said.\n\nUzumcu said the OPCW was constrained by its founding treaty, the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. The OPCW has no obligation to act when one of its members violates the convention, he said. Determining blame for the use of chemical weapons is the task of a separate United Nations-OPCW mission in Syria, the Joint Investigative Mechanism, established in 2015. A spokesman for the Joint Investigative Mechanism referred questions to the OPCW.\n\n\"The secretariat has fulfilled, accurately and entirely, the tasks they were asked to fulfil and will remain within our limitations as far as our mandate is concerned,\" Uzumcu said.\n\nHe said some states have suspicions that the Syrian government hid stocks of chemical precursors that might be used for the production of certain nerve agents, including sarin. But he said there was no conclusive evidence.\n\nUzumcu said he regretted that relations had broken down between Russia and the United States on the OPCW executive council, which has the power to impose restrictions on Syria's membership and report it to the U.N. Security Council for non-cooperation.\n\nUzumcu said his office was still seeking answers from the Assad administration about undeclared chemicals, aerial bombs and the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which has overseen Syria's chemical weapons since the 1970s. Syrian officials have maintained that no supporting documentation exists for the programme, which included dozens of storage, production and research facilities.\n\nThe Syrian crisis has had a profound effect on the way the OPCW operates. For two decades the organisation had reached consensus on most decisions, only calling on the 41-member executive council to vote on a handful of occasions. Syria marked a clear divide on the council.\n\nIn 2016, when an inquiry by the United Nations and OPCW found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks, the United States sought to impose sanctions on those responsible through the executive council, but then dropped the proposal, the details of which were not made public. A text drafted by Spain condemned the attacks but removed any reference to sanctions. It was supported by a majority, including Germany, France, the United States and Britain, but opposed by Russia, China, Iran and Sudan.\n\nThe United States has since placed sanctions on hundreds of Syrian officials it said were linked to the chemical weapons programme. President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian air base, but division on the OPCW governing body and at the United Nations has prevented collective action against the continuing attacks.\n\nWestern governments accused Moscow of trying to undermine investigations by the United Nations and OPCW in order to protect Assad; Syria says the inspection missions are being used by Western countries to force regime change.\n\nRussian officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFormer U.N. chief weapons inspector Ake Sellstrom, who is now chief scientist for the U.N.-OPCW mission, said it is critical that perpetrators of chemical attacks are put on trial to deter future use of weapons of mass destruction. His team should be reporting back to the U.N. by mid-October, he said.\n\nA key unsolved question is what happened to the 2,000 aerial bombs that Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons, a process that would be costly and time-consuming.\n\n\"To my knowledge, the Syrian government never furnished any details of where, when and how they changed the bombs' payload,\" said an OPCW-U.N. source, who took part in investigations in 2015-2016. He said there clearly was \"a real, high-level, command structure behind this.\"\n\nSyrian officials did not respond to requests for comment about the bombs.\n\nThe team is also examining the deaths of almost 100 people on April 4 when a gas attack hit Khan Sheikhoun, a town in the rebel-held province of Idlib near the Turkish border. Samples taken from people exposed to the chemicals and tested by the OPCW confirmed sarin use. Meqdad, Syria's deputy foreign minister, said in the interview that Syrian forces were not to blame, repeating earlier denials by Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem.\n\nSellstrom said the presence of sarin so long after Syria was supposed to have dismantled its chemical weapons programme posed difficult questions. \"Is there a hideout somewhere, or is there production somewhere and how much is available?\" he said, adding that the reported use of aerial bombs in Khan Sheikhoun could point to the Syrian forces keeping some strategic weapons as well.\n\nThe attack means either \"that someone can produce sarin today, or sarin has been hidden,\" Sellstrom said.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label":

Many diplomats and weapons inspectors now believe that promise was a ruse. (Source: Reuters)\n\nIn the spring of 2015 a Syrian major general escorted a small team of chemical weapons inspectors to a warehouse outside the Syrian capital Damascus. The international experts wanted to examine the site, but were kept waiting outside in their car for around an hour, according to several people briefed on the visit.\n\nWhen they were finally let into the building, it was empty. They found no trace of banned chemicals.\n\n\"Look, there is nothing to see,\" said the general, known to the inspectors as Sharif, opening the door.\n\nSo why were the inspectors kept waiting? The Syrians said they were getting the necessary approval to let them in, but the inspectors had a different theory. They believed the Syrians were stalling while the place was cleaned out. It made no sense to the team that special approval was needed for them to enter an empty building.\n\nThe incident, which was not made public, is just one example of how Syrian authorities have hindered the work of inspectors and how the international community has failed to hold Syria to account, according to half a dozen interviews with officials, diplomats, and investigators involved in eliminating Syria's weapons of mass destruction.\n\nA promise by Syria in 2013 to surrender its chemical weapons averted U.S. air strikes. Many diplomats and weapons inspectors now believe that promise was a ruse.\n\nThey suspect that President Bashar al-Assad's regime, while appearing to cooperate with international inspectors, secretly maintained or developed a new chemical weapons capability. They say Syria hampered inspectors, gave them incomplete or misleading information, and turned to using chlorine bombs when its supplies of other chemicals dwindled.\n\nThere have been dozens of chlorine attacks and at least one major sarin attack since 2013, causing more than 200 deaths and hundreds of injuries. International inspectors say there have been more than 100 reported incidents of chemical weapons being used in the past two years alone.\n\n\"The cooperation was reluctant in many aspects and that's a polite way of describing it,\" Angela Kane, who was the United Nation's high representative for disarmament until June 2015, told Reuters. \"Were they happily collaborating? No.\"\n\n\"What has really been shown is that there is no counter-measure, that basically the international community is just powerless,\" she added.\n\nThat frustration was echoed by U.N. war crimes investigator Carla del Ponte, who announced on Aug. 6 she was quitting a U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria. \"I have no power as long as the Security Council does nothing,\" she said. \"We are powerless, there is no justice for Syria.\"\n\nThe extent of Syria's reluctance to abandon chemical weapons has not previously been made public for fear of damaging international inspectors' relationship with Assad's administration and its backer, Russia, which is giving military support to Assad. Now investigators and diplomatic sources have provided telling details to Reuters:\n\n- Syria's declarations about the types and quantities of chemicals it possessed do not match evidence on the ground uncovered by inspectors. Its disclosures, for example, make no mention of sarin, yet there is strong evidence that sarin has been used in Syria, including this year.

The international experts wanted to examine the site, but were kept waiting outside in their car for around an hour, according to several people briefed on the visit.\n\nWhen they were finally let into the building, it was empty. They found no trace of banned chemicals.\n\n\"Look, there is nothing to see,\" said the general, known to the inspectors as Sharif, opening the door.\n\nSo why were the inspectors kept waiting? The Syrians said they were getting the necessary approval to let them in, but the inspectors had a different theory. They believed the Syrians were stalling while the place was cleaned out. It made no sense to the team that special approval was needed for them to enter an empty building.\n\nThe incident, which was not made public, is just one example of how Syrian authorities have hindered the work of inspectors and how the international community has failed to hold Syria to account, according to half a dozen interviews with officials, diplomats, and investigators involved in eliminating Syria's weapons of mass destruction.\n\nA promise by Syria in 2013 to surrender its chemical weapons averted U.S. air strikes. Many diplomats and weapons inspectors now believe that promise was a ruse.\n\nThey suspect that President Bashar al-Assad's regime, while appearing to cooperate with international inspectors, secretly maintained or developed a new chemical weapons capability. They say Syria hampered inspectors, gave them incomplete or misleading information, and turned to using chlorine bombs when its supplies of other chemicals dwindled.\n\nThere have been dozens of chlorine attacks and at least one major sarin attack since 2013, causing more than 200 deaths and hundreds of injuries. International inspectors say there have been more than 100 reported incidents of chemical weapons being used in the past two years alone.\n\n\"The cooperation was reluctant in many aspects and that's a polite way of describing it,\" Angela Kane, who was the United Nation's high representative for disarmament until June 2015, told Reuters. \"Were they happily collaborating? No.\"\n\n\"What has really been shown is that there is no counter-measure, that basically the international community is just powerless,\" she added.\n\nThat frustration was echoed by U.N. war crimes investigator Carla del Ponte, who announced on Aug. 6 she was quitting a U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria. \"I have no power as long as the Security Council does nothing,\" she said. \"We are powerless, there is no justice for Syria.\"\n\nThe extent of Syria's reluctance to abandon chemical weapons has not previously been made public for fear of damaging international inspectors' relationship with Assad's administration and its backer, Russia, which is giving military support to Assad. Now investigators and diplomatic sources have provided telling details to Reuters:\n\n- Syria's declarations about the types and quantities of chemicals it possessed do not match evidence on the ground uncovered by inspectors. Its disclosures, for example, make no mention of sarin, yet there is strong evidence that sarin has been used in Syria, including this year. Other chemicals found by inspectors but not reported by Syria include traces of nerve agent VX, the poison ricin and a chemical called hexamine, which is used to stabilise sarin.\n\n- Syria told inspectors in 2014-2015 that it had used 15 tonnes of nerve gas and 70 tonnes of sulphur mustard for research. Reuters has learned that inspectors believe those amounts are not \"scientifically credible.\" Only a fraction would be needed for research, two sources involved in inspections in Syria said.\n\n- At least 2,000 chemical bomb shells, which Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons and either used or destroyed, are unaccounted for, suggesting that they may still be in the hands of Syria's military.\n\n- In Damascus, witnesses with knowledge of the chemical weapons programme were instructed by Syrian military officials to alter their statements midway through interviews with inspectors, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international agency overseeing the removal and destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, conceded serious questions remain about the completeness and accuracy of Syria's disclosures.\n\n\"There are certainly some gaps, uncertainties, discrepancies,\" OPCW Director General Ahmet Uzumcu, a Turkish diplomat, told Reuters.\n\nBut he rejected criticism of his leadership by Kane and some other diplomats. Kane told Reuters that Uzumcu should have turned up the pressure on Syria over the gaps in its reporting and done more to support his inspectors. Uzumcu countered that it was not his job \"to ensure the full compliance\" of treaties on chemical weapons, saying that the OPCW was mandated to confirm use of chemical weapons but not to assign blame.\n\nSyria's deputy foreign minister, Faisal Meqdad, insisted that Syria was completely free of chemical weapons and defended the country's cooperation with international inspectors.\n\n\"I assure you that what was called the Syrian chemical weapons programme has ended, and has ended with no return. There are no more chemical weapons in Syria,\" he told Reuters in an interview.\n\nSharif did not respond to requests for comment about the incident at the warehouse.\n\nOn Aug. 21, 2013, hundreds of people died in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta, a district on the outskirts of Damascus. The colourless, odourless nerve agent causes people to suffocate within minutes if inhaled even in small amounts. Assad's forces were blamed by Western governments. He has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons and blames insurgents for the attack.\n\nIn the wake of the atrocity, the United States and Russia brokered a deal under which Assad's government agreed to eradicate its chemical weapons programme. As part of the deal, Syria joined the OPCW, based in the Hague, Netherlands, promising to open its borders to inspectors and disclose its entire programme - after previously denying it had any chemical weapons.\n\nSyria declared it had 1,300 tonnes of chemical weapons or industrial chemical stocks, precisely the amount that outside experts had estimated. In an OPCW-led operation, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, that stockpile was shipped overseas for destruction with the help of 30 countries, notably the United States.\n\nBut there were two significant problems. First, inspections did not go smoothly. Days after the Ghouta sarin attack, OPCW inspectors heading for the area came under sniper fire. They made it through to Ghouta eventually and were given just two hours by Syrian authorities to interview witnesses and take samples. The team confirmed that sarin had been used.\n\nAnd in May 2014 a joint United Nations-OPCW convoy was hit by explosives and AK-47 fire while attempting to get to the site of another chemical attack in the northern town of Kafr Zita. That mission was aborted. On the return journey some of the team were detained for 90 minutes by unidentified gunmen. Syria's foreign ministry issued a statement blaming terrorists for attacking the convoy.\n\nReuters was unable to determine exactly how many times the work of inspectors has been hampered, but Syrian tactics have included withholding visas, submitting large volumes of documents multiple times to bog down the process, last-minute restrictions on site inspections and coercing certain witnesses to change their stories during interviews, four diplomats and inspectors involved in the process told Reuters.\n\nThe OPCW team has carried out 18 site visits since 2013, but has now effectively given up because Syria has failed to provide sufficient or accurate information, these sources said.\n\nThe second problem was a switch of tactics by Assad's forces. While the United Nations and OPCW focused on ridding Syria of the stockpile it admitted having, Assad's forces began using new, crude chlorine bombs instead, according to two inspectors. As many as 100 chlorine barrel bombs have been dropped from helicopters since 2014, they said. Syria has denied using chlorine.\n\nAlthough less poisonous than nerve gas and widely available, chlorine's use as a weapon is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention that Syria signed when it joined the OPCW, an intergovernmental agency that works with the United Nations to implement the convention. If inhaled, chlorine gas turns into hydrochloric acid in the lungs and can kill by drowning victims in body fluids.\n\nA source involved in monitoring Syria's chemical weapons for the OPCW said Damascus began using chlorine as \"a weapon of terror\" to gain a battlefield advantage when one of its bases in Kafr Zita was threatened with being overrun in 2014.\n\n\"The base was surrounded by opposition. The government forces wanted to depopulate the area. That's why they started using chlorine,\" said the source.\n\nA senior official who has worked with United Nations and OPCW investigators said two helicopter squadrons dropped chlorine barrel bombs, drums filled with chlorine canisters, from two air bases. To produce such a quantity must have required technical staff and logistical support, suggesting the operation was overseen by senior commanders, the official said.\n\nThe introduction of a new type of chemical weapon came at an awkward time for the OPCW, said the source involved in studying Syria's chemical weapons for the weapons monitoring group. It was keen to remove Syria's declared stockpile and reluctant to start a probe into alleged government violations that could jeopardise Syrian cooperation. The goal of removing the stockpile, which Western governments feared could fall into the hands of Islamic State, took precedence over the chlorine attacks, the source said.\n\nOPCW head Uzumcu denied there had been a reluctance to investigate reports of chlorine attacks, pointing out that in 2014 he set up a fact finding mission to look into them. This mission was not tasked with assigning blame, however. It concluded that the use of chlorine was systematic and widespread.\n\nUzumcu said the team's conclusions were handed to the OPCW executive council. It condemned the use of chlorine and passed the findings to the United Nations. A spokesman for the United Nations said it was the role of the OPCW to determine whether or not a member state was in breach of the chemical weapons ban.\n\nKane, the former U.N. high representative for disarmament, told Reuters that Uzumcu should have tackled Syria over its lapses in reporting to the OPCW, including undeclared chemicals and a failure to report the government's Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which was, in effect, the programme's headquarters.\n\n\"Why, my God, three-and-a half years later, has more progress not been made in clearing up the inconsistencies? If I was the head of an organisation like that ... I would go to Damascus and I would confront these people,\" Kane said.\n\nUzumcu said the OPCW was constrained by its founding treaty, the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. The OPCW has no obligation to act when one of its members violates the convention, he said. Determining blame for the use of chemical weapons is the task of a separate United Nations-OPCW mission in Syria, the Joint Investigative Mechanism, established in 2015. A spokesman for the Joint Investigative Mechanism referred questions to the OPCW.\n\n\"The secretariat has fulfilled, accurately and entirely, the tasks they were asked to fulfil and will remain within our limitations as far as our mandate is concerned,\" Uzumcu said.\n\nHe said some states have suspicions that the Syrian government hid stocks of chemical precursors that might be used for the production of certain nerve agents, including sarin. But he said there was no conclusive evidence.\n\nUzumcu said he regretted that relations had broken down between Russia and the United States on the OPCW executive council, which has the power to impose restrictions on Syria's membership and report it to the U.N. Security Council for non-cooperation.\n\nUzumcu said his office was still seeking answers from the Assad administration about undeclared chemicals, aerial bombs and the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which has overseen Syria's chemical weapons since the 1970s. Syrian officials have maintained that no supporting documentation exists for the programme, which included dozens of storage, production and research facilities.\n\nThe Syrian crisis has had a profound effect on the way the OPCW operates. For two decades the organisation had reached consensus on most decisions, only calling on the 41-member executive council to vote on a handful of occasions. Syria marked a clear divide on the council.\n\nIn 2016, when an inquiry by the United Nations and OPCW found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks, the United States sought to impose sanctions on those responsible through the executive council, but then dropped the proposal, the details of which were not made public. A text drafted by Spain condemned the attacks but removed any reference to sanctions. It was supported by a majority, including Germany, France, the United States and Britain, but opposed by Russia, China, Iran and Sudan.\n\nThe United States has since placed sanctions on hundreds of Syrian officials it said were linked to the chemical weapons programme. President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian air base, but division on the OPCW governing body and at the United Nations has prevented collective action against the continuing attacks.\n\nWestern governments accused Moscow of trying to undermine investigations by the United Nations and OPCW in order to protect Assad; Syria says the inspection missions are being used by Western countries to force regime change.\n\nRussian officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFormer U.N. chief weapons inspector Ake Sellstrom, who is now chief scientist for the U.N.-OPCW mission, said it is critical that perpetrators of chemical attacks are put on trial to deter future use of weapons of mass destruction. His team should be reporting back to the U.N. by mid-October, he said.\n\nA key unsolved question is what happened to the 2,000 aerial bombs that Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons, a process that would be costly and time-consuming.\n\n\"To my knowledge, the Syrian government never furnished any details of where, when and how they changed the bombs' payload,\" said an OPCW-U.N. source, who took part in investigations in 2015-2016.

Its disclosures, for example, make no mention of sarin, yet there is strong evidence that sarin has been used in Syria, including this year.

The colourless, odourless nerve agent causes people to suffocate within minutes if inhaled even in small amounts. Assad's forces were blamed by Western governments. He has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons and blames insurgents for the attack.\n\nIn the wake of the atrocity, the United States and Russia brokered a deal under which Assad's government agreed to eradicate its chemical weapons programme. As part of the deal, Syria joined the OPCW, based in the Hague, Netherlands, promising to open its borders to inspectors and disclose its entire programme - after previously denying it had any chemical weapons.\n\nSyria declared it had 1,300 tonnes of chemical weapons or industrial chemical stocks, precisely the amount that outside experts had estimated. In an OPCW-led operation, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, that stockpile was shipped overseas for destruction with the help of 30 countries, notably the United States.\n\nBut there were two significant problems. First, inspections did not go smoothly. Days after the Ghouta sarin attack, OPCW inspectors heading for the area came under sniper fire. They made it through to Ghouta eventually and were given just two hours by Syrian authorities to interview witnesses and take samples. The team confirmed that sarin had been used.\n\nAnd in May 2014 a joint United Nations-OPCW convoy was hit by explosives and AK-47 fire while attempting to get to the site of another chemical attack in the northern town of Kafr Zita. That mission was aborted. On the return journey some of the team were detained for 90 minutes by unidentified gunmen. Syria's foreign ministry issued a statement blaming terrorists for attacking the convoy.\n\nReuters was unable to determine exactly how many times the work of inspectors has been hampered, but Syrian tactics have included withholding visas, submitting large volumes of documents multiple times to bog down the process, last-minute restrictions on site inspections and coercing certain witnesses to change their stories during interviews, four diplomats and inspectors involved in the process told Reuters.\n\nThe OPCW team has carried out 18 site visits since 2013, but has now effectively given up because Syria has failed to provide sufficient or accurate information, these sources said.\n\nThe second problem was a switch of tactics by Assad's forces. While the United Nations and OPCW focussed on ridding Syria of the stockpile it admitted having, Assad's forces began using new, crude chlorine bombs instead, according to two inspectors. As many as 100 chlorine barrel bombs have been dropped from helicopters since 2014, they said. Syria has denied using chlorine.\n\nAlthough less poisonous than nerve gas and widely available, chlorine's use as a weapon is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention that Syria signed when it joined the OPCW, an intergovernmental agency that works with the United Nations to implement the convention. If inhaled, chlorine gas turns into hydrochloric acid in the lungs and can kill by drowning victims in body fluids.\n\nA source involved in monitoring Syria's chemical weapons for the OPCW said Damascus began using chlorine as \"a weapon of terror\" to gain a battlefield advantage when one of its bases in Kafr Zita was threatened with being overrun in 2014.\n\n\"The base was surrounded by opposition. The government forces wanted to depopulate the area. That's why they started using chlorine,\" said the source.\n\nA senior official who has worked with United Nations and OPCW investigators said two helicopter squadrons dropped chlorine barrel bombs, drums filled with chlorine canisters, from two air bases. To produce such a quantity must have required technical staff and logistical support, suggesting the operation was overseen by senior commanders, the official said.\n\nThe introduction of a new type of chemical weapon came at an awkward time for the OPCW, said the source involved in studying Syria's chemical weapons for the weapons monitoring group. It was keen to remove Syria's declared stockpile and reluctant to start a probe into alleged government violations that could jeopardise Syrian cooperation. The goal of removing the stockpile, which Western governments feared could fall into the hands of Islamic State, took precedence over the chlorine attacks, the source said.\n\nOPCW head Uzumcu denied there had been a reluctance to investigate reports of chlorine attacks, pointing out that in 2014 he set up a fact finding mission to look into them. This mission was not tasked with assigning blame, however. It concluded that the use of chlorine was systematic and widespread.\n\nUzumcu said the team's conclusions were handed to the OPCW executive council. It condemned the use of chlorine and passed the findings to the United Nations. A spokesman for the United Nations said it was the role of the OPCW to determine whether or not a member state was in breach of the chemical weapons ban.\n\nKane, the former U.N. high representative for disarmament, told Reuters that Uzumcu should have tackled Syria over its lapses in reporting to the OPCW, including undeclared chemicals and a failure to report the government's Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which was, in effect, the programme's headquarters.\n\n\"Why, my God, three-and-a half years later, has more progress not been made in clearing up the inconsistencies? If I was the head of an organisation like that ... I would go to Damascus and I would confront these people,\" Kane said.\n\nUzumcu said the OPCW was constrained by its founding treaty, the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. The OPCW has no obligation to act when one of its members violates the convention, he said. Determining blame for the use of chemical weapons is the task of a separate United Nations-OPCW mission in Syria, the Joint Investigative Mechanism, established in 2015. A spokesman for the Joint Investigative Mechanism referred questions to the OPCW.\n\n\"The secretariat has fulfilled, accurately and entirely, the tasks they were asked to fulfil and will remain within our limitations as far as our mandate is concerned,\" Uzumcu said.\n\nHe said some states have suspicions that the Syrian government hid stocks of chemical precursors that might be used for the production of certain nerve agents, including sarin. But he said there was no conclusive evidence.\n\nUzumcu said he regretted that relations had broken down between Russia and the United States on the OPCW executive council, which has the power to impose restrictions on Syria's membership and report it to the U.N. Security Council for non-cooperation.\n\nUzumcu said his office was still seeking answers from the Assad administration about undeclared chemicals, aerial bombs and the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which has overseen Syria's chemical weapons since the 1970s. Syrian officials have maintained that no supporting documentation exists for the programme, which included dozens of storage, production and research facilities.\n\nPOLITICAL DEADLOCK\n\nThe Syrian crisis has had a profound effect on the way the OPCW operates. For two decades the organisation had reached consensus on most decisions, only calling on the 41-member executive council to vote on a handful of occasions. Syria marked a clear divide on the council.\n\nIn 2016, when an inquiry by the United Nations and OPCW found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks, the United States sought to impose sanctions on those responsible through the executive council, but then dropped the proposal, the details of which were not made public. A text drafted by Spain condemned the attacks but removed any reference to sanctions. It was supported by a majority, including Germany, France, the United States and Britain, but opposed by Russia, China, Iran and Sudan.\n\nThe United States has since placed sanctions on hundreds of Syrian officials it said were linked to the chemical weapons programme. President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian air base, but division on the OPCW governing body and at the United Nations has prevented collective action against the continuing attacks.\n\nWestern governments accused Moscow of trying to undermine investigations by the United Nations and OPCW in order to protect Assad; Syria says the inspection missions are being used by Western countries to force regime change.\n\nRussian officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSARIN FOUND\n\nFormer U.N. chief weapons inspector Ake Sellstrom, who is now chief scientist for the U.N.-OPCW mission, said it is critical that perpetrators of chemical attacks are put on trial to deter future use of weapons of mass destruction. His team should be reporting back to the U.N. by mid-October, he said.\n\nA key unsolved question is what happened to the 2,000 aerial bombs that Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons, a process that would be costly and time-consuming.\n\n\"To my knowledge, the Syrian government never furnished any details of where, when and how they changed the bombs' payload,\" said an OPCW-U.N. source, who took part in investigations in 2015-2016. He said there clearly was \"a real, high-level, command structure behind this.\"\n\nSyrian officials did not respond to requests for comment about the bombs.\n\nThe team is also examining the deaths of almost 100 people on April 4 when a gas attack hit Khan Sheikhoun, a town in the rebel-held province of Idlib near the Turkish border. Samples taken from people exposed to the chemicals and tested by the OPCW confirmed sarin use. Meqdad, Syria's deputy foreign minister, said in the interview that Syrian forces were not to blame, repeating earlier denials by Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem.\n\nSellstrom said the presence of sarin so long after Syria was supposed to have dismantled its chemical weapons programme posed difficult questions. \"Is there a hideout somewhere, or is there production somewhere and how much is available?\" he said, adding that the reported use of aerial bombs in Khan Sheikhoun could point to the Syrian forces keeping some strategic weapons as well.\n\nThe attack means either \"that someone can produce sarin today, or sarin has been hidden,\" Sellstrom said.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label":

The team confirmed that sarin had been used.\n\nAnd in May 2014 a joint United Nations-OPCW convoy was hit by explosives and AK-47 fire while attempting to get to the site of another chemical attack in the northern town of Kafr Zita. That mission was aborted. On the return journey some of the team were detained for 90 minutes by unidentified gunmen. Syria's foreign ministry issued a statement blaming terrorists for attacking the convoy.\n\nReuters was unable to determine exactly how many times the work of inspectors has been hampered, but Syrian tactics have included withholding visas, submitting large volumes of documents multiple times to bog down the process, last-minute restrictions on site inspections and coercing certain witnesses to change their stories during interviews, four diplomats and inspectors involved in the process told Reuters.\n\nThe OPCW team has carried out 18 site visits since 2013, but has now effectively given up because Syria has failed to provide sufficient or accurate information, these sources said.\n\nThe second problem was a switch of tactics by Assad's forces. While the United Nations and OPCW focused on ridding Syria of the stockpile it admitted having, Assad's forces began using new, crude chlorine bombs instead, according to two inspectors. As many as 100 chlorine barrel bombs have been dropped from helicopters since 2014, they said. Syria has denied using chlorine.\n\nAlthough less poisonous than nerve gas and widely available, chlorine's use as a weapon is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention that Syria signed when it joined the OPCW, an intergovernmental agency that works with the United Nations to implement the convention. If inhaled, chlorine gas turns into hydrochloric acid in the lungs and can kill by drowning victims in body fluids.\n\nA source involved in monitoring Syria's chemical weapons for the OPCW said Damascus began using chlorine as \"a weapon of terror\" to gain a battlefield advantage when one of its bases in Kafr Zita was threatened with being overrun in 2014.\n\n\"The base was surrounded by opposition. The government forces wanted to depopulate the area. That's why they started using chlorine,\" said the source.\n\nA senior official who has worked with United Nations and OPCW investigators said two helicopter squadrons dropped chlorine barrel bombs, drums filled with chlorine canisters, from two air bases. To produce such a quantity must have required technical staff and logistical support, suggesting the operation was overseen by senior commanders, the official said.\n\nThe introduction of a new type of chemical weapon came at an awkward time for the OPCW, said the source involved in studying Syria's chemical weapons for the weapons monitoring group. It was keen to remove Syria's declared stockpile and reluctant to start a probe into alleged government violations that could jeopardise Syrian cooperation. The goal of removing the stockpile, which Western governments feared could fall into the hands of Islamic State, took precedence over the chlorine attacks, the source said.\n\nOPCW head Uzumcu denied there had been a reluctance to investigate reports of chlorine attacks, pointing out that in 2014 he set up a fact finding mission to look into them. This mission was not tasked with assigning blame, however. It concluded that the use of chlorine was systematic and widespread.\n\nUzumcu said the team's conclusions were handed to the OPCW executive council. It condemned the use of chlorine and passed the findings to the United Nations. A spokesman for the United Nations said it was the role of the OPCW to determine whether or not a member state was in breach of the chemical weapons ban.\n\nKane, the former U.N. high representative for disarmament, told Reuters that Uzumcu should have tackled Syria over its lapses in reporting to the OPCW, including undeclared chemicals and a failure to report the government's Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which was, in effect, the programme's headquarters.\n\n\"Why, my God, three-and-a half years later, has more progress not been made in clearing up the inconsistencies? If I was the head of an organisation like that ... I would go to Damascus and I would confront these people,\" Kane said.\n\nUzumcu said the OPCW was constrained by its founding treaty, the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. The OPCW has no obligation to act when one of its members violates the convention, he said. Determining blame for the use of chemical weapons is the task of a separate United Nations-OPCW mission in Syria, the Joint Investigative Mechanism, established in 2015. A spokesman for the Joint Investigative Mechanism referred questions to the OPCW.\n\n\"The secretariat has fulfilled, accurately and entirely, the tasks they were asked to fulfil and will remain within our limitations as far as our mandate is concerned,\" Uzumcu said.\n\nHe said some states have suspicions that the Syrian government hid stocks of chemical precursors that might be used for the production of certain nerve agents, including sarin. But he said there was no conclusive evidence.\n\nUzumcu said he regretted that relations had broken down between Russia and the United States on the OPCW executive council, which has the power to impose restrictions on Syria's membership and report it to the U.N. Security Council for non-cooperation.\n\nUzumcu said his office was still seeking answers from the Assad administration about undeclared chemicals, aerial bombs and the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which has overseen Syria's chemical weapons since the 1970s. Syrian officials have maintained that no supporting documentation exists for the programme, which included dozens of storage, production and research facilities.\n\nAlso Watch:\n\nPOLITICAL DEADLOCK\n\nThe Syrian crisis has had a profound effect on the way the OPCW operates. For two decades the organisation had reached consensus on most decisions, only calling on the 41-member executive council to vote on a handful of occasions. Syria marked a clear divide on the council.\n\nIn 2016, when an inquiry by the United Nations and OPCW found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks, the United States sought to impose sanctions on those responsible through the executive council, but then dropped the proposal, the details of which were not made public. A text drafted by Spain condemned the attacks but removed any reference to sanctions. It was supported by a majority, including Germany, France, the United States and Britain, but opposed by Russia, China, Iran and Sudan.\n\nThe United States has since placed sanctions on hundreds of Syrian officials it said were linked to the chemical weapons programme. President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian air base, but division on the OPCW governing body and at the United Nations has prevented collective action against the continuing attacks.\n\nWestern governments accused Moscow of trying to undermine investigations by the United Nations and OPCW in order to protect Assad; Syria says the inspection missions are being used by Western countries to force regime change.\n\nRussian officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSARIN FOUND\n\nFormer U.N. chief weapons inspector Ake Sellstrom, who is now chief scientist for the U.N.-OPCW mission, said it is critical that perpetrators of chemical attacks are put on trial to deter future use of weapons of mass destruction. His team should be reporting back to the U.N. by mid-October, he said.\n\nA key unsolved question is what happened to the 2,000 aerial bombs that Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons, a process that would be costly and time-consuming.\n\n\"To my knowledge, the Syrian government never furnished any details of where, when and how they changed the bombs' payload,\" said an OPCW-U.N. source, who took part in investigations in 2015-2016. He said there clearly was \"a real, high-level, command structure behind this.\"\n\nSyrian officials did not respond to requests for comment about the bombs.\n\nThe team is also examining the deaths of almost 100 people on April 4 when a gas attack hit Khan Sheikhoun, a town in the rebel-held province of Idlib near the Turkish border. Samples taken from people exposed to the chemicals and tested by the OPCW confirmed sarin use. Meqdad, Syria's deputy foreign minister, said in the interview that Syrian forces were not to blame, repeating earlier denials by Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem.\n\nSellstrom said the presence of sarin so long after Syria was supposed to have dismantled its chemical weapons programme posed difficult questions. \"Is there a hideout somewhere, or is there production somewhere and how much is available?\" he said, adding that the reported use of aerial bombs in Khan Sheikhoun could point to the Syrian forces keeping some strategic weapons as well.\n\nThe attack means either \"that someone can produce sarin today, or sarin has been hidden,\" Sellstrom said.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label":

The international experts wanted to examine the site, but were kept waiting outside in their car for around an hour, according to several people briefed on the visit.\n\nWhen they were finally let into the building, it was empty. They found no trace of banned chemicals.\n\n\"Look, there is nothing to see,\" said the general, known to the inspectors as Sharif, opening the door.\n\nSo why were the inspectors kept waiting? The Syrians said they were getting the necessary approval to let them in, but the inspectors had a different theory. They believed the Syrians were stalling while the place was cleaned out. It made no sense to the team that special approval was needed for them to enter an empty building.\n\nThe incident, which was not made public, is just one example of how Syrian authorities have hindered the work of inspectors and how the international community has failed to hold Syria to account, according to half a dozen interviews with officials, diplomats, and investigators involved in eliminating Syria's weapons of mass destruction.\n\nA promise by Syria in 2013 to surrender its chemical weapons averted U.S. air strikes. Many diplomats and weapons inspectors now believe that promise was a ruse.\n\nThey suspect that President Bashar al-Assad's regime, while appearing to cooperate with international inspectors, secretly maintained or developed a new chemical weapons capability. They say Syria hampered inspectors, gave them incomplete or misleading information, and turned to using chlorine bombs when its supplies of other chemicals dwindled.\n\nThere have been dozens of chlorine attacks and at least one major sarin attack since 2013, causing more than 200 deaths and hundreds of injuries. International inspectors say there have been more than 100 reported incidents of chemical weapons being used in the past two years alone.\n\n\"The cooperation was reluctant in many aspects and that's a polite way of describing it,\" Angela Kane, who was the United Nation's high representative for disarmament until June 2015, said. \"Were they happily collaborating? No.\" \"What has really been shown is that there is no counter-measure, that basically the international community is just powerless,\" she added.\n\nThat frustration was echoed by U.N. war crimes investigator Carla del Ponte, who announced on Aug. 6 she was quitting a U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria. \"I have no power as long as the Security Council does nothing,\" she said. \"We are powerless, there is no justice for Syria.\" The extent of Syria's reluctance to abandon chemical weapons has not previously been made public for fear of damaging international inspectors' relationship with Assad's administration and its backer, Russia, which is giving military support to Assad. Now investigators and diplomatic sources have provided telling details: - Syria's declarations about the types and quantities of chemicals it possessed do not match evidence on the ground uncovered by inspectors. Its disclosures, for example, make no mention of sarin, yet there is strong evidence that sarin has been used in Syria, including this year. Other chemicals found by inspectors but not reported by Syria include traces of nerve agent VX, the poison ricin and a chemical called hexamine, which is used to stabilise sarin.\n\n- Syria told inspectors in 2014-2015 that it had used 15 tonnes of nerve gas and 70 tonnes of sulphur mustard for research. Inspectors believe those amounts are not \"scientifically credible.\" Only a fraction would be needed for research, two sources involved in inspections in Syria said.\n\n- At least 2,000 chemical bomb shells, which Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons and either used or destroyed, are unaccounted for, suggesting that they may still be in the hands of Syria's military.\n\n- In Damascus, witnesses with knowledge of the chemical weapons programme were instructed by Syrian military officials to alter their statements midway through interviews with inspectors, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.\n\nThe head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international agency overseeing the removal and destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, conceded serious questions remain about the completeness and accuracy of Syria's disclosures.\n\n\"There are certainly some gaps, uncertainties, discrepancies,\" OPCW Director General Ahmet Uzumcu, a Turkish diplomat, said.\n\nBut he rejected criticism of his leadership by Kane and some other diplomats. Kane said that Uzumcu should have turned up the pressure on Syria over the gaps in its reporting and done more to support his inspectors. Uzumcu countered that it was not his job \"to ensure the full compliance\" of treaties on chemical weapons, saying that the OPCW was mandated to confirm use of chemical weapons but not to assign blame.\n\nSyria's deputy foreign minister, Faisal Meqdad, insisted that Syria was completely free of chemical weapons and defended the country's cooperation with international inspectors.\n\n\"I assure you that what was called the Syrian chemical weapons programme has ended, and has ended with no return. There are no more chemical weapons in Syria,\" he said in an interview.\n\nSharif did not respond to requests for comment about the incident at the warehouse.\n\n- SARIN ATTACK -\n\nOn Aug. 21, 2013, hundreds of people died in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta, a district on the outskirts of Damascus. The colourless, odourless nerve agent causes people to suffocate within minutes if inhaled even in small amounts. Assad's forces were blamed by Western governments. He has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons and blames insurgents for the attack.\n\nIn the wake of the atrocity, the United States and Russia brokered a deal under which Assad's government agreed to eradicate its chemical weapons programme. As part of the deal, Syria joined the OPCW, based in the Hague, Netherlands, promising to open its borders to inspectors and disclose its entire programme - after previously denying it had any chemical weapons.\n\nSyria declared it had 1,300 tonnes of chemical weapons or industrial chemical stocks, precisely the amount that outside experts had estimated. In an OPCW-led operation, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, that stockpile was shipped overseas for destruction with the help of 30 countries, notably the United States.\n\nBut there were two significant problems. First, inspections did not go smoothly. Days after the Ghouta sarin attack, OPCW inspectors heading for the area came under sniper fire. They made it through to Ghouta eventually and were given just two hours by Syrian authorities to interview witnesses and take samples. The team confirmed that sarin had been used.\n\nAnd in May 2014 a joint United Nations-OPCW convoy was hit by explosives and AK-47 fire while attempting to get to the site of another chemical attack in the northern town of Kafr Zita. That mission was aborted. On the return journey some of the team were detained for 90 minutes by unidentified gunmen. Syria's foreign ministry issued a statement blaming terrorists for attacking the convoy.\n\nIt is unknown exactly how many times the work of inspectors has been hampered, but Syrian tactics have included withholding visas, submitting large volumes of documents multiple times to bog down the process, last-minute restrictions on site inspections and coercing certain witnesses to change their stories during interviews, four diplomats and inspectors involved in the process said.\n\nThe OPCW team has carried out 18 site visits since 2013, but has now effectively given up because Syria has failed to provide sufficient or accurate information, these sources said.\n\nThe second problem was a switch of tactics by Assad's forces.

SANA/Handout via REUTERS\n\nNearly four years after President Bashar al-Assad's government promised to get rid of its stockpile of chemical weapons, gas attacks are still commonplace. What went wrong?\n\nTHE HAGUE - In the spring of 2015 a Syrian major general escorted a small team of chemical weapons inspectors to a warehouse outside the Syrian capital Damascus. The international experts wanted to examine the site, but were kept waiting outside in their car for around an hour, according to several people briefed on the visit.\n\nWhen they were finally let into the building, it was empty. They found no trace of banned chemicals.\n\n\"Look, there is nothing to see,\" said the general, known to the inspectors as Sharif, opening the door.\n\nSo why were the inspectors kept waiting? The Syrians said they were getting the necessary approval to let them in, but the inspectors had a different theory. They believed the Syrians were stalling while the place was cleaned out. It made no sense to the team that special approval was needed for them to enter an empty building.\n\nThe incident, which was not made public, is just one example of how Syrian authorities have hindered the work of inspectors and how the international community has failed to hold Syria to account, according to half a dozen interviews with officials, diplomats, and investigators involved in eliminating Syria's weapons of mass destruction.\n\nA promise by Syria in 2013 to surrender its chemical weapons averted U.S. air strikes. Many diplomats and weapons inspectors now believe that promise was a ruse.\n\nThey suspect that President Bashar al-Assad's regime, while appearing to cooperate with international inspectors, secretly maintained or developed a new chemical weapons capability. They say Syria hampered inspectors, gave them incomplete or misleading information, and turned to using chlorine bombs when its supplies of other chemicals dwindled.\n\nThere have been dozens of chlorine attacks and at least one major sarin attack since 2013, causing more than 200 deaths and hundreds of injuries. International inspectors say there have been more than 100 reported incidents of chemical weapons being used in the past two years alone.\n\n\"The cooperation was reluctant in many aspects and that's a polite way of describing it,\" Angela Kane, who was the United Nation's high representative for disarmament until June 2015, told Reuters. \"Were they happily collaborating? No.\"\n\n\"What has really been shown is that there is no counter-measure, that basically the international community is just powerless,\" she added.\n\nThat frustration was echoed by U.N. war crimes investigator Carla del Ponte, who announced on Aug. 6 she was quitting a U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria. \"I have no power as long as the Security Council does nothing,\" she said. \"We are powerless, there is no justice for Syria.\"\n\nThe extent of Syria's reluctance to abandon chemical weapons has not previously been made public for fear of damaging international inspectors' relationship with Assad's administration and its backer, Russia, which is giving military support to Assad. Now investigators and diplomatic sources have provided telling details to Reuters\n\n- Syria's declarations about the types and quantities of chemicals it possessed do not match evidence on the ground uncovered by inspectors. Its disclosures, for example, make no mention of sarin, yet there is strong evidence that sarin has been used in Syria, including this year. Other chemicals found by inspectors but not reported by Syria include traces of nerve agent VX, the poison ricin and a chemical called hexamine, which is used to stabilise sarin.\n\n- Syria told inspectors in 2014-2015 that it had used 15 tonnes of nerve gas and 70 tonnes of sulphur mustard for research. Reuters has learned that inspectors believe those amounts are not \"scientifically credible.\" Only a fraction would be needed for research, two sources involved in inspections in Syria said.\n\nSUFFERING: The aftermath of a chlorine gas attack on Kansafra village in May, 2015. REUTERS/Abed Kontar\n\n\"Why, my God, three-and-a-half years later, has more progress not been made in clearing up the inconsistencies? If I was the head of an organisation like that, I would go to Damascus and I would confront these people.\"\n\nAngela Kane, former U.N. high representative for disarmament\n\n- At least 2,000 chemical bomb shells, which Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons and either used or destroyed, are unaccounted for, suggesting that they may still be in the hands of Syria's military.\n\n- In Damascus, witnesses with knowledge of the chemical weapons programme were instructed by Syrian military officials to alter their statements midway through interviews with inspectors, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international agency overseeing the removal and destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, conceded serious questions remain about the completeness and accuracy of Syria's disclosures.\n\n\"There are certainly some gaps, uncertainties, discrepancies,\" OPCW Director General Ahmet Uzumcu, a Turkish diplomat, told Reuters.\n\nBut he rejected criticism of his leadership by Kane and some other diplomats. Kane told Reuters that Uzumcu should have turned up the pressure on Syria over the gaps in its reporting and done more to support his inspectors. Uzumcu countered that it was not his job \"to ensure the full compliance\" of treaties on chemical weapons, saying that the OPCW was mandated to confirm use of chemical weapons but not to assign blame.\n\nSyria's deputy foreign minister, Faisal Meqdad, insisted that Syria was completely free of chemical weapons and defended the country's cooperation with international inspectors.\n\n\"I assure you that what was called the Syrian chemical weapons programme has ended, and has ended with no return. There are no more chemical weapons in Syria,\" he told Reuters in an interview.\n\nSharif did not respond to requests for comment about the incident at the warehouse.\n\nSARIN ATTACK\n\nOn Aug. 21, 2013, hundreds of people died in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta, a district on the outskirts of Damascus. The colourless, odourless nerve agent causes people to suffocate within minutes if inhaled even in small amounts. Assad's forces were blamed by Western governments. He has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons and blames insurgents for the attack.\n\nUNDER PRESSURE: Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Director General Ahmet Uzumcu has rejected criticism of his leadership. It is not the OPCW's job to assign blame, he says. REUTERS/Michael Kooren\n\n\"The secretariat has fulfilled, accurately and entirely, the tasks they were asked to fulfil.\"\n\nAhmet Uzumcu, director general of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\n\nIn the wake of the atrocity, the United States and Russia brokered a deal under which Assad's government agreed to eradicate its chemical weapons programme. As part of the deal, Syria joined the OPCW, based in the Hague, Netherlands, promising to open its borders to inspectors and disclose its entire programme - after previously denying it had any chemical weapons.\n\nSyria declared it had 1,300 tonnes of chemical weapons or industrial chemical stocks, precisely the amount that outside experts had estimated. In an OPCW-led operation, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, that stockpile was shipped overseas for destruction with the help of 30 countries, notably the United States.\n\nBut there were two significant problems. First, inspections did not go smoothly. Days after the Ghouta sarin attack, OPCW inspectors heading for the area came under sniper fire. They made it through to Ghouta eventually and were given just two hours by Syrian authorities to interview witnesses and take samples. The team confirmed that sarin had been used.\n\nAnd in May 2014 a joint United Nations-OPCW convoy was hit by explosives and AK-47 fire while attempting to get to the site of another chemical attack in the northern town of Kafr Zita. That mission was aborted. On the return journey some of the team were detained for 90 minutes by unidentified gunmen. Syria's foreign ministry issued a statement blaming terrorists for attacking the convoy.\n\nReuters was unable to determine exactly how many times the work of inspectors has been hampered, but Syrian tactics have included withholding visas, submitting large volumes of documents multiple times to bog down the process, last-minute restrictions on site inspections and coercing certain witnesses to change their stories during interviews, four diplomats and inspectors involved in the process told Reuters.\n\nAnthony Deutsch on how he uncovered the problems facing weapons inspectors in Syria\n\nThe OPCW team has carried out 18 site visits since 2013, but has now effectively given up because Syria has failed to provide sufficient or accurate information, these sources said.\n\nThe second problem was a switch of tactics by Assad's forces. While the United Nations and OPCW focused on ridding Syria of the stockpile it admitted having, Assad's forces began using new, crude chlorine bombs instead, according to two inspectors. As many as 100 chlorine barrel bombs have been dropped from helicopters since 2014, they said. Syria has denied using chlorine.\n\nAlthough less poisonous than nerve gas and widely available, chlorine's use as a weapon is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention that Syria signed when it joined the OPCW, an intergovernmental agency that works with the United Nations to implement the convention. If inhaled, chlorine gas turns into hydrochloric acid in the lungs and can kill by drowning victims in body fluids.\n\nA source involved in monitoring Syria's chemical weapons for the OPCW said Damascus began using chlorine as \"a weapon of terror\" to gain a battlefield advantage when one of its bases in Kafr Zita was threatened with being overrun in 2014.\n\n\"The base was surrounded by opposition. The government forces wanted to depopulate the area. That's why they started using chlorine,\" said the source.\n\nA senior official who has worked with United Nations and OPCW investigators said two helicopter squadrons dropped chlorine barrel bombs, drums filled with chlorine canisters, from two air bases. To produce such a quantity must have required technical staff and logistical support, suggesting the operation was overseen by senior commanders, the official said.\n\nThe introduction of a new type of chemical weapon came at an awkward time for the OPCW, said the source involved in studying Syria's chemical weapons for the weapons monitoring group. It was keen to remove Syria's declared stockpile and reluctant to start a probe into alleged government violations that could jeopardise Syrian cooperation. The goal of removing the stockpile, which Western governments feared could fall into the hands of Islamic State, took precedence over the chlorine attacks, the source said.\n\nOPCW head Uzumcu denied there had been a reluctance to investigate reports of chlorine attacks, pointing out that in 2014 he set up a fact finding mission to look into them. This mission was not tasked with assigning blame, however. It concluded that the use of chlorine was systematic and widespread.\n\nUzumcu said the team's conclusions were handed to the OPCW executive council. It condemned the use of chlorine and passed the findings to the United Nations. A spokesman for the United Nations said it was the role of the OPCW to determine whether or not a member state was in breach of the chemical weapons ban.\n\nKane, the former U.N. high representative for disarmament, told Reuters that Uzumcu should have tackled Syria over its lapses in reporting to the OPCW, including undeclared chemicals and a failure to report the government's Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which was, in effect, the programme's headquarters.\n\n\"Why, my God, three-and-a half years later, has more progress not been made in clearing up the inconsistencies? If I was the head of an organisation like that ... I would go to Damascus and I would confront these people,\" Kane said.\n\nUzumcu said the OPCW was constrained by its founding treaty, the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. The OPCW has no obligation to act when one of its members violates the convention, he said. Determining blame for the use of chemical weapons is the task of a separate United Nations-OPCW mission in Syria, the Joint Investigative Mechanism, established in 2015. A spokesman for the Joint Investigative Mechanism referred questions to the OPCW.\n\n\"The secretariat has fulfilled, accurately and entirely, the tasks they were asked to fulfil and will remain within our limitations as far as our mandate is concerned,\" Uzumcu said.\n\nHe said some states have suspicions that the Syrian government hid stocks of chemical precursors that might be used for the production of certain nerve agents, including sarin. But he said there was no conclusive evidence.\n\nUzumcu said he regretted that relations had broken down between Russia and the United States on the OPCW executive council, which has the power to impose restrictions on Syria's membership and report it to the U.N. Security Council for non-cooperation.\n\nUzumcu said his office was still seeking answers from the Assad administration about undeclared chemicals, aerial bombs and the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which has overseen Syria's chemical weapons since the 1970s. Syrian officials have maintained that no supporting documentation exists for the programme, which included dozens of storage, production and research facilities.\n\nPOLITICAL DEADLOCK\n\nThe Syrian crisis has had a profound effect on the way the OPCW operates. For two decades the organisation had reached consensus on most decisions, only calling on the 41-member executive council to vote on a handful of occasions. Syria marked a clear divide on the council.\n\nIn 2016, when an inquiry by the United Nations and OPCW found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks, the United States sought to impose sanctions on those responsible through the executive council, but then dropped the proposal, the details of which were not made public. A text drafted by Spain condemned the attacks but removed any reference to sanctions. It was supported by a majority, including Germany, France, the United States and Britain, but opposed by Russia, China, Iran and Sudan.\n\nThe United States has since placed sanctions on hundreds of Syrian officials it said were linked to the chemical weapons programme. President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian air base, but division on the OPCW governing body and at the United Nations has prevented collective action against the continuing attacks.\n\nWestern governments accused Moscow of trying to undermine investigations by the United Nations and OPCW in order to protect Assad; Syria says the inspection missions are being used by Western countries to force regime change.\n\nRussian officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSARIN FOUND\n\nFormer U.N. chief weapons inspector Ake Sellstrom, who is now chief scientist for the U.N.-OPCW mission, said it is critical that perpetrators of chemical attacks are put on trial to deter future use of weapons of mass destruction. His team should be reporting back to the U.N. by mid-October, he said.\n\nA key unsolved question is what happened to the 2,000 aerial bombs that Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons, a process that would be costly and time-consuming.\n\nREUTERS INVESTIGATES\n\n\"To my knowledge, the Syrian government never furnished any details of where, when and how they changed the bombs' payload,\" said an OPCW-U.N. source, who took part in investigations in 2015-2016. He said there clearly was \"a real, high-level, command structure behind this.\"\n\nSyrian officials did not respond to requests for comment about the bombs.\n\nThe team is also examining the deaths of almost 100 people on April 4 when a gas attack hit Khan Sheikhoun, a town in the rebel-held province of Idlib near the Turkish border. Samples taken from people exposed to the chemicals and tested by the OPCW confirmed sarin use. Meqdad, Syria's deputy foreign minister, said in the interview Syrian forces were not to blame, repeating earlier denials by Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem.\n\nSellstrom said the presence of sarin so long after Syria was supposed to have dismantled its chemical weapons programme posed difficult questions. \"Is there a hideout somewhere, or is there production somewhere and how much is available?\" he said, adding that the reported use of aerial bombs in Khan Sheikhoun could point to the Syrian forces keeping some strategic weapons as well.\n\nThe attack means either \"that someone can produce sarin today, or sarin has been hidden,\" Sellstrom said.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label":

The Syrians said they were getting the necessary approval to let them in, but the inspectors had a different theory. They believed the Syrians were stalling while the place was cleaned out. It made no sense to the team that special approval was needed for them to enter an empty building.\n\nThe incident, which was not made public, is just one example of how Syrian authorities have hindered the work of inspectors and how the international community has failed to hold Syria to account, according to half a dozen interviews with officials, diplomats, and investigators involved in eliminating Syria's weapons of mass destruction.\n\nA promise by Syria in 2013 to surrender its chemical weapons averted U.S. air strikes. Many diplomats and weapons inspectors now believe that promise was a ruse.\n\nThey suspect that President Bashar al-Assad's regime, while appearing to cooperate with international inspectors, secretly maintained or developed a new chemical weapons capability. They say Syria hampered inspectors, gave them incomplete or misleading information, and turned to using chlorine bombs when its supplies of other chemicals dwindled.\n\nThere have been dozens of chlorine attacks and at least one major sarin attack since 2013, causing more than 200 deaths and hundreds of injuries. International inspectors say there have been more than 100 reported incidents of chemical weapons being used in the past two years alone.\n\n\"The cooperation was reluctant in many aspects and that's a polite way of describing it,\" Angela Kane, who was the United Nation's high representative for disarmament until June 2015, told Reuters. \"Were they happily collaborating? No.\"\n\n\"What has really been shown is that there is no counter-measure, that basically the international community is just powerless,\" she added.\n\nThat frustration was echoed by U.N. war crimes investigator Carla del Ponte, who announced on Aug. 6 she was quitting a U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria. \"I have no power as long as the Security Council does nothing,\" she said. \"We are powerless, there is no justice for Syria.\"\n\nThe extent of Syria's reluctance to abandon chemical weapons has not previously been made public for fear of damaging international inspectors' relationship with Assad's administration and its backer, Russia, which is giving military support to Assad. Now investigators and diplomatic sources have provided telling details to Reuters:\n\n- Syria's declarations about the types and quantities of chemicals it possessed do not match evidence on the ground uncovered by inspectors. Its disclosures, for example, make no mention of sarin, yet there is strong evidence that sarin has been used in Syria, including this year. Other chemicals found by inspectors but not reported by Syria include traces of nerve agent VX, the poison ricin and a chemical called hexamine, which is used to stabilize sarin.\n\n- Syria told inspectors in 2014-2015 that it had used 15 tonnes of nerve gas and 70 tonnes of sulphur mustard for research. Reuters has learned that inspectors believe those amounts are not \"scientifically credible.\" Only a fraction would be needed for research, two sources involved in inspections in Syria said.\n\n- At least 2,000 chemical bomb shells, which Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons and either used or destroyed, are unaccounted for, suggesting that they may still be in the hands of Syria's military.\n\n- In Damascus, witnesses with knowledge of the chemical weapons program were instructed by Syrian military officials to alter their statements midway through interviews with inspectors, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the international agency overseeing the removal and destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, conceded serious questions remain about the completeness and accuracy of Syria's disclosures.\n\n\"There are certainly some gaps, uncertainties, discrepancies,\" OPCW Director General Ahmet Uzumcu, a Turkish diplomat, told Reuters.\n\nBut he rejected criticism of his leadership by Kane and some other diplomats. Kane told Reuters that Uzumcu should have turned up the pressure on Syria over the gaps in its reporting and done more to support his inspectors. Uzumcu countered that it was not his job \"to ensure the full compliance\" of treaties on chemical weapons, saying that the OPCW was mandated to confirm use of chemical weapons but not to assign blame.\n\nSyria's deputy foreign minister, Faisal Meqdad, insisted that Syria was completely free of chemical weapons and defended the country's cooperation with international inspectors.\n\n\"I assure you that what was called the Syrian chemical weapons program has ended, and has ended with no return. There are no more chemical weapons in Syria,\" he told Reuters in an interview.\n\nSharif did not respond to requests for comment about the incident at the warehouse.\n\nSarin Attack\n\nOn Aug. 21, 2013, hundreds of people died in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta, a district on the outskirts of Damascus. The colorless, odorless nerve agent causes people to suffocate within minutes if inhaled even in small amounts. Assad's forces were blamed by Western governments. He has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons and blames insurgents for the attack.\n\nIn the wake of the atrocity, the United States and Russia brokered a deal under which Assad's government agreed to eradicate its chemical weapons program. As part of the deal, Syria joined the OPCW, based in the Hague, Netherlands, promising to open its borders to inspectors and disclose its entire program - after previously denying it had any chemical weapons.\n\nSyria declared it had 1,300 tonnes of chemical weapons or industrial chemical stocks, precisely the amount that outside experts had estimated. In an OPCW-led operation, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, that stockpile was shipped overseas for destruction with the help of 30 countries, notably the United States.\n\nBut there were two significant problems. First, inspections did not go smoothly. Days after the Ghouta sarin attack, OPCW inspectors heading for the area came under sniper fire. They made it through to Ghouta eventually and were given just two hours by Syrian authorities to interview witnesses and take samples. The team confirmed that sarin had been used.\n\nAnd in May 2014 a joint United Nations-OPCW convoy was hit by explosives and AK-47 fire while attempting to get to the site of another chemical attack in the northern town of Kafr Zita. That mission was aborted. On the return journey some of the team were detained for 90 minutes by unidentified gunmen. Syria's foreign ministry issued a statement blaming terrorists for attacking the convoy.\n\nReuters was unable to determine exactly how many times the work of inspectors has been hampered, but Syrian tactics have included withholding visas, submitting large volumes of documents multiple times to bog down the process, last-minute restrictions on site inspections and coercing certain witnesses to change their stories during interviews, four diplomats and inspectors involved in the process told Reuters.\n\nThe OPCW team has carried out 18 site visits since 2013, but has now effectively given up because Syria has failed to provide sufficient or accurate information, these sources said.\n\nThe second problem was a switch of tactics by Assad's forces. While the United Nations and OPCW focused on ridding Syria of the stockpile it admitted having, Assad's forces began using new, crude chlorine bombs instead, according to two inspectors. As many as 100 chlorine barrel bombs have been dropped from helicopters since 2014, they said. Syria has denied using chlorine.\n\nAlthough less poisonous than nerve gas and widely available, chlorine's use as a weapon is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention that Syria signed when it joined the OPCW, an intergovernmental agency that works with the United Nations to implement the convention. If inhaled, chlorine gas turns into hydrochloric acid in the lungs and can kill by drowning victims in body fluids.\n\nA source involved in monitoring Syria's chemical weapons for the OPCW said Damascus began using chlorine as \"a weapon of terror\" to gain a battlefield advantage when one of its bases in Kafr Zita was threatened with being overrun in 2014.\n\n\"The base was surrounded by opposition. The government forces wanted to depopulate the area. That's why they started using chlorine,\" said the source.\n\nA senior official who has worked with United Nations and OPCW investigators said two helicopter squadrons dropped chlorine barrel bombs, drums filled with chlorine canisters, from two air bases. To produce such a quantity must have required technical staff and logistical support, suggesting the operation was overseen by senior commanders, the official said.\n\nThe introduction of a new type of chemical weapon came at an awkward time for the OPCW, said the source involved in studying Syria's chemical weapons for the weapons monitoring group. It was keen to remove Syria's declared stockpile and reluctant to start a probe into alleged government violations that could jeopardize Syrian cooperation. The goal of removing the stockpile, which Western governments feared could fall into the hands of Islamic State, took precedence over the chlorine attacks, the source said.\n\nOPCW head Uzumcu denied there had been a reluctance to investigate reports of chlorine attacks, pointing out that in 2014 he set up a fact finding mission to look into them. This mission was not tasked with assigning blame, however. It concluded that the use of chlorine was systematic and widespread.\n\nUzumcu said the team's conclusions were handed to the OPCW executive council. It condemned the use of chlorine and passed the findings to the United Nations. A spokesman for the United Nations said it was the role of the OPCW to determine whether or not a member state was in breach of the chemical weapons ban.\n\nKane, the former U.N. high representative for disarmament, told Reuters that Uzumcu should have tackled Syria over its lapses in reporting to the OPCW, including undeclared chemicals and a failure to report the government's Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which was, in effect, the program's headquarters.\n\n\"Why, my God, three-and-a half years later, has more progress not been made in clearing up the inconsistencies? If I was the head of an organization like that ... I would go to Damascus and I would confront these people,\" Kane said.\n\nUzumcu said the OPCW was constrained by its founding treaty, the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. The OPCW has no obligation to act when one of its members violates the convention, he said. Determining blame for the use of chemical weapons is the task of a separate United Nations-OPCW mission in Syria, the Joint Investigative Mechanism, established in 2015. A spokesman for the Joint Investigative Mechanism referred questions to the OPCW.\n\n\"The secretariat has fulfilled, accurately and entirely, the tasks they were asked to fulfil and will remain within our limitations as far as our mandate is concerned,\" Uzumcu said.\n\nHe said some states have suspicions that the Syrian government hid stocks of chemical precursors that might be used for the production of certain nerve agents, including sarin. But he said there was no conclusive evidence.\n\nUzumcu said he regretted that relations had broken down between Russia and the United States on the OPCW executive council, which has the power to impose restrictions on Syria's membership and report it to the U.N. Security Council for non-cooperation.\n\nUzumcu said his office was still seeking answers from the Assad administration about undeclared chemicals, aerial bombs and the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which has overseen Syria's chemical weapons since the 1970s. Syrian officials have maintained that no supporting documentation exists for the program, which included dozens of storage, production and research facilities.\n\nPolitical Deadlock\n\nThe Syrian crisis has had a profound effect on the way the OPCW operates. For two decades the organization had reached consensus on most decisions, only calling on the 41-member executive council to vote on a handful of occasions. Syria marked a clear divide on the council.\n\nIn 2016, when an inquiry by the United Nations and OPCW found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks, the United States sought to impose sanctions on those responsible through the executive council, but then dropped the proposal, the details of which were not made public. A text drafted by Spain condemned the attacks but removed any reference to sanctions. It was supported by a majority, including Germany, France, the United States and Britain, but opposed by Russia, China, Iran and Sudan.\n\nThe United States has since placed sanctions on hundreds of Syrian officials it said were linked to the chemical weapons program. President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian air base, but division on the OPCW governing body and at the United Nations has prevented collective action against the continuing attacks.\n\nWestern governments accused Moscow of trying to undermine investigations by the United Nations and OPCW in order to protect Assad; Syria says the inspection missions are being used by Western countries to force regime change.\n\nRussian officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSarin Found\n\nFormer U.N. chief weapons inspector Ake Sellstrom, who is now chief scientist for the U.N.-OPCW mission, said it is critical that perpetrators of chemical attacks are put on trial to deter future use of weapons of mass destruction. His team should be reporting back to the U.N. by mid-October, he said.\n\nA key unsolved question is what happened to the 2,000 aerial bombs that Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons, a process that would be costly and time-consuming.\n\n\"To my knowledge, the Syrian government never furnished any details of where, when and how they changed the bombs' payload,\" said an OPCW-U.N. source, who took part in investigations in 2015-2016. He said there clearly was \"a real, high-level, command structure behind this.\"\n\nSyrian officials did not respond to requests for comment about the bombs.\n\nThe team is also examining the deaths of almost 100 people on April 4 when a gas attack hit Khan Sheikhoun, a town in the rebel-held province of Idlib near the Turkish border. Samples taken from people exposed to the chemicals and tested by the OPCW confirmed sarin use. Meqdad, Syria's deputy foreign minister, said in the interview that Syrian forces were not to blame, repeating earlier denials by Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem.\n\nSellstrom said the presence of sarin so long after Syria was supposed to have dismantled its chemical weapons program posed difficult questions. \"Is there a hideout somewhere, or is there production somewhere and how much is available?\" he said, adding that the reported use of aerial bombs in Khan Sheikhoun could point to the Syrian forces keeping some strategic weapons as well.\n\nThe attack means either \"that someone can produce sarin today, or sarin has been hidden,\" Sellstrom said.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label":

I would go to Damascus and I would confront these people,\" Kane said.\n\nUzumcu said the OPCW was constrained by its founding treaty, the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. The OPCW has no obligation to act when one of its members violates the convention, he said. Determining blame for the use of chemical weapons is the task of a separate United Nations-OPCW mission in Syria, the Joint Investigative Mechanism, established in 2015. A spokesman for the Joint Investigative Mechanism referred questions to the OPCW.\n\n\"The secretariat has fulfilled, accurately and entirely, the tasks they were asked to fulfil and will remain within our limitations as far as our mandate is concerned,\" Uzumcu said.\n\nHe said some states have suspicions that the Syrian government hid stocks of chemical precursors that might be used for the production of certain nerve agents, including sarin. But he said there was no conclusive evidence.\n\nMen rescue a boy from under the rubble after what activists said was explosive barrels dropped in Aleppo by forces loyal to Assad. REUTERS/Hosam Katan\n\nUzumcu said he regretted that relations had broken down between Russia and the United States on the OPCW executive council, which has the power to impose restrictions on Syria's membership and report it to the U.N. Security Council for non-cooperation.\n\nUzumcu said his office was still seeking answers from the Assad administration about undeclared chemicals, aerial bombs and the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, which has overseen Syria's chemical weapons since the 1970s. Syrian officials have maintained that no supporting documentation exists for the program, which included dozens of storage, production and research facilities.\n\nThe Syrian crisis has had a profound effect on the way the OPCW operates. For two decades the organization had reached consensus on most decisions, only calling on the 41-member executive council to vote on a handful of occasions. Syria marked a clear divide on the council.\n\nIn 2016, when an inquiry by the United Nations and OPCW found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks, the United States sought to impose sanctions on those responsible through the executive council, but then dropped the proposal, the details of which were not made public. A text drafted by Spain condemned the attacks but removed any reference to sanctions. It was supported by a majority, including Germany, France, the United States and Britain, but opposed by Russia, China, Iran and Sudan.\n\nThe United States has since placed sanctions on hundreds of Syrian officials it said were linked to the chemical weapons program. President Donald Trump ordered a missile strike on a Syrian air base, but division on the OPCW governing body and at the United Nations has prevented collective action against the continuing attacks.\n\nWestern governments accused Moscow of trying to undermine investigations by the United Nations and OPCW in order to protect Assad; Syria says the inspection missions are being used by Western countries to force regime change.\n\nRussian officials did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCivil Defence members wear gas masks near damaged ground in Ibleen village from what activists said was a chlorine gas attack, on Kansafra, Ibleen and Josef villages, Idlib countryside, Syria May 3, 2015. REUTERS/Abed Kontar/File photo\n\nFormer U.N. chief weapons inspector Ake Sellstrom, who is now chief scientist for the U.N.-OPCW mission, said it is critical that perpetrators of chemical attacks are put on trial to deter future use of weapons of mass destruction. His team should be reporting back to the U.N. by mid-October, he said.\n\nA key unsolved question is what happened to the 2,000 aerial bombs that Syria said it had converted to conventional weapons, a process that would be costly and time-consuming.\n\n\"To my knowledge, the Syrian government never furnished any details of where, when and how they changed the bombs' payload,\" said an OPCW-U.N. source, who took part in investigations in 2015-2016. He said there clearly was \"a real, high-level, command structure behind this.\"\n\nSyrian officials did not respond to requests for comment about the bombs.\n\nThe team is also examining the deaths of almost 100 people on April 4 when a gas attack hit Khan Sheikhoun, a town in the rebel-held province of Idlib near the Turkish border. Samples taken from people exposed to the chemicals and tested by the OPCW confirmed sarin use. Meqdad, Syria's deputy foreign minister, said in the interview that Syrian forces were not to blame, repeating earlier denials by Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem.\n\nSellstrom said the presence of sarin so long after Syria was supposed to have dismantled its chemical weapons program posed difficult questions. \"Is there a hideout somewhere, or is there production somewhere and how much is available?\" he said, adding that the reported use of aerial bombs in Khan Sheikhoun could point to the Syrian forces keeping some strategic weapons as well.\n\nThe attack means either \"that someone can produce sarin today, or sarin has been hidden,\" Sellstrom said.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100, "id": 161, "label":

Secretary General Ban Ki-moon establishes United Nations Mission to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic. Headed by Swedish scientist Ake Sellstrom and comprised of experts from the World Health Organization and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), it is tasked with looking into possible use of chemical weapons following reports of an attack in the northern town of Khan al-Assal. It confirms use of sarin in the Aug. 21 attack in the Damascus suburb Ghouta that killed hundreds.\n\n2014 - OPCW Declaration Assessment Team begins work to resolve gaps and inconsistencies in Syria's declaration to the OPCW, which was supposed to include all aspects of its chemical weapons programme. By July 2016, after visiting Syria 18 times to inspect sites and meet with Syrian officials, it can \"not fully verify that Syria had submitted a declaration that could be considered accurate and complete.\"\n\n- OPCW establishes a Fact Finding Mission in response to persistent allegations of chemical weapon attacks in Syria, \"to establish facts surrounding allegations of the use of toxic chemicals, reportedly chlorine, for hostile purposes in the Syrian Arab Republic.\" The Fact Finding Mission concludes the use of chlorine was systematic and widespread.

It confirms use of sarin in the Aug. 21 attack in the Damascus suburb Ghouta that killed hundreds. 2014 - OPCW Declaration Assessment Team begins work to resolve gaps and inconsistencies in Syria's declaration to the OPCW, which was supposed to include all aspects of its chemical weapons programme. By July 2016, after visiting Syria 18 times to inspect sites and meet with Syrian officials, it can \"not fully verify that Syria had submitted a declaration that could be considered accurate and complete.\"\n\n- OPCW establishes a Fact Finding Mission in response to persistent allegations of chemical weapon attacks in Syria, \"to establish facts surrounding allegations of the use of toxic chemicals, reportedly chlorine, for hostile purposes in the Syrian Arab Republic.\" The Fact Finding Mission concludes the use of chlorine was systematic and widespread. It is not tasked with assigning blame. 2015 - United Nations-OPCW Joint Investigative Mechanism in Syria is established to identify individuals or entities behind chemical weapons attacks. 2016 - Joint Investigative Mechanism concludes that Syrian government forces used chlorine as a chemical weapon in three cases and that Islamic State militants used sulphur mustard.\n\n- OPCW executive council adopts decision condemning Syrian government and Islamic State for chemical weapons use after a vote that split the body and signaled an end to U.S.-Russia cooperation. 2017 - OPCW Fact Finding Mission concludes that sarin was used in an April 4 attack in the Khan Sheikhoun area of northern Syria, the most deadly use of the nerve agent in three years. It does not assign blame.\n\n(Editing by Janet McBride and Richard Woods)", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label":

A corresponding statement was made by Syrian Deputy Foreign and Expatriates Minister Faisal Mekdad during a press conference in Damascus.\n\nHe said that the riot control weapons discovered were limited to hand and rocket-propelled grenades which had been fitted with irritating toxic agents. The chemical ammunition had been produced by the US-based company Federal Laboratories, and toxic agents were produced by Cherming Defence (UK) and NonLethal Technologies (US).\n\nSputnik Radio discussed the issue with Dr. Kevin Barrett, a Doctor of Arabic and Islamic Studies and the co-founder of the Muslim-Jewish-Christian Alliance for Truth, who said that this discovery could be extremely important in exonerating the Syrian government of the accusations that they used chemical weapons against their own people.\n\n\"It could be extremely important, but it depends on how different elements of the international community react to this. Will they actually look seriously at it, will we get any real investigation from any international bodies or will they studiously look the other way and continue to spin everything they do in line with the imperial forces which are trying to destroy Syria and have been fabricating the information about alleged chemical attacks from the Syrian government, which all turned out to be false,\" he told Sputnik.\n\n\"I am not going to hold my breath until the international community becomes honest about this whole issue, but in the long run, history will show that it actually has been elements of the so-called Syrian rebels and their foreign backers, including the US, that have been guilty of introducing chemical weapons into this conflict,\" he added.\n\nThe political scientist further elaborated how this incident could prove that the Syrian government, in fact, did not use any chemical weapons.\"I don't know if you could prove a negative with something like this, but it certainly is additional evidence, and it could be very strong and convincing additional evidence, that these past stories in which chemical weapons events were attributed to the Syrian government turned out to have been fabricated by the Syrian rebels,\" he said.\n\nThis would be one more item of evidence, perhaps a very strong one, he said, suggesting that what we have seen is a consistent false flag strategy by the rebels and their foreign backers to introduce the chemical weapons into this conflict.\n\nThe strategy is primarily to blame the Syrian government and to try to create the impression that the Syrian government has crossed the so-called \"red line\" that Obama talked about.\n\nIn the most serious incidents, including the Khan Sheikhoun incident in north-western Syria on April 4, we have seen this pattern of accusation over and over. And then in subsequent investigation we find out that either it did not happen, as in this case, where there were not real chemical weapons, or, as in other cases, it was fabricated by the rebels, he said. And this evidence will once again suggest that the rebels and their backers are fabricating these events.\n\nDr. Barrett also commented on the statement of Faisal Mekdad that under Article 5 of the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the use of toxic agents was allowed only in cases of stopping disorders. The Convention prohibits the use of toxic agents as means of warfare.\"So, we can say for sure that the US and UK as well as their allies in the region violate the Chemical Weapons Convention. They support terrorist organizations operating in Syria. They deliver to the militants not only armaments but also prohibited toxic agents,\" the Deputy Foreign Minister added.\n\nSpeaking about any possible repercussions which could follow the statement, Dr. Barrett noted that it \"depends on international bodies having the courage to bite the hand that feeds them.\"\n\n\"And we have not seen that kind of courage very often. We are getting all kinds of contradictory information and mushy equivocal statements from the UN, among others. Whether they will ever really take this up and turn against the US and UK is highly speculative, I can't really imagine this happening any time in the near future,\" he suggested.\n\nThe political scientist, however, suggested that this discovery could become yet another defining moment of the Syrian war, which in the long run will lead towards peace in the war-torn country.\"The facts on the ground have changed now to favor the forces that have been defending the Syrian government against this destabilization program and the international talks to try to bring peace to the region have shifted away from the US and its Zionist and Saudi friends. Now we have Turkey, Iran and Russia playing the key role. Given those changes, it is possible that if a convincing enough case could be made based on this incident showing that the whole chemical weapons issue has been a fabrication, in the long run it could be sort of public relations turning point,\" he said.\n\nHowever, the real turning point, he further noted, has been that the US \"has lost the will to continue to destabilize Syria, and Turkey has changed its attitude.\"\n\nTrump, Dr. Barrett said, has officially ended support for the CIA-backed Syrian rebels. Unfortunately the Pentagon is still backing other factions but to the extent that the US and the UK and NATO are able to get out of Syria and to admit that they made a mistake, this is as far as they will go.\n\n\"However they will never admit that the real purpose of all of this intervention has been to destabilize Syria and to pursue a geopolitical strategy against Iran and against Russia and in favor of expansionist Israel. But to the extent they can get out, then they can afford politically to start telling the truth,\" he said.\n\n\"We are seeing a different international situation now, with more of a will to find a solution to this problem. I think this will be part of a series of turning points that will ultimately lead to peace in Syria,\" he finally stated.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

Both the opposition and the government traded accusations.\n\nIn the same year, a chemical attack hit the then government-controlled town of Khan al-Asal in the countryside of Aleppo, in which several Syrian soldiers and civilians were either killed or suffered from suffocation.\n\nThe government accused the rebels, who denied the accusation.\n\nIn October 2013, OPCW officials arrived in Syria to monitor the dismantlement of the Syrian chemical weapons arsenal, after Damascus officially joined the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\nThe OPCW later said that the government made its chemical weapon production facilities inoperable.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100, "id": 161, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism"},

Gen. Vladimir Bogatyrev told Radio Sputnik, calling for a joint effort to stop the spread of chemical weapons and toxic agents in Syria.\n\nThe fact that US and UK-made toxic agents have ended up in the hands of terrorists in Syria revealed true colors of Washington and London amid the ongoing crisis, retired Maj. Gen. Vladimir Bogatyrev, chair of the Board of the Russian National Association of Retired Military Officers, told Radio Sputnik.\n\nOn Wednesday the Syrian Foreign Ministry accused the US and Great Britain of supplying poisonous CS and CN substances to extremists in Syria.\n\n\"The special equipment found consisted of hand grenades and rounds for grenade launchers equipped with CS and CN toxic agents,\" Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad told a press conference in Damascus, \"The chemical munitions were produced by the Federal Laboratories company in the US. The toxic agents were produced by Cherming Defense UK and NonLethal Technologies (US).\"\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo/ United media office of ArbeenEyes Wide Shut: How US, UK-Made Toxic Agents Ended Up in Hands of TerroristsMekdad focused attention on the fact that in accordance with Article 5 of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons, the use of toxic agents is permitted only to combat riots and prohibited for use in warfare.\n\n\"So, we can say for sure that the US and UK, as well as their allies in the region, have violated the Chemical Weapons Convention. They support terrorist organizations operating in Syria. They deliver to the militants not only armaments but also prohibited toxic agents,\" the Syrian deputy foreign minister concluded.\n\nIn response, the US Department of Defense and UK's Chemring Defence dismissed the accusations.\n\n\"Department of Defense assistance to Vetted Syrian Opposition groups is limited to those groups fighting ISIS [Daesh]. That assistance does not now, nor has it ever, included chemical agents like you describe,\" Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon told Sputnik on Wednesday.\n\nFor its part, UK company Chemring Defence said that it didn't provide toxic agents to terrorists in Syria and \"doesn't manufacture chemical weapons or components that can be used for anything like that.\"\n\n\u00a9 Sputnik/ Nour MolhemCanisters found at a terrorist chemical weapons factory in Aleppo\n\nCommenting on the issue Ammar Waqqaf, a Middle East expert, the Founder and Director of the analytical organization Gnosos, suggested that both the US and UK governments are likely to ignore this episode.\n\nThe US-led coalition usually closes its eyes to the use of toxic gases by the Syrian \"rebel\" groups, he highlighted.\n\n\"There have been numerous occasions when rebels clearly used toxic gases,\" Waqqaf said, \"There are even videos, for example in Sheikh Maqsood a couple of years ago where Jaish al-Islam used chlorine gas. There was a clear yellow cloud over there, they even admitted it and later denied it. But nobody speaks about all these things.\"\n\n\u00a9 REUTERS/ Ammar Abdullah'Beyond Understanding': Moscow on UK, US Possible Supplies of Toxic Agents to SyriaRetired Maj. Gen. Vladimir Bogatyrev shares a similar stance.\n\n\"The information that emerged in the media [on Wednesday], that Syria accuses the United States and Great Britain of supplying toxic elements or even chemical weapons to the Syrian 'opposition'... shows a black and unsightly face of these two countries, these two 'great democracies',\" Bogatyrev told Radio Sputnik.\n\n\"So many accusations against the Syrian leadership and the allies of Syria have been made! And today the truth comes out,\" the military analyst highlighted.\n\nPreviously, the US and EU leadership put the blame for the April chemical incident in Khan Shaykhun, Idlib, on the Syrian government presenting no credible evidence to confirm the claim.\n\nAccording to Bogatyrev, the spread of chemical weapons or toxic agents in Syria should be stopped, while the policy of \"regime change\" conducted by some geopolitical actors needs to be defined as \"criminal.\"\n\n\"All the UN conventions on the prohibition of chemical weapons, all norms of human morality and norms of political behavior on the international scene have recently been violated. And now the first task is to stop any attempts to lie and deceive on the international arena,\" the military analyst said.\n\n\"Second, it is necessary -- specifically under the leadership of the UN Security Council -- to block any attempts to spread elements of chemical weapons as well as attempts to divide terrorists into 'good' and 'bad',\" he highlighted.\n\n\"And, finally, it is necessary to clearly determine that the policy of the United States and the UK aimed at overthrowing 'undesired regimes' is criminal. Especially, since this is most seriously manifested today in Syria,\" retired Maj. Gen.

A joint UN and OPCW investigation earlier in the year found Syrian government forces used chlorine gas in three attacks in 2014 and 2015.\n\n\"The extent of Syria's reluctance to abandon chemical weapons has not previously been made public for fear of damaging international inspectors' relationship with Assad's administration and its backer, Russia,\" the Israeli news outlet Haaretz reports.\n\nDespite overwhelming evidence Assad has continued to deploy chemical weapons, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova laid the blame squarely on allied forces, saying there was evidence that the West is supplying chemical weapons to militants in Syria.\n\n\"Yes, it's true,\" she told the state-funded Vesti FM radio station on Thursday morning. \"Western countries

The deal was preceded by a gas attack in the suburbs of Damascus, which killed from 280 to 1,700 people, according to various data.\n\nOn November 15, the Executive Council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) approved a detailed plan for the destruction of chemical weapons.

Sputnik Radio spoke with political scientist Dr. Kevin Barrett about the significance of this discovery and whether it could become a turning point in the Syrian conflict.\n\nAccording to Syria's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the toxic agents found in Aleppo and Damascus suburb were produced by one British company and two American companies. The corresponding statement was made by Syrian Deputy Foreign and Expatriates Minister Faisal Mekdad during the press conference in Damascus.\n\nHe said that all found riot control weapons were hand and rocket-propelled grenades which have been fitted with irritating toxic agents. Detected chemical ammunition were issued by Federal Laboratories company on the territory of the US, and toxic agents were produced by the Cherming Defence UK and American NonLethal Technologies.\n\nSputnik Radio discussed the issue with Dr. Kevin Barrett, Doctor of Arabic and Islamic Studies and the co-founder of Muslim-Jewish-Christian Alliance for Truth, who said that this discovery could be extremely important for lifting all the accusations of using chemical weapons against their own people from the Syrian government\n\n\"It could be extremely important, but it depends on how different elements of the international community react to this. Will they actually look seriously at it, will we get any real investigation from any international bodies or will they studiously look the other way and continue to spin everything they do in line with the imperial forces which are trying to destroy Syria and have been fabricating the information about alleged chemical attacks from the Syrian government, which all turned out to be false,\" he told Sputnik.\n\n\"I am not going to hold my breath until the international community becomes honest about this whole issue, but in the long run history will show that it actually has been elements of the so-called Syrian rebels and their foreign backers, including the US, that have been guilty of introducing chemical weapons into this conflict,\" he added.\n\n\u00a9 AFP 2017/ Omar haj kadourLack of Investigation Into US Strikes in Syria Proves Idlib Chemical Attack Was Staged - Syrian Deputy FMThe political scientist further elaborated how this incident could prove that the Syrian government, in fact, did not use any chemical weapons.\n\n\"I don't know if you could prove a negative with something like this, but it certainly is additional evidence, and it could be very strong and convincing additional evidence, that these past stories in which chemical weapons events were attributed to the Syrian government turned out to have been fabricated by the Syrian rebels,\" he said.\n\nThis would be one more item of evidence, perhaps a very strong one, he said, suggesting that what we have seen is a consistent false flag strategy by the rebels and their foreign backers to introduce the chemical weapons into this conflict.\n\nThe strategy is primarily to blame the Syrian government and to try to create the impression that the Syrian government has crossed the so-called \"red line\" that Obama talked about.\n\nIn the most serious incidents, including Khan Sheikhoun incident in north-western Syria on April 4, we have seen over and over this pattern of an accusation. And then in subsequent investigation we find out that either it did not happen, as in this case, where there were not real chemical weapons, or, as in other cases, it was fabricated by the rebels, he said. And this evidence will once again suggest that the rebels and their backers are fabricating these events.\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo/ Luis M. AlvarezState Department Aware of Claims US, UK Supplied Toxins to Syria - OfficialDr. Barrett also commented on the statement of Faisal Mekdad that under the article 5 of the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the use of toxic agents was allowed only in cases of stopping disorders. The Convention prohibits the use of toxic agents as means of warfare.\n\n\"So, we can say for sure that the US and UK as well as its allies in the region violate the Chemical Weapons Convention. They support terrorist organizations operating in Syria. They deliver to the militants not only armaments but also prohibited toxic agents,\" the deputy foreign minister added.\n\nSpeaking about any possible repercussions which could follow the statement, Dr. Barrett noted that it \"depends on the international bodies having the courage to bite the hand that feeds them.\"\n\n\"And we have not seen that kind of courage very often. We are getting all kinds of contradictory information and mushy equivocal statements from the UN, among others. Whether they will ever really take this up and turn against the US and UK is highly speculative, I can't really imagine this happening any time in the near future,\" he suggested.\n\n\u00a9 REUTERS/ Ammar Abdullah'Beyond Understanding': Moscow on UK, US Possible Supplies of Toxic Agents to SyriaThe political scientist however suggested that this discovery could become yet another defining moment of the Syrian war which in the long run will lead towards peace in the war-torn country.\n\n\"The facts on the ground have changed now to favor the forces that have been defending the Syrian government against this destabilization program and the international talks to try to bring peace to the region have shifted away from the US and its Zionist and Saudi friends. Now we have Turkey, Iran and Russia playing the key role. Given those changes, it is possible that if a convincing enough case could be made based on this incident showing that the whole chemical weapons issue has been a fabrication, in the long run it could be sort of public relations turning point,\" he said.\n\nHowever the real turning point, he further noted, has been that the US \"has lost the will to continue to destabilizing Syria and that Turkey has changed its attitude.\"\n\nTrump, Dr. Barrett said, has officially ended backing for the CIA-backed Syrian rebels. Unfortunately the Pentagon is still backing other factions but to the extent that the US and the UK and NATO are able to get out of Syria and to admit that they made a mistake, this is as far as they will go.\n\n\"However they will never admit that the real purpose of all of this intervention has been to destabilize Syria and to pursue a geopolitical strategy against Iran and against Russia and in favor of the expansionist Israel. But to the extent they can get out, than they can afford politically to start telling the truth,\" he said.\n\n\"We are seeing a different international situation now with more of a will to find a solution to this problem. I think this will part of a series of turning points that will ultimately lead to peace in Syria,\" he finally stated.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

During the probe, it was conclusively determined that the so-called incident in Khan Shaykhun from beginning to end was staged by militants according to a prearranged scenario,\" Faisal Mekdad announced at a news conference in Damascus Wednesday.\n\nThe investigation conducted by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), which found traces of sarin in the samples of soil supposedly coming from Khan Shaykhun, where the incident took place on 4 April, has many flaws and cannot be deemed conclusive, Mekdad stated.\n\n\"The investigation conducted by OPCW specialists, to put it bluntly, is laughable and we told the organization about it. How can the organization analyze samples, delivered by the militants from another country?\" Mekdad questioned.\n\n\"We suspect though, that such probes are just a formality. We'd like to remind that there's a crucial 'chain of custody' principle. Who can guarantee that the samples allegedly coming from the crater were indeed there? Or how they got there?\" Mekdad said. \"Who can guarantee the alleged witnesses would not falsify the facts?\"\n\n\"The chain of custody requires control by an OPCW representative and not those interested in smearing the Syrian government and fabricating facts, used by the US to justify such terrorist acts as the strike on the airbase,\" he added.\n\nThe incident almost immediately prompted the United States to launch a volley of Tomahawk cruise missiles on Syria's Shayrat Airbase. The US attack, according to Mekdad, was planned beforehand, while the Khan Shaykhun incident was used as a pretext \"without bothering to conduct their own investigation.\"\n\nThe Syrian government would welcome an open investigation and would provide all the support required, the official underlined.\n\n\"Such [an] investigation must start from Damascus. You can go to the scene in Khan Shaykhun, or head another way - to Shayrat Airbase, where the experts on the fact-finding mission will get access to everything they would need to conduct an open, impartial and neutral probe.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Chemical incident in Khan Shaykhun: Why is the West not interested in the truth?\n\nMoscow has consistently called for an proper, impartial investigation of the incident. It has also criticized the OPCW report as it was based on data and testimonies provided by \"various NGOs\" without the necessary verification. Russia's OPCW representative, Aleksandr Shulgin, told RT that the report itself admits that the investigative team decided not to visit the incident scene due to alleged \"security factors\" and was thus unable to gather the necessary material evidence directly from the spot.\n\nIn addition to challenging the OPCW report, Syria's deputy foreign minister also highlighted other discoveries made by the Syrian army in the recently liberated areas of the country. The find, he said, not only prove the use of combat chemical agents by militants, but also indicate the foreign origins of some of the toxic substances.\n\n\"Large amounts of special compounds, containing Turkish-made chemical agents, have been uncovered during liberation of certain resident areas. According to specialists' evaluations, these compounds are used for chemical weaponry production,\" Mekdad said.\n\nApart from components for chemical warfare agents production, the army also allegedly uncovered foreign factory-made riot-control chemical munitions.\n\n\"In [the] Aleppo countryside, as well as Djobar, Kabun in Eastern Ghouta region of Damascus governorate, we've registered terrorist usage of irritating chemical substances used by police as riot control agents. Weapon and munitions stockpiles have been secured after [the] liberation of the regions from terrorists, the spoils have also contained combat-ready irritant chemical agents,\" Mekdad said.\n\n\"Those chemical agents have been produced by British and American companies,\" Mekdad said, adding that the \"hand grenades and warheads for grenade launchers\" contained gases, namely CS and CN, used for riot control.\n\nOn par with chemical weapons, the use of \"riot control agents as a method of warfare\" is also explicitly prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).\n\n\"Thus we can firmly state that the US and UK, as well as their regional allies, in violation of the CWC provide all sorts of support to terrorist organizations, operating in Syria. They supply the militants not only with conventional weaponry, but with the poisonous compounds,\" Mekdad concluded.\n\nThe April 4 incident, according to various estimations, claimed the lives of between 74 to 100 civilians and injured hundreds. Washington rushed to blame Damascus based on open-source intelligence, while the Syrian government strongly denied responsibility. On April 7, US President Donald Trump authorized the firing of 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at the Shayrat Airbase from where US intelligence said the chemical attack was launched.", "date":

Security forces open fire on the unarmed protesters, killing four. They are believed to be the first deaths related to the uprising. But rather than quelling demonstrations, the brutal crackdown by President Bashar al-Assad's forces provokes more protests.\n\nMarch 28, 2011: The protests in Daraa have been continuing for several days, with a crackdown by security forces reportedly claiming some 60 lives up to now.\n\nAugust 18, 2011: In response to the unrelenting crackdown across the country, US President Barack Obama calls on Assad to resign and orders all Syrian government assets in the US to be frozen.\n\nObama warns that if Syria uses chemical weapons, it will have \"enormous consequences\" that will change his thinking about intervening in the country's civil war. He infamously calls it a \"red line.\" But over the next year there will be two gas attacks that drew international condemnation.\n\nMarch 19, 2013: A gas attack kills 26 people, at least half of them government soldiers, in the northern town of Khan al-Assal. A UN investigation concludes that sarin nerve gas was used, but cannot determine who used it. Both the government and the rebel forces accuse each other of using the prohibited gas.\n\nAugust 21, 2013: A far deadlier sarin gas attack kills hundreds in the rebel-held suburbs of Damascus. UN investigators determine that ground-to-ground missiles packed with sarin were fired into civilian areas while people slept. The US and others blame the Assad regime for the attack.\n\nAugust 31, 2013: Obama announces he'll ask Congress for authorization to strike back against the Syrian government, but the Republican-controlled legislature fails to act.\n\nSeptember 27, 2013: The UN Security Council threatens to use force against Syria if it doesn't destroy its chemical weapons stockpile. By mid-October, Syria signs on to the Chemical Weapons Convention; this prohibits it from producing, stockpiling or using chemical weapons.\n\nJune 23, 2014: The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) announces that it has removed all of the Syrian government's chemical weapons. But government opponents say the Assad regime sill has hidden chemical weapons supplies.\n\nSeptember 23, 2014: The US launched limited airstrikes against \"Islamic State\" (IS) militants inside Syria.\n\nAugust 7, 2015: The UN Security Council authorizes the OPCW and UN experts to investigate new reports that Assad has, again, resorted to chemical weapons. This time he is suspected of repeatedly using chlorine gas in opposition areas populated by civilians.\n\nRussia begins bombing\n\nSeptember 30, 2015: After providing military aid behind the scenes since the war's inception, Russia actively enters the conflict. The Russian air force carries out relentless bombing attacks against Assad opponents and is also accused of deliberately bombing civilian targets, including hospitals. A civil war that had been deadlocked for four-and-a-half years begins to move steadily in favor of the Assad regime.\n\nAugust 24, 2016: The joint OPCW-UN panel determines that the Syrian military used chlorine gas in three separate attacks against its opponents - two of those attacks were carried out by helicopter. But investigators also determine that IS militants also used mustard gas\n\nFebruary 28, 2017: Russia and China veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for sanctions against the Syria government in response to its use of chemical weapons.\n\nApril 4, 2017: At least 58 people are killed in what appears to be a nerve-gas attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in rebel-held Idlib province. Victims show telltale signs of a chemical weapons attack, including convulsions and foaming at the mouth. Witnesses claim the attack was carried out by Russian or Syrian jets, but both Moscow and Damascus deny the allegations.\n\nApril 6, 2017: The US fires a barrage of cruise missiles at the military base where the attack is believed to have originated from. US President Donald Trump, who campaigned as an isolationist and a populist, defends the attack, calling it a \"vital national security interest of the United States.\"\n\nMay 9, 2017: Trump approves military plans to arm the Kurdish YPG as part of the effort to retake the Syrian city of Raqqa from IS militants. The move infuriates NATO ally Turkey, which has long sparred with the US over the YPG. Washington considers the YPG crucial to defeating the IS in Syria. But Ankara views the group as an extension of the Kurdish PKK militant group, which it (and Washington) considers a terrorist organization.\n\nJuly 7, 2017: Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agree to a limited ceasefire in three war-torn provinces in southwest Syria. After six years of fighting residents are weary of the conflict, but wary about whether the ceasefire will hold.\n\nJuly 9, 2017: The ceasefire takes effect at 12 noon and an uneasy calm prevails during the initial hours.\n\nJuly 23, 2017: Syrian warplanes bomb the suburbs of Damascus, just one day after the military had declared a cessation of hostilities in the area.\n\nThroughout the more than six-year conflict, there have been multiple attempts at countrywide peace talks - most backed by the UN but some backed by Russia - but all of them have failed. Likewise, the UN's independent Commission of Inquiry on Syria has issued nearly a dozen reports chronicling war time atrocities.\n\nBut without a UN Security Council referral to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, the commission's relentless work appears to be for nothing. Efforts to send the commission's work to the ICC have been vetoed by permanent Security Council members Russia and China. It was out of frustration with that political stalemate that commission member Carla del Ponte announced in August 2017 that she would be quitting the commission.", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories":

Wednesday that the United States, Britain and their allies in the region breach the Chemical Weapons convention by supporting terrorist organizations in Syria and supplying them with toxic materials and weapons of all forms.\n\nMikdad, in a meeting held with a number of journalists at the Foreign and Expatriates Ministry HQ, called on the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)to investigate into the US, Britain and Turkey's supply to terrorist organizations, which are present in Syria, with internationally-banned poisonous materials.\n\nHe said that since the beginning of the crisis in the country, reports about the use of chemical weapons in different areas have been frequently occurring in the media and usually Western countries, relying on the allegations of terrorist groups, were accusing the Syrian state without any evidence.\n\nMikdad added that depending on the fabrications and lies of the terrorists who claimed that the Syrian Arab Army carried out a chemical attack on the city of Khan Sheikhoun, the United States launched missile strikes even before conducting investigations into the matter.\n\nHe noted that the Syrian government has investigated into the issue, using analyses of foreign non-governmental organizations and as a result of the investigations, the truth of what has happened in Khan Sheikhoun was found from the beginning to the end.\n\n\"Syria has received the fact-finding committee of the OPCW and opened all doors in front of them for investigation, but they refused,\" said Mikdad, adding that Syria has carried out all its obligations, but when this doesn't serve the US, it will be rejected.\n\nHe considered that the echo of the chemical attack in Khan Sheikhoun had one objective, mainly, to condemn the Syrian government of breaching the international and human laws, affirming that the Syrian government doesn't possess any form of chemical weapons and all its stockpile has been eliminated under the supervision of the OPCW.\n\nIn a relevant context, Mikdad pointed out that a number of western states push terrorists to carry out war crimes by supplying them with large quantities of special materials which include Turkish-made chemical materials, and according to experts, these materials are used to manufacture chemical weapons.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories":

It was the most deadly chemical weapons attack in nearly 30 years, but it wasn't the last and more could be on the way.\n\nAs the international community marks the 20th anniversary of the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) this year, the Bashar al-Assad regime's flagrant violations of the Treaty's fundamental obligations should be of high concern. They also should serve as a reminder that chemical weapons remain a threat that demands a global solution.\n\nAssad -- despite signing the CWC in October 2013 and pledging to destroy his declared chemical weapons stockpiles and production capabilities -- has continued chemical attacks on the Syrian opposition (). In April this year, the regime used sarin again at Khan in northwestern Syria, killing at least 74 people, including nearly a dozen children, and injuring more than 500.\n\nPresident Trump took prompt, but limited military action against the Syrian military airbase responsible for staging the April sarin attack, and threatened additional strikes should the Syrian regime attempt future chemical attacks. But more steps are necessary to hold Assad and his military commanders responsible for chemical weapons attacks that violate treaty commitments they recently made.\n\nISIS has repeatedly used mustard gas and chlorine on the battlefield in Syria and Iraq and can produce crude mustard gas as detailed by former CIA Director, John Brennan, in 2016. North Korea's Kim Jong-un chose the extremely deadly nerve agent, VX, to assassinate his half-brother at Kuala Lumpur international airport last year. One possible explanation for why Kim chose to have his half-brother killed with such an exotic military grade chemical agent is to signal to potential adversaries the type of weapon he has in his national arsenal and his willingness to use it. Other countries, including CWC signatories, may be reconsidering their options as well.\n\nThere can be no doubt that when Assad reviews the landscape of past and present despots, such as Libya's Moammar Qaddafi, Iraq's Saddam Hussein, and North Korea's Kim, he surely will take note that only Kim -- with his nuclear weapons program and a chemical weapons arsenal -- is still alive and in power. Rather than relinquishing his remaining chemical weapons stockpiles, Assad could choose instead to covertly restock them.\n\nTo counter Assad and others who might turn to the use of chemical weapons, the U.S. could collaborate with other major powers to bolster the international ban on chemical weapons. Convening a major conference -- akin to the Nuclear Security Summit held last year -- focused on strengthening the treaty's inspection and enforcement provisions could be a worthy first step. Enhanced sanctions could be imposed on the Syrian regime, given its acceptance of the CWC treaty terms prohibiting the use of chemicals as weapons. Additionally, Russia, could be held accountable for aiding Syria despite the regime's repeated use of chemical weapons. Finally, in order to strengthen international norms, the U.S. could warn Assad, and other rogue leaders considering treaty banned weapons, that if chemical weapons are used, severe military, diplomatic, and economic actions will follow.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare

Analysts say that, if this is true, the US and UK are in violation of international treaties.\n\nBrian Becker, the host of Loud & Clear on Radio Sputnik, was joined by Mark Sloboda, a Moscow-based political analyst. Becker started by asking about the meaning of the Syrian claims to the ongoing armed conflict in the war-torn nation.\n\nThe claims are \"all at this point, according to the Syrian deputy foreign minister, coming officially out of the Syrian government,\" said Sloboda. \"To me what's most striking about this news is that you won't find any of it reported in the Western media whatsoever. The only way you'll find it is in the Russian media or sources drawing links from the Syrian government media. There is an automatic assumption in the Western media that we just ignore anything and everything that the Syrian government says. Now, we certainly shouldn't take everything they say at face value, any more than we should what the US government, the Russian government, any government says, but to completely reject and not report on what the Syrian government is ... a complete failure of journalism.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nSloboda goes on to say that the chemical weapons discovered were \"common respiratory agents used in riot control, but they are prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) for use in warfare ... the Russian permanent representative to the UN Vasily Nebenzia has pointed out that this is a violation of the CWC and would be a violation of such by the US if evidence determines that they have supplied that these weapons to their proxies [in Syria.]\"\n\nBecker then proceeded to note that it didn't make sense to him for the Syrian government to manufacture and use chemical weapons against their enemies as the war is going their way by most metrics.\n\n\"Chemical weapons are an extremely ineffective battlefield weapon,\" Sloboda replied. \"[I]t depends on the use of particular agents but we're talking nerve agents like sarin, they can't be stored, they have to be delivered to an area. The most possible use for something like that is to clear an area of enemy troops immediately. Within a few hours of a large movement of your own forces into an area, there's problems with delivery, there's problems with blowback onto your own forces depending on the environmental conditions and the agent used.\"\n\n\u00a9 AFP 2017/ Mohamed al-BakourPentagon Says It Never Sent Chemical Agents to Syrian Opposition Groups\n\n\"If there's one thing that the Syrian conflict has proven beyond a doubt, which I think everyone knowledgeable already knew, [is] that chemical weapons are terribly ineffective weapons as a battlefield [weapon] or as deterrence for anything. The one thing they seem to be good for is providing a pretext for operations within the country that has them. This is why I believe that the Syrian government, under prompting from Russia, was so willing to do away with its chemical weapons because they realized that they were far more a liability than ... any type of military or strategic asset.\"\n\nFor that reason, Sloboda found \"the accusations of large scale chemical weapon used by the Syrian government unconvincing, simply for that it makes no rational sense. Of course one of the arguments is the West are gearing for regime change in Syria always present is that they are not rational I don't accept that argument either.\"\n\nBecker asked what the American endgame in Syria is, and whether or not the US intended to establish a permanent military presence there.\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo/ Hassan AmmarSyria Has Right to Address UN as Alleged Western Chemical Weapons Found, Russian MP Says\n\nSloboda wasn't positive. \"There are 10 US military bases in northeast Syria in Kurdish-controlled territory. The US has no legal mandate to be in Syria doing anything, and they do not have the cooperation of the Syrian government. They are in violation of the UN charter by being there, they don't have any long-term mission in Syria. It is problematic for them that their only chosen standing proxies are the Kurds, because certainly Iraq, Turkey, and all the other regional forces do not want to see a Kurdish micro-state carved out of Syria.\"\n\n\"At this point I would presume that a large part of is being done simply for leverage in the final political settlement in Syria, and to declare that some type of victory was achieved at least over [Daesh] and paper over the rest of what has happened,\" Sloboda concluded.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "wgt": 100, "id": 1168, "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Wholesale and Distribution"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Products_and_Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 1169, "label": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Products and Services"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Basic_Chemicals", "wgt": 100, "id": 1171, "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Basic Chemicals"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Chemical_Engineering", "wgt": 100, "id": 1172, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Chemical Engineering"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Dyestuffs_and_Chemicals", "wgt": 100, "id": 1173, "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Dyestuffs and Chemicals"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "191"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Syrian Arab Republic"}, "type": "loc", "id": "212"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "type": "loc", "id": "12949"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "303396", "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303500", "label": {"eng": "Chemical warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303508", "label": {"eng": "Syrian people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "303517", "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304755", "label": {"eng": "Weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305246", "label": {"eng": "Syrian civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurdish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "305524", "label": {"eng": "Kurdish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306271", "label": {"eng": "Riot control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309009", "label": {"eng": "War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "310116", "label": {"eng": "Syrian opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Kurdistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "323229", "label": {"eng": "Syrian Kurdistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Ministers_(Syria)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "323397", "label": {"eng": "Council of Ministers (Syria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_endgame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "332570", "label": {"eng": "Chess endgame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "338516", "label": {"eng": "Nerve agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "338518", "label": {"eng": "Chemical weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Charter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "351597", "label": {"eng": "United Nations Charter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "362201", "label": {"eng": "Sarin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Weapons_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "372109", "label": {"eng": "Chemical Weapons Convention"}}]}

It reported symptoms including \"suffocation, breathing difficulties, blurry vision, and muscle weakness\" as well as \"pupil constriction and burning redness in the eyes.\"\n\nThe use of chlorine as a weapon would violate the CWC and three U.N. Security Council resolutions adopted in 2013 and 2015.\n\nMoscow has long backed the Assad regime's denials of responsibility for toxic weapons attacks like one in Idlib's Khan Sheikhun last April, which the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said involved the deadly nerve gas sarin, or a \"sarin-like\" substance.\n\nRussian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova was quick to respond to the latest claims by Mekdad, who said the materials had been discovered in Aleppo and suburbs of Damascus.\n\n\"Here you can see all their [the West's] commitment to international law and the triumph of democracy,\" Zakharova wrote on her Facebook page.\n\n\"Supplying chemical agents to terrorists and using photos of killed children as a pretext is beyond one's comprehension,\" she added.\n\nIn a subsequent interview, Zakharova expanded.\n\n\"The consequences of the war that has been raging in Syria for many years are now being analyzed and material evidence has started to emerge - it has been mentioned many times at various levels,\" the Tass news agency quoted her as telling Russia's Vesti FM radio station\n\n\"The fact is that the Western states and regional countries have directly or indirectly supplied banned poisonous substances to militants, terrorists and extremists active in Syria,\" she said.\n\nZakharova said Russian and international experts have long been drawing attention to the fact that Western countries, while claiming fealty to democratic principles and international law, \"supply militants with things necessary to continue military activities on the territory of an independent state.\"\n\nShe added that evidence of such support has been made available during bilateral Russia-U.S. talks.\n\nMekdad named two American and one British company as the manufacturers of the materials found. According to the companies' websites, they produce non-lethal riot and crowd control equipment for law enforcement, including CS irritant cartridges and stun grenades.\n\nThe Assad regime's SANA news agency reported that Mekdad called on the OPCW to investigate the provision by the U.S., Britain and Turkey of \"internationally-banned poisonous materials\" to rebel groups.\n\nHe also repeated charges that the U.S. had carried out the missile strike on an airbase in April based on \"the fabrications and lies of the terrorists who claimed that the Syrian Arab Army carried out a chemical attack on the city of Khan Sheikhun.\"\n\nRussia and the Assad regime have claimed variously that the gas in the April incident was released after a rebel chemical weapons storage facility was bombed, or that the entire episode was a \"false-flag\" operation designed to trigger U.S. military intervention.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41,

after the Assad regime allegedly carried out a chemical gas attack in the de-conflict zone in Damascus, Syria on 20 July 2017 [Alaa Muhammed/Anadolu Agency]\n\nThe non-governmental organisation, the Syrian Network for Human Rights, said that it had recorded the use of chemical weapons five times by the Syrian regime after the attack that targeted the city of Khan Shaykhun, in rural, Idlib last April.\n\nThe report, issued by the London-based network, documented chemical attacks conducted by the Syrian regime on opposition sites in Damascus as well as its hinterland.\n\nThe network also asserts that the Syrian regime did not stop using chemical weapons after the US administration's bombing of Shayrat airbase, from where aircraft carried out the attack on Khan Shaykhun took off.\n\nThe report noted that the Syrian regime has tended to carry out small chemical attacks that do not leave a large number of victims, fearing that huge attacks would draw the attention of the world and \"embarrass decision-makers and push them to respond.\"\n\nThe network said that in the newly-documented attacks, the Syrian regime mostly used gas-loaded grenades (believed to be chlorine gas).\n\nAccording to the report, the total number of chemical attacks between March 2011 and 31 July, 2017 reached more than 207 that caused the death of 1420 people, 1356 of whom are civilians, including 186 children and 244 women, as well as 57 opposition fighters and seven prisoners of the regime forces in opposition prisons, while at least 6672 people were injured.", "date": "2017-08-16",

It wasn't because of the games! So nothing, I just have to thank everyone who always supported me.\n\n\"It didn't happen the way I wanted it to.

official athletes village after allegedly creating an 'inappropriate environment.'\n\nAthletes competing in the Games take up residency in the village where competitors are allowed to mix together, train, eat and relax alongside one another.\n\nHowever, team Paraguay have asked one of their stars to leave the village after refusing to allow them to stay until the end of the competition that officially closes on Sunday, August 11.\n\nSwimmer Luana Alonso endured a torrid participation at the Games as she finished sixth in the 100m butterfly - 0.24 seconds behind Georgia's Ana Nizharadze - and narrowly missing out on qualifying for the semi-finals of the event.\n\nShe then sensationally announced her retirement from swimming in a social media post to her nearly 500,000 Instagram followers, but has remained in Paris ever since.\n\nParaguayan swimmer Luana Alonso has been removed from the official athletes village after allegedly creating an 'inappropriate

at the Games\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nNow, the Paraguayan team have removed the 20-year-old from the athletes village and cited Alonso's 'inappropriate behaviour' as justification for doing so as the Olympics enters its final week of competition.\n\nA statement from Larissa Schaerer, the head of the COP mission, read: 'Her presence is creating an inappropriate atmosphere within Team Paraguay.\n\n'We thank her for proceeding as instructed, as it was of her own free will that she did not spend the night in the Athletes' Village.'\n\nAlonso's Instagram story suggest she has since jetted back to the United States where she attends school after posting a short video on social media showing her driving towards a border control crossing.\n\nThe swimmer wasn't permitted by her team to remain at the athletes village until the end of the Games\n\nThe Paraguayan previously made her Olympic debut at the Tokyo Games four-years previous and is amongst the youngest competitors to retire at the age of just 20.\n\nConfirming her retirement last week, Alonso said: 'Swimming: thank you for allowing me to dream, you taught me to fight, to try, perseverance, sacrifice, discipline and many more.\n\n'I gave you part of my life and I don't change it for anything in the world because I lived the best experiences of my life, you gave me thousands of joys, friends from other

In the overall time, Team USA set the world record with a time of 3:49.63.\n\nWith that, the USA won its eighth gold medal in swimming at the Paris Olympics. That put it one ahead of Australia, who has long been a rival of the Americans in swimming. It was also the Australians who ended up taking silver in the Women's 4\u00d7100 meter medley. The Americans won 28 total medals in swimming, which was the most of any nation.\n\nFirst into the pool was Regan Smith on the backstroke. She established a short lead, which Lilly King then built on in the breaststroke. From there, Gretchen Walsh was dominant in the butterfly. By the time Torri Huske was in the pool for the freestyle final leg, it wasn't a question of whether or not the Americans would win gold, but if they'd break the world record.

On Thursday, the Philadelphia Union formally announced that they've signed their academy prospect to a Homegrown contract that will eventually land him with Manchester City.\n\n\"I tend not to even listen to what they call me or what they say about me. It's really just what I think of myself,\" Sullivan said. \"I don't really listen to anyone, whether it's good or bad. So it doesn't really get to me whatsoever.\"\n\nThe long-rumored deal -- said to be the richest Homegrown signing in Major League Soccer history, although no details were released -- allows the Union to continue to develop Sullivan and benefit in the short term from his ability, before profiting when he likely heads overseas to the Premier League. It also allows him to stay at home for a few more years.\n\nSullivan is considered one of the best young American players. In a match last April between the U.S. under-15 team and England in Spain, he scored both goals in a 2-2 draw that the Americans won in a penalty shootout.\n\nHe was named the best player at the CONCACAF under-15 championships.

He's made two appearances for the team, a step below the Union's senior squad.\n\nThe teen hopes to make his Union senior debut this year. If he does, he'll join his brother, Quinn, another academy product who has played for the team since 2021.\n\nSullivan (14 years, 224 days) is the fifth-youngest player to sign a first-team contract in MLS history. If he plays for the Union before July 29, he'll become the youngest player ever to appear in a match. Freddy Adu was 14 years, 306 days old when he debuted for D.C. United in 2004.\n\n\"I think Jim Curtin was really integral in getting Cavan here, if I'm being completely honest,\" said his dad, Brendan Sullivan. \"He called us, he reached out to us, he said, 'Look, I think he can play for me right away. With a little bit of a little bit of coaching, we think that he's ready and we're willing to take that on.'\"\n\nSullivan, a Philadelphia native, is the youngest of four brothers. Quinn, 20, is the oldest. Brendan Sullivan played professionally in the A-League, which eventually became the USL First Division, a tier below MLS. His mother, Heike, played at Penn. Grandfather Larry coached at Villanova from 1991-2007.\n\nSullivan said he first started to get attention by clubs when he was just 10.\n\n\"I think that's really when I thought, 'This is happening.' It didn't feel real but definitely triggered something in my mind where I was like, 'I can do this,'\" Sullivan said.\n\nSullivan can't play for Manchester City until he is 18. But he holds a German passport that could allow him to move to Europe and play for City-affiliated teams -- like Girona in Spain or Palermo in Italy -- when he turns 16.\n\nBecause of the collaborative transfer agreement with Manchester City, Sullivan's deal is unusual. It signals that the Premier League club trusts that the Union can develop an elite player.\n\nSullivan isn't looking too far ahead. In many ways he's a typical teenager, albeit a very gifted one. He jokes: \"I'm a pretty boring kid, to be honest.\"\n\n\"I mean, you can see him. He's a pretty even-keeled kid,\" his mother said. \"He really does that on his own.

In a match last April between the U.S. under-15 team and England in Spain, he scored both goals in a 2-2 draw that the Americans won in a penalty shootout.\n\nHe was named the best player at the CONCACAF under-15 championships. He had a pair of assists in the 4-2 victory over Mexico in the final.\n\nUnion coach Jim Curtin recently called Sullivan 'a special talent, top talent not only in this country but in the world.'\n\nSullivan has already made his professional debut, coming off the bench for the Union's MLS NEXT team last month and getting an assist on the game-winning goal. He's made two appearances for the team, a step below the Union's senior squad.\n\nThe teen hopes to make his Union senior debut this year. If he does, he'll join his brother, Quinn, another academy product who has played for the team since 2021.\n\nIt allows the Union to continue to develop Sullivan and benefit in the short term from his ability, before profiting when he likely heads overseas to the Premier League\n\nSullivan (14 years, 224 days) is the fifth-youngest player to sign a first-team contract in MLS history. If he plays for the Union before July 29, he'll become the youngest player ever to appear in a match. Freddy Adu was 14 years, 306 days old when he debuted for D.C. United in 2004.\n\n'I think Jim Curtin was really integral in getting Cavan here, if I'm being completely honest,' said his dad, Brendan Sullivan. 'He called us, he reached out to us, he said, \"Look, I think he can play for me right away. With a little bit of a little bit of coaching, we think that he's ready and we're willing to take that on.\"'\n\nSullivan, a Philadelphia native, is the youngest of four brothers. Quinn, 20, is the oldest. Brendan Sullivan played professionally in the A-League, which eventually became the USL First Division, a tier below MLS. His mother, Heike, played at Penn. Grandfather Larry coached at Villanova from 1991-2007.\n\nSullivan said he first started to get attention by clubs when he was just 10.\n\n'I think that's really when I thought, \"This is happening.\" It didn\u00b4t feel real but definitely triggered something in my mind where I was like, \"I can do this,\"' Sullivan said.\n\nAt 18 he will sign for one of the best teams in world soccer in City, who won a historic Treble last season\n\nSullivan can't play for City until he is 18. But he holds a German passport that could allow him to move to Europe and play for City-affiliated teams - like Girona in Spain or Palermo in Italy - when he turns 16.\n\nBecause of the collaborative transfer agreement with Manchester City, Sullivan's deal is unusual. It signals that the Premier League club trusts that the Union can develop an elite player.\n\nSullivan isn't looking too far ahead. In many ways he's a typical teenager, albeit a very gifted one. He jokes: 'I'm a pretty boring kid, to be honest.'\n\n'I mean, you can see him. He's a pretty even-keeled kid,' his mother said. 'He really does that on his own. I'm sure we help keep him grounded, but I think he is already grounded, and I think he should get a lot of credit for that.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_under-16_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national under-16 football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Pepi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ricardo Pepi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Curtin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Curtin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Dallas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Dallas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augsburg", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Augsburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Augsburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CONCACAF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-League_Men", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A-League Men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_Wildcats", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Villanova Wildcats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddy_Adu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freddy Adu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USL_First_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USL First Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treble_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treble (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.C._United", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D.C.

On Thursday, the Philadelphia Union formally announced that they've signed their academy prospect to a Homegrown contract that will eventually land him with Manchester City.\n\n\"I tend not to even listen to what they call me or what they say about me. It's really just what I think of myself,\" Sullivan said. \"I don't really listen to anyone, whether it's good or bad. So it doesn't really get to me whatsoever.\"\n\nThe long-rumored deal - said to be the richest Homegrown signing in Major League Soccer history, although no details were released - allows the Union to continue to develop Sullivan and benefit in the short term from his ability, before profiting when he likely heads overseas to the Premier League. It also allows him to stay at home for a few more years.\n\nSullivan is considered one of the best young American players. In a match last April between the U.S. under-15 team and England in Spain, he scored both goals in a 2-2 draw that the Americans won in a penalty shootout.\n\nHe was named the best player at the CONCACAF under-15 championships. He had a pair of assists in the 4-2 victory over Mexico in the final.\n\nUnion coach Jim Curtin recently called Sullivan \"a special talent, top talent not only in this country but in the world.\"\n\nSullivan has already made his professional debut, coming off the bench for the Union's MLS NEXT team last month and getting an assist on the game-winning goal. He's made two appearances for the team, a step below the Union's senior squad.\n\nThe teen hopes to make his Union senior debut this year. If he does, he'll join his brother, Quinn, another academy product who has played for the team since 2021.\n\nSullivan (14 years, 224 days) is the fifth-youngest player to sign a first-team contract in MLS history. If he plays for the Union before July 29, he'll become the youngest player ever to appear in a match. Freddy Adu was 14 years, 306 days old when he debuted for D.C. United in 2004.\n\n\"I think Jim Curtin was really integral in getting Cavan here, if I'm being completely honest,\" said his dad, Brendan Sullivan. \"He called us, he reached out to us, he said, 'Look, I think he can play for me right away. With a little bit of a little bit of coaching, we think that he's ready and we're willing to take that on.'\"\n\nSullivan, a Philadelphia native, is the youngest of four brothers. Quinn, 20, is the oldest. Brendan Sullivan played professionally in the A-League, which eventually became the USL First Division, a tier below MLS. His mother, Heike, played at Penn. Grandfather Larry coached at Villanova from 1991-2007.\n\nSullivan said he first started to get attention by clubs when he was just 10.\n\n\"I think that's really when I thought, 'This is happening.' It didn't feel real but definitely triggered something in my mind where I was like, 'I can do this,'\" Sullivan said.\n\nSullivan can't play for Manchester City until he is 18. But he holds a German passport that could allow him to move to Europe and play for City-affiliated teams - like Girona in Spain or Palermo in Italy - when he turns 16.\n\nBecause of the collaborative transfer agreement with Manchester City, Sullivan's deal is unusual. It signals that the Premier League club trusts that the Union can develop an elite player.\n\nSullivan isn't looking too far ahead. In many ways he's a typical teenager, albeit a very gifted one. He jokes: \"I'm a pretty boring kid, to be honest.\"\n\n\"I mean, you can see him. He's a pretty even-keeled kid,\" his mother said. \"He really does that on his own. I'm sure we help keep him grounded, but I think he is already grounded, and I think he should get a lot of credit for that.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anne_m_peterson@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Anne M.

They're like every kid's dream team. For them to come together and agree on something -- I sat with my family and my agents and we decided that it was the best plan.\"\n\nSullivan's older brother, Quinn, plays for the Union's first team and two other brothers, Ronan and Declan, are in the club's youth academy.\n\n\"I've been watching my home team, the Union, for as long as I remember and hoped that one day I'd get the chance to play for my city in front of my family, friends, and fans,\" Sullivan said in the club's release.\n\n\"Being able to not only play for the Union but to be able to play with my brother is a dream come true.

His older brother, Quinn, 20, has been a first-team player since 2021.\n\n\"I've always wanted to start my career here because this is my home and I've always been on the sidelines of Quinn's games and I've been in and around the facility when my uncle worked here,\" Sullivan told ESPN. \"So, I've always been inspired and to play in front of this culture, and these fans are special.\n\n- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)\n\n\"But I also think the collaboration between the Union and the City Group was -- I think that did it for me. I always watch Man City. They're like every kid's dream team. For [Philadelphia and Man City] to come together and agree on something -- I sat with my family and my agents and we decided that it was the best plan.\"\n\nFinancial details were not disclosed.\n\nSullivan is the fifth-youngest player to a sign a first-team contract in league history. If he appears for the Union before July 29 -- which is the expectation -- he would surpass onetime prodigy Freddy Adu as the youngest player to appear in MLS.\n\n\"I think it would be cool to obviously have my first record, but it doesn't really matter to me if I beat it or not,\" Sullivan said of Adu's record. \"I mean, everyone's on their own journey. It's not really where you start, it's about where you finish.\"\n\nOn whether Sullivan will debut before July 29, Union coach Jim Curtin told ESPN: \"If he's healthy, he'll do it.\"\n\nEver since Adu flamed out and his career turned into a cautionary tale of unfair expectations and unmet hype, there has been a collective temptation in the United States to cringe at comparing him to others who have come since. By signing at such an early age, Cavan Sullivan -- and his family and the club -- knew they were inviting outsized expectations in a similar vein.\n\nBy signing with the Union, staying at home with his parents and playing with his older brother, the hope is that remaining in a familiar, comfortable environment will ease the transition.\n\n\"I think he's a pretty mature kid. I think he gets some of it,\" said Brendan Sullivan, Cavan's father. \"That's not to say we don't think there's going to be bumps along the way. We definitely know that. And I think that's part of the reason this collaboration between the Union and City Group is so important, because he really does have a safety net here.\n\n\"I mean, Jim Curtin is integral in the fact that this deal even got done. I think he's on board, and he's willing to give Cavan the tutelage he needs to get him up to running and at the level.\"\n\nThe Curtin and Sullivan families have a long shared history. Curtin played for Cavan's grandfather, Larry Sullivan, as a teenager and as a college player at Villanova, where Larry Sullivan was the head soccer coach from 1991 to 2007. As such, Curtin has been aware of Cavan Sullivan's development since he was very young.\n\n\"I knew Quinn, and Cavan was the youngest son.

His older brother, Quinn, 20, has been a first-team player since 2021.\n\n\"I've always wanted to start my career here because this is my home and I've always been on the sidelines of Quinn's games and I've been in and around the facility when my uncle worked here,\" Sullivan told ESPN. \"So, I've always been inspired and to play in front of this culture, and these fans are special.\n\n\"But I also think the collaboration between the Union and the City Group was -- I think that did it for me. I always watch Man City. They're like every kid's dream team. For [Philadelphia and Man City] to come together and agree on something -- I sat with my family and my agents and we decided that it was the best plan.\"\n\nSullivan is the fifth-youngest player to a sign a first-team contract in league history. If he appears for the Union before July 29 -- which is the expectation -- he would surpass onetime prodigy Freddy Adu as the youngest player to appear in MLS.\n\n\"I think it would be cool to obviously have my first record, but it doesn't really matter to me if I beat it or not,\" Sullivan said of Adu's record. \"I mean, everyone's on their own journey. It's not really where you start, it's about where you finish.\"\n\nOn whether Sullivan will debut before July 29, Union coach Jim Curtin told ESPN: \"If he's healthy, he'll do it.\"\n\nEver since Adu flamed out and his career turned into a cautionary tale of unfair expectations and unmet hype, there has been a collective temptation in the United States to cringe at comparing him to others who have come since. By signing at such an early age, Cavan Sullivan -- and his family and the club -- knew they were inviting outsized expectations in a similar vein.\n\nBy signing with the Union, staying at home with his parents and playing with his older brother, the hope is that remaining in a familiar, comfortable environment will ease the transition.\n\n\"I think he's a pretty mature kid. I think he gets some of it,\" said Brendan Sullivan, Cavan's father. \"That's not to say we don't think there's going to be bumps along the way. We definitely know that. And I think that's part of the reason this collaboration between the Union and City Group is so important, because he really does have a safety net here.\n\n\"I mean, Jim Curtin is integral in the fact that this deal even got done. I think he's on board, and he's willing to give Cavan the tutelage he needs to get him up to running and at the level.\"\n\nThe Curtin and Sullivan families have a long shared history. Curtin played for Cavan's grandfather, Larry Sullivan, as a teenager and as a college player at Villanova, where Larry Sullivan was the head soccer coach from 1991 to 2007. As such, Curtin has been aware of Cavan Sullivan's development since he was very young.\n\n\"I knew Quinn, and Cavan was the youngest son. As it often goes, the youngest tries to keep up with his older brothers -- he has two older twin brothers that are also good players,\" Curtin said. \"So, you'd see them around on different sporting fields all over the Philadelphia area, and the legend of Cavan kind of grew.\"\n\nStill, it would have been impossible to foresee this kind of rise.\n\nCavan Sullivan's maternal grandfather is from Germany, and he has held a German passport from a young age.

I always watch Man City. They're like every kid's dream team. For them [Philadelphia and Man City] to come together and agree on something -- I sat with my family and my agents and we decided that it was the best plan.\"\n\nFinancial details were not disclosed.\n\nSullivan is the fifth-youngest player to a sign a first-team contract in league history and if he appears for the Union before July 29 - which is the expectation - he would surpass one-time prodigy Freddy Adu as the youngest player to appear in MLS.\n\n\"I think it would be cool to obviously have my first record, but it doesn't really matter to me if I beat it or not,\" Sullivan said of Adu's record. \"I mean, everyone's on their own journey. It's not really where you start, it's about where you finish.\"\n\nOn if Sullivan will debut before July 29, Union coach Jim Curtin told ESPN: \"If he's healthy, he'll do it.\"\n\nEver since Adu flamed out and his career turned into a cautionary tale of unfair expectations and unmet hype, there has been a collective temptation in the United States to cringe at comparing him to others that have come since. By signing at such an early age, Sullivan - and his family and the club - knew they were inviting outsized expectations in a similar vein.\n\nBy signing with the Union, staying at home with his parents and playing with his older brother, the hope is that remaining in a familiar, comfortable environment will ease the transition.\n\n\"I think he's a pretty mature kid. I think he gets some of it,\" said Brendan Sullivan, Cavan's father. \"That's not to say we don't think there's going to be bumps along the way. We definitely know that. And I think that's part of the reason this collaboration between the Union and City Group is so important because he really does have a safety net here.\n\n\"I mean Jim Curtin is integral in the fact that this deal even got done and I think he's on board and he's willing to give Cavan the tutelage he needs to get him up to running and at the level.\"\n\nThe Curtin and Sullivan families have a long, shared history. Curtin played for Cavan's grandfather, Larry Sullivan, as a teenager and as a college player at Villanova, where Sullivan was the head soccer coach from 1991-2007. As such, Curtin has been aware of Cavan's development since he was very young.\n\n\"I knew Quinn and Cavan was the youngest son. As it often goes, the youngest tries to keep up with his older brothers -- he has two older twin brothers that are also good players,\" Curtin said. \"So, you'd see them around on different sporting fields all over the Philadelphia area and the legend of Cavan kind of grew.\"\n\nStill, it would have been impossible to foresee this kind of rise.\n\nSullivan's maternal grandfather is from Germany and he has held a German passport from a young age. When Quinn started going on trials with European clubs as a young teenager, Cavan would also get to go, which is when the realistic possibility of a European move started to crystalize. About four years ago, they both trialed at Borussia Dortmund -- Quinn with the U17s; Cavan with the U13 or U14s -- and Cavan remembers thinking from then on that he could see himself eventually playing in Europe.\n\nBut, for now, the focus is on breaking through with the Union in a meaningful way.\n\n\"I guess my goal is just to become a regular player within the next two years,\" he said. \"And then after that I would hope to be a starter. I guess that's from the 16 to 18 age window. And then right when I'm 18 I hope to be at the level of the Man City first team.\"\n\nIf Sullivan progresses rapidly, there is also the possibility he could move to Europe as early as 16, but in that scenario, he would not be permitted to play in England. City Football group owns clubs in Spain (Girona), Belgium (Lommel S.K.), Italy (Palermo) and France (Troyes) that could serve as potential development stops.\n\n\"When the time is right, the game tells the truth,\" Curtin said. \"You can trick it for a game or two or a half, but over the course of a season, if Cavan has a season where it shows that he's above the level in MLS, he'll move on.\"\n\nSullivan's best position is still yet to be determined but he's an attacking player that is dynamic with the ball at his feet and confident taking on defenders. Curtin said he could serve as a second striker or an attacking player and that his versatility will be an asset for the Union.\n\n\"I would say the big word is 'playmaker,'\" Sullivan said. \"That's what I try and be every game, every training. I think I'm good on the dribble. My decision making is pretty good and my vision on the field is one of my qualities.\"\n\nSullivan has appeared twice for the Union II in MLS NEXT Pro, registering one assist in 58 minutes.\n\n\"I haven't really done anything yet, haven't even made my debut,\" Sullivan said. \"So, there's still a lot of room for improvement, a lot of development to go. But definitely still excited for what's ahead.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddy_Adu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freddy Adu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Curtin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jim Curtin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cavan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cavan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villanova_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villanova University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ES_Troyes_AC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ES Troyes AC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lommel_S.K.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lommel S.K."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playmaker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playmaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palermo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palermo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palermo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Girona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Girona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0508%2Fr1330216_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553314", "eventUri": "eng-9553314", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-07-29", "textStart": 1391, "textEnd": 1398, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

But the unique deal allows him to remain with his boyhood club through 2028 before making the switch to England.\n\nPhiladelphia sporting director, Ernst Tanner, previously helped discover and develop the likes of Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane, David Alaba, and Dominik Szoboszlai, during former roles with Hoffenheim and RB Salzburg. Sullivan is one of the greatest talents that Tanner has ever seen, and he's already compared the American midfielder to Szoboszlai who is now impressing at Liverpool.\n\nREAD MORE: MLS stars told how to stop Lionel Messi as history-making season gathers pace\n\nREAD MORE: Lionel Messi sets MLS record as Luis Suarez scores hat-trick in Inter Miami rout\n\n\"He is one of the biggest talents on the globe... Cavan is a top three young talent I've seen in my 30-year career,\" Tanner said when agreeing to sign Sullivan at Philadelphia on senior terms. \"I'd say comparatively he reminds me of signing Dominik Szoboszlai.\"\n\nSullivan was playing for Philadelphia Union II in MLS Next Pro, but teams had been keeping tabs on the youngster who was representing their U17 side aged 13, and also impressing for the United States U15 national team. Despite being linked with moves away from Philadelphia, the unique deal reached between the Union and City made perfect sense to Sullivan.\n\n\"The collaboration between the Union and the City Group was -- I think that did it for me,\" Sullivan told ESPN. \"I always watch Man City. They're like every kid's dream team. For them [Philadelphia and Man City] to come together and agree on something -- I sat with my family and my agents and we decided that it was the best plan.\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nSullivan will join his older brother, Quinn, at the Union, who started playing in their first team back in 2021. Cavan has already been handed the No. 6 shirt at Philadelphia, and could make his MLS debut in weeks to come.\n\n\"Cavan is undeniably a rare and extraordinary talent. At just 14 years old his natural skill and vision are far beyond his years,\" Tanner added in a release on Thursday. \"His advanced soccer IQ, paired with his ability to read plays, advance the ball, and score, show just how high his ceiling will be.\n\n\"We are incredibly pleased to have come to an agreement to have Cavan join the Union on his first professional contract and have no doubt about the impact he will make with the club.\" The deal allows Philadelphia to hold onto their prized asset for four more years, and City will have the opportunity to activate their clause assuming that Sullivan progresses as expected.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_mcbride@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Joseph McBride", "type":

But for now he has chosen to start with his hometown team. Here's the inside story of why he picked the Union.\n\nCavan Sullivan hadn't even played a second of professional soccer when the world started crowning him as the game's best 14-year-old prospect.\n\nNot just better than anyone in Union history, or MLS history, or U.S. national team history. Better than anyone from the entire planet: France, Brazil, England, Argentina, and the rest of soccer's royalty.\n\nSuperpower teams beat a path to the Sullivans' door, led by reigning English Premier League and UEFA Champions League titleholders Manchester City. So did Germany's Borussia Dortmund, which has perhaps the sport's best track record of developing young stars, and other Bundesliga clubs.\n\nMan City won the family's affection, and in a few years, it will be Cavan's new home. But before then, the precocious attacking midfielder is starting his pro career at the club where he has grown up: the Union.\n\n\"It means everything. This is the best city in my eyes ... I wouldn't want to start anywhere else.\"\n\nSullivan has signed a first-team contract with his hometown club. The plan is for him to play at Subaru Park until he's 18, then head to Manchester and try to earn stardom in the Premier League. When the time comes, City will pay up to $5 million in the deal.\n\nExactly when he'll make his Union first-team debut remains to be seen. It could be later this year during the Leagues Cup tournament if all goes right. For now, he'll play with the reserve team, and that's fine. What matters most is that he's here.\n\n\"It means everything,\" Sullivan told The Inquirer in an exclusive interview, with his parents by his side. \"This is the best city in my eyes, in terms of just the fans, the culture, the energy that the fans bring and the city brings. I wouldn't want to start anywhere else.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: 'The sky's the limit' for 14-year-old Cavan Sullivan, the Union's best-ever prospect\n\nThe family part is no overstatement. Multiple generations of Sullivans have lived in Bridesburg, with the latest ones residing in Norristown to accommodate life with four kids. As Cavan's father, Brendan, put it, \"We're 191,\" referring to the first three digits of Philadelphia zip codes.\n\n\"I was thrilled with Cav's decision to decide to start his career here, play with his brother, drive in every day with his brother, live in the house for a couple more years,\" Brendan Sullivan said. \"19124, 19137, those were our zip codes [in the city]. We were bought in through birthright, for better or for worse.\"\n\nCavan's mother, Heike, also played a key role, fueled by her own soccer background. The veteran Ballard Spahr attorney captained Penn's women's soccer team in 1994 and '95, while Brendan played for the Quakers' men. At Temple's law school, she researched issues with MLS's corporate structure. Her Ballard colleagues have included John Langel, the longtime lawyer for the U.S. women's players union.\n\n\" READ MORE: Cavan Sullivan had a game-winning assist in his debut with the Union's reserve team in March\n\nHeike became the family's point person, declining comment even to people she knows well -- and even as international journalists made claims she knew were false.\n\n\"For me, that was one of the most bizarre things: to see the things in the news that were stated as though they were certain, and go, 'That ain't true,'\" she said. \"It's just not a world I live in. So yeah, it was strange.\"\n\nAnd she made sure it never became more than that.\n\n\"It wasn't upsetting,\" she said. \"It's just sort of like, 'Wow, first of all, some of the details that are right, how are they out there? And then some of the details that are just completely wrong, how and why are they out there?' ... It's not worth getting upset about, but it was fascinating to watch this news come out.\"\n\nFor many months, the dream of Sullivan playing for the Union was on the cusp of becoming a nightmare. Scouts, journalists, and even many people at the Union were convinced that Cavan would spurn the club he's been part of since elementary school.\n\nAnd where his oldest brother, Quinn, plays for the first team.\n\nAnd where their other brothers, Ronan and Declan, are in the youth academy.\n\nAnd where Brendan teaches history at the team's high school in Chester for elite soccer prospects.\n\nAnd where the manager, Jim Curtin, played collegiately at Villanova for a coaching staff that had Brendan as an assistant and his father, Larry Sullivan, as head coach.\n\nIt was all heading for disaster -- until suddenly, in late March, it wasn't. That's when word first got out that Cavan was going to turn pro here.\n\n\"We feel as if this is the best possible deal for Cavan, for our family, for Philadelphia. It really is a win-win-win.\"\n\nAfter a few more weeks, all the paperwork finally got over the line.\n\n\"We feel as if this is the best possible deal for Cavan, for our family, for Philadelphia,\" Brendan said. \"It really is a win-win-win.\"\n\nHow close did it come to not happening?\n\n\"It just took a lot of back and forth, I'm not going to lie,\" Brendan said. \"It was long, it was protracted. In the early stages, this probably wasn't going to get done. But it did get done.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: Why Cavan Sullivan signing with the Union came so close to not happening\n\nWhen Cavan turns 16 in September 2025, that same month will mark 25 years since the start of Jim Curtin's senior season at Villanova. It was also when Brendan joined his father's coaching staff there.\n\nTheir histories have been intertwined ever since, and now there's a new chapter. The move that broke months of stalemate between the Sullivans and the Union came when Curtin called his old coach.\n\n\"We really think a lot of credit goes to Jim, if I'm being honest,\" Brendan said. \"For pushing this along, coming in at the 11th hour and saying, 'Let's do it. We think he's ready.'\"\n\nThat message, Sullivan said, \"was a big, big point for us.\" And a day after he received it, Union principal owner Jay Sugarman received it, and called Brendan Sullivan to set up a meeting.\n\n\" READ MORE: Union resersve team coach Marlon LeBlanc praises Cavan Sullivan for keeping cool amid the hype\n\n\"That's where it really started to look like, hey, this could work,\" Sullivan said. \"And it doesn't happen without Jim.\"\n\nHad that last push failed, the Sullivan family would have waited until Cavan turns 16, the earliest he could join a team in the European Union. He'd have turned pro with one of Manchester City's feeder teams, Lommel SK of Belgium's second division. And the Union's years of investment in Cavan would have gone up in smoke.\n\nBut now there's no need to worry, thanks to the former student who's now the master of the local soccer scene.\n\n\"At times he was probably in the dark, at times we were in the dark,\" Brendan Sullivan said, \"but he and I had a couple of really good conversations. And when I say he pushed it along, he pushed it along. A lot of the credit, Jim deserves.\"\n\nCavan Sullivan is the 24th player in the Union's 15-year history to rise from the youth ranks to the pros. It's an exceptional record, and it is made even more so by the names involved.\n\nBrenden and Paxten Aaronson, Mark McKenzie, and Auston Trusty lead the ranks of renowned alumni. Jack McGlynn, Nathan Harriel, Quinn Sullivan, and David Vazquez highlight the current team. Steffen and Christian Pulisic played for Union youth teams as children before earning fame elsewhere.\n\n\"I know that this club has what it takes to develop me and get to where I want to be.\"\n\nThey built the foundation on which Cavan Sullivan now stands. And they show the Union know how to handle young stars on and off the field.\n\n\"It's an honor that they look at me the way they do, and that they recognize the abilities that I have,\" Cavan said. \"And I feel safe in their hands, just by looking at their track record and the pipeline. Because if they keep pumping out players going to Europe, it's just like, I know that this club has what it takes to develop me and get to where I want to be.\"\n\nAs Brendan spoke on the subject, he knew the weight his remarks would carry.\n\n\"I'd be lying if I didn't say that the Sullivans as a whole, all Sullivans, feel a certain level of responsibility to that foundation, and a huge debt of gratitude, specifically to the Graham family,\" he said, referring to longtime academy bankrollers Richie and Steve Graham.\n\n\"How generous they've been to all soccer players,\" Brendan continued, \"but they've been extremely generous to the Sullivans. So we felt a responsibility, and we had hoped beyond hope that something could get done with Philadelphia because of that.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: A ski school, a Wayne office park, and a 'godfather' may be the secret to USMNT World Cup success\n\nThe gleam of Manchester City's sky-blue jerseys hides uncomfortable truths for players who wear it.\n\nThough City Football Group owns feeder teams around the world -- including MLS's New York City FC, one of the Union's biggest rivals -- very few players have risen all the way through the pipeline. Far more have fallen down it instead, such as Downingtown-born U.S. national team goalkeeper Zack Steffen.\n\nCity also isn't known for promoting its own young talent. Star midfielder Phil Foden, as famous as he is, is the exception. The players who surround him and thrill audiences worldwide have mostly been bought, and mostly for huge sums: Erling Haaland, Kevin de Bruyne, Bernardo Silva, and so on.\n\n\"I'm humble enough to realize that it is going to be a challenge, it is going to be hard ... But I'm also confident enough to say I believe I can do this.\"\n\nNot only must Sullivan try to do what no American has ever done in England, but he must buck City's own history.\n\n\"I'm humble enough to realize that it is going to be a challenge, it is going to be hard -- I mean, the greatest club in the world, arguably,\" said Cavan, who is still growing at 5-foot-7 and 150 pounds. \"So I know there's going to be spots I'm going to have to fight for throughout the way. But I'm also confident enough to say I believe I can do this. I do trust my abilities.\"\n\nHe trusts his work ethic, too.\n\n\"As long as I continue to work and develop my game,\" he said, \"I would say at the rate I'm doing it now, I think I'll be all right.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: Union fans should treasure watching Jack McGlynn, because they might not be able to for much longer\n\nBrendan admitted there was a time when they weren't sure City was the right fit. They first visited Dortmund in September 2020, and kept up relations along the way.\n\n\"We have met some great people at Dortmund over the years,\" he said. \"They were amazing to us and really great people. We always thought Dortmund would probably be a great fit. It's probably the most tested, obviously, and with great success.\"\n\nHeike made pro-and-con lists for every potential club, and made sure he went through every step.\n\n\"He hated the exercise,\" she said. \"I'm a mom, right?\"\n\nWhen the time came for the ultimate decision, the parents let their son make it. And his reflection on that brought a moment to remember that he really is still just 14.\n\n\"I mean, just the name Man City pops out to almost every kid, and they're the most fun team to watch in the world right now,\" Cavan said, the stars clearly shining in his eyes. \"Especially for myself, I look up to and use players like Bernardo Silva and Foden, to try and play like them. It's just always been a dream of mine to also play in the Premier League, and with the plan the Union and the City group created to get there at 18 -- which is a young age -- that just seemed ideal for me.\"\n\nBoth parents were convinced not just by City's sizzle, but by its substance.\n\n\"The level of detail that Man City went down to in terms of the plan, the development, all the different variations and pivot points at which things could change, could toggle into something else,\" Brendan said, \"the level of scouting they did on Cavan, the level of scouting they did against other people in other countries all over, it was ridiculous. ... We truly had to look at each other and be like, 'This can't be real, that they did this amount.'\"\n\n\" READ MORE: Quinn Sullivan shines for the Union while younger brother Cavan commands headlines\n\nHe named academy head of recruitment Samuel Fagbeni and City Football Group's director of football transactions Carlos \"Rafi\" Moersen (who lived in the U.S. for many years) as particularly influential.\n\n\"Obviously it's a business, everybody's trying to make money, but it felt at least to me like there was a desire to develop him,\" Heike added. \"I know at the end of the day there's money in that, too, but I felt like at the end, egos got out of the way.\"\n\nThat included working with the Union to a surprising degree.\n\n\"These guys, their willingness to cooperate, for us only highlighted more how interested they were in Cavan, how much they believe in him, because it is so much work,\" Brendan said. \"And [for] the Union to say, 'Look, we're also willing to discuss this. We think we can sit at the table and create something that's new.' ... Yeah, I am surprised, because it doesn't exist, this sort of cooperation.\"\n\nIt was not a given that City would agree to the Sullivans' desire that Cavan start his pro career with the Union.\n\n\"He couldn't be any happier than to start here, rather than some team in Belgium or Spain or Italy,\" Brendan said. \"It says a lot about the Union that Manchester City is willing to cooperate and sit at the table, and say, 'Look, we think that this is the best place for him to start at this point.'\"\n\nIt sure does. The more time you spend in the soccer world, the more cynical you get. But the more time you spend around the Union, the more you see how truly extraordinary they are at youth development.\n\nIt's not just the quantity, the names on the back, and the names on the front of the European clubs' jerseys those famed alumni now wear. It's that the Union have created a litany of creative, skilled, attacking players -- the kind of players it was long assumed Americans could not be.\n\n\" READ MORE: The Union want to expand Subaru Park, but know it won't be easy: 'We want to be better, bigger'\n\nWhen Richie Graham opened YSC Academy 11 years ago, he dreamed of beating that assumption. Today, the dream is as close as ever to coming true. Cavan Sullivan is the seventh creative midfielder to reach the Union's first team in the last six years.\n\n\"Richie Graham would tell you it's culture. It's what he stands on, it's what he's built it on,\" Brendan Sullivan said. \"It's on some level, really Jim's culture. But from the ownership down, it's really been a culture of trying to stand on the group that came before you.\"\n\nAnd he sees it every day in his history classroom.\n\n\"Every kid in the building wants to star here. ...

Now he'll coach Cavan as the 14-year-old begins his road toward hoped-for soccer stardom.\n\nUnion manager Jim Curtin doesn't get emotional in public very often. Maybe when one of his players scores a big goal, but that's about it.\n\nOn Thursday, though, Curtin was nearly moved to tears over one aspect of Cavan Sullivan's arrival to the big time.\n\nA quarter-century ago, Cavan's grandfather Larry was Curtin's college coach at Villanova. In Curtin's senior season, Cavan's father Brendan joined the Wildcats' coaching staff.\n\nNow Curtin is coaching the 14-year-old who might become the best ever from a family that he called \"kind of Philadelphia soccer royalty.\"\n\n\"There's an element of debt, excitement, a kind of full-circle moment,\" Curtin said at a news conference in Cavan's honor Thursday at Subaru Park. The precocious attacking midfielder sat next to him on stage, and much of the Sullivan family -- Brendan, mother Heike, and fellow sons Quinn, Ronan, and Declan -- sat in the front row of the seats.\n\n\" READ MORE: Why Cavan Sullivan, hyped as the world's best 14-year-old soccer player, chose to turn pro with the Union\n\nCurtin praised Larry as \"a guy that taught me so much about the game, about being a leader a person, and a good soccer player as well,\" and called Brendan \"the first guy that I saw that was a professional-level player, that I saw day-in and day-out.\"\n\nThough MLS's launch in 1996 was a year before Curtin started at Villanova, American players were still hard to find. The sport certainly wasn't like what it is now, where there are countless players and fans can watch every big league worldwide.\n\nSullivan's signing with the Union is a symbol of that, too. For as much as everyone wanted him to start his pro career at the hometown club, the Union still had to make an offer worth picking over starting at England's Manchester City, Germany's Borussia Dortmund, or other big European clubs that wanted him.\n\nIn the end, Sullivan will get the best of both worlds. He'll play for the Union until he's 18, then move to Man City for a pre-agreed price of around $5 million.\n\nAnd he'll get paid plenty before then. Sullivan signed the largest homegrown player contract in Major League Soccer history, multiple sources told The Inquirer, with the league breaking its homegrown player salary cap -- around $200,000 a year -- to get the deal done.\n\n\" READ MORE: 'Cavan is special': Union's Ernst Tanner says Cavan Sullivan is one of the best he's ever seen\n\nIt will be just over $500,000 per season, one source with knowledge of the matter said, surpassing a special benchmark in league history: the salary that Freddy Adu, American soccer's first 14-year-old phenom, earned as a rookie with D.C. United 20 years ago.\n\nMLS wasn't ready for a player of his age back then, and Adu endured a tumultuous career that included 20 months with the Union from 2011-13.\n\nThe landscape is far better now, and the Union are a big reason why. Their youth academy includes a full-time high school for top prospects that Cavan attends, that his oldest brother Quinn -- now a Union first-team veteran -- attended before, and that Brendan works at as a history teacher.\n\nOn top of that, the Union have sent some of those players on to big international stages. Brenden and Paxten Aaronson, Mark McKenzie, and Auston Trusty all grew up here, play in major European leagues, and have been with the senior U.S. national team.\n\n\"We have a track record now,\" academy director Jon Scheer said. \"We have a history of developing players within our academy, within MLS, and transitioning them on to bigger clubs in the global game ... I think we now have a proof of concept with our competitive strategy that families and players can truly believe in.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: Is Cavan Sullivan really that good? Here's what to know about the Union academy and its teen phenom.\n\nOf course, lots of people in town want to know when Sullivan will play for the Union's first team. Curtin preached patience, but also didn't hide from Sullivan's immense potential.\n\n\"The game will tell us,\" he said. \"He's going to work hard and get on the field on merit first and foremost. But I'll just say publicly, it's a lot closer than people realize. Our team, whatever we need that week, he's going to be called upon quickly, because he deserves it.\"\n\nThe odds are that if we're going to see Sullivan with the first team this year, it will be during the late-summer Leagues Cup tournament instead of the regular season. The Union's group stage opener is July 27, and if Sullivan plays in that game he'll break Adu's record for MLS's youngest ever player by two days.\n\nSullivan will definitely play for the Union's reserve team before then, and probably often. Coach Marlon LeBlanc has known Sullivan since he was eight years old, and Sullivan has already played for the reserves as an amateur a few times. In his debut on March 24, he came off the bench and created the game-winning assist.\n\n\" READ MORE: Cavan Sullivan wants 'to win the World Cup with the USA'\n\n\"My job is to put him in a position to be successful,\" LeBlanc said. Everybody wants to see Cavan out there on Saturday night [when the first team plays], but Cavan understands the process to get to Saturday night. We're going to make sure that he's learning, he's progressing, and he's held accountable as well.\"\n\nBut they'll also let him express himself on the field.\n\n\"We're not going to stifle his creativity,\" LeBlanc said. \"We're going to give him a platform to do it, but we're going to make sure that he does it the right way. And I know Cav, and he's going to do it the right way -- and he doesn't want it any other way, and that's one of the best things about working with Cavan.\"\n\nIt matters a lot to LeBlanc, and the organization as a whole, that Sullivan should have the time and space to be a kid.\n\n\"He's good enough to play and be there, but I want to make sure that people remember that he's 14 years old,\" he said. \"That will be a big part of his development: him getting to stay in his home, in his bed, in his house, with his family, is only going to speed that part up too.

He scored four goals, earning the Golden Ball as the best player in the tournament. He has ascended as a Union Academy product since 2020, to the club's Under-15 MLS NEXT team, U17 MLS Next team and the club's second team earlier this year.\n\nSullivan was born on Sept. 28, 2009 in Philadelphia, and was listed as 5-foot-8, 150 pounds before his signing. He'll join his 20-year-old brother Quinn, also a midfielder, on the Union MLS squad.\n\nAt 14 years old, he could become the youngest athlete to play an American professional sport - and be the youngest player to debut in a major soccer league - if he debuts with the Union on or before July 29.\n\n\"I've been watching my home team, the Union, for as long as I remember and hoped that one day, I'd get the chance to play for my city in front of my family, friends, and fans,\" Sullivan said in a statement before his formal introduction Thursday.\n\n\"Being able to not only play for the Union, but to be able to play with my brother is a dream come true. I will give everything I have to this club and hope to help bring home some hardware. I'm thankful for the opportunity and hope to make Philadelphia proud.\"\n\nSullivan also helped the Union U-15 team reach the 2023 Generation Adidas Cup final, after wins over academy powerhouses like Valencia, Arsenal, and Real Madrid. Sullivan scored one minute into the match against Arsenal. He was named to the tournament's Best XI for his play.\n\nEarlier this year, Sullivan helped the Union U-17 squad win their second-consecutive GA Cup championship. He also made two appearances for the Union II, where he assisted a game-winning goal against New England Revolution II.\n\n\"Cavan is undeniably a rare and extraordinary talent. At just 14-years-old, his natural skill and vision are far beyond his years,\" Philadelphia Union sporting director Ernst Tanner said in a statement. \"His advanced soccer IQ, paired with his ability to read plays, advance the ball, and score, show just how high his ceiling will be.\n\n\"We are incredibly pleased to have come to an agreement to have Cavan join the Union on his first professional contract and have no doubt on the impact he will make with the club.\"\n\nWho are the youngest players to debut in MLS history?\n\nSullivan will be first on this list if he debuts on or before July 29.\n\n1.

The extremely talented academy standout was already turning heads at 12-years-old.\n\nHe wasn't just catching attention around the academy scene or with the U.S. youth national team -- he was getting noticed by some of the biggest clubs in Europe, including Manchester City, Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid.\n\nThis past winter, a decision was made as those big clubs were flexing their financial muscle to try to lure Sullivan to Europe, skipping a professional deal with his boyhood club. Months of tense discussions ended in an ideal outcome for all parties, with Sullivan inking the most lucrative homegrown deal in MLS history to begin his professional club with the Union.\n\nThat deal was made official on Thursday.\n\n\"This is a historic day for the Philadelphia Union. It is not often, in any sport, you get to sign a generational talent,\" head coach Jim Curtin told the media.\n\nSullivan joined the Union academy at age 10. His oldest brother, Quinn, who also came through the club's academy, is currently in the Union first team.\n\n\"The Union means almost everything to me, it's my club,\" Sullivan said. \"Watching Quinn in the first team -- being at the club since I was a little kid. This is my home.\"\n\nSullivan has excelled at every level of youth soccer, already breaking into the Union's second team to get his first steps in professional soccer.\n\n\"Everybody knows, he is probably one of the biggest talents on the globe,\" sporting director Ernst Tanner said. \"It was important we could keep him with us.\"\n\nThis deal was far from a foregone conclusion. In fact, as recently as two months ago, it seemed certain Sullivan would skip Philly and head directly to Europe on his 16th birthday, as he has a German passport which allows him to leave before turning 18.\n\n\"That's what we tried to avoid,\" Tanner said.\n\nThe Union knew about the global interest in Sullivan. Manchester City eventually won out, as first reported by The Athletic. In conjunction with this homegrown deal, Sullivan will join Manchester City after he turns 18.\n\nThe Union's press release made no mention of Manchester City, which has not released anything publicly, either. Tanner declined to comment when asked. Sources reiterate that the deal for Sullivan to join City after he turns 18 is signed and done.\n\nSullivan has now signed the most lucrative homegrown deal in MLS history, with the average compensation surpassing the previous record held by Freddy Adu, who first signed for D.C. United at 14 years old in 2003. Adu's deal was worth around $500,000 per season. Sullivan's average is slightly above that over the length of the contract, according to sources briefed on the deal who weren't authorized to speak publicly about it. The deal escalates in value every year. The Union officially announced it was a \"record deal.\"\n\nThe MLS Players Association will release salary data twice in 2024 and Sullivan's number for this season will be revealed then. Homegrown deals are \"more or less standardized\" through the league office, Tanner said, hence the drawn out negotiations. The league office needs to sign off on any deal. The Union wasn't only negotiating with Sullivan's camp, but also the league office.\n\nSullivan's deal will be around five times a normal homegrown contract. For comparison, NYCFC signed academy standout Maxi Carrizo to a homegrown deal when he was 14 in 2022. Last season, per the MLSPA, his deal was worth $111,597. New York Red Bulls academy standout Bento Estrela also signed his first deal when he was 14. Last season, when he was 17, his deal paid $109,444.\n\nThose two are on the higher end of recent homegrown deals, but the unprecedented talent and the competition from European clubs put Sullivan on strong footing to maximize this deal.\n\nNow, with his future settled, Sullivan is focused on making history.\n\n\"To be honest, nothing has really happened yet, the work starts now,\" Sullivan said. \"I have a lot to do. My main goal is to win MLS Cup.\"\n\nIf he were to make his first team debut before July 29, he would become the youngest player ever to debut among the top North American professional sports leagues (MLB, MLS, NBA, NFL, NHL, NWSL, WNBA), per the Elias Sports Bureau. The previous youngest player to accomplish these feats was Adu, who made his MLS debut at 14 years and 306 days old on April 3, 2004 for D.C. United.\n\n\"We're not afraid to put Cavan on the field at any time when he's ready,\" Curtin said. \"He'll get on the field on merit, first and foremost, but I'll say it publicly: (His debut) is a lot closer than people may realize.\"\n\nTanner is world renowned for his work in youth development throughout a decorated career in Germany, then Austria, before coming to America. He also doesn't traffic in hyperbole, so when he makes an assessment of a player, people listen.\n\n\"I'd say Cavan, in my eyes, is a top three youth talent I've seen in my 30-year career,\" Tanner said.\n\nA ton of stars have crossed those eyes over that 30-year career.\n\nPrior to the Union, Tanner's previous role was building out the RB Salzburg academy. The club either produced or acquired at a young age the likes of Erling Haaland, Konrad Laimer and Dominik Szoboszlai, a player Tanner compared Sullivan to.\n\nSzoboszlai was an exceptional young talent that Salzburg brought into their academy, saying the deal was done when the player was 14, like Sullivan.\n\nLike Salzburg in Austria, Philly has become the gold standard for youth development in the United States. Since Tanner took over, the club has produced and transferred the likes of Brenden Aaronson, Paxten Aaronson and Mark McKenzie to Europe. Academy graduate Auston Trusty ended up in the Premier League. Current first teamers Jack McGlynn and Quinn Sullivan are destined for Europe, too.\n\n\"We have a track record,\" academy director Jon Scheer said. \"We have a history of developing players, within our academy and the first team, then transitioning them on to bigger clubs in the global game. We have a proof of concept that families and players can truly believe in.\"\n\nFrom ownership through the academy, with key figures like Tanner, Scheer, Curtin and second team head coach Marlon LeBlanc, the Union stands on their business.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_bogert@theathletic.com", "name": "Tom Bogert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homegrown_Player_Rule_(MLS)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homegrown Player Rule (MLS)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddy_Adu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freddy Adu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Curtin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim Curtin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLS_Players_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MLS Players Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.C._United", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D.C.

He has until July 29 to make his debut to become the youngest player in North American professional sports history. He's the fifth-youngest signing in league history. Financial details were not disclosed, per league policy.\n\nThe club has reportedly agreed in principle to a deal with English Premier League giants Manchester City for Sullivan's services once he turns 18, which is not until 2027. The Union deal is through 2028 and ensures compensation for the club. (There are limits as to the age at which players can sign professional contracts overseas.)\n\n\"I've been watching my home team, the Union, for as long as I remember and hoped that one day I'd get the chance to play for my city in front of my family, friends, and fans,\" Sullivan said in a press release. \"Being able to not only play for the Union but to be able to play with my brother is a dream come true. I will give everything I have to this club and hope to help bring home some hardware. I'm thankful for the opportunity and hope to make Philadelphia proud.\"\n\nSullivan joined the Union Academy in 2020. He's already played for Union II, with an assist in two appearances. He has appeared for the Union at the U-15 and U-17 level, including leading the latter to the Generation Adidas Cup this spring. He helped the Union finish second at the U-15 level in 2023 at age 13.\n\nInternationally, Sullivan won the Golden Ball at the 2023 CONCACAF Boys Under-15 Championships in 2023, which the U.S. won.\n\n\"Cavan is undeniably a rare and extraordinary talent. At just 14 years old his natural skill and vision are far beyond his years,\" sporting director Ernst Tanner said. \"His advanced soccer IQ, paired with his ability to read plays, advance the ball, and score, show just how high his ceiling will be.

I always watch Man City. They're like every kid's dream team.

Curtin said he could serve as a second striker or an attacking player and that his versatility will be an asset for the Union.\n\n\"I would say the big word is 'playmaker,'\" Sullivan said. \"That's what I try and be every game, every training. I think I'm good on the dribble.

He thinks Sullivan's potential is up there with them.\n\nUnion sporting director Ernst Tanner has had a hand in developing many soccer stars in his long career.\n\nNow Cavan Sullivan is headed toward that launchpad. The 14-year-old attacking midfield starlet turned pro with the Union on Thursday, and there's an agreement to sell him to Man City when he turns 18.\n\nWhere does Tanner rank Sullivan among the prospects he's seen, even at such a young age?\n\n\"He is certainly matching up with the likes of Szoboszlai, etc., in that stage,\" he told The Inquirer. \"He's certainly that good. I've seen a lot of real promising talent, but I would say Cavan is certainly top three.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: Top prospect Cavan Sullivan will turn pro with the Union before joining Man City in a few years\n\nIt's not yet known how much money Sullivan will make in his first pro deal. But it is known that the Union petitioned MLS headquarters to break the homegrown player salary cap, which is just over $200,000, to match the money that European clubs offered.\n\nThe league agreed, and agreed to an unprecedented deal where City's future acquisition is already set. Those are big signs of how important Sullivan is.\n\n\"We needed the league, otherwise it would never have gotten done,\" Tanner said. \"And finally, we could get it done.\"\n\nIt's also a sign of how important it is to the league's reputation, not just the Union's, that he start his pro career here instead of in Europe. Though Lionel Messi gets the overwhelming majority of MLS's marketing hype, the best thing the league does -- and the biggest thing for long-term success -- is develop young players.\n\nCasual fans who tune in to see Sullivan won't get to actually see him in a first-team game for a while. The Union will be intentionally patient with his development. But that is one of the biggest upsides to his signing here instead of with a European team that would throw him into the deep end without caring about him personally.\n\n\"That's exactly what I'm telling most of our boys who are dreaming their dream too early,\" Tanner said. \"They all see that Europe is more or less the soccer-specific milk and honey land, but the reality is pretty different. ... I always tell them, hey, it's even better if you get over to Europe as a stable player where you have transitioned well into men's soccer.\"\n\nSo the pathway is there for Sullivan, and everyone is ready to follow it.\n\n\" READ MORE: Union fans should treasure watching Jack McGlynn, because they might not be able to for much longer\n\n\"We need to establish him in the second team, and once he is really getting over that level on the second team, he might need to train with the first team, and then we need to see how quick we can get him on the field with the first team,\" Tanner said. \"But there is no rush, because we can't take away from him that he needs to develop and needs to get ready to play.\"\n\nTanner also framed the matter in a fan-first way.\n\n\"We don't want to present an unfinished product on the first team to our spectators,\" he said. \"They deserve to get to see real players.\"\n\nBut the time will come eventually -- and yes, it could come later this year. The Leagues Cup tournament in the late summer would make a lot more sense for a debut than a regular-season game.\n\n\"We need to see how quickly it goes,\" Tanner said. \"Maybe it takes two years, maybe it goes quicker -- we are all not seers. But I can only say something: If he is going ahead in his development like he was doing in the last half-year, it can get really quick.\"\n\nHe promptly balanced that optimism with caution: \"That would also not be natural.\"\n\nSullivan has already played for the Union's reserves a few times as an amateur. While he hasn't looked out of place skill-wise, he's clearly still not a physical match for players around him who are multiple years older.\n\n\" READ MORE: Cavan Sullivan debuted for the Union's reserve team with a game-winning assist\n\n\"There's a big difference even between the under-17 [team] and the second team, in particular for a 14-year-old -- we've seen that already,\" Tanner said. \"And we know that there's even a bigger difference between the second team and the first team, in terms of competitiveness and physicality. That's what we need to see and evaluate, and then put him on the right level. The good news is we have all these levels available.\"\n\nThe other good news is that the Union reserve team's games are easy to watch. Many are streamed in Apple's MLS Season Pass package, and some are free on the reserve league's website, MLSNextPro.com. Tickets to watch games in person at Subaru Park are just $12, general admission, and Union season ticket-holders can go to three games a year for free. (The next home game isn't until June 2.)\n\nIf you watch the Union's reserves, you'll see that the club is continuing a remarkable track record of developing creative midfielders.\n\nIt's not bluster to say that the Union might be the best in MLS at this, with seven such players reaching the first team in the last six years. The Aaronson brothers and Anthony Fontana are now in Europe. McGlynn, David Vazquez, and Cavan's brother Quinn Sullivan are with the Union's first team now.\n\n\"It means that we are obviously doing a good job in detecting and nurturing talent, and believe me, that's not the end,\" Tanner said. \"There are great talents already over in Europe, there are great talents at the moment playing in our first team, and there are a lot of really great talents in our second [reserve] team as we all have seen this season.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: Brenden and Paxten Aaronson made the USMNT together for the first time last November\n\nSome of those reserve-team talents have played for the under-17 squad, which is the two-time reigning champion of the prestigious Generation Adidas Cup.\n\nLast year, Vazquez helped the under-17s beat Brazil's Palmeiras along the way -- and Sullivan helped the under-15 squad beat Spain's Real Madrid and England's Arsenal. This year, Sullivan helped the under-17s beat Croatia's Hajduk Split, then his teammates topped Brazil's Flamengo (Sullivan was suspended due to a red card).\n\n\"If you can beat the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me in soccer academies of the whole world, that tells you something,\" Tanner said. \"When we compare to [teams] outside of our country and are even better, that's pretty astonishing for a young system. They have a history, and they have a culture, of decades in their talent identification and developing process.\"\n\nThe Union have only existed for 15 years, and didn't really start spending big on youth development until 11 years ago when YSC Academy opened.\n\n\"That tells you a lot about the value of all these efforts we have done, and the quality which is in our academy and our club,\" Tanner said.\n\nSullivan is the latest, and greatest, symbol of that.\n\n\"There's a lot coming,\" Tanner said. \"But even so, we all know that Cavan is special. You don't have a talent like him every five years.\"\n\nA person who's seen enough of them over decades would know.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia

Hyped in some corners as the best 14-year-old soccer player in the world, Cavan has already drawn interest for years from a who's who of international clubs.\n\nBut when it came time to choose the first steps of what he hopes is a long professional journey, Sullivan wanted to stay close to home and to family.\n\n\"I've just been in and around the club since I was a little kid,\" Sullivan said Thursday at an introductory press conference at Subaru Park upon signing with the Union. \"So this is my home. And it's an honor to sign here for my first professional contract. It means a lot that they see the talent in me at such a young age. I want to prove myself and work for this club, for this city and for all these fans.\"\n\nSullivan's signing makes history, something that all involved hope becomes common in the career of a \"generational talent.\" The midfielder is 14 years, 224 days old, the fifth-youngest player to sign an MLS contract. Should he debut before the end of July, he'd be the youngest player in MLS (and American professional team sports) history. His contract is the richest Homegrown deal ever. It comes with a reported agreement that he will join English giants Manchester City when he turns 18.\n\nBefore all that, though, is a chance to ply his trade daily with his big brother. Cavan, born in 2009, is the youngest of four brothers. Quinn, a Union Homegrown signee in 2021 and born in 2004, has become an MLS starter and youth national team fixture. In between are 2007 birth year twins Ronan and Declan.\n\nNow Cavan and Quinn will share an office, essentially, long before either can legally buy a beer.\n\n\"I didn't think that, especially this early, it'd be occurring, but I'm super happy that it is and super excited for it,\" Quinn said. \"Definitely would be hoping for it later down the line, as with all my brothers - Ronan and Declan still have the opportunity to do that - and hopefully, I'll be able to share the field with all of them at some point.\"\n\nFamily was part of the pull for Cavan. Union coach Jim Curtin played at Villanova under Cavan's grandfather, Larry Sullivan, one of the doyens of Philadelphia soccer whose influence on Curtin choked the coach up Thursday. Brendan Sullivan, the boys' father, was an assistant at Villanova and now teaches at YSC Academy. He and wife Heike played soccer at Penn.\n\nThe only limiting factor on Cavan's next steps were legal. Union sporting director Ernst Tanner said discussions were held before Sullivan's 14th birthday last September, the earliest he could have been employed. Labor laws are tricky, given that he would work in Pennsylvania for a league headquartered in New York and incorporated in Delaware. Sullivan cannot be transferred to another country until his 18th birthday, though with a German passport, he can join a foreign academy at age 16. The Union wouldn't have received a transfer fee for his services in that case. Thursday's deal allows them to recoup the cost of his development and reap the benefits of his on-field production until he's ready for Europe.\n\nSullivan's hype is considerable. Tanner called him, \"certainly among the top three talents I have seen the year range so far.\" Curtin used the terms \"relentless\" and \"fearless\" in describing his skills. They echo a consensus from Sullivan's play with the Union Academy and youth national teams.\n\n\"He's a specialist in that when he gets the ball, it's electric,\" Curtin said. \"Something's going to happen here. He's going to do something that I don't think of as a coach, that I can't teach as a coach. He's going to do something outside the box. And that's something that you can't really put words to.\"\n\n\"He's got this attacking mindset that is fearless,\" Union II coach Marlon LeBlanc said. \"He creates goals, he scores goals, he can do it in every facet. He's an absolutely fantastic young footballer, and you throw (age) 14 in there and that's why we're all sitting here in this room having this discussion.\"\n\nSullivan has, from his earliest days at FC Delco and the Union Academy, played up in age. He helped the Union made the Generation Adidas Cup final in the U-15 bracket at age 13. This spring, at 14, he powered a U-17 title. Shortly thereafter, he made his debut with Union II.\n\nCurtin used Thursday's press conference to reinforce the club's value of youth development. For a club that aspires to be the gold standard in developing young Americans, Sullivan's decision to stay home is a significant coup. It's validation that the club can help him improve, with a support system that will help tackle the physical and mental challenges along the way.\n\nThat includes a big brother to both help him and let him know gently when he needs to help himself.\n\n\"I'm happy to be in the locker with him and help him in whatever direction he needs,\" Quinn Sullivan said of his little brother. \"And it's great to have someone in the locker room that has that experience already, four years in, lead them in the right direction and let him do his thing as well. There's a fine line between helping out and doing too much, and I'll make sure not to go over that line.\"\n\nCavan chose his words carefully, flanked by people who both praised him voluminously while vowing to keep him humble. In doing so, he showed some of the mentality that was being so lavishly lauded.\n\n\"To be honest, nothing really has happened yet,\" Cavan said. \"The work starts now. I've got a lot to do. My main goal was to win MLS Cup. Development starts now, and it does feel nice, but still a lot of work to do for my part and a lot of room to grow.\"", "source": {"uri": "delcotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Delaware

Maybe when one of his players scores a big goal, but that's about it.\n\nOn Thursday, though, Curtin was nearly moved to tears over one aspect of Cavan Sullivan's arrival to the big time.\n\nA quarter-century ago, Cavan's grandfather Larry was Curtin's college coach at Villanova. In Curtin's senior season, Cavan's father Brendan joined the Wildcats' coaching staff.\n\nNow Curtin is coaching the 14-year-old who might become the best ever from a family that he called \"kind of Philadelphia soccer royalty.\"\n\n\"There's an element of debt, excitement, a kind of full-circle moment,\" Curtin said at a news conference in Cavan's honor Thursday at Subaru Park. The precocious attacking midfielder sat next to him on stage, and much of the Sullivan family -- Brendan, mother Heike, and fellow sons Quinn, Ronan and Declan -- sat in the front row of the seats.\n\nCurtin praised Larry as \"a guy that taught me so much about the game, about being a leader a person, and a good soccer player as well,\" and called Brendan \"the first guy that I saw that was a professional-level player, that I saw day-in and day-out.\"\n\nThough MLS's launch in 1996 was a year before Curtin started at Villanova, American players were still hard to find. The sport certainly wasn't like what it is now, where there are countless players and fans can watch every big league worldwide.\n\nSullivan's signing with the Union is a symbol of that, too. For as much as everyone wanted him to start his pro career at the hometown club, the Union still had to make an offer worth picking over starting at England's Manchester City, Germany's Borussia Dortmund, or other big European clubs that wanted him.\n\nNew details of the deal\n\nIn the end, Sullivan will get the best of both worlds. He'll play for the Union until he's 18, then move to Man City for a pre-agreed price of around $5 million.\n\nAnd he'll get paid plenty before then. Sullivan signed the largest homegrown player contract in Major League Soccer history, multiple sources told The Philadelphia Inquirer, with the league breaking its homegrown player salary cap -- around $200,000 a year -- to get the deal done.\n\nIt will be just over $500,000 per season, one source with knowledge of the matter said, surpassing a special benchmark in league history: the salary that Freddy Adu, American soccer's first 14-year-old phenom, earned as a rookie with D.C. United 20 years ago.\n\nMLS wasn't ready for a player of his age back then, and Adu endured a tumultuous career that included 20 months with the Union from 2011-13.\n\nThe landscape is far better now, and the Union are a big reason why. Their youth academy includes a full-time high school for top prospects that Cavan attends, that his oldest brother Quinn -- now a Union first-team veteran -- attended before, and that Brendan works at as a history teacher.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nOn top of that, the Union have sent some of those players on to big international stages. Brenden and Paxten Aaronson, Mark McKenzie and Auston Trusty all grew up here, play in major European leagues, and have been with the senior U.S. national team.\n\n\"We have a track record now,\" academy director Jon Scheer said. \"We have a history of developing players within our academy, within MLS, and transitioning them on to bigger clubs in the global game ... I think we now have a proof of concept with our competitive strategy that families and players can truly believe in.\"\n\nPatience with playing him\n\nOf course, lots of people in town want to know when Sullivan will play for the Union's first team. Curtin preached patience, but also didn't hide from Sullivan's immense potential.\n\n\"The game will tell us,\" he said. \"He's going to work hard and get on the field on merit first and foremost. But I'll just say publicly, it's a lot closer than people realize. Our team, whatever we need that week, he's going to be called upon quickly, because he deserves it.\"\n\nThe odds are that if we're going to see Sullivan with the first team this year, it will be during the late-summer Leagues Cup tournament instead of the regular season. The Union's group stage opener is July 27, and if Sullivan plays in that game he'll break Adu's record for MLS's youngest ever player by two days.\n\nSullivan will definitely play for the Union's reserve team before then, and probably often. Coach Marlon LeBlanc has known Sullivan since he was eight years old, and Sullivan has already played for the reserves as an amateur a few times. In his debut on March 24, he came off the bench and created the game-winning assist.\n\n\"My job is to put him in a position to be successful,\" LeBlanc said. Everybody wants to see Cavan out there on Saturday night [when the first team plays], but Cavan understands the process to get to Saturday night. We're going to make sure that he's learning, he's progressing, and he's held accountable as well.\"\n\nBut they'll also let him express himself on the field.\n\n\"We're not going to stifle his creativity,\" LeBlanc said. \"We're going to give him a platform to do it, but we're going to make sure that he does it the right way. And I know Cav, and he's going to do it the right way -- and he doesn't want it any other way, and that's one of the best things about working with Cavan.\"\n\nIt matters a lot to LeBlanc, and the organization as a whole, that Sullivan should have the time and space to be a kid.\n\n\"He's good enough to play and be there, but I want to make sure that people remember that he's 14 years old,\" he said. \"That will be a big part of his development: him getting to stay in his home, in his bed, in his house, with his family, is only going to speed that part up too. And he gets to do this at his own timeline, his own process.\"\n\n\u00a92024 The Philadelphia Inquirer. Visit inquirer.com.

That has the world talking. But Sullivan knows what he wants.\n\nIn the years to come, Cavan Sullivan won't just play for the Union, and later on Manchester City. The 14-year-old attacking midfield phenom is also going to pick a national team where he could someday play on soccer's biggest stage of all, the FIFA World Cup.\n\nA national team is a lifetime commitment once you reach the senior level, and a lot of soccer players don't even get to choose. They're born somewhere, their parents are also from there, and that's it. But because Sullivan's mother Heike has a German passport -- he does too.\n\nHeike's father, the late Klaus Krippendorff, came to the U.S. from Germany in the 1960s and was a renowned professor of communication at Penn. She played varsity soccer at Penn in the '90s, captaining the Quakers' women's team in 1994 and 1995. Along the way, she met her future husband, Brendan Sullivan, who played for the men's team.\n\n\" READ MORE: Why Cavan Sullivan, hyped as the world's best 14-year-old soccer player, chose to turn pro with the Union\n\nFast-forward a little under 30 years later, and here we are. At this point, Cavan Sullivan has already played for the United States under-15 and under-16 teams. But a player with multi-national eligibility doesn't have to commit until the senior level.\n\nThat leaves the door open for Germany to try to win Sullivan over. In March, German newspaper TZ reported that the the four-time men's World Cup champions had scouted Sullivan \"a few times,\" and was considering inviting him to youth teams.\n\nThe report got lots of people talking, even if it was always clear that Germany landing Sullivan is a long shot.\n\nSo would he say yes? We had a chance to ask him in a recent interview, ahead of the announcement this week of his signing with the Union.\n\n\" READ MORE: 'Cavan is special': Union's Ernst Tanner says Cavan Sullivan is one of the best he's ever seen\n\n\"I mean, I'm an American, but I'm open to options, I guess?\" he said, seated with his parents, and they all laughed. \"I want to win the World Cup with the USA. So that's all I've got to say.\"\n\nConsider it said, then -- and a reminder that he's still just 14. In the rest of American culture, that's eighth grade, not even high school yet.\n\nYes, Sullivan has already made big decisions in life. One was picking Manchester City over the many other European teams that wanted him, including Germany's Borussia Dortmund. The club that developed Christian Pulisic and Gio Reyna was on Sullivan's trail for years, inviting him over for a trial as early as September 2020.\n\nBut Sullivan's soccer career has a long way to go, on and off the field, and he doesn't have to make his national team decision any time soon. He's a great prospect, but as with any player of his age, it will be a few years before he gets to the senior national team level. Especially with the U.S. or Germany, which have deep talent pools.\n\nThe U.S. pool, by the way, includes Cavan's oldest brother, Quinn, who's also on the Union. He played for the Americans' under-20 squad at last year's age-group World Cup, and is competing to make this year's under-23 Olympic team (though he faces long odds).\n\nCould they play together for the U.S. some day? We'll have to wait to see. At least it should be a shorter wait for them to play together for the Union, now that Cavan is officially a pro.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_tannenwald@inquirer.com", "name": "Jonathan Tannenwald", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cavan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cavan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Soccer_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Soccer Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_under-16_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national under-16 football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Reyna", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giovanni Reyna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Pulisic", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Pulisic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad_and_Tobago_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trinidad and Tobago national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_under-20_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national under-20 football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA_Nations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA Nations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/4yGP6psvg8lVcypLuLP-kMQnFQc=/760x507/smart/filters:format(webp)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/pmn/DVPUYWOX6NHB7OQKQPWKPDXL64.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553314", "eventUri": "eng-9553314", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-09-", "textStart": 2678, "textEnd": 2692}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The Union academy star is expected to spent the next four years in Chester, Pennsylvania in the next chapter of his club career before embarking to English Premier League giants Manchester City as part of his deal.\n\nAfter excelling for both the Union's academy and several U.S. youth national teams, Sullivan is ready to translate those successes over to Union II and the Union first team.\n\n\"I've always dreamed big as a kid,\" Sullivan said in a press conference Thursday. \"Signing my first professional contract was always my first goal and then from there on, whatever happened happened. But as of right now, I'm just focused on this season and I really haven't done anything yet for my career. This is just the beginning and I want to be the best I can be. But right now, I just have to work hard and see what's next.\"\n\nSullivan's name has been on the radar of many European giants over the past year, but it was Manchester City who was able to lock up his services. The reigning UEFA Champions League and EPL winners have grown into one of the top franchises in international football, developing plenty of top talent in recent years including Phil Foden, Rico Lewis, and Cole Palmer.\n\nSullivan still has a long way to go until he steps foot in Manchester and admitted he isn't focusing on the noise surrounding his name after committing himself to the club down the road.\n\n\"I see all the noise,\" Sullivan said. \"It's definitely hard to ignore and not see it on social media and stuff like that, but as of now, I'm just focused on my development here with the second team and first team. Hopefully I can make my debut soon. It's really not paying attention to it, whether it's good or bad. Whether someone's talking positively about you or negatively, it means nothing.\"\n\nSullivan has made two MLS NEXT Pro appearances this season for Union II, registering one assist. After featuring at the GA Cup, Sullivan now is a candidate to play more regularly in Marlon LeBlanc's squad while also potentially earning his first team debut with Jim Curtin's men this year.\n\nHe'll become the newest homegrown talent in a lengthy list, following in the footsteps of Brenden Aaronson, Mark McKenzie, Auston Trusty, and others. Sullivan's first team debut will come in due time and it's something he remains excited about after watching many others come through the ranks.\n\n\"I do get goosebumps thinking about my MLS debut,\" Sullivan said. \"I imagine it being a sold-out crowd at Subaru Park, the one I see almost every week and it never fails to amaze me. Finally hearing my name called for the substitution, it's definitely going to put a smile on my face.\"", "source": {"uri": "sbisoccer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SBI Soccer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "larry_henry_jr@sbisoccer.com", "name": "Larry Henry Jr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Soccer_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Soccer Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chester, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chester, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rico_Lewis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rico Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_LeBlanc", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marlon LeBlanc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_McKenzie_(soccer,_born_1999)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark McKenzie (soccer, born 1999)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subaru Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenden_Aaronson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brenden Aaronson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auston_Trusty", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auston Trusty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Curtin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Curtin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://sbisoccer.com/wp-content/uploads/CS-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553314", "eventUri": "eng-9553314", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Here's what to know about the Union academy and its teen phenom.", "body": "Cavan Sullivan is one of the biggest names Philly sports fans might not know (yet), but they should definitely pay attention to the 14-year-old soccer prodigy.\n\nHis home club, the Philadelphia Union, put pen to paper on a deal that secures Sullivan's future stays in his hometown for at least three seasons before an eventual departure to English Premier League giant Manchester City. The Union and Man City brokered a deal that will introduce Sullivan to European soccer when he turns 18 -- a waiting period due to work visa restrictions for minors.\n\nPhilly can be proud because if there was ever a living embodiment of the term \"homegrown,\" Sullivan is its latest descriptor.\n\nSo who is this kid? Where did he come from and why should you care? Inquirer soccer writers Kerith Gabriel and Jonathan Tannenwald bring you up to speed.\n\nIt was almost impossible for Sullivan not to rise to the pedigree he already had before his 16th birthday. His grandfather, Larry, is Northeast Philly soccer royalty, having starred at the now-defunct North Catholic High School in the 1960s, before playing at Temple. But Sullivan is known for his coaching prowess, serving as the head coach at St. Joseph's, Father Judge High School, and Camden Catholic High, which preceded his 17-year stint as the head coach at Villanova.\n\nCavan's dad, Brendan, was also a player. He is now a teacher at YSC Academy and runs a Conshohocken-based soccer school that provides intrinsic coaching and development.\n\n\"I was thrilled with Cav's decision to decide to start his career here, play with his brother, drive in every day with his brother, live in the house for a couple more years,\" he told The Inquirer. \"19124, 19137, those were our zip codes [in the city]. We were bought in through birthright, for better or for worse.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: Why Cavan Sullivan, hyped as the world's best 14-year-old soccer player, chose to turn pro with the Union\n\nCavan's uncle is Chris Albright, a Philly-area native who was a member of the U.S. men's national team and played for multiple Major League Soccer teams including the Union, where he later became the general manager/technical director for four seasons before departing for the same job at FC Cincinnati.\n\nAnd his brother, Quinn Sullivan, is a current midfielder on the Union, making these two the second brother duo to play for the Union since Medford, N.J., natives, Brendan and Paxten Aaronson. -- KG\n\nIt's unknown when he'll get his debut with the first team, but all signs point to the start of MLS's upstart Leagues Cup tournament next month, which would provide an opportunity for even more exposure than games during the regular season. The Leagues Cup, which pits MLS clubs and teams from Mexico's Liga MX together for a chance to gain entrance into the larger Concacaf Champions Cup, was already a draw for fans but gained immense popularity after it became the introduction to Lionel Messi playing on American soil with Inter Miami FC.\n\nThe Leagues Cup being an ancillary offshoot of the MLS regular season also allows key players to get rest while providing an opportunity -- at least in the early stages -- to players who might not get sizable minutes during the season. In short, exposure and a need for a more versatile roster make this tournament the perfect stage to introduce the wunderkind. -- KG\n\n\" READ MORE: 'Cavan is special': Union's Ernst Tanner says Cavan Sullivan is one of the best he's ever seen\n\nHere's how I'd put it, having watched him play for the Union's reserves and youth teams. He's 14 years old, and we just can't forget that at any point along the way here. There's nothing new about teenage prospects who don't live up to the hype, just as there's nothing new about teenage prospects who do.\n\nHaving said that, for what he is right now, yeah, he's really good. You don't just walk into your first reserve team game as a substitute, when you're clearly younger than everyone else on the field, and put the game-winning assist on a dime 25 minutes later.\n\nThe best part of what Sullivan gains from turning pro with the Union is time. He'll play here, but the Union won't rush him or try to burden him with too many expectations. He'll get to live at home with his family, grow up, then show off when he's ready. And when he is, we'll all see it. -- JT\n\nThe Union run their own youth soccer teams for kids as young as eight years old, partly to grow the game and partly to look for the Philly area's best prospects. Things get serious at the under-12 age level, when the Union start picking the cream of the crop. From then on, the Union's teams play against other MLS clubs' teams, and other major youth teams across the region and nation.\n\nThe under-15 and under-17 teams are really big-time. They play against not just American clubs, but international clubs on foreign tours and in big tournaments like the Generation adidas Cup, which the Union's under-17s have won two years in a row.\n\nNow here's the kicker (sorry). In 2013, the Union launched their own full-time high school for their very best prospects, called YSC Academy. A lot of the famous homegrown players you've seen at Subaru Park over the years -- Brenden and Paxten Aaronson, Quinn and Cavan Sullivan, Jack McGlynn, Mark McKenzie, and more -- came through the school.\n\nThose players all turned pro straight out of the school, and in some cases even before graduating. Their classmates who didn't turn pro right away went to college, in places as big as the Big Ten, ACC, and even the Ivy League. And the way MLS rules work, even though the league has a college draft, those kids are exempt from it and the Union keep their rights.\n\nThe Union's academy is so good at this that players from other parts of the country now want to join it. McGlynn came from New York City, and David Vazquez came from Los Angeles. -- JT\n\n\" READ MORE: Inside the Union's controversial recruitment of top prospect David Vazquez\n\nYes, really. College soccer players still make it to MLS, whether or not they came through teams' youth academies, and the league has a draft for them. But college sports aren't really a thing in the rest of the world like they are here.\n\nBig teams in Europe, South America, and Africa develop their players in their own youth academies, and that's it. It took MLS a while to get on board with doing it that way, but they have, and they've gotten good at it. Honestly, it's the best thing the league does, even if Lionel Messi gets all the attention.\n\nImagine something like this happening in basketball: the 76ers running their own AAU squad and a high school, developing those kids, and keeping their pro-rights even if they go to Villanova or Temple for a few years. There wouldn't have been a \"Villanova Knicks\" situation like there was this ... ah, it's too soon, isn't it. -- JT\n\n\" READ MORE: Complaints about Villanova hyping up Knicks alumni are 'idiotic,' Josh Hart says\n\nMoney. And in the case of Cavan Sullivan, potentially millions. Unlike America's pay-to-play model when it comes to youth sports, specifically in the case of travel soccer, in the academy -- while parents still pay -- the idea is that a top MLS academy team like the Union's is developing talent desirable to top clubs in Europe and elsewhere, where teams have the cash to splash at the ready for young talent.\n\nNot only does the team get paid when one of their players leaves to sign a big European contract, but they can potentially get a cut of every future deal he signs, making players like Sullivan valuable beyond what he can contribute while wearing a Union kit. -- KG", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_tannenwald@inquirer.com", "name": "Jonathan Tannenwald",

'The game will tell us'", "body": "CHESTER -- A few dates in Cavan Sullivan's soccer trajectory are known: His signing Thursday as the fifth-youngest in MLS history, his eventual departure to Manchester City when he turns 18 in 2027.\n\nBut when Sullivan's first MLS minutes with the Philadelphia Union will occur is much less certain. The consensus at his introductory press conference was something approximating soon, maybe.\n\nThat is as much expectations management as it is reality meeting hype, not dissimilar to the collision of a 14-year-old and a grown man twice his age.\n\nHere's how Union head coach Jim Curtin, notoriously reluctant to be drawn on such things, put it:\n\n\"The game will tell us,\" Curtin said. \"He's going to be training with the first team, and that's how you're going to get better. ... That is how development happens and gets accelerated quickly. So he's going to jump into training. We're certainly not afraid to put him on the field at any time.\"\n\nExpectations are stratospheric for Sullivan, who at age 14 has a professional contract and the interest of the presiding power in the English Premier League. Sullivan has played up in age for most of his time in the Union Academy, which he joined at 10. He was a star at the U-15 level at age 13, at the U-17 level by 14 and has made two appearances for Union II, already with an assist.\n\nThe burning question, particularly for a Union side looking in need of a spark in an 0-2-1 run, is when Sullivan might play. But the time horizons that Curtin and sporting director Ernst Tanner hypothesized skew more towards years than months.\n\nThis weekend's visit from Orlando City is definitively out, not that it was ever in. Tanner said Sullivan hasn't trained this week while managing a \"small overload injury.\" He should return to Union II training next week and build up to training with the first team.\n\nThe Union's investment is over the long-term - the outlay of the largest Homegrown contract in MLS history not only makes them custodian to his development but guarantees a transfer fee when (and it no longer seems an if) he goes to Europe. They won't rush either his development as a player or a teenager.\n\nFor the moment, both processes are in the hands of Curtin and Union II coach Marlon LeBlanc. Both have long histories with young players, and both are parents of teenagers. (Kellen LeBlanc is an attacking midfielder a year younger than Sullivan and another promising Academy talent.)\n\n\"Cavan is 14,\" Curtin said. \"His job here will be to be a kid and play and reach his full potential, and our job here is to create an environment where he can thrive in.\"\n\nThere's one crucial difference in the two coaches' approaches. Curtin's job is contingent on winning games in MLS. LeBlanc's in MLS Next Pro is not; it's merely a nice if not necessary byproduct of the talent he has that Union II is currently second in its conference.\n\nThat offers the runway to get Sullivan minutes for his benefit, even in situations where he might not be the player who gives Union II the best chance to win the day, as is Curtin's unflinching rubric.\n\n\"My role is going to be to allow him to go out and fail and succeed,\" LeBlanc said. \"He'll be learning in front of the fans on gameday. You guys will get to see that.\"\n\nThe first priority is handling the individual. Second is to get him used to playing kids older by several years with Union II. And then, that will put him in position to contribute to the first team, which Curtin doles out strictly on merit.\n\n\"This game will tell us when the next move comes,\" Curtin said. \"That could be in a year. That could be in two years. That could be in three years, whatever it might be. He's going to play at the very highest level that this sport has. Right now, we think this is the best environment for him to play.\"\n\n\"It's something different than U-17 tournaments, even an international one, by physical standards and opposition,\" Tanner said. \"So that's what we need to see now, how quick he adapts there and gets over the level. And the next step will certainly be that he trains with the first team, and then we take it from there.\n\n\"I'm not a seer. But hopefully within a one- or two-year range, we can do that, that we get him some MLS minutes.\"", "source": {"uri": "delcotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Delaware County Daily Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_degeorge@delcotimes.com", "name": "Matthew DeGeorge", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Curtin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jim Curtin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chester, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chester, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_City_SC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orlando City SC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLS_Next_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MLS Next Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.delcotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/DSC01082.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9553314", "eventUri": "eng-9553314", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chester, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Hyped in some corners as the best 14-year-old soccer player in the world, Cavan has already drawn interest for years from a who's who of international clubs.\n\nBut when it came time to choose the first steps of what he hopes is a long professional journey, Sullivan wanted to stay close to home and to family.\n\n\"I've just been in and around the club since I was a little kid,\" Sullivan said Thursday at an introductory press conference at Subaru Park upon signing with the Union. \"So this is my home. And it's an honor to sign here for my first professional contract. It means a lot that they see the talent in me at such a young age. I want to prove myself and work for this club, for this city and for all these fans.\"\n\nSullivan's signing makes history, something that all involved hope becomes common in the career of a \"generational talent.\" The midfielder is 14 years, 224 days old, the fifth-youngest player to sign an MLS contract. Should he debut before the end of July, he'd be the youngest player in MLS (and American professional team sports) history. His contract is the richest Homegrown deal ever. It comes with a reported agreement that he will join English giants Manchester City when he turns 18.\n\nBefore all that, though, is a chance to ply his trade daily with his big brother. Cavan, born in 2009, is the youngest of four brothers. Quinn, a Union Homegrown signee in 2021 and born in 2004, has become an MLS starter and youth national team fixture. In between are 2007 birth year twins Ronan and Declan.\n\nNow Cavan and Quinn will share an office, essentially, long before either can legally buy a beer.\n\n\"I didn't think that, especially this early, it'd be occurring, but I'm super happy that it is and super excited for it,\" Quinn said. \"Definitely would be hoping for it later down the line, as with all my brothers - Ronan and Declan still have the opportunity to do that - and hopefully, I'll be able to share the field with all of them at some point.\"\n\nFamily was part of the pull for Cavan. Union coach Jim Curtin played at Villanova under Cavan's grandfather, Larry Sullivan, one of the doyens of Philadelphia soccer whose influence on Curtin choked the coach up Thursday. Brendan Sullivan, the boys' father, was an assistant at Villanova and now teaches at YSC Academy. He and wife Heike played soccer at Penn.\n\nThe only limiting factor on Cavan's next steps were legal. Union sporting director Ernst Tanner said discussions were held before Sullivan's 14th birthday last September, the earliest he could have been employed. Labor laws are tricky, given that he would work in Pennsylvania for a league headquartered in New York and incorporated in Delaware. Sullivan cannot be transferred to another country until his 18th birthday, though with a German passport, he can join a foreign academy at age 16. The Union wouldn't have received a transfer fee for his services in that case. Thursday's deal allows them to recoup the cost of his development and reap the benefits of his on-field production until he's ready for Europe.\n\nSullivan's hype is considerable. Tanner called him, \"certainly among the top three talents I have seen the year range so far.\" Curtin used the terms \"relentless\" and \"fearless\" in describing his skills. They echo a consensus from Sullivan's play with the Union Academy and youth national teams.\n\n\"He's a specialist in that when he gets the ball, it's electric,\" Curtin said. \"Something's going to happen here. He's going to do something that I don't think of as a coach, that I can't teach as a coach. He's going to do something outside the box. And that's something that you can't really put words to.\"\n\n\"He's got this attacking mindset that is fearless,\" Union II coach Marlon LeBlanc said. \"He creates goals, he scores goals, he can do it in every facet. He's an absolutely fantastic young footballer, and you throw (age) 14 in there and that's why we're all sitting here in this room having this discussion.\"\n\nSullivan has, from his earliest days at FC Delco and the Union Academy, played up in age. He helped the Union made the Generation Adidas Cup final in the U-15 bracket at age 13. This spring, at 14, he powered a U-17 title. Shortly thereafter, he made his debut with Union II.\n\nCurtin used Thursday's press conference to reinforce the club's value of youth development. For a club that aspires to be the gold standard in developing young Americans, Sullivan's decision to stay home is a significant coup. It's validation that the club can help him improve, with a support system that will help tackle the physical and mental challenges along the way.\n\nThat includes a big brother to both help him and let him know gently when he needs to help himself.\n\n\"I'm happy to be in the locker with him and help him in whatever direction he needs,\" Quinn Sullivan said of his little brother. \"And it's great to have someone in the locker room that has that experience already, four years in, lead them in the right direction and let him do his thing as well. There's a fine line between helping out and doing too much, and I'll make sure not to go over that line.\"\n\nCavan chose his words carefully, flanked by people who both praised him voluminously while vowing to keep him humble. In doing so, he showed some of the mentality that was being so lavishly lauded.\n\n\"To be honest, nothing really has happened yet,\" Cavan said. \"The work starts now. I've got a lot to do. My main goal was to win MLS Cup. Development starts now, and it does feel nice, but still a lot of work to do for my part and a lot of room to grow.\"", "source": {"uri": "delcotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Delaware

Hyped in some corners as the best 14-year-old soccer player in the world, Cavan has already drawn interest for years from a who's who of international clubs.\n\nBut when it came time to choose the first steps of what he hopes is a long professional journey, Sullivan wanted to stay close to home and to family.\n\n\"I've just been in and around the club since I was a little kid,\" Sullivan said Thursday at an introductory press conference at Subaru Park upon signing with the Union. \"So this is my home. And it's an honor to sign here for my first professional contract. It means a lot that they see the talent in me at such a young age. I want to prove myself and work for this club, for this city and for all these fans.\"\n\nSullivan's signing makes history, something that all involved hope becomes common in the career of a \"generational talent.\" The midfielder is 14 years, 224 days old, the fifth-youngest player to sign an MLS contract. Should he debut before the end of July, he'd be the youngest player in MLS (and American professional team sports) history. His contract is the richest Homegrown deal ever. It comes with a reported agreement that he will join English giants Manchester City when he turns 18.\n\nBefore all that, though, is a chance to ply his trade daily with his big brother. Cavan, born in 2009, is the youngest of four brothers. Quinn, a Union Homegrown signee in 2021 and born in 2004, has become an MLS starter and youth national team fixture. In between are 2007 birth year twins Ronan and Declan.\n\nNow Cavan and Quinn will share an office, essentially, long before either can legally buy a beer.\n\n\"I didn't think that, especially this early, it'd be occurring, but I'm super happy that it is and super excited for it,\" Quinn said. \"Definitely would be hoping for it later down the line, as with all my brothers - Ronan and Declan still have the opportunity to do that - and hopefully, I'll be able to share the field with all of them at some point.\"\n\nFamily was part of the pull for Cavan. Union coach Jim Curtin played at Villanova under Cavan's grandfather, Larry Sullivan, one of the doyens of Philadelphia soccer whose influence on Curtin choked the coach up Thursday. Brendan Sullivan, the boys' father, was an assistant at Villanova and now teaches at YSC Academy. He and wife Heike played soccer at Penn.\n\nThe only limiting factor on Cavan's next steps were legal. Union sporting director Ernst Tanner said discussions were held before Sullivan's 14th birthday last September, the earliest he could have been employed. Labor laws are tricky, given that he would work in Pennsylvania for a league headquartered in New York and incorporated in Delaware. Sullivan cannot be transferred to another country until his 18th birthday, though with a German passport, he can join a foreign academy at age 16. The Union wouldn't have received a transfer fee for his services in that case. Thursday's deal allows them to recoup the cost of his development and reap the benefits of his on-field production until he's ready for Europe.\n\nSullivan's hype is considerable. Tanner called him, \"certainly among the top three talents I have seen the year range so far.\" Curtin used the terms \"relentless\" and \"fearless\" in describing his skills. They echo a consensus from Sullivan's play with the Union Academy and youth national teams.\n\n\"He's a specialist in that when he gets the ball, it's electric,\" Curtin said. \"Something's going to happen here. He's going to do something that I don't think of as a coach, that I can't teach as a coach. He's going to do something outside the box. And that's something that you can't really put words to.\"\n\n\"He's got this attacking mindset that is fearless,\" Union II coach Marlon LeBlanc said. \"He creates goals, he scores goals, he can do it in every facet. He's an absolutely fantastic young footballer, and you throw (age) 14 in there and that's why we're all sitting here in this room having this discussion.\"\n\nSullivan has, from his earliest days at FC Delco and the Union Academy, played up in age. He helped the Union made the Generation Adidas Cup final in the U-15 bracket at age 13. This spring, at 14, he powered a U-17 title. Shortly thereafter, he made his debut with Union II.\n\nCurtin used Thursday's press conference to reinforce the club's value of youth development. For a club that aspires to be the gold standard in developing young Americans, Sullivan's decision to stay home is a significant coup. It's validation that the club can help him improve, with a support system that will help tackle the physical and mental challenges along the way.\n\nThat includes a big brother to both help him and let him know gently when he needs to help himself.\n\n\"I'm happy to be in the locker with him and help him in whatever direction he needs,\" Quinn Sullivan said of his little brother. \"And it's great to have someone in the locker room that has that experience already, four years in, lead them in the right direction and let him do his thing as well. There's a fine line between helping out and doing too much, and I'll make sure not to go over that line.\"\n\nCavan chose his words carefully, flanked by people who both praised him voluminously while vowing to keep him humble. In doing so, he showed some of the mentality that was being so lavishly lauded.\n\n\"To be honest, nothing really has happened yet,\" Cavan said. \"The work starts now. I've got a lot to do. My main goal was to win MLS Cup. Development starts now, and it does feel nice, but still a lot of work to do for my part and a lot of room to grow.\"", "source": {"uri": "delcotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Delaware

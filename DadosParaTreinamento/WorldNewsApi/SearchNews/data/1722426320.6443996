{"id": 243331274, "title": "Nike stock sees record drop as analysts question leadership after poor forecast", "text": "Jim Duffy, an analyst at Stifel, said in a research note Thursday that Nike was asking investors to place their faith in newer, unproven sneaker and clothing styles amid wobbly demand \u2014 straining confidence in the company\u2019s leadership in the process. \u201cManagement credibility is severely challenged and potential for C-level regime change adds further uncertainty,\u201d he wrote. Nike plans to roll out an array of new products, and is trying to do so more quickly, to counteract reluctance from inflation-battered consumers. But over at UBS, analyst Jay Sole had his own reservations about the company, and cut his per-share profit estimates for its next three fiscal years. \u201cOur key conclusion is there will be no quick rebound for Nike\u2019s earnings,\u201d Sole said in a research note on Friday. \u201cWe believe Nike is embarking on what will be a multiyear reset of its business in order to return to healthy top-line growth rates.\u201d He added: \u201cOur base case top-line forecast depends on Nike successfully developing new innovative products, but there is no guarantee this will happen.\u201d Speaking on a conference call to discuss Nike\u2019s fourth-quarter results Thursday, Chief Executive John Donahoe said the company saw strong gains in performance products, although this was more than offset by declines in Nike\u2019s lifestyle segment. Those declines, he added, had \u201ca pronounced impact\u201d on Nike\u2019s digital results. \u201cThese factors when combined with increased macro uncertainty and worsening foreign exchange have caused us to reduce our guidance for [fiscal-year] 2025,\u201d Donahoe said. \u201cNKE\u2019s 4Q24 print was very choppy, and the challenges facing the company are clearly more impactful than we (or management) expected,\u201d wrote Wedbush analyst Tom Nikic in a note released Friday. \u201cAfter the company missed Q4 sales and meaningfully cut FY25 guidance, shares are likely to open meaningfully lower on Friday.\u201d Related: Nike wants to sell fewer classic sneakers, roll out more new ones in bid to revive demand \u201cWe doubt many investors will view this as a \u2018buy the pullback\u2019 event, and we think NKE shares are headed for a stay in the proverbial penalty box until new product innovations actually start to manifest themselves and management regains investor trust,\u201d Nikic said. \u201cWe remain at Outperform due to our expectation that NKE will eventually \u2018figure it out,\u2019 but our conviction in our thesis has certainly taken a hit.\u201d Wedbush lowered its Nike price target to $97 from $115. Analysts say that that Nike is entering a period of transition. \u201cFY25 will be a transitional year with significantly softer performance than we anticipated and what NKE planned 3 months ago,\u201d wrote Raymond James analyst Rick B. Patel in a note released Friday. In particular, Patel cited weakness in lifestyle products, worsening global macro headwinds and a foreign-exchange hit.

This is what it means for Lululemon and Nike \u201cOne could argue Nike kitchen-sinked FY25, but we don\u2019t have confidence on upside to revenue (most critical factor) given increasingly tough macro,\u201d Patel added, pointing to widespread reports of consumer softness from the likes of Levi Strauss & Co. LEVI, -1.43%, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. WBA, -0.78% and General Mills Inc. GIS, -0.71% The analyst also cited unfavorable channel mix and China volatility. Raymond James downgraded Nike to market-perform from outperform. KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Ashley Owens also expects fiscal-year 2025 to be a transition year for Nike as the company navigates the pullback of top franchises for life-cycle management, balances its wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels, kickstarts product-newness and innovation initiatives, and invests in brand marketing. \u201cWe think the above dynamics coupled with a challenging macro will continue to pressure results for the next couple of quarters,\u201d she said. However, Owens noted Nike\u2019s new \u201cSpeed Lane\u201d priority to accelerate product creation and its goal of doubling the business contribution from new products by the end of fiscal 2025. \u201cAdditionally, NKE noted headcount actions are complete, and looks to other areas for savings, planning to reallocate $1B to invest in consumer-facing activities in FY25 to help support top line,\u201d the analyst added. \u201cThough channel-mix shift and franchise [management] will challenge the next few quarters, we think balancing product offerings, channels, and price points could help NKE be more competitive [long term].\u201d KeyBanc Capital Markets maintained its sector-weight rating for Nike.

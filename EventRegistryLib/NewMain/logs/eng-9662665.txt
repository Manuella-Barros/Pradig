Rhoades and Christian T. Gonzalez are both facing felony charges in the slaying of young Octavia Aquino, authorities announced.\n\nRhoades is facing one count of neglect of a dependent resulting in death while Gonzalez is facing one count of murder. Gonzalez, who was originally charged with one count of battery resulting in serious bodily injury, made his initial appearance in juvenile court on Monday before his case was waived to adult court.\n\nAccording to a news release from the Evansville Police Department, officers at about 9 a.m. on Friday, June 14, responded to an emergency call at a home in the 4500 block of Spring Valley Road in reference to a juvenile female who had stopped breathing. The caller -- who was one of three other adult females who lived at the home with Rhoades, Gonzales and Octavia -- told the emergency dispatcher that she found her roommate's child unresponsive and \"beyond help.\"\n\nUpon arriving at the scene, first responders described the little girl -- later identified as Octavia -- as being \"cold to the touch.\" The Evansville Fire Department arrived a short while later and began attempts to revive Octavia before transporting her to a local hospital.\n\nWhen she got to the hospital, Octavia was still alive, but had \"very little brain activity,\" authorities said.\n\nRhoades was at work when her daughter was found, saying she left before 7 a.m. and Octavia was asleep. She and the three other females who lived at the apartment were brought to police headquarters for questioning. Gonzalez was not questioned due to his age.\n\n\"A roommate stated that she noticed the child had bruises on her body yesterday, specifically around her neck area,\" the release states. \"She also had a human bite mark on her forearm. Detectives were told the 16-year-old boyfriend admitted he bit the child, but only after she bit him first. A roommate reported that the child seemed to be 'staring off and was nauseous' while in Rhoades' care last night. All three of these circumstances went unreported to law enforcement or medical staff during their occurrence.\"\n\nIn the release, police referred to Gonzalez as Rhoades' boyfriend five times, saying they came to Evansville together earlier this year when Gonzalez was 15 years old. Gonzalez had been reported missing from his home in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and was detained by police in Evansville in February. He was placed in a youth home which he immediately fled.

Her initial charges are neglect of a dependent resulting in serious bodily injury, a Level 3 felony, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor and invasion of privacy, both of which are misdemeanors. The charges could change following her daughter's death.\n\nThe 16-year-old male, who police described as Rhoades' \"boyfriend\" in a news release, was arrested and booked into the Youth Care Center on charges of battery with serious bodily injury, a Level 5 felony, and misdemeanor false informing. He is set to appear in court this afternoon. If waived to adult court, his name will be publicly released.\n\nEvansville Police Sgt. Taylor Merriss said potential updates would be provided on the charges for both the mother and the 16-year-old after their appearances is in court.\n\nAccording to an EPD probable cause affidavit, officers were called to the apartment for a medical emergency.\n\nThe caller identified themselves as Rhoades' best friend, and said she had found the 4-year-old not breathing.\n\nThe child was taken to the hospital and placed on life support. According to the affidavit, officers noticed a bite mark on the her right arm, and bruising on her legs and neck.\n\nThere were four adults in the apartment at the time officers arrived on scene. None aside from Rhoades were arrested in connection to the child's injuries.\n\nRhoades did not initially tell officers that the 16-year-old boy was living in the apartment, according to the affidavit, but another of the adults did. They also told the officer that the 16-year-old \"bit\" the 4 year old the day before.\n\nOfficers then found the 16-year-old in an upstairs bathroom.\n\nEPD detectives found that the 16-year-old was a missing juvenile from Fort Wayne, Indiana, and there was an active protective order out against Rhoades. Rhoades has an active EPD criminal case against her from February when she allegedly help the juvenile escape from a detention facility in Evansville and run away from his guardian in Fort Wayne.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Rhoades told police she had confronted the 16-year-old about the marks on her daughter and he told her a cat had caused the injuries.\n\nThe affidavit alleges that Rhoades lied, and said there was a camera in the living room and she would look at the footage, at which point the teen reportedly told Rhoades he had bitten the victim after she had bitten him first, according to the affidavit.\n\nRhoades also told officers in a different interview that her daughter had told her the 16-year-old bit her and \"covered\" her mouth.\n\nThe affidavit states that the rest of the day after the confrontation, Rhoades thought her daughter was displaying \"odd behaviors,\" and she did not eat anything aside from a bag of Cheetos the rest of the day.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, police asked Rhoades about a report that her daughter had vomited, as well.

As a result, Destiny F. Rhoades' charge has been upgraded from Neglect of a Dependent Resulting in Serious Bodily Injury to Neglect of a Dependent Resulting in Death, a level 1 felony.\n\nRhoades' 16-year-old boyfriend, Christian T. Gonzalez, who was initially charged with Battery Resulting in Serious Bodily Injury, has been charged with Murder, a level 1 felony. Gonzalez appeared in juvenile court and has been waived to adult court. He has been transported to the Vanderburgh County Confinement Center. An autopsy for Octavia Aquino is scheduled for this week.\n\nEarlier, on June 17, 2024, around 9:00 a.m., officers were dispatched to the 4500 block of Spring Valley Road for a medical emergency. The roommate found the 4-year-old unresponsive. Emergency services attempted to revive her, but she was transported to the hospital with very little brain activity. Rhoades, 23, was at work during the incident and returned to find her daughter unresponsive.\n\nThe investigation revealed troubling details. Rhoades and her juvenile boyfriend had arrived in Evansville earlier this year. In February, the 16-year-old, then 15, was reported missing from Fort Wayne, IN. After being located with Rhoades, he was placed in youth care facilities but fled. He was later found again with Rhoades.\n\nRhoades was previously arrested for Contributing to Delinquency of a Minor, a level 4 felony. She returned to Evansville for a court date in April, around the time the 16-year-old went missing again.

Help them stay calm with this trainer's simple five step process\n\nKathryn Williams\n\nJune 17, 2024 at 1:00 PM\n\nIt's fast-approaching that time of year again that many of us dog owners both love and loathe.\n\nOn the one hand, the weather is warmer, there's more sunshine and the days are longer, which means being able to enjoy the great outdoors with our pups more. But on the other hand, it's also the start of the summer holiday season, which often means parties and fireworks.\n\nFor some of our pups, loud noises are so stressful that even dishing out the best dog treats isn't enough to distract them.\n\nThankfully, in a recent Instagram post, expert trainer and behaviorist Renee Rhoades shared her simple five-step starter guide for sound desensitization and we highly recommend giving it a go!\n\nA post shared by Renee Rhoades | Canine Behaviorist (@r.plus.dogs)\n\nA photo posted by on\n\nBefore working on sound desensitization with your pup, it can be helpful to understand why loud noises bother our dogs so much.\n\n\"Dogs can hear high-frequency sounds better than us,\" explains Rhoades. Humans range from 12-20,000 Hertz, while dogs can hear up to 45,000 Hertz. In fact the highest sound a dog can hear doesn't register for us at all. Think about that next time you tell your dog nothing is there!\"\n\nRhoades goes on to say that loud noises like fireworks and sirens are high-frequency sounds, which explains why dogs will often have a stronger reaction to those.\n\nThe good news is that the anxiety in dogs that's often triggered by loud noises can be overcome through desensitization work. Here's how:\n\n1. Choose a sound your dog doesn't like (such as fireworks, the doorbell, police sirens etc) and find a video of these sounds on YouTube. You then want to play it for your dog -- but with one caveat. \"The sound needs to be at the lowest volume possible,\" Rhoades stresses.\n\n2. Next, you want to position yourself and your dog as far away from the noise as possible but in a location where you can still hear it.\n\n3. Distract your dog while you have the sounds playing. \"Feed or play with your dog while the sound plays for a few seconds,\" says Rhoades. You can use treats, kibble or one of the best dog toys for this.\n\n4. Repeat this process two to three times.\n\n5. Once you've done this, focus on slowly and gently increasing your dog's exposure to the noise. \"Gradually increase the sound and decrease the distance in each session if your dog is comfortable with the current level of sound,\" Rhoades advises.\n\nSound desensitization takes time, patience and consistency, so don't be disheartened if your dog doesn't respond well to begin with. This sort of things is a marathon not a sprint.\n\n\"When introducing potentially scary sounds to your dog, it's best to go at their pace,\" Rhoades explains. If you see any signs of discomfort in their body language, stop right away.\n\nFor pointers on what to look out for, be sure to check out our guide to how to read dog body language.\n\nWest Paw Toppl Dog Toy\n\n$23.96 from Chewy\n\nA treat dispensing puzzle that can be filled with kibble, peanut butter, cheese chunks or smashed banana, this toy is ideal for giving your dog's brain a good workout.View Deal", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kathryn_williams@aol.com", "name": "Kathryn Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desensitization_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Desensitization (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Behaviorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siren_(alarm)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siren (alarm)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dog food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_and_holiday_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christmas and holiday season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Banana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanut_butter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peanut butter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Body language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cheese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats_and_Dogs", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Cats and Dogs", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Supplies", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service_Animals", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Service Animals", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal_Assisted_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Animal Assisted Therapy", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5CV2u3YmikRPiwpGbELQAw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_petsradar_763/f9ca9d7083d1467e9d4fbf618f5dbfba", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662665", "eventUri": "eng-9662665", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-06-", "textStart": 122, "textEnd": 129}], "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

The Spanish world number three\u2019s participation at Roland Garros was in doubt after he pulled out of the Italian Open earlier this month due to an issue with his forearm. But the two-time major winner was in no obvious discomfort as he bared his teeth by dropping just four games against American Wolf. Wearing a protective sleeve on his right arm, the 21-year-old Wimbledon champion crashed down five aces and clubbed 27 winners in a statement 6-1 6-2 6-1 victory on Court Philippe Chatrier. He said: \u201cI\u2019m really happy to be back here in Paris to compete again, it\u2019s been a very difficult month for me because I love competing. \u201cI\u2019ve tried everything I could to be at 100 per cent here at Roland Garros to show my best tennis, and I think I did that today. \u201cI would have loved to have played more matches but I don\u2019t need too many matches to get to 100 per cent. I did really good preparation this past two weeks and practices with top players. My forearm is getting better and better.\u201d", "summary": "The two-time major winner dropped just four games against American Wolf.", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/roland-garros-carlos-alcaraz-spanish-french-american-b2551788.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/26/15/26-0565b194c15043bbb92047c92e7cb19a.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:37:15", "author": "Andy Sims", "authors": ["Andy Sims"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.154}

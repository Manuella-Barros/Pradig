(KGO) -- The Bay Area Air Quality Management District has issued a Spare the Air Alert through Monday due to smoke from the Point Fire. \"The smoke from the Point Fire was creating conditions that were getting into the unhealthier groups range on the air quality index,\" said Erin DeMerritt, a spokesperson with BAAQMD. Winds are blowing smoke towards the Bay Area. The heavier areas of smoke are just south of Lake Sonoma where the fire started. AQI in Windsor and Santa Rosa reached unhealthy levels at different points on Monday.

The smoke is considered unhealthy for those individuals. The Point Fire is about 20% contained as of Monday afternoon. Winds were calmer for most of the day, but there were still spots burning around the fire causing smoke to rise into the air. \"Smoke is a danger in and of itself,\" said James Gore, Sonoma County Supervisor for District 4. \"We have dealt with this for a long time. Ironically the smoke is the thickest not where the fire is.\" MORE: Stanford study examines the lasting effects wildfires have on soil, posing new problems Sonoma County is keeping evacuation orders in place.

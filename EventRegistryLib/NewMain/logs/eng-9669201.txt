amid Conservative claims the tax policy could lead to an exodus and overrun state schools.\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer has said 20 per cent VAT will be added to school fees if he wins power.\n\nThe revenues will be used to hire new teachers for comprehensives, with Holyrood landing an extra \u00a3150m.\n\nBut critics of the policy claim the tax will be unaffordable to parents on modest means who go private.\n\nThey claim thousands of pupils will be forced to leave private education, piling even greater pressure on a struggling state sector.\n\nIn Edinburgh alone, around 25 per cent of pupils are educated at private schools.\n\nHowever, figures provided by Edinburgh council show their state schools are operating under capacity.\n\nSchool roll projections show overall capacity at 65,948 pupils.\n\nBut estimates for the actual numbers of pupils expected to attend the August 2024 session is 53,143.\n\nThe figure falls to 52,881 pupils next year.\n\nThis works out at 12,805 and 13,067 spare places in state schools for the next two years.\n\nFor August 2024, there is space for another 8,671 primary school pupils and 4,134 at secondary school.\n\nThe council said none of their 23 secondary schools are oversubscribed for either the 2024 or 2025 projected intake.\n\nOf the 91 primary schools, there is one for 2024 that is currently over capacity.\n\nA Scottish Labour source said the figures \"destroyed\" the Tory arguments against the VAT policy.\n\nPam Duncan-Glancy, Labour's education spokesperson, said: \"Labour's plans to scrap tax breaks for private schools will deliver a sorely needed boost to our education system.\n\n\"To deliver change and opportunity for the next generation vote Scottish Labour.\"\n\nSNP leader John Swinney told the Record he supports the Labour plan: \"I am sympathetic to the points they bring forward on VAT and private schools.\"\n\n\"I understand where they are coming from.\"\n\nHe compared the move to the SNP Government ensuring private schools in Scotland pay non-domestic business rates.\n\nBut the Lib Dems, like the Tories, opposed the VAT plan.\n\nLib Dem candidate Christine Jardine said: \"It is ill-considered and hasn't been thought through properly.\n\n\"You are actually hitting the state sector.\"\n\nShe added: \"If I am re-elected, I will be supporting the state sector and the independent sector in saying this is a mistake.\"\n\nTo sign up to the Daily Record Politics newsletter, clickhere", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri":

That would be in Sept at the earliest because independent forecasters must be given 10 weeks' notice.\n\nIt means that the changes would be formally introduced in parliament around the same time that children were already starting the 2024/25 academic year.\n\nLabour insiders working on the policy insist that means the tax rise will not be applied this coming academic year, so the earliest it would come in is for the 2025/26 year.\n\nDespite the claims, tax experts have warned that Labour could apply the VAT raid to this academic year if they wanted.\n\nThe Conservatives jumped on the development, claiming Labour would raise less money than claimed if the private school tax change does not happen in its first year in office.\n\nA Tory source told The Telegraph: \"There are now serious questions for Labour. If they are delaying one of their flagship revenue raisers it means the money for their spending has to come from somewhere else. They have to come clean with the British people about what new taxes they will be imposing on people instead.\"\n\nMs Reeves told the Times CEO Summit that the private schools tax increase would not be applied \"retrospectively\" and would be included in her first Budget after a Labour victory.\n\nShe said the party was committed to the policy because \"the children who are struggling most are in state schools - young people are not getting the chance to fulfil their potential\".\n\nMs Reeves urged private schools to start bracing for the extra 20 per cent levy if Labour wins the general election.\n\nShe said: \"Over the last 14 years state schools have to make huge efficiencies because of the cuts to real-terms funding over the last few years and I strongly believe that private schools as well will be able to make efficiencies.\"\n\nRishi Sunak, who was educated at the private school Winchester College, attacked Labour's private schools policy in an interview this week.\n\nThe Prime Minister told the Daily Mail: \"People like my parents are the people who will be most affected by Labour's change. People who are working hard, who are aspiring to provide a better life for their kids. They are the people that will lose out.\n\n\"I believe in an aspirational country, I believe if you're working hard and you want to provide a better life for your family, then any government I lead will be on your side. Whether you want to send your kids to a private school, if you want to buy your first home as a young couple. Whether you want to set up a small business on your own or set up in self-employment, which I think is something to be admired.\n\n\"Those are all things that speak to the type of country that we are in that I want to support.\"\n\nEarlier in the week privately-educated Labour frontbenchers were accused of hypocrisy over the party's plans to impose VAT on fee-paying schools.\n\nNearly 25 per cent of the shadow cabinet attended private schools compared with seven per cent of children whose parents pay for their education.\n\nThey include Hilary Benn, Thangam Debbonaire, Louise Haigh and Anneliese Dodds, chairman of the Labour Party.\n\nJohn Healey, the shadow defence secretary, Alan Campbell, opposition chief whip in the Commons, and David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, were also privately educated.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Is it WW3 or the climate crisis? No - it's VAT on private schools | Lola Okolosie", "body": "Warnings of a looming apocalypse tell us more about Britain than Labour's plan to make education slightly less unequal\n\nBased on a quick glance at headlines from the rightwing press, you might be led to believe that the world as we know it is coming to an end. But this apocalypse is not related to the climate emergency, or geopolitics, or a new pandemic. No, it will come, apparently, as a result of Labour's plan to add VAT to private school fees.\n\nIntent on corralling their loyal readerships into the same frothing hysteria, these outlets blare, like foghorns, variations on a theme: VAT on private school fees is an iceberg to the Titanic that is that cornerstone of British life, the public school. They scoff at the \u00a31.5bn the policy would raise, a sum that could be used to recruit 6,500 new secondary school teachers at a time when only half of the required numbers in England are training to enter the profession. Since the public is too thick to see what is truly at stake here and the Tories are all but mincemeat, it's left to these parts of the press to resolutely speak truth to power.\n\n\"Labour's VAT raid on private schools poses 'existential threat', says Gordonstoun head\", scolded the Telegraph. If that doesn't stir the correct feelings of outrage in you, dear reader, perhaps a headline like \"Labour's VAT on private school fees to 'leave legacy similar to closure of mines'\" will rouse your sense of injustice?\n\nIn case you missed either of the above, news feeds could also alert you to \"Families in crisis as countdown begins to Labour's private school fee hike\", or \"Private school teachers' pensions under threat from Labour tax raid\". The Daily Mail warns that \"Labour's school VAT raid 'may harm' vulnerable pupils\". It's almost as though the rightwing faction of a profession (editors and broadcasters) in which 43% of the most influential figures attended public school has a vested interest in dominating the debate about this policy.\n\nAway from these hysterical headlines, the reality is that private schools are a bastion of privilege, preserving a cycle where the wealthy can afford an education that puts them at a remove from everyone else and which maintains their social and economic advantages. In a 2019 report, the Sutton Trust revealed that 39% of Britain's most powerful people attended private school, a rate five times higher than the general public. Though only making up 7% of Britain's entire school population, these elites represent 65% of our senior judges, 57% of Rich List members, 48% of FTSE 350 CEOs and 63% of Rishi Sunak's cabinet, on his becoming prime minister.\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies notes that the \"occupational status advantage\" of private school pupils results in higher earnings. Recent studies show that, in 2015, at the age of 25 a private school alumnus could expect to be earning 17% more than someone who went to a state school. By 40, men born in 1970 who attended private school earned 35% more than their state school peers, reflecting what the IFS calls \"a striking return on their parents' investment\". You may conclude, therefore, that they do not have a right to a government break. God forbid that those extensive and well-tended playing fields might be levelled, just a tad.\n\nAnd so this effort to equalise, in the smallest way possible, educational opportunity is twisted and distorted, becoming an outsized threat that is only a \"cruel\" desire to see the lives of \"hard-working\" people ruined. Forget about the Jacob Rees-Moggs and Boris Johnsons of our world, and instead consider the \"domestic staff, gardeners, caterers, plumbers, maintenance and administrative staff\" who could lose their jobs as a result of school closures. And if that doesn't get your tears flowing, there are also the parents \"who are both working two jobs\" who we do not \"associate with putting their children into an independent school\".\n\nEven by the right's own logic, the policy doesn't represent a real threat. In spite of considerable fees hikes over the past decade, private school attendance has remained as unruffled as a butler at Downton Abbey. Average fees for private day schools rose by 8% for the 2023-24 academic year, to an eye-watering \u00a318,064, with boarding school fees soaring to \u00a342,459. The Department for Education, rather inconveniently for the VAT scare stories, just reported that as of January 2024, private school enrolment rose from 591,954 the previous year to 593,486. And, ahem, 12 new independent schools opened last year. For all the siren-like wailing about expected enrolment drops should Labour follow through, the data asks that we make another set of inferences. Families choosing private education are more \"resilient\" and less sensitive to price increases than the scaremongering would have us believe.\n\nFor decades, private schools have been the grooming grounds for Britain's political and economic leaders. Countless prime ministers epitomise the journey from an expensive and exclusive education to positions of power in government and the media. These overblown stories of imminent disaster prove that the prospect of these schools facing financial pressure, however small, - or, heaven forbid, closing - is taken as a direct challenge to the entrenched privileges of Britain's elite.\n\nWhile I'm no Labour cheerleader at the moment, it's time for private schools to learn to play fair, even if it means their manicured lawns become a little less perfect. But maybe it is precisely this kind of disruption that so terrifies the elite.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lola_okolosie@theguardian.com", "name": "Lola Okolosie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Value-added tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apocalypse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Private school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Titanic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordonstoun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gordonstoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Fiscal_Studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Institute for Fiscal Studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerstone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cornerstone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hysteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceberg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iceberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Existentialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutton_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sutton Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School_Meals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School Meals", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/High_School_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/High School Health", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Chung_Moo_Doe", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Chung Moo Doe", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0be375455d91535c140eb76bf4c30d554543b054/0_27_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=d687fd22a061fc32b6b77e28a6f68a93", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669201", "eventUri": "eng-9669201", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

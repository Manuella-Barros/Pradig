Then we started seeing people looking incredibly distressed.\n\n\"The next second we knew, we were literally running for our lives to the very back of the store where we were told to get on the ground, away from the windows and just lay as flat as possible.\n\n\"We hid behind a clothing display that was about knee-high.

There were two children who were screaming.\"\n\nThe friends spent about 20 minutes lying on the floor with an Israeli family, a British family and a German girl.\n\n\"I've never been so terrified, it's a feeling I'll never be able to describe and hope I never experience again but so grateful I'm alive,\" Ms Reader wrote on Facebook.\n\nShe later told the ABC: \"We haven't come to terms with it. It's surreal. The sheer fear is quite incredible.\"\n\nIt is the third terror attack in three months faced by at least two of the travelling party.\n\nMs Reader and Ms Monaco were in lockdown in the London Tube when a van mowed down pedestrians on London Bridge in June and they were in Notre Dame days later when a hammer-wielding man attacked a police officer.\n\nDespite their ordeal, the trio plans to continue their trip.\n\nMs Monaco insisted she wouldn't take her parents' advice and cut her four-month European adventure short.\n\n\"I feel a bit rattled ... but I don't feel like I want to go home ...

They were yelling instructions which we could kind of make out to move away from the windows and to get down low on the floor.\n\n\"I don't think it's really truly hit home for us yet just how close we were.\"\n\nMs Monaco, on a four-month holiday, was in June caught up in the London Bridge terror attack and was staying in Paris when a hammer-wielding man attacked a police officer.\n\nShe plans to continue her trip, pending security advice, despite the latest ordeal.\n\n\"We are pretty adamant we are staying -- we came here to see Barcelona and we're not leaving until we see what we came to see,'' she said.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100, "id": 161, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders", "wgt": 100, "id": 811, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc", "id": "56"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "type": "loc", "id": "67"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "type": "loc", "id": "138"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "State of New South Wales"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of New South Wales"}, "type": "loc", "id": "70413"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc", "id": "86522"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cambrils"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambrils", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cambrils"}, "type": "loc", "id": "150774"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "type": "loc", "id": "151106"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "type": "loc", "id": "298752"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302532", "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302616", "label": {"eng": "Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302668", "label": {"eng": "Coast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302866", "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303057", "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303670", "label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Rambla,_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303748", "label": {"eng": "La Rambla, Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosive_belt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305331", "label": {"eng": "Explosive belt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "308008", "label": {"eng": "Sales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esplanade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312942", "label": {"eng": "Esplanade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Outfitters", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "314243", "label": {"eng": "Urban Outfitters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hide-and-seek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "379672", "label": {"eng": "Hide-and-seek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "382310", "label": {"eng": "Lockdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Corp_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "395693", "label": {"eng": "News Corp"}}]}

As they were about to leave, the store was locked, trapping everybody inside.\n\nMs Monaco told Nine.com.au that at first there was just confusion rather than panic or fear.\n\nThen sirens sounded and the crowd outside all began to look in the same direction.\n\nMs Monaco said: 'In a split second it became absolute pandemonium. We didn't see the van, we could just see the crowds and the police and some people who had clearly seen something terrible happen.\n\nMoped rider drives into massive sinkhole\n\n'We were looking at about 200 people crowded out in the square. Suddenly everyone outside just started screaming and everyone turned at the same time.\n\n'People were literally pushing to get into the store off the street. We were genuinely terrified.'\n\nShe told 3AW: 'We started to see people who looked incredibly distressed, walking away from the street and that's when we realised that something had definitely happened.\n\n'Then the next second we knew we were literally running for our lives to the very back of the store, where we were told to get on the ground, away from the windows, and to get as flat as possible.'\n\nShe also described how people were banging on the shop's windows to get in and of the panic inside as people became separated from their friends.\n\nThey remained locked inside for 20 minutes, hiding behind any shelter they could find.\n\nAsked if she wanted to come home Ms Monaco, who had quit her job in Melbourne three months ago to travel across Europe, said: 'I feel a bit rattled, it's not how I really expected today to go but I don't feel like I want to go home, I feel like I want to stay here and not let them, whoever they may be, win and I'm going to see what I came here to see.'\n\nMORE: Scotland might be the only country in the world where their favourite drink isn't Coke\n\nMORE: Moment terrorist is shot dead by police officer who killed FOUR attackers",

{"id": 231283846, "title": "Book review: Are women working on OnlyFans victims or savvy capitalists?", "text": "Does the publication of \u201cMargo\u2019s Got Money Troubles\u201d mean it\u2019s finally Rufi Thorpe\u2019s moment? Ever since her gripping debut novel \u201cThe Girls From Corona Del Mar,\u201d Thorpe has enjoyed a cult following among writers and critics for her fiction grounded in the California landscape. However, despite years of enthusiastic buzz, award nominations and glowing word-of-mouth praise, the general reception for her work has remained subdued. Now, Thorpe\u2019s literary hum has translated into a resounding roar. Long before publication, the Hollywood Reporter announced that A24 had acquired the rights to the author\u2019s fourth novel, \u201cMargo\u2019s Got Money Troubles,\u201d with David E. Kelley slotted to write the television adaptation as well as Nicole Kidman\u2019s and Elle and Dakota Fanning\u2019s production companies on board to executive produce. What caught their eyes? I\u2019d argue that beyond Thorpe\u2019s strong characters and tight plots, what sets her apart from her peers is the gnawing philosophical tension that rests at the center of her books. \u201cMargo\u2019s Got Money Troubles\u201d seizes upon the conundrum of the virgin-whore paradigm, using the boom of OnlyFans to explore if the women building followings on the site are pitiable victims or savvy capitalists working the system. Margo Millet was a 19-year-old student and part-time waitress when she stumbled into an affair with Mark, her English professor at Fullerton College. Their six-week fling wasn\u2019t particularly noteworthy. She reflects that, \u201cHe was a wind chime in human form, dangling dorkily from the glorious tree of higher education.\u201d Without the money to attend New York University, alongside her best friend, Becca, Margo found herself untethered, an all too familiar state. She grew up with Shyanne, her single mother, who worked in retail and waited with unfounded hope for Margo\u2019s dad, Jinx, to leave his wife and kids for her. Jinx was a professional wrestler who traveled the world, making it easy to conceal his affairs and breeze in and out of Margo\u2019s life. After drug addiction led to a bout in rehab, he retired from the profession, his marriage dissolving. As Jinx\u2019s life shifts into a new chapter, Margo finds herself unexpectedly pregnant with Mark\u2019s baby. Reconciling the aftermath of a flashy wrestling career is a fitting crisis for Thorpe\u2019s novel that\u2019s fraught with people who are always something more than they appear to be. Teachers are lying cheaters, wrestlers are performers, and unwed mothers aren\u2019t so easy to pigeonhole. Curiously, it\u2019s in Mark\u2019s classroom that Margo first begins to distinguish the power of perspective and narration. Distinguishing between fictional and real characters, Mark stresses that fictional characters \u201care only interesting because they aren\u2019t real. The fakeness is where the interest lies.\u201d It\u2019s a kernel of truth that Margo holds onto. Thorpe latches onto the ideas of perspective and circumstance as well as delusions of fantasy and reality throughout the book. Deploying a structural twist that also helps expand the way we understand her lead character\u2019s experience, Thorpe gives Margo the liberty to shift from first to third person: \u201cIt\u2019s true that writing in the third person helps me. It is so much easier to have sympathy for the Margo who existed back then rather than try to explain how and why I did all the things that I did.\u201d The grace of sympathy is also largely absent from blanket generalizations regarding women\u2019s sexuality. Frustratingly, it\u2019s Mark who tells his class, \u201cThe way you look at something changes what you see.\u201d If only it were so simple. This lack of perspective and sympathy explains why it\u2019s easier for Thorpe\u2019s characters to shape-shift rather than to try to explain themselves to people who fail to acknowledge complexity. Mark doesn\u2019t practice what he preaches. Adoration sours, and faced with her pregnancy, he ceases all communication. Margo recognizes that \u201cthe things Mark liked about me never felt like they really had anything to do with me. They were more his fantasy of me.\u201d In spite of logical arguments (Becca lays it bare: Raising a child \u201cis not a philosophical question. It\u2019s a financial decision.\u201d), Margo decides to go ahead and have the baby. However, once Bodhi is born, she loses her job as a waitress. Two of her three roommates, understandably, leave for a baby-free apartment. Margo is stuck: Her mother is no help; she\u2019s too busy courting a prudish suitor. And with no available \u2014 much less affordable \u2014 child care, Margo can\u2019t hold down a job. Reconciling \u201chow sacred the baby was to her, and how mundane and irritating the baby was to others,\u201d Margo found herself \u201cso raw and leaking, so mortal, and yet stronger than she\u2019d ever been.\u201d Conveniently, in fiction, solutions have a way of presenting themselves once you find your confidence. Rootless Jinx takes up residence as a roommate and unlikely home chef, providing for Margo in a way he never did when she was a child. The question of employment is resolved by what a person might imagine to be one of the easiest opportunities available to a stay-at-home mom: developing a following of clients on OnlyFans. Anxious about what it means to participate in consensual and voyeuristic but entirely virtual sex work, Margo\u2019s roommate Suzie points out: \u201cIt seems weird to say a celibate person is a slut. Like, you\u2019re just pretending words have meaning at that point.\u201d With that, and the financial independence the site provides, Margo gives herself over to the work. The bawdy, playful way that Margo constructs and flaunts her online persona, Hungry Ghost, is a total lark. At each step, she remains in control of her image and engagement. Lest you think that Thorpe has opted to shower Margo\u2019s work with the clich\u00e9 of empowerment, think again. The work is depicted without phony glamour, but also without the taint of shame. Margo\u2019s gift for language and penchant for the absurd flourishes as she distinguishes herself from other women on the site. The work becomes a puzzle of professional networking and optimization, aided by Jinx, who sets his protective, paternal hesitations aside when he sees that OnlyFans isn\u2019t too far removed from WWE. Together, they forge new friendships and create an unlikely family for baby Bodhi. In what feels like a fairy tale twist, Margo finds an unlikely kinship with a client who pays her for endearing personal stories rather than provocative photographs or videos. Complications arise and the antics halt when outside forces raise realistic and harrowing stakes. Thorpe allows her characters to remain flawed but bent toward redemption in this wholly entertaining, utterly endearing and thought-provoking novel that asks, \u201cWhat kind of truth would require this many lies to tell?\u201d Thorpe\u2019s novels defy easy categorization. Her characters\u2019 radiant energy and her books\u2019 knotted plots don\u2019t align with the moody atmosphere and tone poem quality of most contemporary literary fiction. Yet, these novels remain more intense and rigorous than most upmarket women\u2019s fiction. It\u2019s exhilarating to find an author who wants to tell you a good yarn, but also ask a lot of complicated questions. While she\u2019s been deemed a beach read, perhaps because of her California roots, Thorpe deserves to break past the limited vision that marketing places on female writers.

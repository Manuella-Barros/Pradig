This goes to show how important our appeals are and there will be more people we need to speak to in the coming days.\n\n\"We will also be appealing to them directly for information to help us in this investigation. These descriptions will be published on our social media channels, website and through the media.\n\n\"We already know that Peter's last known sighting was within the Kenninghall Post Office between 10:08 and 10:12am on Saturday but we still want to hear from anyone who saw him either before that time or after. His car, a red Skoda Fabia, was parked close to The Street, the road close to the heathland where he was walking his dogs Dylan and Gemma.\n\n\"We also want to hear from delivery drivers who might have travelled through or have been in the area on Saturday and who could have important dash cam footage for us to review. In addition, anyone else with images or footages of the area should contact us.\n\n\"The breadth of investigation is far reaching and involves numerous strands. Our main lines of enquiry include forensic investigations, extensive searches, witness interviews, house to house liaison, CCTV enquiries and close liaison with Peter's family.\"\n\n\"The Family Liaison Officers (FLOs) assigned to this investigation work closely with the family, who are partners in the investigation, to offer both support and to assist in the investigation. FLOs offer support to the family around the clock, giving advice and guidance.\n\n\"A team of Police Search Advisors are leading a number of searches at the scene. The search area is considerable and the search team are using a range of detection techniques and methods including use of metal detectors and dogs. It has been fingertip level searches in key areas to ensure all available evidence is identified and recovered.\n\nForensic examinations are progressing under the direction of a crime scene co-ordinator and two senior crime scene investigators.\n\nA variety of specialists are supporting these examinations using Forensic Service providers to access the latest scientific techniques.\n\nNorfolk's County Policing Commander, chief superintendent Mike Fawcett, addressed local residents' concerns.\n\nHe said: \"This is a significant murder investigation for the Constabulary.\n\n\"As such we now have over 100 officers and staff working on this enquiry with specialist officers from the National Crime Agency and other Forces and partners offering assistance. We have also been using our drone to take images of the scene.\n\n\"I can assure local residents that our presence will remain in the area for the foreseeable future and I hope this provides local communities with confidence that we are here to support and protect them.\n\nInformation to Norfolk police on 0800 056 0944 or 0207 158 0010, quoting Operation Graduate, visit the mobile police station or alternatively call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.", "time": "16:33:00"}

woodland\n\nDetectives questioning a man in his 20s on suspicion of murdering Peter Wrighton have been given extra time to interview him.\n\nNorfolk Police said Superintendent had today authorised a further 12-hour detention whilst the investigation continues.\n\nDetectives have also raided a house in the village of Cringleford, near Norwich, as they continue to question a man.\n\nA police spokesman said of the search of the house in Cringleford: 'We can say it's one of a number of locations which are linked to the ongoing investigation.'\n\nScroll down for video\n\nThe pensioner was a much-loved father and grandfather and his death has left the local community reeling in shock\n\nMr Wrighton was hacked to death in a crime so brutal that detectives at first assumed he had been mauled by an animal\n\nDetectives questioning the man will need to make a decision on whether to charge him or not by Monday morning or seek a further application for more time from magistrates.\n\nPolice also revealed that they spoke with more than 700 people on Saturday as part of anniversary checks and have identified more witnesses as a result.\n\nDetective Superintendent Andy Smith said: 'We are extremely pleased and grateful for the response from the public yesterday at the scene which has helped us to identify further witnesses.\n\n'We have also been able to obtain extra dash cam footage which will be downloaded to assist in our enquiries.\n\nPolice vehicles including a forensics team van were photographed parked outside a house that was raided in connection with the probe\n\nThe \u00a3365,000in Cringleford is one of a number of places that are being probed in connection with the murder of Peter Wrighton\n\n'In addition, we have taken over 170 calls since Wednesday (August 9) from members of the public who believe they have further information and this is also greatly appreciated.\n\n'Again, I would like to stress how important the public have been in helpingus to identify potentially key witnesses who were seen in different areas close to the murder scene on Saturday 5 August.\n\n'We are still keen to hear from any members of the pubic who were in this area on the relevant day and who have yet to speak to us.'\n\nDet Supt Andy Smith added: 'We still have around 100 officers working in the area, providing reassurance, speaking with witnesses and conducting house to house and CCTV enquiries.\n\nPolice continue their search for evidence bout the murder of Peter Wrighton at woods south of East Harling, Norfolk\n\nLeft: Forensic officers are pictured searching an area of woodland as they hunt for evidence into the pensioner's killing. Right: An officer questions a member of the public\n\n'We are also searching and forensically examining a number of locations which are linked to the ongoing investigation and you may see officers in other parts of the county.'\n\nDetectives ask that anyone with information about the incident contact Norfolk Police immediately on 0800 056 0944 or 0207 158 0010, quoting Operation Graduate.\n\nThey can also visit the mobile police station or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.", "time": "17:32:00"}

The referee wore one while officiating Manchester United vs Crystal Palace. The move is to capture footage for a future television programme promoting football officials.\n\nHistory has been made in the Premier League as referee Jarred Gillett became the first official in English top-flight history to wear a camera during Manchester United's match against Crystal Palace on Monday night. The camera, dubbed the 'ref-cam', was attached to the official and will capture footage throughout the 90 minutes.\n\nRelated 10 Best Referees in Football History (Ranked) Referees are not meant to be in the headlines, but these 10 were highly regarded for their world-class decision-making.\n\nIt's the first time any referee in the Premier League has worn such a device, and it will give fans a closer insight into what the referees deal with during a match in the top flight, including their interactions with some of the division's biggest players. Why was Gillett given a ref-cam, though? Well, according to Sky Sports, the move was made for television purposes.\n\nThe Footage Will Air On a TV Show It will serve as part of a one-off special on referees\n\nThe decision to provide Gillett with a camera comes as a result of a one-off TV programme that will look to promote match officials within football. The news was broken by Sky Sports News on air, and they explained the details of why Gillett was wearing a camera and when it would be seen.\n\nFans hoping to listen in to the referee's interactions with stars on the pitch will have to wait a while, however. The footage reportedly won't be made available to the public for several months when it will air on television as a part of the programme. The decision comes off the back of several high-profile incidents in which officials have been met with criticism from the public for some questionable errors within some of the biggest games in the Premier League.\n\nThe Programme Will Promote Match Officials They have been under a lot of fire recently\n\nAfter some critical mistakes during Nottingham Forest's recent match against Everton and Arsenal's win over Bournemouth, officials in the Premier League have been under plenty of fire lately. Their ability to officiate at the highest level has been brought under question by fans and media alike.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: According to the Premier League's chief football officer, Tony Scholes, 96% of decisions made this season have been correct.\n\nRelated Every Referee Currently Working in the Premier League We take a look at every Premier League referee working during the 2023/24 season.\n\nWhether the programme, set to promote the match officials will change any sort of opinion and outlook on them remains to be seen, but seeing first-hand what they have to deal with, in terms of the crowds, the work they put in and the interactions with players gives them as good a chance as any of winning people over.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarred_Gillett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jarred Gillett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Bournemouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Bournemouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Scholes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Scholes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-06-may-2024-08-11-pm-637.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542340", "eventUri": "eng-9542340", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Footage will not be broadcast live but it will be available later in the year when in-house Premier League Productions (PLP) releases a special programme.\n\nProposals for bodycams for referees to reduce dissent from players have become a regular discussion point for football lawmakers in recent years. In February, the Football Association launched a pilot - the first of its kind anywhere in the world - in four grass-roots leagues, after permission was granted by the game's lawmaking body, the International Football Association Board.\n\nReferee Rob Jones also wore a camera mounted on his chest for a pre-season friendly between Chelsea and Brighton last July. Elsewhere, a head-mounted RefCam was worn by Daniel Schlager during a 2-2 draw between Frankfurt and Wolfsburg in February in Germany.\n\nMoves to record exchanges between referees and players have been debated for decades. David Elleray wore a microphone whilst officiating Millwall against Arsenal in the late 1980s in a bid to improve awareness of the pressures referees face.\n\n\"The technology comprises a head-mounted device which is integrated into the usual referee communications system,\" the Premier League said in a new announcement.\n\n\"Its one-off use for educational purposes has been approved by The IFAB, the Premier League, PGMOL and both clubs. We would like to thank Crystal Palace and Manchester United for their support with this project.\"\n\nThe FA, meanwhile, has made a conscious effort to crack down on abuse directed at referees and match officials this season, with new rules brought in that sees players booked for surrounding the referee, among others.\n\nPost-match comments from players, managers or officials could receive a charge or warning if they \"imply bias, attack their integrity, are personally offensive, prolonged, or particularly unreasonable\".", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarred_Gillett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jarred Gillett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_First_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football League First Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Football_Association_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Football Association Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VfL_Wolfsburg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "VfL Wolfsburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Game_Match_Officials_Limited", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Game Match Officials Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Elleray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Elleray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millwall_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Millwall F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yGtQHO_qzlU23qFgNq9ACg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/63860e8d5e6e01ec53a200d04e2da9f4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542340", "eventUri": "eng-9542340", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

However, fans will be able to see the footage captured today later this year as part of a program that the Premier League is making to promote its match officials. There's a lot of pressure on Gillett to do a good job while donning the FPV camera.\n\n\"This footage will not be broadcast live but fans will be able to view it later in the year as part of a program being produced by Premier League Productions (PLP) aimed at offering further insight and education into the demands of officiating in the Premier League,\" the Premier League explains in a statement.\n\nThe league continues, explaining that the experiment comprises a head-mounted camera integrated into the ref's typical communications system, which includes an earpiece and microphone.\n\nGiven that the camera breaks new ground for the Premier League, using the RefCam required prior approval from the International Football Association Board (IFAB), the Premier League, Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), and the two clubs facing off.\n\nAs any sports fan knows, referees and officials face considerable abuse. This Premier League season has been particularly contentious, with teams publicly questioning the integrity of officials and one club, Nottingham Forest, even threatening legal action after it lost a match last month to Everton. Nottingham Forest is in the midst of a grueling relegation battle, which could see the club removed from the Premier League -- a significant blow to a club's financial health.\n\nNottingham Forest is far from the only club upset with the standard of officiating this season, though. Internationally known clubs like Arsenal and Liverpool have also had issues with match referees.\n\nIt is no surprise that the Premier League is taking matters into its own hands. However, it's not immediately evident that a video promoting officials will do much to prevent soccer fans from blaming officials for their teams losing.\n\nThe Premier League says, \"We would like to thank Crystal Palace and Manchester United for their support with this project.\"\n\nWhile this is a first for the Premier League, other top leagues have dabbled with putting cameras on officials. For example, a Major League Soccer (MLS) official in the United States wore a camera during the MLS All-Stars versus Arsenal friendly match last year, which should offer a nice preview of what Premier League fans will see later this year when the RefCam footage is shared.\n\nHockey refs have occasionally worn cameras for a long time, including former NHL referee Wes McCauley during an NHL Stadium Series game a decade ago.\n\nFirst-person perspectives in sports have grown in popularity in recent years. One of the most prolific examples is Formula 1, a sport long at the cutting-edge of camera tech, where all drivers wear a first-person camera in their helmets for every race.\n\nPerhaps one day, fans at home will be able to experience all their favorite sporting events in first person using VR and AR headsets.

was getting so bad that lives were at risk.\n\nThis trial was expanded to eight county associations in December last year as figures showed allegations of serious offences against grassroots match officials had increased slightly.\n\nThere were 1,451 such allegations in 2021-22, an increase of 1% on the previous campaign when 1,430 offences were recorded, FA data revealed.\n\nThe figures, contained in the FA's Annual Grassroots Disciplinary Review, also showed 72 allegations of an actual or attempted assault were made in 2022-23.\n\nOf those, 53 led to charges being brought and 42 were proven, with 11 not proven on the balance of probabilities due to insufficient evidence.\n\nRead more:\n\nFirst British South Asian to referee in Premier League\n\nWest Ham agree deal to replace David

The match, which saw Chelsea secure a thrilling 4-3 victory over Brighton in Philadelphia, served as an early showcase of this technology's potential.", "source": {"uri": "thestreetjournal.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarred_Gillett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jarred Gillett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Game_Match_Officials_Limited", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Game Match Officials Limited"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Jones_(footballer,_born_1979)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Jones (footballer, born 1979)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Football_Association_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Football Association Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Jousting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Jousting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Gymkhana", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Gymkhana", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Mounted_Orienteering", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Mounted Orienteering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://thestreetjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/5510221f-1051-4727-a286-49885d241fc1_premier-league-trophy-clean.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542340", "eventUri": "eng-9542340", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 181, "textEnd": 186}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

to \"improve participant behaviour and respect towards referees\".\n\nPaul Field, president of England's Referees' Association, had said at the time verbal and physical abuse of grassroots referees in the country was getting so bad that lives were at risk.\n\nThis trial was expanded to eight county associations in December last year as figures showed allegations of serious offences against grassroots match officials had increased slightly.\n\nThere were 1,451 such allegations in 2021-22, an increase of 1% on the previous campaign when 1,430 offences were recorded, FA data revealed.\n\nThe figures, contained in the FA's Annual Grassroots Disciplinary Review, also showed 72 allegations of an actual or attempted assault were made in 2022-23.\n\nOf those, 53 led to charges being brought and 42 were proven, with 11 not proven on the balance of probabilities due to insufficient evidence.\n\nRead more:\n\nFirst British South Asian to referee in Premier League\n\nWest Ham

Let us know in the comments section\n\nThe Bundesliga pulled a similar stunt earlier this year, when, in February, Daniel Schlager wore a camera and microphone during a 2-2 draw between Eintracht Frankfurt and Wolfsburg. The subsequent footage was then used on 'Referees Mic'd up - Bundesliga'.\n\nWhile, over the summer, Premier League referee Rob Jones wore a camera for a 2023 Summer Series match between Chelsea and Brighton in Philadelphia. Referee cameras have also been trialled at grassroots level by the FA - as they look to stamp out the amount of abuse officials suffer.\n\nUnited are back in action as they look to qualify for Europe and build some form ahead of their upcoming FA Cup final with Manchester City later this month.

Chelsea and Brighton in July, referee Rob Jones wore a camera mounted on his chest as the Blues ran out 4-3 winners in Philadelphia.\n\nA chest-mounted camera was also used in the clash between Arsenal and the MLS All-Stars in pre-season, with clips uploaded online from the referee's perspective.\n\nA head-mounted RefCam has also been introduced in the German top flight this season, with match official Daniel Schlager wearing a camera during the 2-2 draw between Frankfurt and Wolfsburg in February.\n\nThe Bundesliga later shared clips from the game from Schlager's perspective in a

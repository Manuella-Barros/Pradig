It's the society wedding of the year when that society doesn't want to know them - especially Meghan.\n\n\"I should think I mean the last thing Meghan wanted to do was to fly to the UK - where she's deeply unpopular - and be put on show, if you like, which she would be,\n\n\"To give them their credit, they knew that their presence there would actually deflect completely from the bride and groom, and that often happens when royalty go to a wedding.\"", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "becky_pemberton@thescottishsun.co.uk", "name": "Becky Pemberton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grosvenor,_1st_Duke_of_Westminster", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Grosvenor,_6th_Duke_of_Westminster", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gerald Grosvenor, 6th Duke of Westminster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godparent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Godparent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grosvenor,_2nd_Duke_of_Westminster", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chester Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocracy_(class)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aristocracy (class)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VII", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edward VII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaton_Hall,_Cheshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eaton Hall, Cheshire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sunday Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cheshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cheshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Accessories", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Software", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Software", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/prince-harry-duke-sussex-attending-899896387.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623447", "eventUri": "eng-9623447", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 1812, "textEnd": 1818}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 680, "textEnd": 686}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

Hugh is in the unique position of being tight friends with both William and Harry, despite their huge rift, and is godfather to both Prince George and Prince Archie.\n\nHowever, with the warring brothers seemingly unable to put aside their differences and their feud threatening to overshadow the wedding, only William will attend the nuptials, despite Harry also being invited - and it has cleared the way for him to perform a special role.\n\nAccording to The Times, Harry was invited to Hugh's wedding, but then over a phone call with the groom agreed to stay away in what is described as a \"civilised understanding\". This move in turn has cleared the way for William to perform his job as an usher at Friday's ceremony.\n\nIt is expected that William will attend the wedding without his wife the Princess of Wales, who is continuing her recovery following a cancer diagnosis. It is also believed that King Charles, a godfather of Hugh, and Queen Camilla also won't attend having just returned from France from D-Day commemorations the previous day.\n\nLast month, Hugh made rare remarks about his marriage as he visited Chester Cathedral - his wedding day venue. And he publicly spoke about those who have 'supported' him in the build-up to the big day.\n\n\"I think next time we're in here will be slightly more nerve-wracking. But I'm unbelievably excited,\" he told Town & Country. \"I just wanted to make it very clear how unbelievably helpful people have been, how supportive they've been so far which I'm unbelievably grateful for.\n\nHugh became the 7th Duke of Westminster when his father sadly died from a heart attack at the age of 64 in 2016. At the time of his succession, he inherited an estimated wealth of \u00a39billion and gained several new estates.\n\nHe became the head of The Grosvenor Group, which means he owns several huge areas of London, as well as land and over 1,500 buildings all across the world. In London, the group owns Park Lane, half of Mayfair and 300 acres of Belgravia.\n\nThe family also has several enormous estates that include Eaton Hall in Cheshire and the Abbeystead Estate in Lancashire, as well as homes in Scotland and Spain. Some of the most notable buildings owned by the group include the Liverpool One shopping centre, a residential tower in Tokyo, a large chunk of Silicon Valley in California and Annacis Island, near

The Duke, whose real name is Hugh Grosvenor, is in the usual position of being a tight-knit friend to both the royal brothers, despite their huge rift - and is even a godfather to both Prince George and Prince Archie.\n\nInevitably, it seems that both brothers were invited to the grand ceremony, but with their bitter rift threatening to overshadow the big day, it seems that Harry agreed not to attend. His decision means William can fulfil the role of usher at the wedding.\n\nAccording to The Times, Harry was invited to Hugh's wedding, but then over a phone call with the groom agreed to stay away in what is described as a \"civilised understanding\". This move in turn has cleared the way for William to perform his job at Friday's ceremony.\n\nIt is expected that William will attend the wedding without his wife the Princess of Wales, who is continuing her recovery following a cancer diagnosis. It is also believed that King Charles, a godfather of Hugh, and Queen Camilla also won't attend having just returned from France from D-Day commemorations the previous day.\n\nHugh became the 7th Duke of Westminster when his father sadly died from a heart attack at the age of 64 in 2016. At the time of his succession, he inherited an estimated wealth of \u00a39billion and gained several new estates. He became the head of The Grosvenor Group, which means he owns several huge areas of London, as well as land and over 1,500 buildings all across the world. In London, the group owns Park Lane, half of Mayfair and 300 acres of Belgravia.\n\nThe family also has several enormous estates that include Eaton Hall in Cheshire and the Abbeystead Estate in Lancashire, as well as homes in Scotland and Spain. Some of the most notable buildings owned by the group include the Liverpool One shopping centre, a residential tower in Tokyo, a large chunk of Silicon Valley in California and Annacis Island, near Vancouver.\n\nLast month, Hugh made rare remarks about his marriage as he visited Chester Cathedral - his wedding day venue. And he publicly spoke about those who have 'supported' him in the build-up to the big day.\n\n\"I think next time we're in here will be slightly more nerve-wracking. But I'm unbelievably excited,\" he told Town & Country. \"I just wanted to make it very clear how unbelievably helpful people have been, how supportive they've been so far which I'm unbelievably grateful for.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_newton@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Jennifer Newton", "type": "author", "isAgency":

The 7th Duke of Westminster was long considered to be one of Britain's most eligible bachelors before getting engaged, with his family's estimated net worth of $12.8 billion making him the richest person in the U.K. under age 40 and the 14th wealthiest overall, according to The Sunday Times' Rich List 2024.\n\nRelated: Prince Harry Declined Invite to Duke of Westminster's Wedding: 'Understanding Between Two Friends' (Exclusive)\n\nHugh chairs the Grosvenor Trustees and charitable Westminster Foundation, and his family's real estate portfolio includes 300 acres across London neighborhoods Mayfair and Belgravia as well as buildings in more than 40 cities worldwide.\n\nBeyond his business and philanthropic interests with the Westminster Foundation (a grant-giving organization dedicated to helping vulnerable young people in Westminster and Chester, where his family's roots run deep), Hugh has a posh hobby: skeet shooting! The Duke of Westminster has represented Team Great Britain at Olympic competitions overseas and around the U.K.\n\nThe Duke of Westminster inherited his title at age 25 when his father, Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, died in 2016 at age 64, and the memorial service was attended by many members of the royal family. The Grosvenor family's ties to the British royals trace back generations, and the groom's mother, Natalia, is a godmother to Prince William, 41.\n\nThe Prince of Wales and Prince Harry also served as ushers at the wedding of Hugh's sister Lady Tamara to Edward van Cutsem in 2004, and the celebration at Chester Cathedral was attended by Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.\n\nRelated: Prince William Will Take on a Special Role at Prince George's Godfather's High Society Wedding\n\nHugh is also a godson of King Charles and a godfather to both Prince George, 10, and Prince Archie, 5. It's understood that the Duke of Westminster has remained close to both Prince William and Prince Harry amid the rift between the royal brothers, and PEOPLE confirms that the Duke of Sussex, 39, declined an invite to the summer nuptials.\n\nThere was an acknowledgment on both sides that it would be difficult for Harry to attend, as he has been based in California with Meghan Markle since 2020 and no longer uses his former Frogmore Cottage home during U.K. stays.\n\nPrince Harry's decision not to attend the wedding was an \"understanding between the two friends,\" one source describes the conversation. An insider close to the bride and groom tells PEOPLE that Prince Harry and the Duke of Westminster mutually agreed on the decision.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex sends \"his love and support and admiration for the couple\" for their wedding day, the source tells PEOPLE.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

While ordinarily the Summer Flowers project is funded by the Chester BID [Business Improvement District], The Duke of Westminster and Miss Olivia Henson have sponsored this year's displays as part of local celebrations of their marriage at the Cathedral on 7 June,\" a spokesperson for the couple said in a statement.\n\n\"They are very grateful for all the support and kind wishes they have received

The 7th Duke of Westminster was long considered to be one of Britain's most eligible bachelors before getting engaged, with his family's estimated net worth of $12.8 billion making him the richest person in the U.K. under age 40 and the 14th wealthiest overall, according to The Sunday Times' Rich List 2024.\n\nRelated: Prince Harry Declined Invite to Duke of Westminster's Wedding: 'Understanding Between Two Friends' (Exclusive)\n\nHugh chairs the Grosvenor Trustees and charitable Westminster Foundation, and his family's real estate portfolio includes 300 acres across London neighborhoods Mayfair and Belgravia as well as buildings in more than 40 cities worldwide.\n\nBeyond his business and philanthropic interests with the Westminster Foundation (a grant-giving organization dedicated to helping vulnerable young people in Westminster and Chester, where his family's roots run deep), Hugh has a posh hobby: skeet shooting! The Duke of Westminster has represented Team Great Britain at Olympic competitions overseas and around the U.K.\n\nThe Duke of Westminster inherited his title at age 25 when his father, Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor, died in 2016 at age 64, and the memorial service was attended by many members of the royal family. The Grosvenor family's ties to the British royals trace back generations, and the groom's mother, Natalia, is a godmother to Prince William, 41.\n\nThe Prince of Wales and Prince Harry also served as ushers at the wedding of Hugh's sister Lady Tamara to Edward van Cutsem in 2004, and the celebration at Chester Cathedral was attended by Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.\n\nRelated: Prince William Will Take on a Special Role at Prince George's Godfather's High Society Wedding\n\nHugh is also a godson of King Charles and a godfather to both Prince George, 10, and Prince Archie, 5. It's understood that the Duke of Westminster has remained close to both Prince William and Prince Harry amid the rift between the royal brothers, and PEOPLE confirms that the Duke of Sussex, 39, declined an invite to the summer nuptials.\n\nThere was an acknowledgment on both sides that it would be difficult for Harry to attend, as he has been based in California with Meghan Markle since 2020 and no longer uses his former Frogmore Cottage home during U.K. stays.\n\nPrince Harry's decision not to attend the wedding was an \"understanding between the two friends,\" one source describes the conversation. An insider close to the bride and groom tells PEOPLE that Prince Harry and the Duke of Westminster mutually agreed on the decision.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex sends \"his love and support and admiration for the couple\" for their wedding day, the source tells PEOPLE.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

While ordinarily the Summer Flowers project is funded by the Chester BID [Business Improvement District], The Duke of Westminster and Miss Olivia Henson have sponsored this year's displays as part of local celebrations of their marriage at the Cathedral on 7 June,\" a spokesperson for the couple said in a statement.\n\n\"They are very grateful for all the support and kind wishes they have received

Like Queen Elizabeth, she loves horses and a great tiara moment.\n\nPrince Harry was invited to Britain's wedding of the year, but both parties recognized the challenges of his attendance.\n\nPEOPLE confirms that the Duke of Sussex, 39, was invited to the upcoming wedding of Hugh Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster, to Olivia Henson at Chester Cathedral in northern England on June 7. However, there was an acknowledgment on both sides that it would be difficult for Harry to attend. Meanwhile, Prince William is expected to serve as an usher at what is regarded as the society wedding of the year.\n\nIt was an \"understanding between the two friends,\" one source describes the conversation between the two dukes. An insider close to the bride and groom tells PEOPLE that Harry and the Duke of Westminster mutually made the agreement.\n\nThe decision certainly avoided the inevitable clamor had estranged brothers Prince William, 41, and Prince Harry both attended the nuptials, eliminating the possibility of the big day being overshadowed for the couple.\n\nTransatlantic travel to the U.K. is fraught for Harry due to security challenges in his home country. His official support was removed after he and his wife, Meghan Markle, stepped back from their royal roles and relocated to her home state of California in 2020. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex can also no longer use Frogmore Cottage, their former home in Windsor Great Park, as a base during stays in the U.K.\n\nMoreover, Prince Harry's RSVP removes any difficulty of being shown to his seat by his brother, who will welcome guests and help them find their place in the church's pews on Friday.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex sends \"his love and support and admiration for the couple\" for their wedding day, the source tells PEOPLE.\n\nHugh is a godfather to Prince Harry and Meghan's 5-year-old son, Prince Archie, as well as Prince William and Kate Middleton's eldest son, Prince George, 10.\n\nBeyond the Prince of Wales, other prominent guests at the summer nuptials will be Grosvenor's sisters, Lady Edwina and Lady Tamara, and their husbands, broadcaster Dan Snow and banker Edward van Cutsem.\n\nThe Times summarized the upcoming wedding as \"the most royal nonroyal wedding of the year, with members of Britain's oldest and wealthiest aristocratic families heading north.\" Hugh, 33, and Olivia, 31, announced their engagement in April 2023 after two years of dating, and the bride will become the new Duchess of Westminster when they tie the knot. Hugh inherited the title at age 25 when his father died in 2016, and the family's net worth is estimated at $12.8 billion.\n\nIn further ties to the royal family, the Duke of Westminster is a godson of King Charles and his mother is a godmother to Prince William.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

Hugh is one of the very few close friends of William and Harry's who has maintained strong bonds and a line of communication with both,\" the source told the Times.\n\n\"He wishes they could put their heads together and patch things up, but realises it's unlikely to happen before the wedding. He wanted to avoid anything overshadowing the day, especially for Olivia, and doesn't want any awkwardness.\"\n\nThere's been no sign of any easing of tension between Harry and William, with the latter reportedly still furious about his brother's heavy public criticism of himself and Kate since leaving royal duties.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry's absence at the Duke of Westminster's wedding may be the most high-profile, but he's not the only royal unable to attend.\n\nKing Charles, who is the duke's godfather, is also likely to skip the occasion. The monarch, who recently returned to public-facing engagements during his cancer treatment, will be travelling to France alongside Queen Camilla and William for D-Day commemorations the day prior.\n\nRegardless, it's still on track to be a massive event, with over 400 guests invited to witness the nuptials at Chester Cathedral.\n\nFollowing the service, guests will attend an opulent reception at the Grosvenors' nearby 11,000-acre estate, Eaton Hall, the couples' new home.\n\nOn June 8, a second, more intimate reception will be held at the same venue.", "source": {"uri": "news.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "News.com.au"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bronte_coy@news.com.au", "name": "Bronte Coy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grosvenor,_1st_Duke_of_Westminster", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Westminster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duke of Westminster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godparent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Godparent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VIII", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edward VIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Camilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queen Camilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chester Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaton_Hall,_Cheshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eaton Hall, Cheshire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Accessories", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Software", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Software", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/d5525786f3561c8e90a2e717d1fb9aa4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623447", "eventUri": "eng-9623447", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-08", "textStart": 2660, "textEnd": 2666}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

He was mentored for years by Hugh's father, Gerald - who died aged 64 from a heart attack in 2016. Gerald was one of King Charles' closest friends.\n\nIt's been widely reported that the Prince of Wales will play a key role in the nuptials, most likely acting as an usher when the high society guests file into Chester Cathedral ahead of the ceremony.\n\nFriends have suggested the Prince of Wales was first asked in December, and at one stage, he was even said to have been earmarked as a best man.\n\nThe Prince of Wales and Prince George, pictured at the FA Cup final last month, are set for another father/son outing, with William likely to be an usher for his close friend\n\nPrince William, pictured with Grosvenor in 2004, was at one point in the running to be the Duke's best man\n\nEarlier this month, a well-informed source told The Mail on Sunday: 'William was asked to have a prominent role in the wedding and that's what triggered Harry to decline an invitation.\n\n'Apparently he [Harry] was put out by the request when he thought it should have been him.'\n\nWhen Prince William's eldest son Prince George was born in 2013, Hugh Grosvenor, known to friends as 'Huey', was named godfather.\n\nIt's unclear the role that Prince George, pictured at the Easter Mattins service in Windsor earlier this year, will take but it's rumoured the 10-year-old could also take a 'prominent role'\n\nPrince George could also play a prominent role in the wedding, and will certainly by his father's side during the ceremony. When he was asked to be godfather to the future king in 2013, the Duke was the youngest of the seven godparents.\n\nIf the young prince, 10, takes a starring role in the wedding, it will come as he prepares to head to secondary school in September.\n\nTHE TRIO OF LOCAL SCHOOL PUPILS WHO WILL SING FOR THE DUKE AND HIS BRIDE\n\nSweet music: Head Chorister of the Chester Cathedral Choir is Grace Crooks, a Year 12 student at The Queen's School in Chester will lead the singing at the wedding. Right: Cassie Lounds, a Year 10 pupil at the same school is also one of the choristers\n\nThe Duke of Westminster, 33, revealed to his local paper the Chester Standard that people within the religious community in Chester have been 'unbelievably helpful' in helping the couple with their wedding plans\n\nExcited chorister Grace says in a video released by the school to celebrate the Duke's big day that singing at the wedding is 'a lot of pressure but it is such an incredible opportunity and I can't wait!'\n\nA trio of local schoolchildren will help the Duke of Westminster and his soon-to-be bride celebrate their big day as choristers for the ceremony.\n\nTalented vocalists Grace Crook, Isla Mills and Cassie Lounds, who all attend The Queen's School in Chester, have appeared in a video discussing their excitement at being part of the Duke of Westminster and his fianc\u00e9e Olivia's big day.\n\nCrook, who is currently approaching the end of Year 12 and is now Head Chorister of the Chester Cathedral Choir, said she 'hadn't looked back' since first joining the singing collective several years ago.\n\nIn the clip, the teenager says: 'It is an absolute honour to now be the Head Chorister and I am really looking forward to the big day. It is a lot of pressure but it is such an incredible opportunity and I can't wait!'\n\nThe Queen's School's head, Joanne Keville, said the school was delighted to have been asked to participate, saying: 'We are thrilled and immensely proud of Grace, Isla, and Cassie for taking part in such a significant event and look forward to celebrating their continued success.\n\n'Their achievements are a shining example of what our students can accomplish when given the opportunity and support to pursue their passions. We look forward to hearing all about it when they return to school on the Monday after the wedding. What an amazing experience!'\n\nCHESTER TRANSFORMED INTO A CITY OF 100,000 FLOWERS\n\nThe city is being decorated with 100,000 flowers planted in displays across the city throughout the summer, paid for by the groom himself to mark his marriage\n\nCestrians - as the people of Chester are known - are enjoying a floral transformation of their city, after the Duke of Westminster gifted them 100,000 blooms.\n\nFor the rest of the summer planted displays will mark the high society marriage - and the couple are set to donate their wedding flowers to local charities and organisations.\n\nPhotos shared by the city's Business Improvement District on X showed the behind the scenes of setting up the stunning floral displays several weeks ago.\n\nSnaps show volunteers holding onto the blossoms and distributing them around the streets\n\nSnaps pictured volunteers holding onto the blossoms and distributing them around the streets.\n\n'As part of local celebrations for their wedding, the Duke of Westminster and Olivia Henson are delighted to sponsor this year's Chester BID Flower Planting, along with a planting morning with the BID team and Chester Businesses,' the social media caption read.\n\n'The colourful displays which feature vibrant pollinators - benefiting biodiversity as well as the amenity of the city, have now been planted and can be enjoyed across Chester high street and historic rows.'\n\nThe photos were also shared on the organisation's Instagram page.\n\nGOING TO THE CHAPEL! HISTORIC CATHEDRAL WHERE CEREMONY WILL TAKE PLACE\n\nThe couple will tie the knot at Chester Cathedral; a venue that holds a special place in Hugh Grosvenor's heart\n\nThe Duke and future Duchess of Westminster will marry in the stunning Chester Cathedral, near to where Hugh, 33, grew up.\n\nSpeaking to his local newspaper, the Chester Standard, he revealed the reason why he chose the Cathedral to say his vows.\n\n'We've obviously got a long association with the cathedral as a family so we were here for my father's memorial, my sister's wedding and every Remembrance Sunday that I can attend is here,' he said.\n\n'But I'm unbelievably excited and I also wanted to make it very clear how unbelievably helpful people have been, how supportive they've been so far, which I'm unbelievably grateful for because I do realise that it's going to be a big, big thing for the city.\n\nThe Duke's father's memorial took place at the cathedral, as well as his older sister Lady Tamara Grosvenor's 2004 wedding to Edward van Cutsem\n\n'It's going to be certainly a huge thing for us and we're grateful for all the help really.'\n\nHe and Olivia also discussed their plans to eventually move to Eaton Hall, where the Duke grew up.\n\nThe bride-to-be revealed it was an 'easy decision' to move to Chester eventually, and she explained the couple are already transitioning away from London and up to Chester as they plan for their future together.\n\nWELL-WISHERS ARE EXPECTED TO LINE THE STREETS BUT ARE WARNED OVER TWO-DAY ROAD CLOSURES\n\nCrowds are expected to line the streets on the big day just as they did for Hugh's sister's wedding in 2004 (pictured) - with well-wishers advised to use public transport\n\nSpeaking about his big day, Hugh said the occasion will be a 'big, big thing for the city'.\n\nHundreds of well-wishers are expected to turn out to watch the couple drive through the streets as newlyweds, and the local council has announced road closures from tomorrow.\n\nThe Chester Standard this week reported that advisories have been put in place around travelling into the city by car from Wednesday 5th to Friday 7th June.\n\nCheshire West and Chester Council posted on X, formerly Twitter: 'Please rethink journeys into the city centre on that day, avoiding travelling in by car if possible.'\n\nThe council has perhaps used the Duke's sister Lady Tamara Grosvenor's 2004 wedding to Edward van Cutsem as a blueprint.\n\nOn the day of her nuptials, crowds lined the Chester streets in order to catch a glimpse of the bride, groom and guests - who included Prince William, Prince Harry and the late Queen.\n\nA report from the Crewe Chronicle after the wedding said the arrival of William and Harry at Chester Cathedral sent the crowds 'wild'.\n\nIt reported swarms of teenage girls screamed 'marry me William' as he walked into the Cathedral.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 100 police officers were deployed around the city to ensure smooth sailing on the day - a security presence likely to be replicated on June 7.\n\nFROM FAMILY TO ARISTO FRIENDS AND TV STARS: WHO ELSE IS ON THE GUEST LIST?\n\nThe Duke's sisters\n\nThe wedding of Lady Tamara Grosvenor, and Edward van Cutsem. The King and Queen chose to turn down their invitations to the 2004 wedding\n\nHugh Grosvenor is one of four siblings, and the only boy. When his father Gerald died from a heart attack in 2016 at just 64 years old, Hugh inherited the Dukedom as his only male heir.\n\nHugh's sisters are Lady Tamara, 42, who is best friends with Prince William, Lady Edwina, 41, and Lady Viola, 29.\n\nThe siblings will of course be in attendance at the wedding with their families.\n\nLady Tamara married her husband Edward van Cutsem at the same venue in 2004 (in a service attended by the late Queen, Prince William and Prince Harry), which saw crowds lining the streets of Chester to get a look at the bride and groom, as well as the high society attendees.\n\nShe and her husband have three children; Jake, 14, Louis, 12 and Isla, nine.\n\nLady Edwina Grosvenor is a prison reform campaigner and chair of One Small Thing, an organisation which aims to redesign the justice system for women and their children.\n\nShe is married to TV historian Dan Snow, with whom she shares three children Zia, 12, Wolf, 10, and Orla nine.\n\nLady Viola Grosvenor married her husband Angus Roberts, of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, in 2022.\n\nDan Snow\n\nLady Edwina Grosvenor and her husband, TV historian Dan Snow, will be in attendance and Edwina's brother's wedding (pictured at Harry and Meghan's wedding in 2018)\n\nTV historian Dan Snow, who married Lady Edwina Grosvenor in 2010, will be among the attendees at the wedding.\n\nSpeaking about the family into which he married, Dan previously told The Times: 'They're a lovely, close family, really close. The four of them are a team. It's extraordinary.'\n\nAlthough he married into extraordinary wealth, Dan has spoken in the past about his wife's philanthropic career, which may lead to the couple giving away their children's inhertance.\n\nIn contrast to her siblings, Lady Edwina decided to wed Dan in a much more low-key ceremony at Bishop's Lodge in Woolton, Liverpool.\n\nThe couple were pictured at Harry and Meghan's Windsor wedding at St George's Chapel in 2018.\n\nOlivia's Belazu colleagues\n\nOlivia Henson is currently based in London and works for quality ingredient company, Belazu, which sells products such as harissa paste and preserved lemons for home cooks who want to up the ante on their recipes.\n\nThe company's ethos is providing sustainable, good quality ingredients, and Olivia has been described as something of a foodie.\n\nIt's not certain who from Olivia's side of friends and family will be invited to the wedding - but it's likely some of her colleagues will be in attendance.\n\nTHE NO-SHOWS\n\nHarry and Meghan\n\nHarry and Meghan have already been excluded from next month's wedding, even though Hugh, who has an estimated fortune of \u00a310billion, is reportedly the godfather of their son, Prince Archie. Hugh is believed to have felt the Sussexes' appearance could cause tensions with the Royal Family\n\nAs many senior members of the royal family prepare to attend the society wedding of the year, one couple will be notably absent from the festivities.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle will remain in the US while their son Prince Archie's godfather ties the knot.\n\nAmid reports that the Prince of Wales will be an usher at the wedding, sources told the Mail on Sunday that Harry was 'put out' by the decision because he had always regarded himself as being closer to the Duke.\n\nThe source claimed: 'William was asked to have a prominent role in the wedding and that's what triggered Harry to decline an invitation. Apparently he [Harry] was put out by the request when he thought it should have been him.'\n\nReferencing the lack of public details about the occasion, the source added: 'Both the Palace and Hugh's people decided to hold dear the operational part of the wedding once the leak about Harry not attending made the papers.'\n\nLast year, it was claimed that Prince Harry had been 'snubbed' from the wedding, but a source close to the Sussexes was at pains to explain to US publication Page Six that both Meghan and Harry had in fact received invitations, but had jointly decided to decline.\n\nCatherine, Princess of Wales\n\nThe Princess of Wales has not been pictured in an official appearance since Christmas Day 2023 and is not expected to attend the wedding due to her health\n\nThe Princess of Wales has not appeared in public since Christmas Day 2023, after she underwent abdominal surgery and doctors later found cancerous cells in her body.\n\nSince then, Kate, 41, has been recuperating at home while undergoing a course of preventative chemotherapy.\n\nAside from a few glimpses, such as an emotional video in which she confirmed the cancer diagnosis and a heavily disputed Mother's Day photo which she later admitted had been 'edited', Kate has not made any public appearances so far this year.\n\nAs such, Kate is not expected to attend the wedding - but we can be certain she has received an invitation.\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla\n\nThe society wedding of the year is less than three weeks away, yet King Charles and Queen Camilla have still not confirmed their attendance, I hear.\n\nThe attendance of King Charles and Queen Camilla at the society wedding of the year remains unconfirmed - and is now looking increasingly unlikely.\n\nReports have suggested Their Majesties have turned down invitations to the shindig as a result of a 'snub' directed at Camilla when Hugh's sister, Lady Tamara wed Edward van Cutsem in 2004.\n\nCamilla Parker Bowles, as she was then, had been told that she would not be allowed to sit with Prince Charles and would instead be seated several rows back and be made to arrive separately.\n\nThis was because of royal protocol since Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip attended the ceremony, along with Princes William and Harry.\n\nTensions were heightened by reports that Emilie van Cutsem, the groom's mother, and Camilla had fallen out after each is alleged to have criticised the behaviour of the other's children.\n\nCharles ultimately excused himself from the event with just days to go, saying he had to visit Warminster barracks to meet the families of soldiers serving in Iraq. Camilla was described as 'otherwise engaged'.\n\nAccording to royal author Sarah Bradford, Camilla was so infuriated that she told Charles the status quo was no longer acceptable. Their own engagement was announced three months later.\n\nThe King, who is Grosvenor's godfather, is still undergoing cancer treatment and will be travelling to France the day before the ceremony next month with the Queen and Prince William to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy.\n\nTHE MAYBES\n\nPrincess Charlotte and Prince Louis\n\nIt is unclear whether Princess Charlotte, nine and Prince Louis, six, will be on the attendee list at the wedding (pictured in Sandringham on Christmas Day)\n\nWith their father, Prince William, and oldest brother Prince George, in attendance at the wedding, the younger Wales siblings may well be present at Hugh Grosvenor's nuptials.\n\nHowever, considering that the Princess of Wales is not expected to attend the wedding, it may be that Charlotte, nine, and Louis, six, remain at home with their mother.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

An insider close to the bride and groom tells PEOPLE that Harry and the Duke of Westminster mutually made the agreement.\n\nThe decision certainly avoided the inevitable clamor had estranged brothers Prince William, 41, and Prince Harry both attended the nuptials, eliminating the possibility of the big day being overshadowed for the couple.\n\nRelated: Prince George's Godfather Tops List as Richest Young Brit as Wedding Day Approaches\n\nTransatlantic travel to the U.K. is fraught for Harry due to security challenges in his home country. His official support was removed after he and his wife, Meghan Markle, stepped back from their royal roles and relocated to her home state of California in 2020. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex can also no longer use Frogmore Cottage, their former home in Windsor Great Park, as a base during stays in the U.K.\n\nMoreover, Prince Harry's RSVP removes any difficulty of being shown to his seat by his brother, who will welcome guests and help them find their place in the church's pews on Friday.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex sends \"his love and support and admiration for the couple\" for their wedding day, the source tells PEOPLE.\n\nHugh is a godfather to Prince Harry and Meghan's 5-year-old son, Prince Archie, as well as Prince William and Kate Middleton's eldest son, Prince George, 10.\n\nBeyond the Prince of Wales, other prominent guests at the summer nuptials will be Grosvenor's sisters, Lady Edwina and Lady Tamara, and their husbands, broadcaster Dan Snow and banker Edward van Cutsem.\n\nThe Times summarized the upcoming wedding as \"the most royal nonroyal wedding of the year, with members of Britain's oldest and wealthiest aristocratic families heading north.\" Hugh, 33, and Olivia, 31, announced their engagement in April 2023 after two years of dating, and the bride will become the new Duchess of Westminster when they tie the knot. Hugh inherited the title at age 25 when his father died in 2016, and the family's net worth is estimated at $12.8 billion.\n\nIn further ties to the royal family, the Duke of Westminster is a godson of King Charles and his mother is a godmother to Prince William.\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

Also, roads around the area will be closed for two days to accommodate the wedding party.\n\nThe choice of Chester Cathedral as the venue for the ceremony is a significant one, as the Grosvenor family seat is at Eaton Hall near the town.\n\nSpeaking to Town&Country about his upcoming wedding in May, Hugh said: \"I'm unbelievably excited. I also just wanted to make it very clear how unbelievably helpful people have been, how supportive they've been so far which I'm unbelievably grateful for. Because I do realise that it's going to be a big thing for the city.

Still, they have spent time together on a handful of occasions, including back in 2022 when they did a walkabout with their wives, Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton, after Queen Elizabeth II's death.\n\nEarlier this year, it was suggested that Prince Harry and Prince William would cross paths again this summer as they were both invited to a mutual friend's wedding. But the brothers seemingly will not see each other once more, given that Harry has apparently declined the invitation.\n\nIt makes sense that Harry and William ran in the same circles from childhood into adulthood; the two men are only about two years apart, so they shared plenty of friends. One of those included Hugh Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster. Hugh is set to wed on June 7, and there was plenty of speculation that Harry and William would both attend the wedding. However, according to Express, it's been announced that Harry does not plan to fly back to the United Kingdom for the event.\n\nHarry lives in California with his wife, Meghan Markle, and he did just return to the UK less than a month ago. That could be the reason why it doesn't make sense for him to travel back. That, or he doesn't want to have a run-in with William.\n\nWilliam is planning to attend Hugh's wedding, and Express reports that he will likely serve as an usher. Harry and William reportedly did not spend any time together during Harry's last visit in early May for an Invictus Games ceremony.\n\nAs Harry further establishes roots in the United States, he seems to be drifting from the life he knew in the UK. In addition to missing his friend's wedding, one of the royal family members seemed to make a point to show support for the royal family despite always previously taking Harry's side.\n\nPrincess Eugenie, who even visited Harry and Meghan out in California with her husband at one point, did not attend Harry's Invictus Games ceremony on May 8. However, a short while later, she did attend the royal family's garden party alongside William, and she made an interesting statement on her Instagram upon sharing a series of photos.\n\n\"Come rain or shine, I was delighted to support my family yesterday to meet some special individuals at the Buckingham Palace Garden Party,\" part of Eugenie's caption read. It seemed to suggest that she was making it clear she is still very much a member of the royal family despite remaining close to Harry.\n\nOf course, the hope is that Harry does not completely lose touch with the people who once meant so much to him. Perhaps he just has a scheduling conflict and cannot attend the wedding, though we likely won't ever know.", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julia_mullaney@cheatsheet.com", "name": "Julia Mullaney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_Westminster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duke of Westminster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Invictus Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace_Garden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace Garden"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Eugenie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princess Eugenie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Invitations_and_Announcements", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Invitations and Announcements", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Software", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Software", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Prince-Harry-Prince-William.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623447", "eventUri": "eng-9623447", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 908, "textEnd": 914}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 2064, "textEnd": 2069}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

How ridiculous", "body": "It's a conundrum for the social experts, the likes of Debrett's or the late arbiter of etiquette, Emily Post: you are close friends with two royal princes and godfather to their sons. Which of the two do you have to your wedding, given that if you have both, their visible mutual loathing will be the only topic?\n\nNaturally, Hugh Grosvenor, the Duke of Westminster -- for it is he -- has gone for the obvious option. He's invited the Prince of Wales to be usher at his wedding to Olivia Henson at Chester cathedral on Friday, and it says much about the classiness of the event that William will be handing out the orders of service and directing people to the appropriate side of the aisle. Harry was understanding about it. He was invited too, on the basis that he would decline because he lives a long way away in California.\n\nProblem solved. The lucky, lucky bride -- for it will be difficult for the most gallant to avoid noticing that she has got the catch of the century -- will not now be outshone on the big day. Princess Kate, another Marlborough girl, will, alas, be absent for reasons of health, and Meghan Markle, who, whatever else you can say about her, can outshine every other woman on any scene, will not be there either. Win, win!\n\nIt is obviously fortunate that the two brothers live on different continents, with Harry on the far side of the US, but this is getting tiresome. It is plain from this wedding that the brothers share lots of friends as well as a parent. They are united in the loss of a mother and a certain reserve towards the stepmother who displaced her. Is it not time for some sort of rapprochement, some diplomatic settlement to enable them to occupy the same cathedral, to be able to mix with 400 guests at a stately home with a large garden without acrimony?\n\nThe situation is, obviously, endlessly fascinating for the rest of us, but it's hardly setting people a good example. Lots of Britons don't care for their siblings and they manage to stay civil for the sake of the parents, family and mutual friends. With conflict resolution so much in vogue, can they not work out a deal? It might involve Harry never discussing his family in public, William not hitting him and their wives never meeting, but it must be possible.\n\nThis situation benefits neither. Think of the fun they could have had, with so many friends at this wedding. As for the happy event, it's a reminder of the realities of primogeniture and of our obsession with class. Because, no matter how we cut it, this is why we care about William and Harry in the first place.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debrett's", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Debrett's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chester Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grosvenor,_2nd_Duke_of_Westminster", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grosvenor,_1st_Duke_of_Westminster", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godparent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Godparent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_VII", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edward VII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Etiquette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Post", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emily Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catherine, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Churchill,_1st_Duke_of_Marlborough", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aisle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_Britons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celtic Britons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primogeniture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primogeniture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_country_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English country house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cathedral"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Invitations_and_Announcements", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Invitations and Announcements", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Software", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Software", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/a5aa068d066ea7085ff7f6bba0d39345", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623447", "eventUri": "eng-9623447", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Nothing's more British than that", "body": "You could be forgiving for assuming that you don't have much in common with the UK's richest man under 40. Otherwise known as Hugh (or \"Hughie\"), the Duke of Westminster is a 33-year-old billionaire who owns vast amounts of the UK including 300 acres (121ha) of Belgravia. So far, so deeply not relatable.\n\nBut Hughie has one problem a lot of us are going to be able to understand: a guest list nightmare for his wedding. He's making an honest woman of fianc\u00e9e Olivia Henson this Friday. (I've found very posh people usually get married on a Friday, but when they do it's not because the venue hire is cheaper, it's because they don't have to abide by the concept of a weekend.) And the wedding is set to be attended by one of his best friends, but not the other, because said friends can't be in the same room together.\n\nNow in Hughie's specific case, the friends we're talking about are a fairly well known pair named Harry and William. The three men grew up together and have been mates since childhood, with the Duke acting as godfather to both Prince George and Prince Archie. Under normal circumstances it would have been expected that a full complement of young royals would have attended the wedding. But according to The Times, Harry and Hughie have reached a \"civil understanding\" that he won't attend the wedding, apparently because his attendance might threaten to overshadow the marriage.\n\nAll very noble, I'm sure, but I think it's the wrong call. It's far too grown-up and mature and honestly, what's a wedding without a bit of drama?\n\nLike most brides, I had to wrestle with table plans which kept non-speaking family members away from each other and gave the greatest chance of my university friends not admitting that they'd always thought the other one was a massive dick.\n\nPutting a seating chart together for your wedding feels a bit like the parts of Game of Thrones where they put all the little soldiers on the map-table and then move them around trying to plan a war. Who's snogged whose boyfriend? Who brings out other people's worst drinking habits? Who still hasn't made up from an argument about a borrowed dress in 2012?\n\nI understand that Olivia and Hugh might be seeking to enjoy a relaxed, tasteful wedding amongst the global elite, but that's not what anyone actually wants.\n\nEven if you're so rich that you could pay Taylor Swift to sing the communion mass and have Morgan Freeman do a reading, there are some universal aspects that they all need, and one of those is a bit of drama.\n\nWedding tension is an essential aspect of the package deal. Allegedly Meghan and Harry used Princess Eugenie's wedding to announce that Meghan was pregnant with Archie and that's exactly the kind of rumour mill-grinding, gossip-generating, generic debate fodder that these events need.\n\nIf there's no fight on the dance floor, no one standing at the edges slagging someone else off, no scrappy chats in the loos, then is it really a wedding at all? Next you'll be telling me that they've dispensed with the warm Prosecco or the best man won't be overusing the word \"stunning\" to describe the bride.\n\nSo congratulations to Hugh and Olivia. Given that they've probably spent more on this wedding than I'll make in the course of my life, I entirely understand why they've decided to play it safe. But I do think it's rather a shame.\n\nLike much of the UK, while I joke about the William and Harry schism, I think it's all rather sad. The Royals have, by all accounts, had rather a rough year. Surely the best possible antidote to all of this would be for Harry and William to be arm in arm on the dancefloor, screaming Robbie Williams' \"Angels\" with their ties around their heads?\n\nWeddings might be the best place for drama, but they're also the perfect place to hash out the pain and find forgiveness nine pints deep.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_reid@inews.co.uk", "name": "Rebecca Reid", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grosvenor,_2nd_Duke_of_Westminster", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgravia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgravia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgravia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_George_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince George of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godparent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Godparent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Game of Thrones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royals_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Royals (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Schism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robbie Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groomsman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Groomsman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecco", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hashish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucharist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eucharist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Accessories", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Software", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Software", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SEI_207347241.jpg?crop=0px%2C58px%2C927px%2C523px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623447", "eventUri": "eng-9623447", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

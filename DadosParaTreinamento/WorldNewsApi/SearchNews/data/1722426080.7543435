Due to the double power of the double engine government in Bihar, a mere 5 bridges have collapsed in just 9 days. The double engine NDA government comprising 6 parties, under the guidance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, has sent auspicious and bright wishes of Mangalraj (good rule) to the people of Bihar on the collapse of the 5 bridges in 9 days.\u201dHis comments came in the wake of an under-construction bridge collapse in Madhubani district's Jhanjharpur, the fifth such incident in the past 11 days. The 77-meter-long bridge, under construction for the last two years and with an estimated cost of around Rs 3 crore, was being built under the Prime Minister's Rural Road Scheme by Bihar's Rural Development Department.Mocking the Nitish Kumar government\u2019s claims of \"good governance feats,\" the Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly added, \u201cThe self-proclaimed honest people are calling the thousands of crores of rupees being lost by the public due to the collapse of bridges as \u2018courtesy\u2019 rather than \u2018corruption.\u2019\u201d With his tongue firmly in cheek, Yadav suggested, \u201cOpposition leaders should resign after bridges are submerged in water.\u201dIn addition to the Madhubani incident, four other bridges have collapsed in the last 11 days, raising serious questions about construction standards and oversight. On June 18, a bridge over the Bakra River in Araria, built at a cost of Rs 12 crore, collapsed.This was followed by a four-decade-old bridge over the Gandak River in Siwan falling on June 22. A day later, on June 23, a bridge under construction in East Champaran, costing around Rs 1.5 crore, also collapsed, with locals blaming the use of substandard materials.The most recent incident occurred on June 27, when a bridge over a small tributary connecting the Kankai and Mahananda rivers in Kishanganj gave way. A video capturing the bridge collapse also went viral.In response to the series of collapses, the state government\u2019s rural works department held a review meeting earlier this week to assess the status of bridges and culverts across the state. Officials have been given a week to submit a comprehensive report.The frequent bridge collapses have drawn sharp criticism from opposition leaders, who are calling for a fair investigation and appropriate action against those responsible.Published By: Devika BhattacharyaPublished On: Jun 29, 2024Read | Thik nahi bana raha hai...: Nitish raps construction firm over Bhagalpur bridge collapseMust Watch", "summary": "<a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bihar-bridge-collapse-tejashwi-yadav-attacks-nitish-kumar-government-pm-modi-nda-2559950-2024-06-29\"> <img align=\"left\" hspace=\"2\" height=\"180\" width=\"305\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/rjd-leader-tejashwi-yadav-235304739-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=x9O9.Knk7oXOe4F3PI1Z5ArplmButeqD\"> </a> 'Mangalraj': Tejashwi Yadav's swipe over Bihar bridge collapse saga", "url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bihar-bridge-collapse-tejashwi-yadav-attacks-nitish-kumar-government-pm-modi-nda-2559950-2024-06-29", "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/rjd-leader-tejashwi-yadav-235304739-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=x9O9.Knk7oXOe4F3PI1Z5ArplmButeqD?size=1280:720", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:11:48", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.036}

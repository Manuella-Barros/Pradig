I just thought there would have been more but the results just didn't work for us.\n\n\"But we'll see. Hopefully we can get through the week, get some data for the bike and see where we're at.\n\n\"The Superbike has never turned a mile and it's literally brand new.\"\n\nOn the prospects of challenging for his sixth success at the event, Dunlop added: \"I would like one because it's been eluding me for a while. It's a bit sad because I'd like to have a win here but come Thursday and Saturday, we'll have a push.\"\n\nIn warm and dry conditions, Irwin fired a warning shot across the bow of his rivals with a 124.895mph lap on the Hager PBM Ducati to knock Milwaukee BMW's Todd off the Superbike top spot right at the end of the session.\n\nThe British Superbike Championship leader, on a high after a bank holiday treble at Oulton Park, was inside Peter Hickman's 2022 outright lap record as he put down an early marker.\n\nThe 35-year-old could equal the record of nine Superbike wins at the NW200 on Thursday, which is jointly held by Michael Rutter and Joey Dunlop.\n\n\"The pace was incredible, hats off to the team,\" said Irwin. \"There's a lot of people around the course already and it's just class to be here.\n\n\"I think it's just nice to have a good day one but of course it's nice to respond when people go top and you know you can go out and go top again.\n\n\"The cool thing is the fans are seeing lap record speeds by very capable riders and that's great for the event and everyone involved.\"\n\nFinal qualifying takes place on Thursday with roads closed from 9am to 3pm ahead of the evening race schedule (4.45pm to 9pm).\n\nThe opening Superbike race will be held first followed by the first Supersport event and Superstock race, all over four laps of the 8.9-mile course.",

I just felt there was more there but it just didn't work for us.\"\n\nIn the opening practice qualifying sessions at the North West 200 on Wednesday, Dunlop was third on his Hawk Racing Honda behind Glenn Irwin and Davey Todd.\n\nThe Ballymoney rider followed that up with two more third places in the Supersport and Superstock classes to cap a solid start to his 2024 event.\n\nThe final set of practice sessions take place on Thursday morning before the racing starts later that evening.\n\nDunlop admits there were \"late nights\" for his team to prepare his machines for the North West 200, in which he will run a Honda Superstock and a Triumph in the Supersport under his MD Racing banner.\n\n\"It's been a bit of a nightmare but the bikes look good and the boys have worked hard all week,\" Dunlop added.\n\n\"Thanks to the lads, they have all worked hard. It's a bit painful for them, but the boys don't say no. They probably want to, but they just don't.\n\n\"We've done a good job. The boys I have working for me are all mates. They are all good lads and they are doing the best that they can.\"\n\nHe also said his injury \"doesn't feel any different\" compared to other years ahead of racing around the 8.9-mile Triangle Circuit, which takes place on closed public roads between the towns on Portstewart, Coleraine and Portrush.\n\nWith many of the leading riders regulars in the British Superbike Championship or support series, Dunlop, who focuses on road racing, says he can compete with the top racers.\n\n\"I've proven I can be competitive with all the BSB boys,\" said Dunlop, who added the pace was \"hot and heavy\".\n\n\"There's no reason why I can't be and nothing is stopping us from continuing to do so.\n\n\"The boys are riding BSB every weekend. We know with the likes of Glenn [Irwin] coming here that short-circuit style is what the North West is all about. People like Glenn are the proof of that, who are running at the front then they come here straight away and turn it on.\n\n\"Davey [Todd], Pete [Peter Hickman] - they are all short circuit men.

The Ballymoney rider was third fastest in Wednesday's opening Superbike qualifying, behind BSB pair Glenn Irwin and Davey Todd.\n\nDunlop goes into the race week nursing an injury sustained after crashing at the recent Cookstown 100, an incident the 35-year-old joked came \"out of my own stupidity\".\n\nBut now the home hero is back on track and plotting his first North West 200 win since 2016.\n\nRead more: Jeremy McWilliams on retirement, staying fit, newcomers and NW200 glory\n\nRead more: North West 200 schedule for practice and racing\n\nHe told the BBC: \"It's good to be here. The weather is looking decent. It's not too often you come here and the folks say the weather is going to be good all week. The road racing is back again and I am looking forward to getting stuck in.\n\n\"I did a lot of miles in a recent 24-hour race which was good. That was beneficial to us. Obviously it wasn't on the new bike, it was the old bike. And last weekend I took a bit of a tumble out of my own stupidity.\n\n\"But we have had plenty of miles under the belt, and you need it especially going up against the boys who ride at BSB every weekend. It's going to get hot and heavy, I'd say.\"\n\nReflecting on his tumble at the Cookstown, Dunlop said: \"I picked up an injury in that Cookstown crash. We are just going to have to re-adapt things this weekend. And once we have that under out belt...it should be good.\n\n\"I can't really use it as an excuse as I don't know what it is like at the minute. But I feel good and I don't feel any different to any other year. I am prepped and ready to go. The boys were just a bit late in getting stuff which is a bit of a problem .\n\n\"But we'll see. Hopefully we can get through the week and get some data on the bike and see where we're at.\n\nAhead of Wednesday's opening practice, Dunlop smiled: \"Steve (Hicken) says take her steady for a lap, but when you're sitting at 200mph I don't know what he wants me to do. But I am looking forward to it.\n\n\"I have no problem going down the road on a brand new bike because I know what they're made of and how they were built and what the boys do to get them right. So the job will be Oxo.\"\n\nDunlop was third quickest in opening Superbike practice on Wednesday with a time of 4:22:814 on the MasterMac by Hawk Racing Honda, behind Davey Todd in second (4:19:910, Milwaukee TAS Racing BMW)) and Carrick rider Glenn Irwin who impressed on the Hager PBM Ducati at 4:18:553.\n\nThe Ballymoney man was also third fastest in the Supersport class on the Triumph 765 behind Richard Cooper and Todd, and third again in the Superstocks behind Todd and Dean Harrison.\n\nDunlop said: \"There has been a bit of late night working. Thanks to the lads they have worked so hard and done a lot of work at the last minute. It has been a bit painful for them. They probably want to say no but they don't.\n\n\"We are doing a good job. The boys working for me are all mates and we are doing the best we can. It has taken a lot of stress to get the bikes ready.\n\n\"But I am looking forward to it.\"\n\nDunlop, who has five wins at the North West 200, says he would love to add to his tally in 2024.\n\nAnd he says this week's event will act as good preparation for the Isle of Man TT which starts next month. Dunlop sits just one win behind his late, great uncle Joey who holds the record at 26.\n\nHe said: 'I would like another North West win. It has eluded me for quite a while. Something has always come up. I'd like to have a win here and Thursday and Saturday we will have a push.\"\n\n\"The North West will give us a good indication of where we are at ahead of the TT. With new bikes, the new 765 Triumph we don't know a lot about, this is good prep to see. The 2024 Blade is the same.\n\n\"It is important to see where we are speed wise and then after that we can work towards the TT.\"\n\nSign up to our free sports newsletter to get the latest headlines to your inbox", "source": {"uri": "belfastlive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gareth_fullerton@belfastlive.co.uk", "name": "Gareth Fullerton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_200", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North West 200"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunlop_Tyres", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dunlop Tyres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Road racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cookstown", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cookstown"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cookstown"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Superbike_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "British Superbike Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superbike_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Superbike racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Irwin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Irwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_McWilliams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy McWilliams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dunlop", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Dunlop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballymoney", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballymoney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ballymoney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAS_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TAS Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bird_Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Bird Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_Motorcycles_Ltd", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triumph Motorcycles Ltd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_bike", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport bike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man_TT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isle of Man TT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducati", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ducati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.belfastlive.co.uk/incoming/article28646023.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Dunlop-Stocker.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550097", "eventUri": "eng-9550097", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

I love this place.\"\n\nLooking ahead to the first race on the new-look Thursday evening schedule, the 34-year-old added: \"I expect a strong challenge tonight. Davey (Todd) is riding really well and Pete (Hickman) and Dean (Harrison), they are all strong characters, resilient and winners at the top level.\n\n\"I don't expect it to be easy and I know where to improve.\"\n\nTAS Racing team principal Philip Neill said Irwin was a clear favourite in the Superbike class but added that his man Todd was 'capable' of giving the Ulsterman a run for his money.\n\n\"On the Superbike, personally I think we have no real right to expect him to be winning it,\" said Neill.\n\n\"He is obviously capable and the bike is capable, but Glenn Irwin is obviously favourite. How many wins has he had in a row and he is on a trick of a machine and he is a great rider.\n\n\"Davey should be here with the expectation of giving Glenn a run for this money. If all goes according to plan and that happens and there is a good race between the two of them and others, it'll not be a two horse race and I will assure you of that.\"\n\nBradford's Dean Harrison twice finished on the podium in the Superbike races in 2023 but is relying on his Superstock-specification Honda Racing Fireblade due to issues around the availability of parts for the Superbike.\n\nHowever, the 35-year-old went fourth quickest, 5.8s off Irwin's pace, while official lap record holder Hickman was fifth, only a tenth of a second down on Harrison.\n\nHickman is also riding a BMW Superstock machine under his own PHR Performance banner this year.\n\nManx rider Conor Cummins was seventh on the Milenco by Padgett's Honda ahead of Honda's John McGuinness and James Hillier (WTF Racing Honda).\n\nTodd made the most of the excellent conditions around the 8.9-mile course as he dipped under Alastair Seeley's 2023 Superstock lap record for pole with a speed of 124.524mph on the Milwaukee BMW.\n\nThe 28-year-old narrowly edged out Hickman by two tenths of a second, with Dunlop four seconds adrift of Todd on his MD Racing Honda.\n\nHillier, Paul Jordan (Jackson Racing Honda) and Mike Browne (Aprilia) were the top six.\n\nIn the Supersport class, Richard Cooper was on top on the BPE by Russell Racing Yamaha by 0.677s from Todd (Powertoolmate

There's no reason why I can't be.\"", "body": "Watch more of our videos on Shots!\n\nand live on Freeview channel 276\n\nThe 25-time Isle of Man TT winner was in the thick of the action during opening qualifying on Wednesday, finishing third quickest in the Superbike, Supersport and Superstock classes as he made his typically fast start to the first major road race of the year.\n\nDunlop was riding his new MasterMac Hawk Racing Honda Superbike for the first time and ended the session 4.2s down on pre-race favourite Glenn Irwin, who is aiming to join Joey Dunlop and Michael Rutter on nine victories in the class in this evening's opening race.\n\nIt was a promising start for the Ballymoney man, who is on the brink of making history at the TT in June as he closes in on his legendary uncle Joey's record of 26 victories.\n\nDunlop suffered an uncharacteristic crash last month at the Cookstown 100 when he came off his MD Racing Triumph 765 in the Supersport invitation race and admitted that while he hurt himself, he didn't expect the injury to have too much of an adverse impact on his prospects this week.\n\nHe has won five times at the North West but his last taste of the victory champagne was back in 2016, when he triumphed in the Superbike class on a Hawk Racing BMW.\n\nDunlop said: \"I did [pick up an injury] but it's something that we will have to adapt to this weekend; I can't really use it as an excuse because I feel good at the minute, I feel like I'm prepped and ready to go.\n\n\"I feel I can be competitive here with the BSB boys. There's no reason why I can't be and there's nothing stopping me because I have the machinery to do so.\n\n\"It's hard because the boys are riding BSB every weekend and it's [North West 200 course] a short circuit style; obviously we know by the likes of Glenn coming here the short circuit style is what the North West is all about to a degree.\n\n\"I suppose people like Glenn are the proof of that because they're running at the front at BSB, then they come here straight away and turn it on; all the short circuit men - Davey [Todd], Pete [Peter Hickman] - they come to the North West and make it hard work because they're primed up and ready to go, whereas the TT is a bit different obviously - we know how competitive it is getting there because it's getting faster every year,\" he added.\n\n\"I would like one because it's been eluding me for a while. It's a bit sad because I'd like to have a win here but come Thursday and Saturday we'll have a push.\"\n\nDunlop finished on the podium in both Superstock races in 2023 on his MD Racing Honda and fourth in the feature NW200 Superbike race.\n\nHe was leading the first Superbike race until he was forced out with a rear tyre issue.\n\nIn the Supersport races, Dunlop sealed fourth and fifth respectively on his Yamaha R6, but he has made the switch to the British Triumph machine for 2024.\n\n\"Last year I think we gave a good account of ourselves but I think the results didn't do us justice in my opinion,\" he said. \"I just thought there would have been more but the results just didn't work for us.\n\n\"We had red flags in the Superbike race which didn't help and we had a tyre go in the first Superbike race while leading.\n\n\"In the Superstock race we were just learning so much about the bike and we were making inroads, but it was a lap too late sort of thing.\"\n\nIn Superbike qualifying, BSB title leader Irwin set an unofficial lap record of 4m 18.553s (124.895mph) in perfect conditions around the 8.9-mile course on the Hager PBM Ducati.\n\nMilwaukee BMW's Davey Todd (124.243mph) was 1.357s adrift with Dunlop third (122.870mph).\n\nLap record holder Peter Hickman slotted into fourth on his PHR Performance BMW, 6.470s seconds off the top spot, with Dean Harrison - riding the Honda Racing UK Superstock machine - and the returning Ian Hutchinson (Milenco by Padgett's Honda) rounding out the first six.\n\nSix-time NW200 winner John McGuinness completed the session in seventh, also riding a Honda Racing UK Superstock machine, with James Hillier next on the WTF Racing Honda.\n\nFinal qualifying takes place on Thursday (roads closed 9am-3pm) with the opening Superbike, Supersport and Superstock races - all over four laps - scheduled in the evening (roads closed 4:45pm to 9pm).", "source": {"uri": "newsletter.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

I've just got to try a little harder next time.\"\n\nCooper romps to Supersport win\n\nCooper had 6.5 seconds to spare over runner-up Hickman at the end of the Supersport race, with Dunlop just 0.3 seconds in arrears of the Lincolnshire rider as he clinched his second rostrum of the evening.\n\nThere was drama in the early stages as early leader Todd was taken out by a charging Adam McLean at York Corner on lap one.\n\nThe departure of his likely chief challenger allowed Cooper to build an unassailable advantage and secure the fifth North West win of his career and his first outside the Supertwins category.\n\nRiding the BPE by Russell Racing Yamaha for a second successive year, the Nottingham rider posted the fastest lap of the race at 117.657.\n\nThe chasing pack could only watch as the race leader disappeared into the distance but the battle for second between the two Triumph riders went some way to ameliorate the disappointment of the absence of Ducati-mounted Todd.\n\n\"I rode a good race. I had no boards out there so I didn't realise I was so far in front, I've got a bit in reserve for the next race if I need it,\" said diminutive 41-year-old Englishman Cooper.\n\nMike Browne was fourth, Paul Jordan fifth and Cummins again sixth.\n\nTodd blasts to Superstock triumph\n\nTodd recovered sufficiently from his accident in the Supersport event to take his place in pole position for the Superstocks and emerged the victor on his BMW.\n\nThe English rider was pushed all the way by Honda Racing's Dean Harrison, who lost ground after overshooting at Mather's Chicane on the last lap.\n\nTodd's winning margin was 6.97 seconds and his fastest lap 124.46, just outside the class lap record.\n\nDunlop took another third spot to round off a satisfactory day for the Ballymoney rider, followed over the line by James Hillier, John McGuinness and Finnish rider Erno Kostamo.\n\n\"I wasn't sure I was going to race as I was a bit sore from the Supersport crash but I don't come here to sit on the sidelines,\" explained Todd.\n\n\"It's an awesome bike, fantastic to ride and I'm happy to get the win.\"\n\nThursday race results\n\nSuperbikes - 1 Glenn Irwin (Ducati); 2 Davey

He was riding so well but he was on the limit in some scary places and I was rolling the throttle a bit behind him. To win we had to go to his level.\"\n\nIrwin described his feat of joining Joey Dunlop and Rutter as the most successful Superbike riders ever as an 'amazing' achievement.\n\n\"Those guys done it over their whole career and to go nine wins in a row... that (battle with Todd) was a reminder of how tough it is here,\" Irwin said.\n\n\"Some people want to ride harder than me here but we can still find a way. I don't know how we've done it - great team, great family support and a mindset that I don't think that anyone on the grid has anything near, so that makes a difference.\"\n\nRunner-up Todd was left feeling frustrated after fluffing his lines at the all-important Juniper chicane on a breathless last lap.\n\n\"I feel like I put in the work there at the start,\" said Todd.\n\n\"We sort of kept a little bit in reserve in practice and I said to the boys, we've got more in that lap time; doing 4'16 is pretty savage.\n\n\"I thought I had it worked out. I sort of know where Glenn's strong and where he isn't.\n\n\"I'm just frustrated in myself. I made a silly judgement at the end. I know where I'm strong, I could have had him up the inside into Juniper and I choose to go outside. It's one of them, you have to make your decision.\"\n\nDunlop enjoyed his early scrap with Honda Racing's Dean Harrison on the opening laps and admitted things got 'hot and heavy'.\n\n\"It got hot and heavy there,\" said the 35-year-old. \"We were bouncing on each other a wee bit. It's Pete (Hickman) and Dean, people that I race with all the time on the roads.\n\n\"It's not so bad when you know them - you know who you're working with; that's what it's about.\n\n\"If we could have got away we would have been in a better place but we lost the tow at the start.\"\n\nLouth man Hickman in fourth was only four tenths of a second behind Dunlop when they crossed the line.\n\nHarrison who, like Hickman, was riding a Superstock machine, claimed fifth place ahead of the Isle of Man's Conor Cummins on Clive Padgett's Milenco by Padgett's Honda.\n\nMorecambe's John McGuiness was a solid seventh on the Honda Racing Superstock machine in his 30th year of racing at the North West, while James Hillier took eighth position on the WTF Racing Honda.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superbike_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superbike racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Rutter_(motorcyclist)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Rutter (motorcyclist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Dunlop", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joey Dunlop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Irwin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Irwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hickman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Hickman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_200", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North West 200"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bird_Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Bird Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Riband", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue Riband"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dunlop", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Dunlop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducati", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ducati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hillier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Hillier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conor_Cummins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conor Cummins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunlop_Tyres", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dunlop Tyres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda_Racing_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Honda Racing Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louth,_Lincolnshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louth, Lincolnshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louth, Lincolnshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isle of Man"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Isle of Man"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Performance_Tuning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Performance Tuning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/extra/assets/img/dummy-social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550097", "eventUri": "eng-9550097", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Davey is riding really well, Michael, Peter and Dean are tough characters and resilient. They are top riders.\"\n\nCooper takes pole position\n\nRichard Cooper will start the Supersport races from pole position after edging Todd to the fastest time in Thursday's shortened qualifying session.\n\nLike in the Superbike session that preceded it, the leading times were faster than the opening session on Wednesday and it was Cooper who popped his Yamaha to the top of the times, with Todd just 0.677 seconds back on his Ducati.\n\nThe session was red flagged with 10 minutes to go, which the North West 200 said was for a \"racing incident on the approach to Trolans\".\n\n\"I didn't realise I was fastest, I was just trying to get in as many laps as possible,\" Cooper said.\n\n\"We're still making some changes, but it's feeling good.\"\n\nAfter being beaten to pole position in the Superbike class, Todd recovered to take top spot in the Superstock class ahead of Hickman, whose late lap time put him second on the grid.\n\nDean Harrison will start in third place after his time from Wednesday's session was enough to put is Honda on the front row.\n\nDunlop will start in fourth place ahead of John McGuinness, who, like Honda team-mate Harrison, set his fastest time in Wednesday's opening session.\n\nThe second Superstock session was red flagged in the closing stages.\n\nThe Supertwins opened Thursday's running after their curtailed session on Wednesday, and Hickman set the pace from Cooper and McWilliams on the damp circuit.\n\nTheir second session closed out Thursday's qualifying in dry conditions and despite fast efforts from Cooper and McWilliams, Hickman's time from earlier in the day was enough to secure pole position.\n\nCooper and McWilliams will round out the front row for both of Saturday's races ahead of Mike Browne and Christian Elkin.\n\n\"The little Swan R7 is going well,\" said Hickman.\n\n\"Every other bike we have come up against, we've been as strong as, if not a little bit stronger.

conditions, Todd took the lead off the line from Irwin and was still in front at University, with Dean Harrison (Honda Racing UK) and Michael Dunlop (MasterMac Hawk Honda) giving chase.\n\nAt

moved ahead of Harrison after the Honda rider clouted the kerb on the way out of the start/finish chicane.\n\nOn the second lap, it was still Todd ahead at the Magic Roundabout in Coleraine with the leaders continuing to stretch their advantage over the chasing pack.\n\nThere was no change in Portrush but Todd pulled a slight gap after Irwin appeared to miss a gear coming out of Metropole.\n\nHowever, he closed the deficit once more along the Coast Road section and Irwin set a new outright lap 125mph benchmark.\n\nDunlop in third was 9.27s behind leader Todd, with Harrison and Peter Hickman (PHR Performance BMW) close behind the Ballymoney man.\n\nIrwin was all over Todd on the approach to Metropole on the third lap but the English rider still managed to keep his nose in front.\n\nIrwin, though, pounced for the lead into Juniper chicane with a clean pass on the brakes to start the final lap as he led by two tenths of a second.\n\nDunlop was 14 seconds behind followed by Harrison, Hickman and Conor Cummins (Milenco by Padgett's Honda).\n\nIrwin led into University but Todd was still right in contention and the 28-year-old made a pass to take the lead again

Irwin at Juniper chicane before running deep, leaving the Ulsterman to clinch a record-equalling ninth victory.\n\nTodd was 2.5s down at the end with Dunlop 14.2s further in arrears as he sealed the

A lot of guys like to wind down during the off-season, but I prefer to go full gas..\"\n\nDavey Todd isn't one for the sedate lifestyle. You can't imagine him relaxing in a spa or 'winding down' during the off-season.\n\nHe's a self-confessed 'adrenaline junkie', a man who needs to be under the visor, tearing down some road or soaring over muddy peaks on a motocross track.\n\nRead more: Jeremy McWilliams on retirement, staying fit, newcomers and NW200 glory\n\nRead more: North West 200 schedule for practice and racing\n\nBut Todd is far from a reckless rider who just craves the thrill of riding motorcycles at speeds in excess of 200mph. He is a three-time winner at the North West 200, including a Supersport double at last year's event.\n\nAnd he's back for more in 2024, and this time he is targeting Glenn Irwin's Superbike crown.\n\nIrwin has won the last EIGHT big bike races at the North West, and he clocked the fastest lap on his Hager PBM Ducati during Wednesday's opening qualifying session which for many was a statement of intent from the Carrick man.\n\nTodd - this year riding with with Milwaukee liveried TAS Racing BMW - was second quickest, sitting right on the slipstream of Irwin in the time sheets, and also topping the Superstock leaderboard and finishing second in the Supersports.\n\nHe told Belfast Live: \"I had two Supersport wins at last year's North West which was awesome. I never really consider myself a 600 rider so that was a bit of a shock. But I am definitely coming back to win the Superbike races. That's what I want, and the one everyone wants.\n\n\"Superbike races are the big ones, and I want to be up there battling with my mate Glenn. I have been second to him three times in the last couple of years.\n\n\"He is targeting that record, and I am here to stop him. There are others. There are so many riders you might don't take into account because everyone talks about Glenn, but these riders are always there or thereabouts. Dean Harrison is always fast, Michael Dunlop. So many, especially in the 600 races.\n\n\"Paul Jordan, Adam McLean, you can't write anyone off. That's what makes it exciting and that's why I loved those Supersport wins last year.\n\n\"I love those battles. There is nothing better than to win in those battles.\"\n\nTodd has earned three wins at the North West since making his debut in 2018. He admits he still feels like a newcomer but insists he has \"served my apprenticeship\".\n\nHe said: \"I remember my first time at the North West because it wasn't that long ago. It was only 2018. It still feels like yesterday for me and I still feel like a newcomer to the sport. I am still learning, but I am now here to win races. I have served my apprenticeship a little bit.\n\n\"I have had a few race wins and a few podiums. I am here to do a job this year and I am excited to see how I get on.\n\n\"It feels really good and refreshing being with the new team. I had a great relationship with my old team, the Milenco by Padgett's team. They treated me so well and it was a fantastic journey.\n\n\"That being said I am with a really prestigious team now with TAS Racing, with a great sponsor in Milwaukee. I am on a BMW which I think is the lap record holder at the North West 200 and Isle of man TT. So I have no excuses.\"\n\nMotorcycle racing can be a perilous business, especially with it comes to competing on the roads.\n\nBut despite the risks that come with the job, Todd insists his only fear is not competing to the level he knows he can.\n\n\"I have had a few close shaves with racing. I have had a few crashes, but racing bikes doesn't scare me. It's the thought of not doing well. Getting hurt doesn't enter my mind,\" he says.\n\n\"I try to push the boundaries outside of racing. I try and do things all the time that push and scare me. Because it is quite hard to find things that do that outside of racing motorbikes. I am definitely an adrenaline junkie!\"\n\nHe added: \"I don't like time off. A lot of guys like to wind down during the off-season, but I prefer to go full gas. I spent my off-season in New Zealand riding the Superbike in the championship there. And I did some supermoto and supercross - a bit of everything.\n\n\"I am into my surfing and mountain-biking, too. I love cycling, motocross. Anything extreme sports wise, I am into it.\n\n\"The longest I have been off the bike is probably because of an injury. I had about a year off after breaking my leg pretty bad a couple of years ago. It was never through choice, put it that way. I had one period before I did my first TT, I had no ride and my family don't have money. So I didn't have a ride then, most of 2017.\n\n\"I managed to get a ride to do a couple of road races at the end of that year. But if I had the choice, I wouldn't have two days off the bike.\"\n\nSign up to our free sports newsletter to get the latest headlines to your inbox", "source": {"uri": "belfastlive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gareth_fullerton@belfastlive.co.uk", "name": "Gareth Fullerton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_200", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North West 200"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_bike", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sport bike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superbike_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superbike racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Irwin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Irwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAS_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TAS Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_McWilliams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy McWilliams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bird_Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Bird Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motocross", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motocross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducati", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ducati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorcycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dunlop", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Dunlop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cycle sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermoto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supermoto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man_TT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isle of Man TT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motorcycle racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extreme sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMA_Supercross_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMA Supercross Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Road racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_biking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mountain biking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surfing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/ATV Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://i2-prod.belfastlive.co.uk/incoming/article29134285.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Davey-Todd.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550097", "eventUri": "eng-9550097", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

That made it feel special.\n\n\"Then to win a wet race in 2019 was equally special because when I was sitting on the grid I just thought 'I'm just going to ride around here' but then I found something.\n\n\"In 2022, I had to work hard with Davey and I had to work hard last year because we were on the back foot,\" Irwin added.\n\n\"We knew we had something for Saturday but we had very much been on the back foot until then.\"\n\nThe addition of a third Superbike race to the schedule of events this year gives Irwin and his rivals a unique opportunity to claim a Superbike hat-trick.\n\nAlong with Saturday's two six-lap races, a four-lap sprint race will kick-start proceedings on Thursday evening after the conclusion of qualifying.\n\nAn enhanced prize fund will also be an extra incentive, with Milwaukee Tools providing \u00a36,000 to the rider with the highest points accumulation across all three Superbike races, boosting the total earnings for a Superbike triple crown to approximately \u00a320,000.\n\nFor Irwin, though, his biggest motivation is maintaining his winning run and extending his haul to 11 straight victories to take over the mantle of the undisputed Superbike king of the North West 200 with a clean sweep.\n\n\"I've come through every type of challenge at the North West and I do believe I'm a better version of myself and as a team and rider combined now compared to what I was last year,\" Irwin said.\n\n\"Before the North West last year I'd only rode the bike [Panigale V4R] twice really, so we were very new to Ducati.\n\n\"We had some issues throughout the week and technically we probably led ourselves the wrong way. In FP1 the steering damper wasn't quite tight enough and we ended up going down a rabbit hole to try and make the bike stable, and it's fair to say that while we had a bike that was extremely friendly come Saturday, it was not very agile.\n\n\"So we've information from last year and we tried different things in practice last year - different engine specs - which was not the best idea.\n\n\"So as a team we learned from that and ultimately when you're on a streak you don't want to lose it,\" he added.\n\n\"The ambition is to win nine, 10, 11 and then by the end of the week if we've topped the Superbike win record then that would incredible.\n\n\"If I'm going to do it I want to do 11 out of 11 - I don't want it to be 10 out of 11 and if you're going to do it, do it right.\"\n\nIrwin should take all the beating again but he will have to bring his A-game to fend off a raft of serious contenders, with previous runner-up Todd riding the Milwaukee BMW M1000RR for TAS Racing while lap record holder Peter Hickman lines up in Portrush on his PHR Performance BMW Superstock machine.\n\nMichael Dunlop was in the frame 12 months ago and is another name high on the Superbike shortlist along with Dean Harrison, who leads the charge for Honda Racing in a major change for the Bradford man, who rode Kawasaki machinery in the class since 2018.", "source": {"uri": "newsletter.co.uk", "dataType":

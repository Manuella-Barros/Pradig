The province released a timeline for its plan to search the Prairie Green landfill for the remains of Morgan Harris and Marcedes Myran after announcing last week that environmental regulators had approved the search. \"When somebody goes missing, we go looking,\" Premier Wab Kinew told reporters during a briefing. \"We hope that it is successful. We cannot guarantee success, but we can guarantee that we're going to try.\" Kinew said the province has come up with a \"robust, comprehensive and thorough search plan.\" The government will lead the search and work with an oversight committee that includes the victims' families, an Indigenous elder and forensic anthropologists. Initial planning began earlier this year. The province is building temporary structures for the site, including a healing centre that should be finished next month. Workers will soon run a test that will shed light on some of the conditions they may encounter during the search. They will then excavate and search the material collected from the \"targeted zone\" -- the area where Prairie Green has identified where the remains may be located. The province expects to begin in late fall. It could continue until the following spring. The area is equivalent to about four football fields and is about 10 metres deep. Police believe the remains of Harris and Myran were sent to the landfill in May 2022. Owners of the privately operated site halted dumping waste in the area the following month after police notified them of the women's deaths. The government's lead on the project said workers will have to sort through two months worth of refuse, which makes it more difficult to narrow the focus of the search. \"We want to try and get a clue in terms of finding receipts or things of that nature that might have a specific date on it to let us know that we're in the right vicinity,\" said Amna Mackin, assistant deputy minister of transportation and infrastructure. The province has chosen a search method that requires equipment to excavate the area. The contents will then be brought to a separate search building where workers will manually go through the contents. \"Doing a manual search is the typical way to do landfill searches, whether it's humanitarian or otherwise,\" said Mackin. This also allows the search to go on through winter. The search facility will be heated and the cold weather helps \"improve stability concerns,\" said Mackin. Jeremy Skibicki has admitted to killing Harris, Myran and two other Indigenous women - Rebecca Contois, whose remains were found in a different landfill, and an unidentified woman an Indigenous grassroots community has named Mashkode Bizhiki'ikwe, or Buffalo Woman, whose remains have not been located. Skibicki's first-degree murder trial wrapped up last week with closing arguments and the judge has reserved his decision until next month. Defence lawyers argued Skibicki should be found not criminally responsible due to mental illness. Manitoba's former Progressive Conservative government earlier rejected calls to search the landfill, saying asbestos and other materials would pose a threat to searchers and the effort has no guarantee of success. Kinew has assured the search will be done in a way that protects the health and safety of those involved. The Manitoba and federal governments have pledged $40 million for the search, which is far below cost estimates put forward in earlier studies developed by the victims' families. Kinew said the funding shortfall had nothing to do with his government's plan, which also differs from the families initial proposal. \"This is a better more suitable method for this type of landfill material.\" The province has also committed to funding mental health supports, traditional medicines and the upkeep of a sacred fire as well as honorariums for elders and knowledge keepers.

We hope it is successful. We cannot guarantee success, but we can guarantee that we're going to try.\"\n\nThe two women - both victims of admitted serial killer Jeremy Skibicki - were killed in May 2022. Their remains are believed to have been deposited in a section of the landfill on May 16, 2022. However, nearly three weeks worth of material was put in that section of the landfill before it was shut down.\n\nA map of the Prairie Green Landfill indicates the area (marked in green) where the remains of Marcedes Myran and Morgan Harris are believed to be. Excavations of this area are expected to begin in the late fall of 2024. (Source: Province of Manitoba)\n\nThe province said the total amount of waste in this area is around 72,000 cubic metres. It spans the length of about four football fields and is about 10 metres deep.\n\nAmna Mackin, the project lead for the search, said it will be completed in five stages. The first stage - which was to get the required regulatory and developmental approval - has just concluded.\n\nThe second stage will try to narrow down a more specific area where the remains may be located. The province will also develop detailed health and safety plans due to the potential of harmful chemicals and asbestos in the landfill.\n\nThe team of actual searchers will be assembled, and various buildings - including a search facility and a healing space for the victims' families - will be constructed at the landfill.\n\nA test search will also be completed during this stage, excavating a separate area of the landfill to better understand how to work with the material. Mackin said this test search will begin at the end of June.\n\nExcavation of landfill to search for remains begins this fall\n\nStage three is expected to start later this fall. Crews will excavate the top layers of waste in the section, digging down to the target area where the materials deposited around May 16, 2022, are believed to be.\n\nAt this point stage four will begin - the manual process of searching the material for the women's remains. Heavy equipment will excavate the materials in the area which will then be loaded into trucks and taken to the search facility.\n\nThere searchers will use tools and rakes to manually sift through it. Mackin said the search operations can continue throughout the winter.\n\nIf nothing is found, Mackin said stage five will begin - the province will decide if it needs to dig deeper.\n\n\"When we talk about moving ahead with the search of the Prairie Green Landfill, to me this is about sending a message to everyone in Manitoba that you matter,\" Kinew said. \"That every single person in this province has dignity, and that when somebody goes missing, we go looking because we care.\"\n\nThe search has $40 million from the province and the federal government.", "source": {"uri": "winnipeg.ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV Newsnet                        "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landfill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manitoba", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manitoba"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manitoba"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Manitoba", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Manitoba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wab_Kinew", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wab Kinew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Manitoba", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier of Manitoba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serial killer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_and_territories_of_Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Provinces and territories of Canada"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asbestos", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asbestos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_equipment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heavy equipment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chemical industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Recruitment_and_Staffing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Recruitment and Staffing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search_Engines", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search Engines", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Algorithms/Sorting_and_Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Algorithms/Sorting and Searching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles/Word_Search", "label": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles/Word Search", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/6/20/prairie-green-landfill-1-6934278-1718894655518.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669202", "eventUri": "eng-9669202", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-05-", "textStart": 909, "textEnd": 915, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

(AP) - California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday had a message for local governments: clean up homeless encampments now or lose out on state funding next year.\n\nStanding in front of a cleared homeless encampment in Los Angeles, Newsom vowed to start taking state funding away from cities and counties that are not doing enough to move people out of encampments and into shelter. The governor joined the California Department of Transportation, known as Caltrans, on Thursday to clear several encampment sites in the area.\n\n\"I want to see results,\" Newsom told reporters at a news conference. \"I don\u00b4t want to read about them. I don\u00b4t want to see the data. I want to see it.\"\n\nThursday\u00b4s announcement was part of Newsom's escalating campaign to push local governments into doing more homeless encampment sweeps. Newsom last month ordered state agencies to start clearing encampments on state land. He also pressured local government to do the same, though he cannot legally force them to act.\n\nThe executive order came after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling that said governments could not force people to leave encampments if there weren\u00b4t any shelter beds available. Newsom\u00b4s administration wrote in support of cities\u00b4 arguments that previous rulings, including one that barred San Francisco from clearing encampments, have prevented the state from solving a critical problem.\n\nCalifornia is home to roughly one-third of the nation\u00b4s population of homeless people, a problem that has dogged Newsom since he took office. There are thousands of tents and makeshift shelters across the state that line freeways, and fill parking lots and public parks.\n\nThe state has spent roughly $24 billion under Newsom's leadership to clean up streets and house people. That includes at least $3.2 billion in grants given to local government to build shelters, clear encampments and connect homeless people to services as they see fit, Newsom said.\n\nThose have been unprecedented investments from the state, he added, but his administration will start redirecting that money in January.\n\n\"This is not about criminalization,\" Newsom said. \"What\u00b4s criminal is neglecting people that are struggling and suffering and dying on our watch.\"\n\nIt's not the first time Newsom has vowed to cut funding over what he sees as the lackluster efforts from local governments to address homelessness. In 2022, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in homelessness spending from cities and counties over the lack of progress. Last month, his office clawed back a $10-million grant sent to San Diego to build tiny homes because the county didn't act fast enough.\n\nSan Francisco's mayor has taken more aggressive action in clearing encampments.\n\nBut others, including Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and LA County officials, have pushed back, saying the governor's approach won't work. Newsom on Thursday praised Bass' work at successfully reducing the number of people sleeping outside in Los Angeles, adding his frustration is mostly directed toward counties.\n\nCalifornia State Association of Counties, which represents 58 counties in California, said it won\u00b4t weigh in on the governor\u00b4s announcement Thursday. A spokesperson instead pointed to a statement in response to Newsom's order last month that the counties \"will continue to work together with the Governor and share his sense of urgency.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tent city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California Department of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Controlled-access highway"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_San_Francisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of San Francisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Bass", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen Bass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803079", "eventUri": "eng-9803079", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 234, "relevance": 1}

The governor joined the California Department of Transportation, known as Caltrans, on Thursday to clear several encampment sites in the area.\n\n\"I want to see results,\" Newsom told reporters at a news conference. \"I don't want to read about them. I don't want to see the data. I want to see it.\"\n\nThursday's announcement was part of Newsom's escalating campaign to push local governments into doing more homeless encampment sweeps. Newsom last month ordered state agencies to start clearing encampments on state land. He also pressured local government to do the same, though he cannot legally force them to act.\n\nThe executive order came after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a lower court ruling that said governments could not force people to leave encampments if there weren't any shelter beds available. Newsom's administration wrote in support of cities' arguments that previous rulings, including one that barred San Francisco from clearing encampments, have prevented the state from solving a critical problem.\n\nCalifornia is home to roughly one-third of the nation's population of homeless people, a problem that has dogged Newsom since he took office. There are thousands of tents and makeshift shelters across the state that line freeways, and fill parking lots and public parks.\n\nThe state has spent roughly $24 billion under Newsom's leadership to clean up streets and house people. That includes at least $3.2 billion in grants given to local government to build shelters, clear encampments and connect homeless people to services as they see fit, Newsom said.\n\nThose have been unprecedented investments from the state, he added, but his administration will start redirecting that money in January.\n\n\"This is not about criminalization,\" Newsom said. \"What's criminal is neglecting people that are struggling and suffering and dying on our watch.\"\n\nIt's not the first time Newsom has vowed to cut funding over what he sees as the lackluster efforts from local governments to address homelessness. In 2022, he threatened to withhold $1 billion in homelessness spending from cities and counties over the lack of progress.

County, Where He Wants More 'Urgency'", "body": "The stop in Los Angeles came without the usual courtesy notice.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom was in Southern California on Thursday morning to celebrate the debut of two giant pandas at the San Diego Zoo. But hours later, he emerged 127 miles up the freeway, driving home his message of the moment: Famously tolerant California isn't tolerating homeless encampments anymore.\n\nSince July 25, when the governor urged California cities to dismantle the street camps that have come to define the state's homelessness crisis, leaders in Los Angeles have been particularly resistant to Mr. Newsom, making clear that they plan to deal with the issue in their own way and on their own timetable.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Newsom, in sunglasses, jeans and a black ball cap, visited two homeless encampments on their turf without directly informing city or county leaders. The only advance notice seemed to be state placards that warned people days ago they were facing citation or arrest if they continued to stay there.\n\n\"People are done. If we don't deal with this, we don't deserve to be in office,\" Mr. Newsom said, tearing into a rancid, garbage-strewn campsite on state property under Interstate 10 in Los Angeles, alongside a crew of state workers with orange vests.\n\nHis mission, he said, was part public service, part political flex. The governor said that he particularly wanted more \"urgency\" from the leaders of Los Angeles County, home to nearly 10 million Californians, where unsheltered homelessness decreased last year at about half the rate as it did in the City of Los Angeles, its largest jurisdiction.\n\n\"We need partners, not sparring partners,\" Mr. Newsom said. \"If we can't move Los Angeles County, we're not going to move the state.\"\n\nThe governor cannot demand that local governments crack down on homelessness, so he has encouraged them to remove camps, starting with those that posed the highest health and safety risks. He can, however, deploy his own teams on state property, which is exactly what he did on Thursday.\n\nAfter Mr. Newsom issued his executive order last month, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, quickly declared that its county jails would not be used to house people removed from encampments. Sheriff Robert Luna has vowed that his agency will arrest homeless campers only if they commit a crime, not simply for sleeping in public spaces.\n\nLindsey P. Horvath, the current chair of the county board of supervisors, said that outreach workers from a county-affiliated homeless authority had already provided services and housing offers to the people who lived at the encampment that Mr. Newsom was clearing. The problem with demanding immediate enforcement, county leaders say, is that people have nowhere to go and will simply move elsewhere in the area.\n\n\"What's the point of a cleanup if you don't match it with housing and services?\" she said.\n\nMayor Karen Bass, who is in Paris this week for the Olympics as her city prepares to host the next Games in four years, has issued a steady stream of statements touting the positive results of her own approach. It prioritizes shelter and offers of support first, rather than scattering homeless campers with threats of citation, arrest or forced eviction.\n\nThis summer, her office announced a 10 percent drop in the number of unsheltered homeless people compared with the previous year, the first double-digit decline in nearly a decade.\n\nOn Thursday morning, as word spread in Los Angeles that the governor was en route from San Diego, Ms. Bass sent out three more statements. She reported that her program, called Inside Safe, had recently found housing for 30 more homeless people, and that her lobbying with the federal government and the United States Conference of Mayors had yielded a policy change that will make it easier for homeless veterans to obtain housing.\n\nMr. Newsom did not criticize Ms. Bass's approach on Thursday and focused instead on county officials.\n\nIn a phone interview from France, Ms. Bass, laughing, said that she had not yet spoken to the governor but had heard that he had gone to San Diego \"to welcome some pandas, and he was passing through Los Angeles and was going to help us out.\"\n\n\"If I were in town, I'd be out there with him,\" she added. \"I know he's frustrated with a lot of cities that do not address the problem, but Los Angeles is one of the cities that does address the problem. For the first time in years, homelessness in Los Angeles is down.\"\n\nMr. Newsom's pit stop came weeks after a Supreme Court ruling in June that gave state and local governments greater authority to crack down on encampments. The change had particular effect in the nine Western states covered by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which had ruled that cities could not arrest homeless people for sleeping outside if they had no other legal place to stay, finding such punishment unconstitutionally cruel and unusual.\n\nWestern officials from both parties, including Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, had asked the Supreme Court to review that lower court ruling, arguing that it had hobbled enforcement so much that encampments were overtaking parks, sidewalks and other public spaces.\n\nAn estimated 180,000 people were homeless last year in California, most of them unsheltered. The state has some of the highest housing costs in the nation, complicating the many other factors that contribute to homelessness.\n\nNewsom administration officials have said that the governor's sweeping executive order is not intended to \"lead with enforcement,\" but rather to strike a balance between public safety and compassion. Issued roughly a month after the Supreme Court decision, Mr. Newsom's order also offered a template for litigation-shy municipalities who were uncertain how to proceed.\n\nThe governor ordered state agencies to act \"with urgency\" to sweep homeless camps from vast tracts of state-owned land, including parks, riverbeds, beaches and wildlands, based on policies and procedures already used by the state transportation agency, Caltrans. That model, he said, mandates the state to remove encampments \"humanely,\" prioritizing those that most threaten health and safety.\n\nThe state must notify campers in advance and work with local service providers to connect them with services and housing. Property collected at each site must be bagged, tagged and stored for at least 60 days.\n\nBut campers who refuse to leave state property can be arrested, a point of contention among advocates for the homeless who fear that \"criminalization\" will further harm an already vulnerable population. And, they note, most cities still are short on shelter space for dispersed campers. California, by the most recent estimates, has only about 71,000 shelter beds.\n\nThough the governor cannot force local governments to sweep encampments, he does control billions of dollars for municipalities to address homelessness, which in turn gives him some leverage.\n\nAnd many California cities have enthusiastically embraced Mr. Newsom's order, pressured by constituents who have lost patience with encampments and blocked sidewalks.\n\nThe Fresno City Council recently initiated a ban on camping in public spaces. Mayor London Breed of San Francisco, a Democrat in a tough fight for re-election, has pledged to aggressively clear encampments and told the police that homeless campers who refused shelter could face citation and possible jail time for illegal lodging. Last week, she directed city officials to offer bus tickets to homeless people before providing them shelter beds or other services.\n\nConstance Farrell, a spokesman for Ms. Horvath, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors chair, said that Los Angeles authorities found out that the governor was coming only after Caltrans posted notices of the cleanup and notified local service providers.\n\nBy Thursday morning, she said, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, the regional planning body that coordinates homelessness programs for the city and county, had found shelter for several of the two dozen or so campers at the two sites that Caltrans had indicated the governor would visit.\n\n\"We're doing the outreach and we're bringing people inside,\" Ms. Farrell said. \"And we're not going to pivot from our approach.\"\n\nIn the working-class neighborhood surrounding the Los Angeles encampment that Mr. Newsom visited first on Thursday, residents expressed relief that someone, anyone, was rousting the settlement under the freeway. Not because of animus toward the people who camped there, they said, but because of the safety hazard.\n\n\"They build a lot of fires,\" said Omar Godinez, 19, an auto mechanic who does smog checks across the street from the encampment. \"There's only a few of them, but this is our environment, you know? It's all dirty and smelly and it's not really pleasant, and it's been that way since Covid.\"\n\n\"It doesn't seem like it's getting better,\" said Jorge Juarez, 29, a waiter who lives down the street who said he had personally seen little evidence of progress, statistics notwithstanding.\n\nLast week, he said, the diner where he works on Hollywood Boulevard was robbed by people he believes were living in a nearby encampment.\n\nAt home, he said, \"it's dangerous to walk at night time, and there's not much we can do about it. It's just homelessness everywhere. And L.A. is such a nice city. It's too bad.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5,

The order cited a controversial US supreme court decision saying unhoused people sleeping outside can be ticketed and jailed even when there is no shelter available, and directed state agencies to develop policies to remove encampments along freeways and other properties under its jurisdiction. The order also urged local governments to follow suit.\n\nRelated: Thousands of senior citizens are dying homeless in Los Angeles, records reveal\n\nNewsom can't legally force local governments to act, but he can pressure them by withholding state funds.\n\n\"I want to see results,\" Newsom told reporters at a news conference on Thursday. \"I don't want to read about them. I don't want to see the data. I want to see it.\"\n\nCalifornia is home to roughly one-third of the nation's population of unhoused people. A 2023 count estimated that there were more than 180,000 people in the state experiencing homelessness, including 123,000 people living outside on the streets in tents, trailers, cars and makeshift shelters.\n\nThe crisis is among the worst in the nation, and is increasingly drawing national attention. Republicans have repeatedly used the homelessness crisis to attack the governor and other California Democrats, including presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nBut solving it is a problem that has dogged Newsom since taking office. Under Newsom, the state has spent roughly $24bn to tackle the homelessness crisis. That includes at least $3.2bn in grants given to local government to build shelters, clear encampments and connect unhoused people to services.\n\nThose have been unprecedented investments from the state, Newsom said.\n\nChris Herring, a University of California, Los Angeles, sociology professor and expert on homelessness, told the Guardian last month he saw Newsom's order as \"giving the green light to a harsher approach\".\n\n\"It sends a clear message to municipalities that even if you do not have shelter available, you can go through with this. The law now allows cities and counties to cite and incarcerate individuals for sleeping outside,\" Herring said.\n\nBut not all local authorities are embracing Newsom's stepped-up approach.

The order cited a controversial US supreme court decision saying unhoused people sleeping outside can be ticketed and jailed even when there is no shelter available, and directed state agencies to develop policies to remove encampments along freeways and other properties under its jurisdiction. The order also urged local governments to follow suit.\n\nNewsom can't legally force local governments to act, but he can pressure them by withholding state funds.\n\n\"I want to see results,\" Newsom told reporters at a news conference on Thursday. \"I don't want to read about them. I don't want to see the data. I want to see it.\"\n\nCalifornia is home to roughly one-third of the nation's population of unhoused people. A 2023 count estimated that there were more than 180,000 people in the state experiencing homelessness, including 123,000 people living outside on the streets in tents, trailers, cars and makeshift shelters.\n\nThe crisis is among the worst in the nation, and is increasingly drawing national attention. Republicans have repeatedly used the homelessness crisis to attack the governor and other California Democrats, including presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nBut solving it is a problem that has dogged Newsom since taking office. Under Newsom, the state has spent roughly $24bn to tackle the homelessness crisis. That includes at least $3.2bn in grants given to local government to build shelters, clear encampments and connect unhoused people to services.\n\nThose have been unprecedented investments from the state, Newsom said.\n\nChris Herring, a University of California, Los Angeles, sociology professor and expert on homelessness, told the Guardian last month he saw Newsom's order as \"giving the green light to a harsher approach\".\n\n\"It sends a clear message to municipalities that even if you do not have shelter available, you can go through with this. The law now allows cities and counties to cite and incarcerate individuals for sleeping outside,\" Herring said.\n\nBut not all local authorities are embracing Newsom's stepped-up approach. While San Francisco's mayor has taken aggressive action in clearing encampments after the supreme court ruling, the Los Angeles mayor, Karen Bass, and LA county officials have pushed back, saying the governor's approach won't work.\n\nNewsom on Thursday praised Bass's work at successfully reducing the number of people sleeping outside in Los Angeles, adding that his frustration is mostly directed toward counties.\n\nThe California state association of counties, which represents 58 counties in the state, said it won't weigh in on the governor's announcement on Thursday.

Gavin Newsom was in Southern California on Thursday morning to celebrate the debut of two giant pandas at the San Diego Zoo. But hours later, he emerged 127 miles up the freeway, driving home his message of the moment: Famously tolerant California isn't tolerating homeless encampments anymore.\n\nSince July 25, when the governor urged California cities to dismantle the street camps that have come to define the state's homelessness crisis, leaders in Los Angeles have been particularly resistant to Mr. Newsom, making clear that they plan to deal with the issue in their own way and on their own timetable.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Newsom, in sunglasses, jeans and a black ball cap, visited two homeless encampments on their turf without directly informing city or county leaders. The only advance notice seemed to be state placards that warned people days ago they were facing citation or arrest if they continued to stay there.\n\n\"People are done. If we don't deal with this, we don't deserve to be in office,\" Mr. Newsom said, tearing into a rancid, garbage-strewn campsite on state property under Interstate 10 in Los Angeles, alongside a crew of state workers with orange vests.\n\nHis mission, he said, was part public service, part political flex. The governor said that he particularly wanted more \"urgency\" from the leaders of Los Angeles County, home to nearly 10 million Californians, where unsheltered homelessness decreased last year at about half the rate as it did in the City of Los Angeles, its largest jurisdiction.\n\n\"We need partners, not sparring partners,\" Mr. Newsom said. \"If we can't move Los Angeles County, we're not going to move the state.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tent city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Zoo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Giant panda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Controlled-access highway"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_10", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interstate 10"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Shows_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Shows and Events", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/08/multimedia/8nat-la-cleanup-newsom-gphj/8nat-la-cleanup-newsom-gphj-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803079", "eventUri": "eng-9803079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 372, "textEnd": 379}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom threatened on Thursday to take away state funding from counties that don't show improvement on homelessness.\n\n\"If we don't see demonstrable results, I'll start to redirect money,\" Newsom said.\n\n\"This is a sincerely held belief that we need local government to step up. This is a crisis. Act like it.\"\n\nUnbridled frustration from the Democratic governor over the lack of progress on his top issue -- homelessness -- isn't new, nor is warning about stripping money from reluctant counties. As he nears the halfway point of his second and final term in office, Newsom is using his soapbox as governor to increase public pressure and lay blame on local leaders for California's most glaring humanitarian crisis.\n\nLos Angeles County, in particular, has become a frequent target of Newsom's ire. The governor again criticized the county on Thursday for delaying implementation of a law that expands the criteria for people to be detained against their will.\n\nHis trip to Pacoima came after his call to remove homeless encampments also appeared to fall on mostly deaf ears last month in Los Angeles, where elected officials criticized the order, or said it changed nothing in their policy approach. The governor's executive order requires his administration to remove encampments on state property and urged cities and counties to do the same.\n\nMayor Karen Bass said \"strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next or give citations instead of housing do not work.\" Los Angeles County Supervisor Lindsay Horvath said the county is already doing \"urgent and humane encampment resolution.\"\n\nTwo weeks later, Newsom arrived in a T-shirt, aviator sunglasses and a baseball cap with a California Department of Transportation crew to clean up encampments near an entrance to the 5 Freeway in Pacoima. The governor said he signed the executive order with \"intention.\"\n\n\"Folks may choose not to do anything differently,\" Newsom said Thursday. \"That's a decision that could be made. Here's what I get to decide. ... If that's the result, I'm going to redirect the money. It's not complicated and I'm going to send it to people that actually want to get the job done.\"\n\nRead more: Newsom orders California agencies to clear homeless camps, but the impact remains a question\n\nThe governor and experts agree that the homelessness crisis is decades in the making, but opinions differ over whether Newsom's more conservative policy approach and finger-pointing will help fix the issue. A dearth of affordable housing, low wages and the high cost of living are at the crux of a problem that has been exacerbated by mental health challenges and drug abuse.\n\nThe Newsom administration has spent more than $24 billion to clean up encampments, move Californians off the streets and sidewalks, and convert hotels and motels into temporary shelters, among dozens of other homelessness initiatives. The state has increased spending flexibility for local governments and given cities and counties more authority to force Californians into treatment under programs such as CARE Court and the expansion of conservatorships.\n\nProposition 1, Newsom's ballot measure that voters narrowly approved in March, is expected to deliver more than $6 billion for 10,000 treatment and housing beds and expand care for drug addiction.\n\nBut Newsom's policy approach to encampments and forced care have become points of contention between the governor and advocates for the unhoused, aligning him more with conservatives than progressives in his own party. The governor argues that he's done his job and given cities and counties more funding, tools and authority to address the problem as they requested.\n\n\"There's no more excuses,\" Newsom said. \"You've got the money. You've got the flexibility. You've got the green light. You've got the support from the state and the public is demanding it of you, and if this is not the most important issue, you're not paying attention. This is the biggest scar on the reputation of the state of California.\"\n\nIn June, Newsom praised a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that allowed Grants Pass, Ore. to enforce a law that banned camping in public places despite the city not having enough shelter to offer the people living in encampments.\n\nAcademics and homeless advocates cast Newsom's encampment order, which followed the ruling, as a reaction to political pressure that could make the problem worse instead of offering a solution to help California's most vulnerable residents.\n\n\"People can't disappear themselves,\" said Margot Kushel, a professor of medicine and the director of the Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative at UC San Francisco. \"There is no easy way out of this. I have deep compassion for everybody's frustration. I'm frustrated. I want this problem to be over. I understand this is unacceptable, but I think when you're in a hole, you need to stop digging.\"\n\nKushel and others described California's fundamental problem as the shortage of affordable housing. The Newsom administration has spent a lot of funding on the problem of homelessness, Kushel said, but the state still isn't building enough housing as the need continues to grow.\n\nRead more: Newsom calls for increased oversight of local homelessness efforts\n\nA state audit also found that California has failed to monitor the effectiveness of its costly homelessness programs, which raised questions about whether Newsom's efforts are worth the price tag as the state grapples with a budget deficit. The governor has pushed for more accountability around how local governments use state dollars.\n\nThe state budget enacted in July broadens the responsibilities of a state Housing Accountability Unit to include oversight of state homelessness grants to cities and counties and adds more staff positions for the work. A separate bill, Assembly Bill 3093, seeks to require local governments to plan to build housing for all income levels, including homeless populations.\n\nSan Jos\u00e9 Mayor Matt Mahan applauded Newsom for focusing on improving accountability.\n\nMahan said the development of more affordable housing is critically important, but it takes too long and costs too much to immediately address the problem. San Jos\u00e9 has focused on using state and federal funding to offer interim and transitional housing communities to provide \"a ladder off the streets.\"\n\nLast month, Newsom informed San Diego County of the state's intent to reclaim a $10-million grant to build 150 tiny units for lack of action and redirect the funds to San Jos\u00e9.\n\nMahan said he backs the idea of a statewide framework with set targets and specific goals for local governments to build shelter and treatment for its homeless residents.\n\n\"I think it will get us out of the fantasy land of thinking that we can prioritize solutions that will work if we just happen to have another $100 billion,\" Mahan said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Gavin Newsom says he will redirect money from California jurisdictions that don't show results in reducing homelessness | CNN", "body": "Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks to reporters after helping to clean up an encampment site in Los Angeles on Thursday.\n\nCNN --\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said he will start to redirect money from cities and counties that don't show \"demonstrable results\" in reducing homelessness.\n\nThe announcement Thursday came after Newsom helped clear a homeless encampment in Los Angeles alongside the state's Department of Transportation.\n\nThe governor issued an executive order in July calling on state agencies to begin taking down homeless encampments on state property and encouraged local governments to adopt similar policies.\n\nThe Democratic governor's order followed a US Supreme Court decision in June that ruled in favor of an Oregon city that ticketed homeless people for sleeping outside. Newsom's order calls on state officials \"to adopt humane and dignified policies to urgently address encampments on state property.\"\n\nNewsom made pointed comments Thursday criticizing some local jurisdictions for not doing enough despite the \"unprecedented resources\" the state has provided.\n\n\"No more excuses. You've got the money, you got the flexibility, you got the green light, you got support from the state, and the public is demanding it of you,\" Newsom said. \"I'm here on behalf of 40 million Californians that are fed up. I'm here because I'm one of them. I want to see results.\"\n\nCalifornia has the largest homeless population in the nation, with more than 180,000 of the estimated 653,000 people experiencing homelessness nationwide residing in the Golden State, according to a 2023 report to Congress from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nThe comments come after some municipalities have pushed back against the idea of issuing citations or jailing people in homeless encampments. In July, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously in favor of a motion affirming its jails won't be used to hold homeless people arrested when encampments are broken up. County officials said the approach was already in effect.\n\nAddressing the pushback, Newsom said his order emphasizes working with local service providers to get people resources and doesn't mention citations.\n\n\"The rhetoric is increasingly stale. This is not about criminalization. What's criminal, is neglecting people who are struggling and suffering and dying on our watch,\" he said.\n\nHe also said his comments about inaction \"is not an indictment\" of the City of Los Angeles and Mayor Karen Bass, but instead \"more broadly an indictment of counties\" that \"need to do more.\"\n\n\"This is not one of those political things,\" Newsom said. \"This is a sincerely held belief that we need local government to step up. This is a crisis, act like it.\"\n\nMoney could start being redirected in January when the state starts forming its budget proposals, Newsom said.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "taylor_romine@cnn.com", "name": "Taylor Romine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Board_of_Supervisors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Bass", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karen Bass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Housing_and_Urban_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Housing and Urban Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2165417501.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803079", "eventUri": "eng-9803079", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

I don't want to see the data. I want to see it.\"\n\nNewsom pledged on Thursday to start taking away state funding from cities and counties that are not doing enough to get people experiencing homelessness out of encampments and into shelter. He also joined the California Department of Transportation to clear several encampments in the area.\n\nCalifornia holds roughly one-third of the nation's population of people experiencing homelessness, and the state has spent about $24 billion under Newsom to clean up the streets and house people. Newsom said on Thursday that at least $3.2 billion has been given to local governments to build shelters, clear encampments and connect people experiencing homelessness to the proper services.\n\nNewsom said that his administration will start redirecting that money in January.\n\n\"This is not about criminalization,\" Newsom said. \"What's criminal is neglecting people that are struggling and suffering and dying on our watch.\"\n\nIn an executive order last month, Newsom directed state agencies to start clearing encampments on state land and pressed local governments to do the same, although he cannot legally force such actions.\n\nNewsom's crackdown on homeless encampments comes after a Supreme Court ruling allowed cities to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public spaces.\n\nIn late June, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling in City of Grants Pass, Oregon, v. Gloria Johnson. Johnson argued that the city of roughly 40,000 unlawfully punished homeless people for sleeping on the streets when no other shelter was available and unlawfully banned the use of sleeping bags, blankets, pillows and even cardboard boxes in public spaces.\n\nThe court sided with the Oregon city over a homeless plaintiff, finding that penalizing homeless people for sleeping on the streets does not violate the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishments as well as \"excessive fines.\"\n\nThe case was divisive among left-leaning circles with some, like Newsom and San Francisco Mayor London Breed, arguing that previous court rulings prevent elected officials from addressing matters of public safety, while others, including Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders, argued that punishing homeless people won't solve the lack of affordable housing.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court decision, Breed has vowed to take a more aggressive approach to homeless encampments. In late July, Breed's office announced that San Francisco police would start clearing out homeless encampments in the city.\n\nHowever, some officials have pushed back on Newsom's approach.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said \"strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next or give citations instead of housing do not work.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Los Angeles County Supervisor Lindsay Horvath said that the county is already doing \"urgent and humane encampment resolution.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Newsom clears Los Angeles homeless encampment after signing state directive", "body": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) helped clear a homeless encampment in Los Angeles on Thursday while threatening to take away state funding from the state's counties that do not do more to curb homelessness.\n\nNewsom was photographed Thursday working alongside Caltrans workers under a freeway in Los Angeles, where he said more than 1,400 encampments have been removed since January.\n\n\"We have thousands and thousands of additional encampments that have not been attended to all throughout the region, not just here in Los Angeles County, but in every part of the state of California,\" Newsom told reporters while standing near the encampment.\n\n\"The state has provided unprecedented resources for cities, municipalities large and small to address the encampment crisis,\" he added, calling the issue \"the biggest scar in the reputation\" of the Golden State.\n\n\"We've been providing the support, local government embraces those efforts, focuses a sense of urgency,\" Newsom said. \"We're going to double down. If local government is not interested, we're fine. We'll redirect the money to parts of the state, cities, and counties that are.\"\n\nThe New York Times reported Newsom or his office visited two homeless encampments Thursday, but did not directly inform city or county leaders. The advance notice was only through state placards warning people they would be cited or arrested if they continued to live there, the outlet said.\n\nThe Hill reached out to the governor's office for further comment.\n\nThe governor said he attended the cleanup on behalf of the 40 million \"fed-up Californians,\" before pointing to his executive order issued last month on the issue.\n\nThe executive order, issued on July 25, directed state agencies and departments to develop \"clear policies\" to quickly address the thousands of homeless encampments spread across California.\n\nThe governor at the time noted that the courts previously prevented the local government and state from cleaning up the encampments, but the Supreme Court decision in Grants Pass v. Johnson changed things.\n\nIn the decision, the high court ruled cities can ticket homeless people for camping in public even when there is no alternative shelter available.\n\n\"So, we had a simple executive order, do your job.

His office touted his administration has spent about $24 billion total to clean up the streets and house people.\n\nEarlier this year, he supported a ballot measure to allow the state to borrow about $6.4 billion to build 4,350 housing units, which passed with a thin margin, The Associated Press reported.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "miranda_nazzaro@thehill.com", "name": "Miranda Nazzaro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tent city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California Department of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Controlled-access highway"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State Relations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/AP24193819201750-e1721929594755.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803079", "eventUri": "eng-9803079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 1694, "textEnd": 1701}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Gavin Newsom hit the throttle on his pressure campaign for local governments to address homeless encampments on Thursday, issuing his most direct threat so far that he'll cut off money to counties he believes are too sluggish in getting people off the street.\n\nThough counties writ large were the target of his broadside, Newsom's ire was not-so-subtly aimed at one in particular: Los Angeles, the epicenter of the state's homelessness crisis and where the Board of Supervisors gave an ice-cold reception to his recent executive order on encampments.\n\n\"If we don't see demonstrable results, I'll start to redirect money,\" Newsom told reporters assembled at the site of a recently cleared encampment on state-owned land in the San Fernando Valley, adding, \"I'll be candid with you. This is more broadly an indictment of counties. ... Counties need to do more.\"\n\nHe continued: \"We're here with our hands out. Open hands, not a closed fist. That said, if we don't see results, we're going to change our approach.\"\n\nHis comments mark the latest escalation of his assertive tone on homeless encampments in California, prompted by the recent Supreme Court ruling that freed local governments to enforce anti-camping laws, including through fines, citations or jail time. The decision has increased the political pressure on all of the state's officials, from Newsom on down, to address what he called \"the biggest scar on the reputation of the state of California.\"\n\n\"We're done with excuses. And the last big excuse was 'well, the courts are saying we can't do it.' Well, that's no longer the case,\" Newsom said. \"So we had a simple executive order. Do your job. No more excuses.\"\n\nNewsom's executive order, which directed state agencies to ramp up their own efforts to clear encampments, does not address enforcement measures. But the question of whether the Supreme Court's Grants Pass court ruling will unleash a new wave of punitive measures has gripped cities and counties in recent weeks.\n\nSan Francisco Mayor London Breed has said she's open to new penalties, including citations and possible jail time for those who refuse services. She also has directed staff to offer homeless people bus tickets out of the city before offering shelter. Newsom on Thursday noted he had started a similar program when he was mayor of the city 25 years ago to reconnect people with family. But, he said, \"that's not the first thing I would do.\"\n\nLos Angeles officials, however, made clear that Grants Pass does not significantly alter their approach to dealing with homelessness, and they've been vocal opponents to policies that would \"criminalize\" people living on the street.\n\n\"We don't want encampments on our sidewalks, but we cannot, nor are we legally allowed to make jails our de facto housing and shelter,\" said Board of Supervisors Chair Lindsey P. Horvath at a meeting last week, where county officials were united in their visible skepticism to the governor's order.\n\nThe board later approved a motion making clear that county jails would not be used to hold people arrested solely for anti-camping ordinances.\n\nNewsom did not specify whether he wanted to see cities or counties ramp up criminal or civil enforcement.\n\n\"No one wants to see criminalization,\" he said. \"That's a lazy, lazy framework. And that's the binary people that don't want to do the job are going to try to frame, and I reject that.\"\n\nHe rattled off a litany of efforts the state has done to help boost counties in work to address homelessness, including millions of dollars for encampment resolution, billions for mental health and substance abuse treatment, zoning reform, efforts to streamline conservatorships and Medi-Cal reimbursement for mobile medical services.\n\n\"All we're asking for is a deeper sense of urgency,\" Newsom said. \"It is not an indictment. These supervisors are actual, real-life friends ... but I want a sense of urgency.\"\n\nThe increased friction with Los Angeles County comes as state and county governments will need to work even more closely together to clean up encampments. Counties are often the service providers that offer shelter or other interventions for people living in the encampments. At the site Newsom visited on Thursday, where he said 11 people had been living, workers did outreach the previous day, alerting people of the coming clean-up.\n\nLos Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said at the supervisor's meeting last week that while Newsom's executive order \"will not alter the way our department approaches or manages the unhoused population,\" it will increase communication with the California Highway Patrol, which will be overseeing the cleanups.\n\nNewsom took pains to specify his critiques were not aimed at Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who is currently in Paris for the close of the Summer Olympics.\n\n\"I want to applaud Mayor Bass,\" Newsom said. \"She saw a 10.4 percent reduction of unsheltered homelessness last year, which was one of the most significant declines in the state of California. She's been a good partner.\"\n\nStill, Newsom's fiery rhetoric toward the county puts Bass in the middle of a brewing dispute between two major players she's locked arms with to tackle her city's most pressing issue.\n\nShe has also been a fierce critic of the Grants Pass decision, arguing that it will lead to neighboring cities and counties simply pushing their homeless population outside their boundaries without solving the underlying problem.\n\nIn fact, Bass at a recent immigration conference prior to Newsom releasing his executive order, said the city needed to prepare to \"resist the potential wave of oppression\" in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling.\n\n\"We're going to have to worry about other cities now, locally, sending unhoused people into LA and creating chaos,\" she said. \"That's not the way to solve the problem.

Gavin Newsom threatened on Thursday to take away state funding from counties that don't show improvement on homelessness.\n\n\"If we don't see demonstrable results, I'll start to redirect money,\" Newsom said.\n\n\"This is a sincerely held belief that we need local government to step up. This is a crisis. Act like it.\"\n\nUnbridled frustration from the Democratic governor over the lack of progress on his top issue -- homelessness -- isn't new, nor is warning about stripping money from reluctant counties. As he nears the halfway point of his second and final term in office, Newsom is using his soapbox as governor to increase public pressure and lay blame on local leaders for California's most glaring humanitarian crisis.\n\nLos Angeles County, in particular, has become a frequent target of Newsom's ire. The governor again criticized the county on Thursday for delaying implementation of a law that expands the criteria for people to be detained against their will.\n\nHis trip to Pacoima came after his call to remove homeless encampments also appeared to fall on mostly deaf ears last month in Los Angeles, where elected officials criticized the order, or said it changed nothing in their policy approach. The governor's executive order requires his administration to remove encampments on state property and urged cities and counties to do the same.\n\nMayor Karen Bass said \"strategies that just move people along from one neighborhood to the next or give citations instead of housing do not work.\" Los Angeles County Supervisor Lindsay Horvath said the county is already doing \"urgent and humane encampment resolution.\"\n\nTwo weeks later, Newsom arrived in a T-shirt, aviator sunglasses and a baseball cap with a California Department of Transportation crew to clean up encampments near an entrance to the 5 Freeway in Pacoima. The governor said he signed the executive order with \"intention.\"\n\n\"Folks may choose not to do anything differently,\" Newsom said Thursday. \"That's a decision that could be made. Here's what I get to decide. ... If that's the result, I'm going to redirect the money. It's not complicated and I'm going to send it to people that actually want to get the job done.\"\n\nThe governor and experts agree that the homelessness crisis is decades in the making, but opinions differ over whether Newsom's more conservative policy approach and finger-pointing will help fix the issue. A dearth of affordable housing, low wages and the high cost of living are at the crux of a problem that has been exacerbated by mental health challenges and drug abuse.\n\nThe Newsom administration has spent more than $24 billion to clean up encampments, move Californians off the streets and sidewalks, and convert hotels and motels into temporary shelters, among dozens of other homelessness initiatives. The state has increased spending flexibility for local governments and given cities and counties more authority to force Californians into treatment under programs such as CARE Court and the expansion of conservatorships.\n\nProposition 1, Newsom's ballot measure that voters narrowly approved in March, is expected to deliver more than $6 billion for 10,000 treatment and housing beds and expand care for drug addiction.\n\nBut Newsom's policy approach to encampments and forced care have become points of contention between the governor and advocates for the unhoused, aligning him more with conservatives than progressives in his own party. The governor argues that he's done his job and given cities and counties more funding, tools and authority to address the problem as they requested.\n\n\"There's no more excuses,\" Newsom said. \"You've got the money. You've got the flexibility. You've got the green light. You've got the support from the state and the public is demanding it of you, and if this is not the most important issue, you're not paying attention. This is the biggest scar on the reputation of the state of California.\"\n\nIn June, Newsom praised a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that allowed Grants Pass, Ore. to enforce a law that banned camping in public places despite the city not having enough shelter to offer the people living in encampments.\n\nAcademics and homeless advocates cast Newsom's encampment order, which followed the ruling, as a reaction to political pressure that could make the problem worse instead of offering a solution to help California's most vulnerable residents.\n\n\"People can't disappear themselves,\" said Margot Kushel, a professor of medicine and the director of the Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative at UC San Francisco. \"There is no easy way out of this. I have deep compassion for everybody's frustration. I'm frustrated. I want this problem to be over. I understand this is unacceptable, but I think when you're in a hole, you need to stop digging.\"\n\nKushel and others described California's fundamental problem as the shortage of affordable housing. The Newsom administration has spent a lot of funding on the problem of homelessness, Kushel said, but the state still isn't building enough housing as the need continues to grow.\n\nA state audit also found that California has failed to monitor the effectiveness of its costly homelessness programs, which raised questions about whether Newsom's efforts are worth the price tag as the state grapples with a budget deficit. The governor has pushed for more accountability around how local governments use state dollars.\n\nThe state budget enacted in July broadens the responsibilities of a state Housing Accountability Unit to include oversight of state homelessness grants to cities and counties and adds more staff positions for the work. A separate bill, Assembly Bill 3093, seeks to require local governments to plan to build housing for all income levels, including homeless populations.\n\nSan Jos\u00e9 Mayor Matt Mahan applauded Newsom for focusing on improving accountability.\n\nMahan said the development of more affordable housing is critically important, but it takes too long and costs too much to immediately address the problem. San Jos\u00e9 has focused on using state and federal funding to offer interim and transitional housing communities to provide \"a ladder off the streets.\"\n\nLast month, Newsom informed San Diego County of the state's intent to reclaim a $10-million grant to build 150 tiny units for lack of action and redirect the funds to San Jos\u00e9.\n\nMahan said he backs the idea of a statewide framework with set targets and specific goals for local governments to build shelter and treatment for its homeless residents.\n\n\"I think it will get us out of the fantasy land of thinking that we can prioritize solutions that will work if we just happen to have another $100 billion,\" Mahan said.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [],

Gavin Newsom said he will start to redirect money from cities and counties that don't show \"demonstrable results\" in reducing homelessness.\n\nThe announcement Thursday came after Newsom helped clear a homeless encampment in Los Angeles alongside the state's Department of Transportation.\n\nThe governor issued an executive order in July calling on state agencies to begin taking down homeless encampments on state property and encouraged local governments to adopt similar policies.\n\nThe Democratic governor's order followed a US Supreme Court decision in June that ruled in favor of an Oregon city that ticketed homeless people for sleeping outside. Newsom's order calls on state officials \"to adopt humane and dignified policies to urgently address encampments on state property.\"\n\nNewsom made pointed comments Thursday criticizing some local jurisdictions for not doing enough despite the \"unprecedented resources\" the state has provided.\n\n\"No more excuses. You've got the money, you got the flexibility, you got the green light, you got support from the state, and the public is demanding it of you,\" Newsom said. \"I'm here on behalf of 40 million Californians that are fed up. I'm here because I'm one of them. I want to see results.\"\n\nCalifornia has the largest homeless population in the nation, with more than 180,000 of the estimated 653,000 people experiencing homelessness nationwide residing in the Golden State, according to a 2023 report to Congress from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nThe comments come after some municipalities have pushed back against the idea of issuing citations or jailing people in homeless encampments. In July, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously in favor of a motion affirming its jails won't be used to hold homeless people arrested when encampments are broken up. County officials said the approach was already in effect.\n\nAddressing the pushback, Newsom said his order emphasizes working with local service providers to get people resources and doesn't mention citations.\n\n\"The rhetoric is increasingly stale. This is not about criminalization. What's criminal, is neglecting people who are struggling and suffering and dying on our watch,\" he said.\n\nHe also said his comments about inaction \"is not an indictment\" of the City of Los Angeles and Mayor Karen Bass, but instead \"more broadly an indictment of counties\" that \"need to do more.\"\n\n\"This is not one of those political things,\" Newsom said. \"This is a sincerely held belief that we need local government to step up. This is a crisis, act like it.\"\n\nMoney could start being redirected in January when the state starts forming its budget proposals, Newsom said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

This is like the guy who burned down your house showing up afterward and saying, \"These unsightly ashes are unacceptable. How dare you!\"\n\nThe governor, who won the job six years ago, now suddenly wants everyone to be \"urgent.\"\n\n\"People are done. If we don't deal with this, we don't deserve to be in office,\" Mr. Newsom said, tearing into a rancid, garbage-strewn campsite on state property under Interstate 10 in Los Angeles, alongside a crew of state workers with orange vests.\n\nYou hit the nail on the head, Newsom. You didn't do anything about it for years, and you don't deserve to be in office. He terms out in '26, so he won't be governor, but we know he has his sights set on higher office, which should scare us all.\n\nThis video depicts the complete lack of authenticity shown so expertly by Democrat nominee Kamala Harris recently on the campaign trail:\n\nSo, after all these years of helping bring on this problem, he's now suddenly issued an executive order and shown up in his \"I'm such a regular guy\" tight T-shirt? That should fix everything:\n\nHe's particularly annoyed with leaders in LA, who aren't jumping aboard with his sudden newfound passion and are resisting his sudden awakening:\n\nSince July 25, when the governor urged California cities to dismantle the street camps that have come to define the state's homelessness crisis, leaders in Los Angeles have been particularly resistant to Mr. Newsom, making clear that they plan to deal with the issue in their own way and on their own timetable...\n\nHis mission, he said, was part public service, part political flex. The governor said that he particularly wanted more \"urgency\" from the leaders of Los Angeles County, home to nearly 10 million Californians, where unsheltered homelessness decreased last year at about half the rate as it did in the City of Los Angeles, its largest jurisdiction.\n\n\"We need partners, not sparring partners,\" Mr. Newsom said. \"If we can't move Los Angeles County, we're not going to move the state.\"\n\nThese are strong statements that sound good on TV. But the same guy who made them recently vetoed a bill that would have required that authorities actually keep track of the hundreds of millions of dollars they've thrown at the situation (with little to nothing to show for it).\n\nRead RedState's Jennifer O'Connell's excellent reporting on that ridiculousness.\n\nNewsom's Mess: Fed Audit Finds Failure to Safeguard Millions of Dollars in Homelessness Funding\n\nMeanwhile, Newsom's little photo-op does not -- unfortunately for him -- erase his disastrous record.\n\nGavin Newsom Delivers Dark State of the State Speech, Obsesses Over Gender Politics, Abortion\n\nThe Fact That Gavin Newsom Is Even in the Conversation Reveals Shallowness of the Media and Dem Voters\n\nAs I've noted before, there's one video that tells you everything you need to know about Newsom and his record on homelessness.

Gavin Newsom traded his suit and tie for a pair of jeans and a t-shirt to help clear out two homeless encampments that have plagued the state in recent years.\n\nThe 56-year-old Democrat, donning a pair of work gloves, tossed mounds of trash and other debris into orange plastic garbage bags underneath an overpass in Los Angeles on Thursday, video from the governor's press office captured.\n\nThe midday clean-up occurred under a section of the 5 Freeway in Mission Hills alongside Caltrans crews, according to KTLA.\n\nIt comes two weeks after Newsom issued an executive order directing state agencies to remove the thousands of tents and makeshift shelters across the state that line freeways, clutter shopping center parking lots and fill city parks.\n\nNewsom wanted municipalities to \"address unsanitary and dangerous encampments within their communities and provide people experiencing homelessness in the encampments with the care and supportive services they need.\"\n\nThe executive order, signed on July 25, was issued after the US Supreme Court allowed cities to enforce bans on sleeping outside in public spaces.\n\n\"No more excuses. We've provided the time. We've provided the funds. Now it's time for locals to do their job,\" Newsom said on X.\n\nNewsom's order urges agencies to prioritize clearing encampments after ample warnings but can't force local authorities to act.\n\nHis administration can, however, apply pressure by withholding money for counties and cities.\n\nNewsom has made homelessness a signature issue as California governor. He pushed and campaigned for a ballot measure earlier this year to allow the state to borrow nearly $6.4 billion to build 4,350 housing units.\n\nCalifornia has an estimated 180,000 homeless people, which is roughly one-third of the nation's total homeless population.\n\nNewsom, who was seen as a potential replacement for President Joe Biden on the Democrat ticket before his name was thrown around as Kamala Harris' running mate, was reelected as governor in 2022, and will finish his second term in Jan. 2027.\n\nNewsom's office boasted about the effectiveness of the clean-up program claiming to have removed over 2.6 million cubic yards of litter, resolving 11,000 encampments and creating more than 18,000 jobs.\n\nSome social media users weren't thrilled to see Newsom getting his hands dirty, calling it a political stunt.\n\n\"Stop enforcing the law, turn cities into dumpsters, then brag about jobs created to clean the dumps. Smh, this is not the flex you think it is,\" one comment on X read.\n\n\"It's like when my kids clean up their own mess and expect praise,\" another person added.\n\n\"Create the problems and then attempt to take credit for cleaning it up!\" a third critic responded.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California Department of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_5_in_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interstate 5 in California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTLA", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KTLA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tent city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T-shirt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Hills,_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mission Hills, Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mission Hills, Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled-access_highway", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Controlled-access highway"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society", "label": "dmoz/Society", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/governor-gavin-newsom-along-caltrans-87419009.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803079", "eventUri": "eng-9803079", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 1016, "textEnd": 1023}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

This is in large part due to policies that Newsom has pushed throughout his political career.\n\n\"No more excuses. You've got the money, you got the flexibility, you got the green light, you got support from the state, and the public is demanding it of you,\" Newsom said at the time, according to Crossroads Today. \"I'm here on behalf of 40 million Californians that are fed up. I'm here because I'm one of them. I want to see results.\"\n\nFox 11 Los Angeles reporter Matthew Seedorff shared a video of Newson clearing debris on X, adding: \"California Governor @GavinNewsom is in Mission Hills, CA helping clear-out a homeless encampment. About 2 weeks ago Newsom issued an executive order telling state officials to take down homeless camps. He tells me cities need to have more urgency.\"\n\nThe Democrat governor issued an executive order in July in response to the Supreme Court ruling in favor of an Oregon city that ticketed homeless people for sleeping outside, directing state agencies \"to urgently address homeless encampments while respecting the dignity and safety of Californians experiencing homelessness,\" according to Newsom's office.\n\nSuddenly sounding much like a Republican, Newsom cited the conditions homeless people live in as a reason to shut down the sprawling encampments when he issued the executive order.\n\n\"[It is] imperative to act with urgency to address dangerous encampments, which subject unsheltered individuals living in them to extreme weather, fires, predatory and criminal activity, and widespread substance use, harming their health, safety, and well-being, and which also threaten the safety and viability of nearby businesses and neighborhoods and undermine the cleanliness and usability of parks, water supplies, and other public resources,\" he said.\n\nKeep in mind that some areas of the state provide guaranteed income to the \"unhoused,\" as Democrats like to call the homeless. An incentive that is sure to exacerbate the problem.\n\nGavin posted the following message Thursday on his official X account: \"The homelessness crisis must be addressed with urgency, dignity, and compassion. The state has provided unprecedented resources for local governments to address dangerous encampments -- and provide individuals with the care and services they need. No more excuses.\"\n\nHere's a quick sampling of responses to the story, as seen on X:\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Gavin Newsom speaks during a press conference at The Unity Council on May 10, 2021 in Oakland, California. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom ordered the removal of a homeless camp in Los Angeles on Thursday, demanding more urgency from local partners as he took part in the demolition.\n\nIn a state-owned underpass beneath Interstate 10, Newsom tore down campsites, signaling to Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass -- who championed a less destructive approach to housing individuals -- that he would use the state's power to crack down on the issue.\n\nNewsom also told reporters that he would be \"redirecting money\" away from counties like Los Angeles that took less aggressive stances.\n\n\"We'll send that money to counties that produce results,\" Newsom said, per local KCRA correspondent Ashley Zavala.\n\nThe sweep comes two weeks after an executive order cracking down on so-called \"homeless encampments,\" which line some sidewalks in cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco. The move was heralded by a bipartisan selection of California politicians, who said the time had come.\n\nBut some progressive Californians have blasted Newsom for the order, citing a lack of housing alternatives for unhoused Californians.\n\n\"Gov. Gavin Newsom's plan to displace and dispossess unhoused people, even though the state does not have enough housing, is a cruel tactic that only masks the problem,\" the ACLU of Northern California wrote in a statement on the initial order.\n\nNewsom's actions were enabled by the Supreme Court's June decision to allow municipalities to criminalize homelessness, specifically its overturning of a doctrine banning a sweep unless unhoused individuals were provided sufficient shelter bed space.\n\nIn a phone call with the New York Times, Bass said she hadn't spoken to the governor, but that she was not necessarily critical of the sweep today, adding that she'd have joined him if she weren't in Paris preparing for Los Angeles' 2028 Olympic Games.\n\n\"I know he's frustrated with a lot of cities that do not address the problem, but Los Angeles is one of the cities that does address the problem.

If we don't deal with this, we don't deserve to be in office,\" Mr. Newsom said, tearing into a rancid, garbage-strewn campsite on state property under Interstate 10 in Los Angeles, alongside a crew of state workers with orange vests.\n\nYou hit the nail on the head, Newsom. You didn't do anything about it for years, and you don't deserve to be in office. He terms out in '26, so he won't be governor, but we know he has his sights set on higher office, which should scare us all.\n\nThis video depicts the complete lack of authenticity shown so expertly by Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris recently on the campaign trail:\n\nSo, after all these years of helping bring on this problem, he's now suddenly issued an executive order and shown up in his \"I'm such a regular guy\" tight T-shirt? That should fix everything:\n\nHe's particularly annoyed with leaders in LA, who aren't jumping aboard with his newfound passion and are resisting his sudden awakening:\n\nSince July 25, when the governor urged California cities to dismantle the street camps that have come to define the state's homelessness crisis, leaders in Los Angeles have been particularly resistant to Mr. Newsom, making clear that they plan to deal with the issue in their own way and on their own timetable...\n\nHis mission, he said, was part public service, part political flex. The governor said that he particularly wanted more \"urgency\" from the leaders of Los Angeles County, home to nearly 10 million Californians, where unsheltered homelessness decreased last year at about half the rate as it did in the City of Los Angeles, its largest jurisdiction.\n\n\"We need partners, not sparring partners,\" Mr. Newsom said. \"If we can't move Los Angeles County, we're not going to move the state.\"\n\nThese are strong statements that sound good on TV. But the same guy who made them recently vetoed a bill that would have required that authorities actually keep track of the hundreds of millions of dollars they've thrown at the situation (with little to nothing to show for it).\n\nRead RedState's Jennifer O'Connell's excellent reporting on that ridiculousness.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_10", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interstate 10"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/319/e400f28e-6de3-420e-ae51-cd1086c272c5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803079", "eventUri": "eng-9803079", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 1078, "textEnd": 1085}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

County kind of pushing back on what you're saying?\" asked Michaelson.\n\n\"Yeah, I mean, cities, I've been pretty impressed. Counties? No, counties mean -- you know, it's a diffuse nature of leadership in a county. You have multiple members of boards of supervisors. Mayor, there's one person accountable. Mayor Bass has done a wonderful job. She's been a great partner. You're seeing that down 10.4%, over 10% decline in unsheltered homeless population last year,\" Newsom replied, adding:\n\nSo that's progress. But I'm not seeing that at the county level. And with all due respect, there's no more excuses. Everything the cities and counties have asked for. The state of California is delivered and the Supreme Court just delivered. So there's no more excuses! So where's the urgency?\n\nDrop everything else, get out there and address the number one, two and three issue in this state with an intensity of purpose. That's the kind of action I want to see. And again, for me, if we don't see, it's not complicated. We're not going to continue to make the investments in communities that aren't willing to do their part. I will redirect those dollars to counties and cities that are doing their part. And so that's clear.\n\n\"What does that look like exactly? L.A. County, the biggest county in the state. One out of four people live in L.A. County, and a lot of county leaders are pushing back on this. So what does that mean for this place?\" followed up Michaelson.\n\n\"Well, I mean, L.A. County can right now move forward with our conservatorship law. They refuse to do it. L.A. County right now could significant increase the number of people getting support under the care court, unprecedented support into the county, billions and billions of dollars over the last few years. And yet we're seeing the same excuses I've seen for decades. And again, it's not an indictment. These are my I say this sincerely, like, this is not a fake political thing. Actually, my friends, this is not an indictment of them. It's an institutional construct where people are acting is like they're victims and they've been using every excuse in the toolkit.

GUESS WHICH BILLS WON'T SURVIVE, WIN PRIZES -- It's almost that time of year again, when California lawmakers run through hundreds of bills in quick succession and announce which will (and won't) advance from the Appropriations committees to the floor. Now's your chance to make predictions and compete against your fellow politicos -- and the Playbook authors -- to guess which bills won't survive the dreaded \"suspense file.\"\n\nThose with the most accurate guesses will receive a shout-out in California Playbook and some extra special swag. Remember to leave your name and email with your prediction so we can contact you if you win.\n\nTHE BUZZ: IF YOU BUILD IT, THEY WILL STAY -- California is leaning into the AI boom, today announcing a partnership with semiconductor giant Nvidia to ramp up training for the state's workers, educators and students.\n\nThe agreement, scooped by your Playbook anchor this morning, is the first of its kind in the nation -- part of Gov. Gavin Newsom's broader push for the state to embrace artificial intelligence and maintain California's reputation as a hub of tech innovation. But it also comes amid a federal investigation into Nvidia on antitrust grounds over its acquisition of an Israeli AI startup.\n\nLast year, Newsom issued an executive order to study how the state can use AI while also mitigating its potential risks -- a critical balancing act as Silicon Valley looks to forge ahead with development while some tech-cautious groups are pressing lawmakers to help pump the brakes.\n\nNewsom, a longtime innovation evangelist, has not yet weighed in on a controversial bill in the state legislature that would require safety testing for the largest AI models, a proposal that as we've reported this week has now received national attention and has tech scions worrying it will squelch the burgeoning industry in its infancy.\n\nIn his State of the State address in June, Newsom touted Nvidia by name, praising the company for nurturing a startup ecosystem and calling AI \"the fourth industrial revolution.\" His memorandum of understanding with the company -- which plays an essential role in the advancement of AI through its chips -- is the clearest signal yet on the governor's thinking.\n\nThe agreement also bolsters California's tech bona fides at a time when some high-profile tech companies and figures -- most frequently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk -- are threatening to leave the state. Amy Tong, secretary of government operations for the state, said the Nvidia pact helps sustain California's dominance in the tech sector.\n\n\"Anything that shows that California is invested in the workforce, it's a good message to the employers to think about, where do you find talent,\" she said.\n\nThe MOU aims to both shore up the workforce in California dedicated to AI as well as train educators on how to apply the technology across different disciplines, from health care to agriculture. Through the agreement, Nvidia will work with the state and its community colleges to craft curriculum, design AI laboratories and workshops, and promote the use of AI across the state.\n\nThe rapid acceleration of AI has created a skills gap in the workforce, said Louis Stewart, head of strategic initiatives for the developer ecosystem at Nvidia. In addition to California, the company is considering similar workforce-development initiatives in other states.\n\n\"Absolutely there's folks that are feeling a little left behind,\" Stewart said. \"And we've got to make sure that everybody feels like they can participate in what's next.\"\n\nThere could be more coming down the pike in California, too. The Newsom administration said it will aim to launch similar initiatives with the University of California and California State University systems, and that there could be additional partnerships with other tech companies in the future.\n\nSHOW ME THE RECEIPTS -- Newsom hit the throttle on his pressure campaign for local governments to address homeless encampments on Thursday, issuing his most direct threat so far that he'll cut off money to counties he believes are too sluggish in getting people off the street, Melanie Mason reports.\n\nThough counties writ large were the target of his broadside, Newsom's ire was not-so-subtly aimed at one in particular: Los Angeles. The city has become the epicenter of the state's homelessness crisis and its Board of Supervisors gave an ice-cold reception to Newsom's recent executive order, which aimed to spur cities and counties to more aggressively clean up encampments.\n\n\"If we don't see demonstrable results, I'll start to redirect money,\" Newsom told reporters assembled at the site of a recently cleared encampment on state-owned land in the San Fernando Valley, adding, \"I'll be candid with you. This is more broadly an indictment of counties ... counties need to do more.\"\n\nHe continued: \"We're here with our hands out. Open hands, not a closed fist. That said, if we don't see results, we're going to change our approach.\"\n\nHis comments mark the latest escalation of his assertive tone on homeless encampments in California, prompted by the recent Supreme Court ruling that freed local governments to enforce anti-camping laws, including through fines, citations or jail time. The decision has increased the political pressure on all of the state's officials, from Newsom on down, to address what he called \"the biggest scar on the reputation of the state of California.\"\n\n\"We're done with excuses. And the last big excuse was 'well, the courts are saying we can't do it.' Well, that's no longer the case,\" Newsom said. \"So we had a simple executive order. Do your job. No more excuses.\"\n\nSWITCHING SIDES -- State Sen. Marie Alvarado-Gil blasted the Democratic Party as \"unrecognizable\" as she confirmed her switch to become a Republican, which our own Jeremy B. White had scooped on Thursday.\n\nAlvarado-Gil, who represents parts of the Central Valley and eastern portions of the state, said Democrats' control in Sacramento is not working for the state.\n\n\"I cannot stand by a party that ignores the will of the people and disregards the core American values that my very community supports and believes in,\" she said in a joint statement with Senate Republican Leader Brian Jones and California Republican Party Chair Jessica Millan Patterson.\n\nSenate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire said in a statement that the move was \"disappointing for voters who elected Senator Alvarado-Gil as a Democrat.\"\n\n\"They trusted her to represent them, and she's betrayed that trust,\" McGuire said, but added: \"One silver lining is MAGA Republicans are gaining a pro-choice, pro-LGBTQ+ rights, anti-Trump colleague.\"\n\nAlvarado-Gil flipped her rural, Republican-plurality district in 2022 after she and another Democrat advanced to the general election, dealing a stunning blow to an already diminished Republican caucus. Then-Republican leader Scott Wilk spent money to boost the other Democratic candidate in a failed bid to prevent a Republican lockout.\n\nICYMI -- After months of negotiations and failed proposals, state lawmakers on Thursday advanced a slate of retail-theft proposals. Our Lindsey Holden had the full recap in yesterday's Playbook PM and tells us what comes next.\n\nSPARKS FLY -- Newsom and state Sen. Scott Wiener want to rebrand wildfire hazard maps to make them less scary, but some environmental groups and local officials are fighting back. Read more in yesterday's California Climate.\n\nALISO CANYON -- Environmental groups are renewing their calls for Newsom to shut down the Aliso Canyon gas storage facility, pressuring the governor to commit to a deadline ahead of a Sept. 26 meeting of the California Public Utilities Commission.\n\nThe latest push, led by Food & Water Watch and Progressive Democrats of America, includes a letter from more than 150 organizations who say that nearly a decade after the devastating gas blowout, the facility continues to be a looming threat.\n\nSENTENCED: A 73-year-old Florida man arrested in January for threatening to kill California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell and his children has been sentenced to two years in prison, NBC News reports. The man, Michael Shapiro, called the incident a \"single drunken episode\" in court documents.\n\nEARTHQUAKE UPDATE: Southern California has seen more than 400 aftershock tremors in the wake of a magnitude-5.2 eqrthquake near Bakersfield, KCAL reports. Geologists said it was a \"pretty active sequence,\" though risk of further aftershocks is expected to drop in the coming days.\n\n-- Democrats are hoping Kamala Harris' so-called \"brat summer\" will energize young voters and give them an edge in competitive California House races. (CalMattters)\n\n-- FBI agents on Thursday raided a towing agency in San Francisco amid money laundering allegations. (San Francisco Chronicle)\n\nBertolina Faust has been working from the campaign's Delaware headquarters since shortly after Harris took over as the Democratic nominee. She worked on previous Harris campaigns and was the campaign manager for Sen. Alex Padilla.\n\nBertolina Faust has strong connections with many of the nation's biggest donors and is helping channel the huge gusher of money coming into the Harris campaign. Her new role and title on the campaign were first reported by NBC News.\n\nWANT A SHOUT-OUT FEATURED? -- Send us a birthday, career move or another special occasion to include in POLITICO's California Playbook.

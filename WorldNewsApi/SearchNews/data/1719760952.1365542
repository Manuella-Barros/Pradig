In the Spanish-language musical Emilia P\u00e9rez, Gasc\u00f3n plays cartel leader Manitas who seeks help from Mexico City lawyer Rita (Zoe Salda\u00f1a) to help her flee to Mexico with her wife, Jessi (Selena Gomez), and children to seek gender-affirming surgery. Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n accepted the ensemble cast\u2019s award with a tearful speech, dedicating it to all trans people \u201cwho suffer so much and must keep faith that changing is possible.\u201d On Sunday (26 May) far-right politician Marion Mar\u00e9chal, who is head of the European list for the conservative Reconqu\u00eate party, targeted Gasc\u00f3n on X (Twitter). The post is still up on her account. \u201cIt is therefore a man who receives the prize for\u2026 female interpretation at Cannes. Progress for the left is the erasure of women and mothers,\u201d Mar\u00e9chal wrote. In response, six associations \u2013 Mousse, Stop Homophobie, Familles LGBT, Adheos, Quazar and F\u00e9d\u00e9ration LBGTQ+ \u2013 have filed a legal complaint. \u201cMarion Mar\u00e9chal\u2019s comments deny the very existence of transgender people, as well as the violence and discrimination they suffer on a daily basis,\u201d said Etienne Deshouli\u00e8res, the lawyer for the six associations. The Stop Homophobie association noted that \u201cthis illegal behaviour reinforces the climate of violence in which LGBT+ people live in France\u201d. Making a public statement on the matter, Stop Homophobie association stated: \u201cWe are filing a complaint against Marion Mar\u00e9chal Le Pen for having violated republican laws by promoting hatred and discrimination.\u201d They continued: \u201cMarion Mar\u00e9chal Le Pen\u2019s speeches are heard by those who take action. \u201cSince 2016, violence against LGBT+ people has exploded by more than 129%, with the largest increase affecting transgender people. We are more determined than ever to protect them.\u201d In an interview after the legal complaint had been filed, Mar\u00e9chal Le Pen responded on Tuesday (28 May) by stating she would \u201cnot be prevented from continuing to say what is the truth. \u201cBeing a woman or a man is a biological reality, whether you like it or not. The XX or XY chromosomes cannot be surpassed.\u201d The 34-year-old politician \u2013 the granddaughter of Front National founder Jean-Marie Le Pen and the niece of the far-right party\u2019s current leader Marine Le Pe \u2013 has previously stated she supports the \u201cdefence of the family.\u201d In 2013, she took part in a demonstration against same-sex marriage. In 2017, she doubled down and said she \u201cguaranteed\u201d that same-sex marriage would be repealed if she won the Presidential election. In 2018, she lashed out at gay families and vowed to \u201ctake our country back\u201d at a US conservative conference. Mar\u00e9chal Le Pen is currently on the campaign trail for the European Parliament elections in June as head of Reconqu\u00eate. Reconqu\u00eate was founded by former failed presidential candidate Eric Zemmour, who has been found guilty and charged with homophobia in 2023.", "summary": "<p>Six LGBTQ+ organisations have filed a legal complaint against far-right French politician Marion Mar\u00e9chal Le Pen after a \u201ctransphobic insult.\u201d Mar\u00e9chal\u2019s comment was aimed at Emilia P\u00e9rez star\u00a0Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, 52, the first trans actress to win Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival.

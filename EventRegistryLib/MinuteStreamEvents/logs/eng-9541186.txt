And if we need to stand alone, we will stand alone,\" he said.\n\nPresident Biden is desperate to end the Israel-Hamas war, starting with the cease-fire the Administration has been trying to broker. Hamas has refused so far, and now the Administration is squeezing Israel even harder to abandon its plan to take Hamas's last Gaza stronghold in the city of Rafah.\n\nThat's the meaning of the Axios report on Sunday that the U.S. put a hold last week on a shipment of U.S.-made weapons to Israel. The dispatch by reporter Barak Ravid cites two Israeli sources, adding that the White House and other parts of the U.S. government declined to comment. The fact that the U.S. didn't deny the report is telling. The Israelis view Mr. Ravid as the Biden Administration's preferred media conduit for its leaks about U.S. policy on the Israel and Gaza conflict.\n\nThe news arrives as the U.S. is working with Qatar and Egypt to persuade Hamas to agree to the latest offer of a cease-fire in exchange for releasing some hostages. CIA director William Burns was in Cairo on the weekend to meet with Arab negotiators. We're told that Hamas hasn't budged on its negotiating demands, which include a permanent end to the war, not merely a cease-fire.\n\nPerhaps the weapons delay was intended as a message to Hamas that the U.S. is willing to arm-twist Israel to stop the Rafah campaign. But that's the diplomatic logic that has kept the war going as long as it has since Oct. 7. Israel's government can't end the war with Hamas's military brigades intact, and that means going into Rafah, as difficult as it may be.\n\nThe U.S. should be putting pressure on Hamas to surrender and release the hostages. The more Hamas thinks it might be saved by U.S. pressure on Israel, the less likely Hamas is to agree to a cease-fire. That's a recipe for extending the war for several more weeks, or longer.\n\nMr. Biden's strategy of pressuring Israel to make concessions that its government and citizens are united against hasn't worked. It hasn't won concessions from Hamas and its allies in Iran and Lebanon. And it hasn't tamed the anti-Israel protests in the U.S. that threaten his re-election.\n\nMr. Biden was in a stronger position, politically and strategically, when he spoke with moral clarity about Hamas and in support of Israel after Oct. 7. The fastest way to end the war is with an Israeli victory, and withholding weapons is exactly the wrong message to send an ally under siege.\n\nContinue.....", "source": {"uri": "gellerreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Geller Report News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_War_(2008\u20132009)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza War (2008\u20132009)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gallant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yoav Gallant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_General_Staff_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief of the General Staff (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Herzog", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Herzog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

From Rafah", "body": "Several people were reported injured after Hamas fired a barrage of rockets and mortars at a humanitarian border crossing between Israel and Gaza. Hamas rockets landed near Kerem Shalom border crossing, the main entry point for aid into Gaza.\n\nHamas fired rockets close to civilian shelters, aimed a maximizing casualties in case an Israeli response. \"The launches carried out by Hamas adjacent to the Rafah Crossing, located approximately 350 meters from civilian shelters, are a clear example of the terrorist organization's systematic exploitation of humanitarian facilities and spaces, and their continued use of the Gazan civilian population as human shields,\" the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in press release Sunday afternoon.\n\nHamas proudly took responsibility for attacking the humanitarian border crossing. Israel was forced to close the passage of aid trucks following the strikes, the IDF confirmed.\n\nThe rockets were fired from the terrorist stronghold of Rafah, an area Israeli military plans to evacuate in case of a possible military operation to free the remaining hostages. In recent days, Hamas terrorists have repeatedly used Rafah's civilian areas to fire rockets towards Israel.\n\nAt least 10 people were hurt in a barrage of some 14 rockets and mortars was fired at Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza from the Rafah area on Sunday, in what is considered an unusual incident that comes after months of fighting in the Gaza Strip. Hamas immediately claimed responsibility for the strike.\n\nChoppers and fighter planes were rushed to the area of the attack to assist in extracting the injured and to attack toward the region from which the rockets were fired.\n\nThe rocket barrage comes days after the Biden administration reportedly 'guaranteed' Hamas that Israel will not enter Rafah and end all military operations if the terrorist group agrees to the latest hostages-for-terrorists deal.\n\nThe Israeli government rejected the Biden administration's unilateral guarantee to abandon the military mission to capture Rafah, where Hamas's terrorist leaderships is hiding behind Israeli hostages serving as human shields.\n\nAccording to a U.S. intelligence sources, Hamas's Gaza-basted chief Yahya \"Sinwar has approximately 15 to 20 hostages surrounding him and his family in Gaza,\" the Israeli TV channel i24NEWS reported this week.\n\nReport: Biden Admin halted arms shipment to Israel as a pressure tactic against Rafah invasion\n\nThe Biden administration last week halted an ammunition shipment to Israel in a bid to pressure the IDF into abandoning the planned operation in Rafah, Israeli journalist Barak Ravid reported in the new website Axios Sunday.\n\nThe revelation comes as Israel's military offensive against Hamas enters its seventh month. Israel, a key U.S. ally, relies of American-made weapons, ammunition and spare parts for its armed forces.\n\nIn recent months, the Biden White House has been threatening to cut shipment of arms and ammunition if Jerusalem did not comply with its demands, including plans to eliminate Hamas leadership cornered in Rafah. According to the The New York Sun on March 18, Washington was \"considering leaving Israel short of the armaments it needs to fight Hamas.\"\n\nThe Axios reported:\n\nThe Biden administration last week put a hold on a shipment of U.S.-made ammunition to Israel, two Israeli officials told Axios.(...)\n\nThe incident raised serious concerns inside the Israeli government and sent officials scrambling to understand why the shipment was held, Israeli officials said.\n\nPresident Biden is facing sharp criticism among Americans who oppose his support of Israel. The administration in February asked Israel to provide assurances that U.S.-made weapons were being used by Israel Defense Forces in Gaza in accordance with international law. Israel provided a signed letter of assurances in March.\n\nThe Israeli officials said the ammunition shipment to Israel was stopped last week. (...)\n\nThe White House declined to comment. (...) The Pentagon, the State Department and the Israeli Prime Minister's Office didn't immediately respond to questions.\n\nNetanyahu vows to fight in Gaza 'until all goals achieved'\n\nDespite Israel's diplomatic efforts to bring back as many hostages as possible though a ceasefire deal with Hamas, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assured the country on Sunday that the military \"will continue to fight until all its goals are achieved.\"\n\nIsrael was willing to release convicted terrorists and allow a 40-day truce in return for the hostages, but the country will complete the military operation in Gaza launched after October 7 massacre to free the hostages and wipe out Hamas in the terrorist-infested enclave.\n\nInability to completely destroy Hamas's leadership and its terrorist fighting force in Gaza, as suggested by the Biden administration, \"would be a huge victory for Hamas, for Iran, for the entire axis of evil,\" he explained.\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu released a video statement addressing reports surrounding the ceasefire deal that's being mediated in Cairo, saying that the Israeli negotiators received a broad mandate in order to secure the release of the remaining 132 hostages, including agreeing to a pause in fighting.\n\nNetanyahu says that while Israel has proven \"extraordinarily generous\" as the U.S. Secretary of State put it, he blamed Hamas for remaining entrenched in its positions including the demand of a full IDF withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and complete cessation in fighting.\n\n\"The State of Israel cannot accept this,\" Netanyahu said, saying that it would allow Hamas to retake control of Gaza and rebuild its forces, and making the next massacre only a matter of time. \"Is this why our heroes fell? Is this what we paid an unbearably heavy price for? The answer is: no! Surrendering to Hamas's demands would be a terrible defeat for the State of Israel. It would be a huge victory for Hamas, for Iran, for the entire axis of evil. It would project a terrible weakness - both to our friends and to our enemies.\"\n\n\"And this weakness will only bring the next war closer, and it will push the next peace agreement further away. Because alliances are not made with the weak and defeated, alliances are made with the strong and victorious.\"\n\n\"Therefore, Israel will not agree to Hamas's demands, which mean surrender, and will continue to fight until all its goals are achieved.\"\n\nAfter months of pro-Hamas coverage since the October 7 attacks, Prime Minister Netanyahu's government has finally told the Qatari state-run Al Jazeera to shut down operations in Israel. Israel's cabinet unanimously voted to kick out the pro-Hamas broadcaster after months of deliberations.\n\nBesides, taking Al Jazeera channels off the Israeli air and closing down offices, the cabinet decision also ordered the \"confiscation of the network's broadcasting equipment,\" the i24NEWS reported Sunday.\n\nFollowing the cabinet vote, Israeli police raided the Jerusalem office of the pro-Hamas broadcaster. \"In a move following the Israeli Cabinet's unanimous vote to close Al Jazeera in Israel, police conducted a raid on the Qatari organization's offices located at Jerusalem's Ambassador Hotel on Sunday afternoon,\" the Israeli TV channel added.\n\nThe Qatari broadcaster's reporting has been harming country's national security, the Israeli government said. \"Al Jazeera's journalists have harmed Israeli security and incited against IDF soldiers,\" Prime Minister Netanyahu said in a press statement following the decision.\n\nAl Jazeera has a long history of siding with Hamas and Palestinian terrorists. In 2014, Processor William A. Jacobson reported how 'Hamas supporters lifted Al Jazeera reporter in air in celebration' following an armed conflict with Israel, initiated by relentless rocket fire into Israel. Hamas-sympathisers in Gaza credited Al Jazeera with bringing about a ceasefire through its biased news reporting to influence gullible international public opinion, something the broadcaster again displayed in the wake of the October 7 massacre.\n\nThe Jerusalem Post reported:\n\nIsrael's cabinet on Sunday unanimously voted to shut down the Qatari news outlet Al Jazeera's operations in Israel, nearly six months after first announcing its intentions to do so due to security concerns related to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIsrael's National Security Cabinet was scheduled to hold the vote on Thursday, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delayed it due to concern that the vote would not pass. According to a spokesperson for Minister-without-portfolio MK Benny Gantz's National Unity party, this was because Mossad chief David Barnea requested that the government delay it for a few days, to avoid possible negative diplomatic ramifications relating to Qatar, a mediator between Israel and Hamas in negotiations for a deal to free Israeli hostages.\n\nThe decision required approval from either the government's National Security Cabinet (NSC) or the general cabinet, and Netanyahu chose to move forwards on Sunday in the general cabinet despite Barnea's request.\n\nIDF eliminates Islamic Jihad terror commander who participated in Oct. 7 atrocities\n\nAn Israeli airstrike on Saturday eliminates Ayman Zaarab, a Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) commander who took part in the October 7 massacre, the IDF confirmed.\n\nBesides Hamas, the PIJ terrorists had an active role in mass-killing, rape and kidnapping of innocent Israelis. Ahead of the attack, hundreds of Hamas and PIJ jihadists went to Iran and received specialized terrorist training from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the Wall Street Journal revealed October 25.\n\nThe Times of Israel reported the precision airstrike in Gaza:\n\nA senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad commander who led the terror group's elite forces into Israel during the October 7 massacre was killed in an Israeli airstrike Saturday, defense officials said.\n\nIman Zareb, a senior figure in the Iran-backed group's Rafah Brigade, was killed along with two other Islamic Jihad fighters in an Israeli bombardment on a \"hideout apartment\" in Rafah, the Israel Defense Forces and Shin Bet Security Service said in a joint statement.\n\nAccording to Israel, Zareb had been leading efforts in recent days to prepare Islamic Jihad fighters to confront Israeli forces once they launch an expected push into the southern Gaza city of Rafah, considered to be the Hamas terror group's last major redoubt.\n\nIsraeli security forces also continued counter-terrorism raid in the West Bank, killing more Hamas terrorists.

according to a report.\n\nTwo Israeli officials told Axios that the weapons shipment was stopped last week, leaving officials within the Israeli government scrambling to understand why.\n\nWhen asked about the report, a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council told Fox News Digital that it has supported Israel's defense since the Oct. 7 attack.\n\n\"The United States has surged billions of dollars in security assistance to Israel since the October 7 attacks, passed the largest ever supplemental appropriation for emergency assistance to Israel, led an unprecedented coalition to defend Israel against Iranian attacks, and will continue to do what is necessary to ensure Israel can defend itself from the threats it faces,\" the statement said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to carry out a military operation in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza where some 1.5 million Palestinians have taken shelter, and where Hamas maintains its last remaining stronghold.\n\nThe potential Rafah operation to root out Hamas terrorists comes despite warnings from President Biden and other Western officials that doing so would result in more civilian deaths and worsen an already dire humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe Biden administration has said there could be consequences for Israel should it move forward with the operation without a credible plan to safeguard civilians.\n\nBiden has also faced criticism from Americans who are against his support of Israel, most recently seen in protests that have erupted across college campuses nationwide.\n\nThe current war in Gaza began after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, in which the terrorist organization killed 1,200 people, and took about 250 people hostage.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType":

Biden Admin Reportedly Halted Arms Shipment To Israel", "body": "The Biden administration has halted a shipment of U.S.-made ammunition to Israel, Axios reported on Sunday, citing two officials in Yerushalayim.\n\nAccording to the U.S. news outlet, last week's decision to place the shipment on hold left the Israeli government concerned, as it is the first time since Hamas's Oct. 7 massacre that the U.S. has halted military aid to the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nThe White House reportedly declined to comment, while the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. State Department and the Israeli Prime Minister's Office didn't immediately respond to questions from Axios.\n\nAn unnamed Israeli official downplayed the report, telling the Israeli news website Ynet that \"the flow continues\" and Israel was \"not aware of a policy decision to stop it.\"\n\n\"Even now, a continued series of defense shipments are being sent from the U.S. to Israel,\" the official stated, while acknowledging that \"one shipment or another may be delayed.\"\n\nIn March, a senior Israeli official told ABC News that Washington had begun slow-walking military aid. According to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, shipments at the beginning of the war were coming \"very fast,\" but Jerusalem is \"now finding that it's very slow.\"\n\nThe official said he was not sure what the cause was, but that Jerusalem was aware of President Joe Biden's frustration with the conflict and his demand that Israel do more to provide humanitarian supplies to Gaza.\n\nThe reports of delays in U.S. arms shipments come as the Israel Defense Forces are making final preparations for a ground operation in Rafah, the last Hamas stronghold located in the southern part of the Strip.\n\nMany of the 132 hostages still in the hands of Hamas more than 200 days after the Oct. 7 massacre are believed to be held in Rafah. Israeli special forces rescued two captives from the city earlier this year.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Sunday that Israel is seeing \"worrying signs\" that Hamas has no intention of agreeing to any hostages-for-ceasefire-and-terrorists-release deal and the IDF is edging closer to military action \"in Rafah and the entire Strip in the near future.\"\n\nDuring a Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem on Sunday, Gallant said the IDF offensive in Rafah, where the remaining four Hamas terrorist battalions are located, is expected to take place \"very soon.\"\n\nBiden has repeatedly told Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu that he would not support a major offensive against the terrorist group in Rafah. Instead, the White House favors a limited operation aimed at attacking high-value Hamas targets and securing the Gaza-Egypt border.\n\nBiden would consider limiting \"certain arms sales\" if Israel launches a major assault in the city, The New York Times reported late last month.\n\nAt least 10 people were wounded, one seriously, on Sunday afternoon when Hamas terrorists in Rafah fired 14 rockets and mortars toward Kibbutz Kerem Shalom in southern Israel. Several rockets exploded near an IDF military facility, causing the casualties.

According to two Israeli officials who spoke to Axios, the ammunition shipment was stopped last week.\n\nThe White House has yet to officially comment on the decision.\n\nIn April, Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic representatives issued a signed letter that called on Biden to halt the sale of weapons to Israel, even as they encourage munitions to be sent to Ukraine. The lawmakers called it \"unjustifiable\" to approve weapons transfers to Israel after an Israeli airstrike that inadvertently killed several humanitarian workers\n\nThis recent move comes amidst growing criticism within President Biden's own base regarding US support for Israel. As left-wing activists across the country have continually called for the US to withdraw its support from Israel, the Biden administration has appeared to soften its initial support for the Jewish state.\n\nThe timing of this decision also follows US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Israel last Wednesday. During his visit, Blinken held discussions with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about potential military operations in Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu has recently signaled Israel's intention to launch an invasion of Rafah, a city in southern Gaza where there is a checkpoint between Gaza and Egypt that Egypt keep strictly controlled to prevent the flow of Palestinians into their nation. There have been ongoing efforts to negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas and secure the release of hostages, though Hamas has refused many of these attempts.\n\nBlinken reportedly cautioned Netanyahu against a continued intensive in Rafah, warning that it could strain US-Israel relations and that the US would be forced to publicly disavow the decision.\n\nNetanyahu, in a statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day on Sunday, seemed to hint at disappointment with what he perceives as a weakening of support for Israel by the Biden administration.\n\n\"In the terrible Holocaust, there were great world leaders who stood by idly; therefore, the first lesson of the Holocaust is: If we do not defend ourselves, nobody will defend us. And if we need to stand alone, we will stand alone,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nLast February, the Biden administration requested assurances from Israel that any US-made weapons would be used in compliance with international law.

MSNBC confirmed the halt on Monday, citing two senior Biden administration officials familiar with the decision.\n\nThe White House, Pentagon and Israeli government did not immediately respond to HuffPost's request for confirmation of Axios' report, while the State Department declined to comment.\n\nSince Israel's current military campaign began seven months ago, Palestinian health officials say soldiers have killed more than 34,000 people, displaced most of the population, destroyed important infrastructure like hospitals and universities, detained and tortured civilians, and created a widespread famine by blocking most humanitarian aid from entering the enclave. Israeli troops and settlers have also been attacking Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, which is not governed by Hamas.\n\nSince Oct. 7, the U.S. has given unconditional support to Israel, sending many of the weapons that soldiers end up using to bomb Gaza. President Joe Biden started a trend of warning Israel about its behavior in Gaza while imposing no consequences on the country for ignoring said warning -- making this reported hold in weapons shipment a significant elevation in tensions between Biden and Netanyahu.\n\nBiden has faced strong opposition both domestically and globally for continuing to support Israel, even as the country stands accused before the International Court of Justice of committing genocide against Palestinians, an allegation it vehemently denies. Students across the U.S. are currently being met with police brutality for campus protests against Israel's offensive and the Biden administration's role in it -- demonstrations the U.S. has not seen since the Vietnam War -- while a growing number of lawmakers are calling for the U.S. to condition its billions in military aid to Israel.\n\nAfter more than a dozen senators demanded assurances that all countries receiving U.S. weapons comply with international and U.S. law prohibiting violence against civilians and attempts to block humanitarian aid, Biden issued a policy in February that requires federal agencies to report to Congress by May 8 on whether they believe Israel is violating those laws.\n\nNetanyahu has repeatedly made it clear that the Israeli military will move forward with its plan to launch a ground offensive on Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city where more than a million Palestinians are currently taking refuge. Soldiers have already been raining bombs on Rafah for weeks, but the prime minister said in recent days that Israel will invade the city regardless of whether his government reaches a deal with Hamas for the release of hostages and a temporary cease-fire.\n\nThe U.S. and the international community have vocally opposed a Rafah invasion due to the high civilian casualties that would result from the siege, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken telling Netanyahu last week that a \"major military operation\" in Rafah would negatively impact U.S.-Israel relations and U.S. policy toward the offensive in Gaza.\n\n\"In the terrible Holocaust, there were great world leaders who stood by idly,\" Netanyahu said on Sunday to commemorate Holocaust Remembrance Day. \"Therefore, the first lesson of the Holocaust is: If we do not defend ourselves, nobody will defend us. And if we need to stand alone, we will stand alone.\"", "source": {"uri": "huffpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HuffPost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But Axios believes that this comes as the Biden administration is very concerned about Israel's intentions to invade the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, where more than 1 million displaced Palestinians have taken refuge.\n\nIn addition, in recent days, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made several statements that he intends to order an invasion of Rafah regardless of whether Israel and Hamas reach an agreement on the release of hostages in Gaza and a ceasefire.\n\nUS Secretary of State Anthony Blinken visited Israel last Wednesday. He had a \"tough\" conversation with Netanyahu about a possible Israeli operation in Rafah, two people briefed on the meeting told reporters.\n\nBlinken told Netanyahu that a \"major military operation\" in Rafah would lead to a public outcry against it by the United States and would negatively affect US-Israeli relations.\n\nA day later, White House spokesman John Kirby told reporters that Israeli leaders understand that Biden is \"sincere\" when he talks about the possibility of changes in US policy on the war in Gaza \"if they continue some kind of ground operation in Rafah without taking refugees into account.\"\n\nEarlier, Netanyahu said that Israel would enter the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, regardless of the ceasefire negotiations. To achieve a complete victory, the IDF must eliminate Hamas battalions there.\n\n- Turkey has suspended all trade relations with Israel because of the conflict in the Gaza Strip. Ankara demands that the international community be allowed to provide humanitarian aid to the Palestinian enclave.\n\n- In April 2024, the head of Israel's military intelligence, Aaron Haliva, resigned.

IDF's retaliatory attack killed 19 Palestinians in Rafah.\n\nThe IDF ordered evacuations in the southern Gaza city on Monday morning, according to the Associated Press, which it notes could mean 'a long-promised ground invasion there could be imminent.'\n\nThe attack from Hamas overnight is now being used as proof that the terror group is using Palestinians as 'human shields' to try and deflect retaliatory attacks and attempt to gain global support for a cease-fire due to loss of innocent life in Gaza.\n\nPresident Biden has faced an onslaught of criticism from Americans who oppose support for Israel in its war with Hamas terrorists operating out of the Palestinian enclave of Gaza.\n\nIsrael provided a signed letter to the Biden administration in March that assured any U.S.-made weapons were used in accordance with international law when employed in the conflict in the Middle East.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day on Sunday hinting at rising tensions between the government in Jerusalem and the Biden administration.\n\n'In the terrible Holocaust, there were great world leaders who stood by idly; therefore, the first lesson of the Holocaust is: If we do not defend ourselves, nobody will defend us. And if we need to stand alone, we will stand alone,' the PM said.\n\nAttacks on Sunday from Hamas prove that the terrorist group is using Palestinians as 'human shields' in the war with Israel\n\nThere are concerns that Israel plans to invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than one million Palestinians are sheltered - and Netanyahu has released several statements confirming intentions to invade.\n\nThe escalation of tensions with the attacks overnight only increase the chances that a Rafah invasion in imminent.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken visited Israel last Wednesday and had a 'tough' conversation with Netanyahu regarding the fallout if Israel engages in a ground operation in Rafah, according to two sources briefed on the meeting.", "source":

The report said that concerned Israeli officials have been scrambling to find out why the delivery has been put on hold.\n\nThe New Arab has contacted the US State Department for a response.\n\nIsrael's seven-month long war on Gaza seemed likely to escalate on Monday as the Israeli military ordered Palestinians to move from shelters in eastern Rafah to a so-called expanded \"humanitarian zone\" along the beach area of Al-Mawasi in advance of a highly anticipated ground incursion.\n\nThe White House has repeatedly expressed its opposition to \"a major military operation\" in Rafah. Last week. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken following a visit to the region said he had not yet viewed a \"credible\" plan from Israel regarding an attack on the city.\n\nSome 1.4 million Palestinians have fled from other parts of the Gaza Strip to Rafah as a result of Israel's ferocious and indiscriminate attacks and most are living in dilapidated tents, dependent on aid handouts and at risk of famine and disease.\n\nThe UN and other humanitarian agencies have expressed major concern not only about the dangers of a ground invasion, but also the extreme challenges of evacuating large numbers of people across destitute areas that lack basic supplies.\n\nIsrael had been expecting military support from the US after President Biden signed a huge package in April which saw some $17 billion assigned to Israel for military aid, despite the president facing mounting calls at home and abroad to restrict assistance.\n\nSince Israel was established in 1948, the US has been its largest supplier of military aid, amounting to around $3.3 billion annually. It has enabled Israel to enhance the production and development of weaponry, including recently its Iron Dome missile interceptor.\n\nMore than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed and 78,000 injured since October and Israel has faced repeated accusations that it is committing war crimes and genocide over its indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas and collective punishment of the population.\n\nIsrael has maintained that four Hamas battalions are present in the southern city which borders Egypt, including members of its senior leadership.

The Biden administration opposes an IDF incursion into Rafah which would finish off Hamas.\n\nAccording to the U.S. news outlet, last week's decision to place the shipment on hold left the Israeli government concerned, as it is the first time since Hamas's Oct. 7 massacre that the U.S. has halted military aid to the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nThe White House reportedly declined to comment, while the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. State Department and the Israeli Prime Minister's Office didn't immediately respond to questions from Axios.\n\nAn unnamed Israeli official downplayed the report, telling the Israeli news website Ynet that \"the flow continues\" and Jerusalem was \"not aware of a policy decision to stop it.\"\n\n\"Even now, a continued series of defense shipments are being sent from the U.S. to Israel,\" the official stated, while acknowledging that \"one shipment or another may be delayed.\"\n\nIn March, a senior Israeli official told ABC News that Washington had begun slow-walking military aid. According to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, shipments at the beginning of the war were coming \"very fast,\" but Jerusalem is \"now finding that it's very slow.\"\n\nThe official said he was not sure what the cause was, but that Jerusalem was aware of President Joe Biden's frustration with the conflict and his demand that Israel do more to provide humanitarian supplies to Gaza.\n\nThe reports of delays in U.S. arms shipments come as the Israel Defense Forces are making final preparations for a ground operation in Rafah, the last Hamas stronghold located in the southern part of the Strip.\n\nMany of the 132 hostages still in the hands of Hamas more than 200 days after the Oct. 7 massacre are believed to be held in Rafah. Israeli special forces rescued two captives from the city earlier this year.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Sunday that Jerusalem is seeing \"worrying signs\" that Hamas has no intention of agreeing to any hostages-for-ceasefire-and-terrorists-release deal and the IDF is edging closer to military action \"in Rafah and the entire Strip in the near future.\"\n\nDuring a Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem on Sunday, Gallant said the IDF offensive in Rafah, where the remaining four Hamas terrorist battalions are located, is expected to take place \"very soon.\"\n\nBiden has repeatedly told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would not support a major offensive against the terrorist group in Rafah. Instead, the White House favors a limited operation aimed at attacking high-value Hamas targets and securing the Gaza-Egypt border.\n\nBiden would consider limiting \"certain arms sales\" if Israel launches a major assault in the city, The New York Times reported late last month.\n\nAt least 11 IDF soldiers were wounded, and three were killed on Sunday afternoon when Hamas terrorists in Rafah fired 14 rockets and mortars toward Kibbutz Kerem Shalom in southern Israel. Several rockets exploded near an IDF military facility, causing the casualties.", "source": {"uri": "jewishpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Press - JewishPress.com"}, "authors":

In a speech marking Holocaust Remembrance Day on Sunday, the Israeli leader said that the Jewish state will continue to \"defend\" itself even if its allies abandon it.\n\nThe Israeli government has found itself under increasing international pressure to halt its offensive in Gaza and agree to a ceasefire. The US, the biggest supplier of weapons to Israel, has faced mounting calls from the UN, pro-Palestinian protesters, and human rights organizations to stop sending arms to the country.\n\n\"I say to the leaders of the world, no amount of pressure, no decision by any international forum, will stop Israel from defending itself,\" Netanyahu said during a memorial ceremony in Jerusalem for the six million Jews killed by Nazi Germany during World War II. \"We will fight the monsters of Hamas and destroy them for good. [...] If Israel is forced to stand alone, Israel will stand alone,\" he added.\n\nOn Sunday, Axios reported that Washington had halted a planned shipment of American-made ammunition to West Jerusalem last week. The decision reportedly left the Israeli government \"scrambling to understand\" why the shipment was put on hold.\n\nThe report comes as Israel has been preparing for an invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah, despite objections from the US and UN. West Jerusalem claims the city is the last significant Hamas stronghold. Rafah is currently home to an estimated 1.4 million Palestinians who have fled the northern parts of the enclave.\n\nOn Monday, the Israeli military ordered tens of thousands of people to begin evacuating from parts of the city, signaling that a ground invasion could be imminent. The army warned it was about to use \"extreme force\" in southern Gaza.\n\nThe administration of the US President Joe Biden previously declared that an Israeli invasion of the civilian-crowded city of Rafah would be a \"red line.\"\n\nA group of Democratic members in the US House of Representatives, including former House speaker and Biden ally Nancy Pelosi, called on the president last month to fully halt weapons shipments to Israel.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for the November presidential election, refused last month to rule out withholding military aid to Israel should he return to the White House.\n\nNetanyahu declared war on Hamas after the Palestinian militant group launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages. The death toll from Israel's retaliation in the enclave is approaching 35,000, according to the Palestinian health authorities.", "source": {"uri": "rt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RT"},

Israel signed a letter of its assurances in March.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted several times in recent days that he plans to order the invasion of Rafah, even if Israel and Hamas can reach a deal for a ceasefire and the release of hostages Hamas is still holding in Gaza.\n\nThe prime minister, in a statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day on Sunday, hinted at the tensions with the Biden administration.\n\n\"In the terrible Holocaust, there were great world leaders who stood by idly; therefore, the first lesson of the Holocaust is: If we do not defend ourselves, nobody will defend us. And if we need to stand alone, we will stand alone,\" he commented.\n\nMeanwhile, Netanyahu and Secretary of State Antony Blinken had a \"tough\" conversation in Israel about the planned Rafah operation, sources briefed on the meeting said.\n\nBlinken reportedly told Netanyahu that the United States would publicly oppose a strike on Rafah and that military action in the city would hurt relations between the United States and Israel.\n\nThursday, White House spokesman John Kirby told reporters that Israeli leaders know that Biden is \"sincere\" about changing policy about the war in Gaza if the ground operation \"doesn't take into account the refugees.\"\n\nWhite House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan Saturday reiterated that stance, commenting at a Financial Times conference that the administration has made it clear that U.S. policy will be influenced by how the Rafah operation progresses.\n\nMeanwhile, Netanyahu has said he will not agree to end the war as part of a hostage deal that allows Hamas to remain in power in Gaza.\n\nSandy Fitzgerald \u2709\n\nSandy Fitzgerald has more than three decades in journalism and serves as a general assignment writer

Two Israeli officials told Axios that the suspension of ammo has raised serious concerns in Jerusalem and left the Israeli government scrambling to understand why the latest intended shipment was held up.\n\nBiden halting the shipment of Americans munitionsis the first time the U.S. has not followed-through on sending weapons assistance since Israel was invaded and attacked by Hamas terrorists on October 7, 2023 - launching a now 7-month war in Gaza.\n\nThe White House , Pentagon , State Department and Israeli Prime Minister's office have yet to respond to or comment on the report. Cease-fire talks appeared to have collapsed overnight after a Hamas rocket attack on Sunday killed three Israeli Defense Force soldiers at a checkpoint. IDF's retaliatory attack killed 19 Palestinians in Rafah.\n\nThe IDF ordered evacuations in the southern Gaza city on Monday morning, according to the Associated Press, which it notes could mean 'a long-promised ground invasion there could be imminent.' The attack from Hamas overnight is now being used as proof that the terror group is using Palestinians as 'human shields' to try and deflect retaliatory attacks and attempt to gain global support for a cease-fire due to loss of innocent lives in Gaza.\n\nPresident Biden has faced an onslaught of criticism from Americans who oppose support for Israel in its war with Hamas terrorists operating out of the Palestinian enclave of Gaza. Israel provided a signed letter to the Biden administration in March that assured any U.S.-made weapons were used in accordance with international law when employed in the conflict in the Middle East.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day on Sunday hinting at rising tensions between the government in Jerusalem and the Biden administration.\n\n'In the terrible Holocaust, there were great world leaders who stood by idly; therefore, the first lesson of the Holocaust is: If we do not defend ourselves, nobody will defend us. And if we need to stand alone, we will stand alone,' the PM said.\n\nThere are concerns that Israel plans to invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than one million Palestinians are sheltered - and Netanyahu has released several statements confirming intentions to invade. The escalation of tensions with the attacks overnight only increases the chances that a Rafah invasion is imminent.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken visited Israel last Wednesday and had a 'tough' conversation with Netanyahu regarding the fallout if Israel engages in a ground operation in Rafah, according to two sources briefed on the meeting.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The hold is not connected to a potential Israeli operation in Rafah and doesn't affect other shipments moving forward, the source said.\n\nAsked about the paused shipment, a National Security Council spokesperson cited ongoing security assistance to Israel.\n\n\"The United States has surged billions of dollars in security assistance to Israel since the October 7 attacks, passed the largest ever supplemental appropriation for emergency assistance to Israel, led an unprecedented coalition to defend Israel against Iranian attacks, and will continue to do what is necessary to ensure Israel can defend itself from the threats it faces,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAxios first reported the paused ammunition shipment.\n\nUS officials have maintained that there is no change in policy toward Israel. And last month, Biden signed a foreign aid bill that included $26 billion for the Israel-Hamas conflict -- including $15 billion in Israeli military aid, $9 billion in humanitarian aid for Gaza and $2.4 billion for regional US military operations.\n\nBut US officials remain concerned about a potential Israeli operation in Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have been sheltering.\n\nThe US is currently involved in intensive negotiations over a ceasefire and hostage deal in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nOver the weekend, Israel and Hamas have remained locked in a back and forth over who to blame for stalled ceasefire talks even after the latest round of negotiations in Cairo created some cause for optimism. Both sides blamed the other for extreme views, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu taking issue with Hamas' demand that Israel withdraw from Gaza.\n\nCIA Director Bill Burns, who had been in Cairo for the ceasefire negotiations over the weekend, also went to Doha to meet with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani. He will remain in Doha on Monday, despite previous plans to go to Israel, a source familiar with his meetings told CNN.\n\nBurns has acted as a key interlocutor for the United States in the multiparty talks between Israel, Hamas, Egypt, and Qatar over a release of hostages held in Gaza that would be paired with a temporary ceasefire.\n\nIt's unclear why Burns' stay in Doha was extended or what may have changed. Sources have consistently noted how fluid the negotiations over a Gaza ceasefire are.\n\nThe US has sought to increase the pressure on Hamas to accept what is thought to be the most recent proposal -- which sources previously told CNN would require the group to release as many as 33 hostages kidnapped from Israel in exchange for a pause in hostilities in Gaza -- while also trying to prevent the Israeli military from launching a ground offensive on Rafah.\n\nEven with a deal in place, Netanyahu has said Israel could still enter Rafah as it looks to eliminate the threat from Hamas.\n\nThis story has been updated with new reporting.\n\nCNN's Alex Marquardt, Jack Forrest, Ibrahim Dahman, Tim Lister, Michael Schwartz, Kareem Khadder, Eyad Kourdi, Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Becky Anderson and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Seven months later and with the death toll in Gaza approaching 35,000, US President Joe Biden and his officials have grown increasingly critical of the Israeli PM.\n\nBiden has declared that an Israeli invasion of the civilian-crowded city of Rafah would be a \"red line\" and publicly rebuked Netanyahu for the \"indiscriminate\" bombing of Gaza. The State Department has also sanctioned Israeli settlers in the West Bank, while the US abstained from a UN Security Council vote in March allowing a measure demanding an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas to pass.\n\nDespite the shift in rhetoric, the Biden administration has also kept weapons and ammunition flowing to Israel, reportedly approving more than 100 arms deliveries to the Jewish state since October 7.\n\nThe contents of these packages are generally not revealed to the public unless their value exceeds $250 million, and only two have passed this threshold.

According to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, shipments at the beginning of the war were coming \"very fast,\" but Jerusalem is \"now finding that it's very slow.\"\n\nThe official said he was not sure what the cause was, but that Jerusalem was aware of President Joe Biden's frustration with the conflict and his demand that Israel do more to provide humanitarian supplies to Gaza.\n\nThe reports of delays in U.S. arms shipments come as the Israel Defense Forces are making final preparations for a ground operation in Rafah, the last Hamas stronghold located in the southern part of the Strip.\n\nMany of the 132 hostages still in the hands of Hamas more than 200 days after the Oct. 7 massacre are believed to be held in Rafah. Israeli special forces rescued two captives from the city earlier this year.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said on Sunday that Jerusalem is seeing \"worrying signs\" that Hamas has no intention of agreeing to any hostages-for-ceasefire-and-terrorists-release deal and the IDF is edging closer to military action \"in Rafah and the entire Strip in the near future.\"\n\nDuring a Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem on Sunday, Gallant said the IDF offensive in Rafah, where the remaining four Hamas terrorist battalions are located, is expected to take place \"very soon.\"\n\nBiden has repeatedly told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would not support a major offensive against the terrorist group in Rafah. Instead, the White House favors a limited operation aimed at attacking high-value Hamas targets and securing the Gaza-Egypt border.\n\nBiden would consider limiting \"certain arms sales\" if Israel launches a major assault in the city, The New York Times reported late last month.\n\nAt least 10 people were wounded, one seriously, on Sunday afternoon when Hamas terrorists in Rafah fired 14 rockets and mortars toward Kibbutz Kerem Shalom in southern Israel. Several rockets exploded near an IDF military facility, causing the casualties.", "source": {"uri": "jns.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish News Syndicate"}, "authors": [{"uri":

And last month, Biden signed a foreign aid bill that included $26 billion for the Israel-Hamas conflict -- including $15 billion in Israeli military aid, $9 billion in humanitarian aid for Gaza and $2.4 billion for regional US military operations.\n\nBut US officials remain concerned about a potential Israeli operation in Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians have been sheltering.\n\nThe US is currently involved in intensive negotiations over a ceasefire and hostage deal in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nOver the weekend, Israel and Hamas have remained locked in a back and forth over who to blame for stalled ceasefire talks even after the latest round of negotiations in Cairo created some cause for optimism. Both sides blamed the other for extreme views, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu taking issue with Hamas' demand that Israel withdraw from Gaza.\n\nCIA Director Bill Burns, who had been in Cairo for the ceasefire negotiations over the weekend, also went to Doha to meet with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani. He will remain in Doha on Monday, despite previous plans to go to Israel, a source familiar with his meetings told CNN.\n\nBurns has acted as a key interlocutor for the United States in the multiparty talks between Israel, Hamas, Egypt, and Qatar over a release of hostages held in Gaza that would be paired with a temporary ceasefire.\n\nIt's unclear why Burns' stay in Doha was extended or what may have changed. Sources have consistently noted how fluid the negotiations over a Gaza ceasefire are.\n\nThe US has sought to increase the pressure on Hamas to accept what is thought to be the most recent proposal -- which sources previously told CNN would require the group to release as many as 33 hostages kidnapped from Israel in exchange for a pause in hostilities in Gaza -- while also trying to prevent the Israeli military from launching a ground offensive on Rafah.\n\nEven with a deal in place, Netanyahu has said Israel could still enter Rafah as it looks to eliminate the threat from Hamas.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

In February, the Biden Administration demanded that Israel provide proof that American weaponry was not being used to violate international law, which Israel confirmed with a signed letter in March.\n\nCurrent hostilities revolve around the city of Rafah in southern Gaza, which Israel allegedly plans to invade due to a strong Hamas presence there. But Biden and other world leaders have tried to urge Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to not carry out the invasion, due to Rafah becoming a popular destination for refugees. Nevertheless, Netanyahu has remained strong and has issued several statements declaring his intention to order an invasion imminently.\n\nIn a statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day, Netanyahu hinted at Biden and other world leaders abandoning Israel, thus vowing to take matters into his own hands.\n\n\"In the terrible Holocaust, there were great world leaders who stood by idly,\" Netanyahu's statement read. \"Therefore, the first lesson of the Holocaust is: If we do not defend ourselves, nobody will defend us. And if we need to stand alone, we will stand alone.\"\n\nSeveral high-profile Biden Administration officials have either publicly or privately voiced their opposition to an invasion of Rafah, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Pentagon spokesman John Kirby, and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. Their arguments have primarily focused on the refugee presence there as well as the likelihood that such an invasion would damage already-fragile peace negotiations, which are currently being overseen by Egypt and Qatar.", "source": {"uri": "amgreatness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Greatness"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_lendrum@amgreatness.com", "name": "Eric Lendrum", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://cdn.amgreatness.com/app/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1923332039-e1714165941538.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541186", "eventUri": "eng-9541186", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 428, "textEnd": 439}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

It is somewhat shocking that a man who is almost always wrong, with the worst instincts, stood up to the political pressure to abandon Israel.\n\nBut as his political support on the Left has been dwindling--the College Democrats, a subgroup of the Democrat National Committee, has broken with the president--Biden has decided that his need for every vote this November requires him to give aid and comfort to Hamas.\n\nThe Biden administration last week put a hold on a shipment of U.S.-made ammunition to Israel, two Israeli officials told Axios.\n\nWhy it matters: It is the first time since the Oct. 7 attack that the U.S. has stopped a weapons shipment intended for the Israeli military.\n\nIt's appalling, but hardly more appalling than his successful efforts to delay the Rafah operation. Anybody with the most passing knowledge of war knows that giving your enemy breathing room when they are in disarray is disastrous, just as anybody with an ounce of sense knows that the best way to alleviate civilian suffering is to end the fighting as quickly as possible.\n\nBut Biden cares about neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians; he cares about his crumbling political prospects and nothing else.\n\nAs usual, Biden is reading the room very badly, not just regarding international relations, but also here in America. Most Americans surely have sympathy for the civilians in Gaza--at least the children--but there is still moral clarity in the populace about who is in the right in this war.\n\nSure, we all want to see it and the suffering end as quickly as possible, but the best way to do that is to ensure a quick victory. Delaying the Rafah operation has greatly increased the risk and the suffering.\n\nDriving the news: The Biden administration is highly concerned Israel will invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah where more than one million displaced Palestinians have been taking shelter.\n\nNetanyahu hinted at tensions with the Biden administration in a statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day issued Sunday.\n\nBehind the scenes: Last Wednesday U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Israel and had a \"tough\" conversation with Netanyahu regarding a possible Israeli operation in Rafah, two sources briefed on the meeting said.\n\nI do not, in principle, deny that the US has a right to influence Israeli policies--after all, we are providing some of the weapons they are using--but the administration is using its influence in a manner that makes things dramatically worse. Israel must go into Rafah to root out Hamas for the simple reason that Hamas is bent on killing as many Israelis as they can in any way they can.\n\nHamas is not looking for peace or an end to the war. They are the cause of the civilian casualties, both because they could end them at any moment if they laid down their weapons and released the hostages, but also because they use civilians as human shields. It is they who want civilian casualties, not Israel. And the Biden administration knows this.\n\nBut Biden and his minions are gutless and without a scintilla of morality in their hearts. They fear their left flank.\n\nAnd that is all that matters. Damn the Israelis. Damn the hostages. And damn the Palestinian civilians. Biden is losing an election, and nothing else matters.\n\nAbandoning Israel won't help his electoral prospects, of course. Probably the opposite. But Biden is too stupid to even understand this.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_strom@hotair.com", "name": "David Strom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yom HaShoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/291/13aa24eb-d2e9-44b0-a30c-bda7732ea128.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541186", "eventUri": "eng-9541186", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 832, "textEnd": 838}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

And if we have to stand alone - we will stand alone.\"\n\nThe delay in the arms shipments coincides with escalating tensions over a potential Israeli operation in Rafah, where a significant number of Palestinians have sought refuge since the onset of the conflict, The Jerusalem Post reports.\n\nNetanyahu has reiterated Israel's resolve to act in Rafah, regardless of international agreement, further heightening concerns.\n\nREAD NEXT: Colombia's President Cuts Ties with Israel Amid Gaza Conflict\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to conduct a military operation in Rafah, located in southern Gaza, where approximately 1.5 million Palestinians have taken refuge, and Hamas maintains its last stronghold.\n\nDespite warnings from President Joe Biden and other Western officials regarding the potential for increased civilian casualties and exacerbation of the humanitarian crisis, Netanyahu remains firm in his resolve.\n\nPresident Biden's administration has cautioned Israel about the consequences of proceeding with the operation without adequate measures to protect civilians, according to AXIOS.\n\nThe decision by the administration to pause the delivery of US-made ammunition to Israel last week underscores this concern, marking the first such interruption since October 7.\n\nThe Biden administration's move to delay the arms shipments has raised serious concerns within the Israeli government, prompting officials to seek clarification.\n\nAmid growing criticism from Americans opposed to Biden's support for Israel, the administration's decision reflects a broader debate over US policy in the region.\n\nIsraeli officials have revealed that the arms shipments were halted last week, with no official comment from the White House.\n\nDespite ongoing efforts by mediators to broker a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas, tensions persist over the potential Israeli operation in Rafah.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken's recent visit to Israel included discussions with Benjamin Netanyahu regarding the proposed operation in Rafah, with Blinken warning against the potential repercussions for US-Israel relations.\n\nThe Joe Biden administration has made it clear that Israel's approach to the Rafah situation will influence US policy regarding the Gaza conflict.\n\nIntensive negotiations involving Egyptian and Qatari mediators are ongoing, with efforts focused on securing a ceasefire and a hostage release agreement, CNN noted.\n\nHowever, disagreements persist between Israel and Hamas, with both sides blaming each other for stalled negotiations.\n\nCIA Director Bill Burns has played a key role in facilitating talks between the parties involved, though uncertainties remain regarding the outcome of these negotiations.\n\nThe US continues to pressure Hamas to accept the latest ceasefire proposal while also urging Israel to refrain from launching a ground offensive in Rafah.\n\nREAD MORE: Biden Accuses

If we are being left to infer what reason could be behind this, Israel's looming mission into Rafah, where Hamas is holed up, offers the best explanation.\n\nHamas continues to use Palestinian civilians as human shields, hiding out in Rafah, where Israeli leaders encouraged civilians to head as the war moved south throughout Gaza. Hamas has nowhere left to run but continues to reject all ceasefire agreements that include giving up all Israeli (and American) hostages, leaving Israel with no choice but either to go in or to surrender and allow Hamas to rebuild itself once again. (Hamas went on to agree to a \"ceasefire\" this morning, negotiated without Israel's involvement, in case you are wondering how serious the group is when it comes to negotiating for peace.)\n\nBiden wants Israel to choose the latter. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby, and national security adviser Jake Sullivan all have said that Israel going into Rafah would lead to the United States making changes to policy toward Israel, a direct threat to Israel for daring to treat Hamas like the terrorist group that it is. All the while, Biden wants to build Hamas an aid pier, putting American lives on the line to transport aid to Gaza that will inevitably be picked over by Hamas before actual civilians even get a look at it. And yes, Hamas continues to hold American hostages, or at least is pretending to, assuming they are still alive.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThis has been Biden's problem since Oct. 7. He wants to split the baby between a U.S. ally that respects human rights and a terrorist group that is genocidal and antisemitic by its nature. His idea of \"support\" for Israel to defend itself has a limit in both duration and scope, and he has made it clear that he would undermine Israel the moment it started defending itself too well. That is why he claimed that Israel is doing exactly what Hamas wants by fighting this war and apologized for not believing Hamas's made-up casualty numbers.\n\nIf Biden has his way, Hamas will survive to commit more Oct. 7 massacres in the future, even if that means cutting off support for Israel through the changes Biden and his team are hanging over the Israelis' heads. Biden would rather have this crisis repeat ad infinitum than suffer through a few protest chants he thinks will lose him an election.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_faria@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Zachary Faria", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kirby_(admiral)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Kirby (admiral)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_hostage_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran hostage crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://wex-s3.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24123833018676-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541186", "eventUri": "eng-9541186", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 72, "textEnd": 78, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

A source familiar with the situation disclosed this development, although the reason behind this decision remains undisclosed. Speculations are rife, yet no official statement has clarified the motive.\n\nThe decision to pause ammunition shipments to Israel isn't linked to any anticipated Israeli operation in Rafah, as confirmed by the same source. Moreover, it's assured that this hold won't affect any forthcoming deliveries. When approached regarding the suspension, a representative from the National Security Council emphasized the continued security support extended to Israel.\n\nDespite this pause, the US reaffirms its unwavering support for Israel. Since the October 7 attacks, the United States has injected substantial financial aid into Israel's security. The spokesperson reiterated the significant efforts undertaken to ensure Israel's ability to defend itself against threats.\n\nWhile US officials maintain their stance towards Israel, concerns linger over a potential Israeli operation in Rafah, a sanctuary for millions of Palestinians. Presently, intensive negotiations are underway for a ceasefire and hostage resolution in the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nCIA Director Bill Burns has emerged as a pivotal figure in multiparty negotiations involving Israel, Hamas, Egypt, and Qatar. His intermediary role, especially concerning the release of hostages held in Gaza, underscores the US commitment to resolving the conflict.\n\nDespite recent negotiations in Cairo offering a glimmer of hope, the ceasefire talks remain precarious. Both Israel and Hamas engage in a blame game, complicating the path to resolution. CIA Director Burns' extended stay in Doha adds to the intrigue surrounding these discussions, highlighting the ad hoc nature of ceasefire negotiations in Gaza.\n\nThe decision to halt ammunition shipments to Israel underscores the complexities of the Israel-Hamas conflict and the delicate balance in US foreign policy. As negotiations continue, the international community watches closely, hoping for a breakthrough in the pursuit of peace.", "source": {"uri": "khybernews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khyber News -Official Website"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Central_Intelligence_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Central Intelligence Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States National Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

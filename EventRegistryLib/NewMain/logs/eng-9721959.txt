But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw,\" Clooney added.\n\nA subsequent Biden interview with ABC journalist George Stephanopoulos \"only reinforced what we saw the week before,\" Clooney said.\n\nOften described as an \"ATM for Democrats,\" Hollywood has traditionally been a significant source of donations for the party. Clooney's event, hosted with actor Julia Roberts, raised more than $30 million in what the Biden campaign said was the largest Democratic fundraiser in history.\n\nAfter Biden's debate performance, several Hollywood donors called on the president to end his campaign.\n\nNetflix co-founder Reed Hastings, Disney heir Abigail Disney and filmmaker Rob Reiner are among those who have said Biden should step aside. Screenwriter Damon Lindelof proposed that his Hollywood colleagues stop writing checks to Democrats until Biden withdraws.\n\nIn Washington, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a longtime Biden ally, said on Wednesday the president must decide quickly if he will stay in the race.\n\nClooney, who described himself as a lifelong Democrat, wrote: \"We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate.\"\n\n\"This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private,\" Clooney wrote. \"Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nAsked to respond, Biden's campaign referred to a letter the president sent Democrats in Congress that said he was \"firmly committed\" to his candidacy and beating Trump. Biden has said he had a \"bad night\" at the debate and vowed to stay in the race.\n\nClooney said leading Democrats and candidates who risk losing in November should ask Biden to drop his campaign.\n\nThe actor suggested that the party decide on a new nominee at its August convention and offered the names of several possible contenders including Vice President Kamala Harris and several state governors.\n\n\"Let's hear from Wes Moore and Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom and Andy Beshear and J.B.

Clooney, who co-hosted a huge Hollywood fundraiser for Biden just last month that raised a record $28 million, has seemingly changed his tune after Biden's disastrous performance in the first presidential debate against Donald Trump.\n\n\"I love Joe Biden.

He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nClooney noted that Democrats have been \"all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign\" when it comes to Biden's aging. The Oscar winner said that Biden's post-debate interview with ABC News and George Stephanopoulos \"only reinforced\" that Biden should not be the Democratic nominee.\n\n\"This is about age.

Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024,\" Clooney concluded.\n\nClooney is one of many Hollywood names who have now spoken out against Biden remaining the Democratic nominee, including Rob Reiner, Stephen King and Michael Moore.

Top Campaign official has no hopes for President Joe Biden: \"It's only a matter of time'\n\nIn a recent op-ed for The New York Times, George Clooney joins the chorus of Hollywood voices urging Joe Biden to step down as the 2024 Democratic nominee for president. Clooney, who co-hosted a major Hollywood fundraiser for Biden in June that raised a record $28 million, seems to have reconsidered his stance after Biden's poor performance in the first presidential debate against Donald Trump.\n\n\"I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president,\" Clooney wrote. \"I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\"\n\nClooney added: \"But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nThe actor emphasized that Democrats are so scared of a second Trump term that they are ignoring signs of Biden's aging. He noted that Biden's post-debate interview with ABC News and George Stephanopoulos further convinced him that Biden should not be the Democratic nominee.\n\n\"This is about age. Nothing more,\" Clooney wrote. \"But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nClooney concluded, \"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.\"\n\nClooney is among several Hollywood figures, including Rob Reiner, Stephen King, and Michael Moore, who have spoken out against Biden remaining the Democratic nominee. Moore recently said on his \"Rumble\" podcast that Biden's debate performance was \"the cruelest form of elder abuse I've ever been forced to watch.\"\n\nIn an interview with ABC News following the debate, Biden pushed back against his critics and insisted he has no plans to drop out of the presidential race.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Reiner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Reiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/be453bd40dbd8a0afb9a1fed50a4fb7e/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/07/10/17206293621034.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nLast month, Clooney, Julia Roberts and Barbra Streisand were among those who took the stage for a fundraiser that took in a record $30 million-plus for Biden, in hopes of energizing would-be supporters for a White House contest they said may rank among the most consequential in U.S. history.\n\nClooney isn't alone in his characterization of his recent exchange with Biden.\n\nA person who interacted closely with Biden described the president as vibrant and engaging at a fundraiser in March but, at the Los Angeles event months later, said they noticed a notable diminishment in Biden's presence.\n\nThe person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private interactions with the president, recalled being struck by how tired and \"out of it\" the president seemed during backstage conversations at the Los Angeles event, adding that they gave Biden the benefit of the doubt for not being as voluble and showing lower energy off-stage because he arrived in Los Angeles after traveling from Italy where he had attended an international summit.\n\nLuminaries from the entertainment world have increasingly lined up to help Biden's campaign. Leading up to the fundraiser, Clooney's name appeared on numerous fundraising missives from the campaign, which he called \"the fight of our lives.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Clooney did not immediately return a message seeking comment on insight into his decision, when precisely he had made it or how recently he had spoken with Biden.\n\nBiden has refused to end his reelection bid after his weak debate performance against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump on June 27.\n\n___\n\nKinnard reported from Chapin, South Carolina.

But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time.\"\n\nWith Biden at the top of the ticket, the Oscar-winner said, Democrats \"are not going to win in November,\" will lose control of the Senate, and won't gain a majority in the House of Representatives.\n\n\"This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and Congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private,\" Clooney wrote.\n\n\"This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed.\"\n\nClooney's call was quickly backed by Hollywood director Rob Reiner, a voiceful Democrat who also demanded days ago that Biden bow out.\n\n\"My friend George Clooney has clearly expressed what many of us have been saying... Democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside,\" wrote Reiner on X.\n\nA self-described \"lifelong Democrat,\" the 63-year-old Clooney last month co-hosted a star-studded fundraiser with Biden in Los Angeles, which also featured former president Barack Obama.\n\nThe Biden campaign said the event brought in a record $28 million.\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010,\" Clooney wrote, referencing a famous hot-mic clip from Biden's vice presidency.\n\n\"He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney said -- a direct challenge to Biden's claim that his poor debate showing was a one-off.\n\n\"As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\"\n\nActor Michael Douglas, who also hosted a Hollywood fundraiser for Biden in April, said Clooney had a \"valid point\" when asked about the editorial during an appearance Wednesday on \"The View\" TV chat show.\n\nDouglas did not call for Biden to step aside, but said he was \"deeply, deeply concerned.\"\n\n\"I adore the guy... and this just happens to be one of these elections that is just so crucial,\" he said, adding \"I don't worry necessarily today or tomorrow, but a year down the line, I worry.\"\n\nClooney joined critics who have likened Democrats' hesitancy to jettison Biden to the Republican Party's unshakeable loyalty to Trump.\n\n\"We love to talk about how the Republican Party has ceded all power... to a single person who seeks to hold on to the presidency, and yet most of our members of Congress are opting to wait and see if the dam breaks,\" he said.\n\nBut with several lawmakers already openly calling for Biden to step aside and more expressing worries, \"the dam has broken,\" Clooney said, asking more come forward.\n\n\"Top Democrats -- Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi -- and senators, representatives and other candidates who face losing in November need to ask this president to voluntarily step aside.\"\n\nClooney brushed aside worries that Biden's exit would create chaos four months before an election in which the Democrats hope to keep Trump from power, and did not endorse a replacement candidate.\n\n\"We Democrats have a very exciting bench. We don't anoint leaders or fall sway to a cult of personality; we vote for a president,\" he said.\n\nThe party should hear from contenders such as Vice President Kamala Harris, Maryland Governor Wes Moore and others, Clooney wrote, \"then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.\"\n\nClooney did not say whether he would withhold funding until Biden leaves, as Abigail Disney -- an heiress to the Disney media fortune -- did last week, along with several other wealthy donors.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "International

He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nThe June event was a star studded fundraiser in Los Angeles featuring former President Barack Obama, actress Julia Roberts and comedian Jimmy Kimmel. The evening raised over $30 million for Biden and his larger political operation, according to NBC News.\n\nBiden's fumbling debate performance opposite former President Donald Trump was on June 27, nearly two weeks after the fundraiser in Los Angeles.\n\nClooney's op-ed was published on Wednesday, nearly two weeks after the disastrous debate, and the same day former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. refused to explicitly endorse Biden as the nominee.\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president,\" wrote Clooney. \"On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate.

Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nReached for comment, a Biden campaign spokesman pointed CNBC to the president's comments insisting that he will stay in the race.\n\nAs Biden digs in, the delicate question of how to convince him to abandon the race is vexing Democrats on Capitol Hill. Clooney implored Democratic leaders like Pelosi to ask the president to stand down.\n\n\"Top Democrats -- Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi -- and senators, representatives and other candidates who face losing in November need to ask this president to voluntarily step aside,\" Clooney wrote.\n\nClooney also wrote that the president's performances after the late June debate hadn't been good enough to quell concerns, including Biden's recent interview on ABC.\n\n\"The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before,\" wrote Clooney.\n\n\"As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question,\" Clooney wrote.\n\nClooney was also careful to praise the president, who has racked up a string of legislative accomplishments in office. \"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.\"\n\nBut for the Biden campaign, Clooney represents only the latest wealthy Democratic party contributor to call on the president to step down.\n\nAbigail Disney, Stewart Bainum Jr. and Reed Hastings are among the party's donors who have already publicly said the president should pass the baton to another candidate.\n\nDisney and philanthropist and investor Gideon Stein both told CNBC they were done helping Democrats raise money, unless Biden announces that he won't run for reelection.", "source": {"uri": "nbcmiami.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 6 South Florida"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julia Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Kimmel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Hastings", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reed Hastings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air Force One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.nbcmiami.com/2024/07/107429770-17186350352024-06-16t033828z_491891049_rc22c8ac0b9l_rtrmadp_0_usa-election-biden.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 955, "textEnd": 962}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

But We Need A New Nominee.\"\n\n\"I love Joe Biden,\" Clooney wrote. \"As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals.\"\n\nBut Biden, like everyone, cannot roll back the clock, Clooney said.\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney wrote.\n\nBiden's poor performance at last month's debate with former President Donald Trump still has Democrats scrambling two weeks afterward as party leadership considers whether to support an alternative candidate.\n\n\"Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw,\" Clooney went on. Biden's team had said that a cold had made the president's voice shallow and raspy at the debate.\n\nDemocrats, the actor said, are in a white-knuckle position every time the president -- \"who we respect\" -- is positioned in front of a camera or microphone, afraid of another bad slip-up.\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate,\" Clooney said. \"This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nClooney argued that it was \"disingenuous\" to say the matter of Biden's nomination is settled when \"we just received new and upsetting information,\" and that a new candidate would \"in all likelihood\" be able to make use of the Biden campaign's millions in funds. Clooney encouraged Democrats like Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and California Gov.

He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nThe June event was a star studded fundraiser in Los Angeles featuring former President Barack Obama, actress Julia Roberts and comedian Jimmy Kimmel. The evening raised over $30 million for Biden and his larger political operation, according to NBC News.\n\nBiden's fumbling debate performance opposite former President Donald Trump was on June 27, nearly two weeks after the fundraiser in Los Angeles.\n\nClooney's op-ed was published on Wednesday, nearly two weeks after the disastrous debate, and the same day former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. refused to explicitly endorse Biden as the nominee.\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president,\" wrote Clooney. \"On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nReached for comment, a Biden campaign spokesman pointed CNBC to the president's comments insisting that he will stay in the race.\n\nAs Biden digs in, the delicate question of how to convince him to abandon the race is vexing Democrats on Capitol Hill. Clooney implored Democratic leaders like Pelosi to ask the president to stand down.\n\n\"Top Democrats -- Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi -- and senators, representatives and other candidates who face losing in November need to ask this president to voluntarily step aside,\" Clooney wrote.\n\nClooney also wrote that the president's performances after the late June debate hadn't been good enough to quell concerns, including Biden's recent interview on ABC.\n\n\"The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before,\" wrote Clooney.\n\n\"As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question,\" Clooney wrote.\n\nClooney was also careful to praise the president, who has racked up a string of legislative accomplishments in office. \"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.\"\n\nBut for the Biden campaign, Clooney represents only the latest wealthy Democratic party contributor to call on the president to step down.\n\nAbigail Disney, Stewart Bainum Jr. and Reed Hastings are among the party's donors who have already publicly said the president should pass the baton to another candidate.\n\nDisney and philanthropist and investor Gideon Stein both told CNBC they were done helping Democrats raise money, unless Biden announces that he won't run for reelection.", "source": {"uri": "shafaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nMovie star and lifelong Democrat George Clooney added his voice to calls for Joe Biden to leave the presidential race on Wednesday, just weeks after headlining a fundraiser that brought in a record single-night haul for the president's reelection campaign.\n\nClooney said in a New York Times opinion piece that he loves Biden, but the party would lose the presidential race as well as any control in Congress with him as the nominee.\n\n\"This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private,\" wrote Clooney. He's hosted several high-dollar Hollywood fundraisers, including for Biden last month.\n\nClooney argued the party should pick a new nominee at its convention next month, saying the process would be \"messy\" but \"wake up\" voters in the party's favor, mentioning Vice President Kamala Harris and Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gavin Newsom of California among those from who the country should now hear.\n\nFocusing much of his piece around Biden's age, Clooney noted differences he saw in the 81-year-old president during their recent Los Angeles event compared to years past.\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010,\" Clooney wrote. \"He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nLast month, Clooney, Julia Roberts and Barbra Streisand were among those who took the stage for a fundraiser that took in a record $30 million-plus for Biden, in hopes of energizing would-be supporters for a White House contest they said may rank among the most consequential in U.S. history.\n\nClooney isn't alone in his characterization of his recent exchange with Biden.\n\nA person who interacted closely with Biden described the president as vibrant and engaging at a fundraiser in March but, at the Los Angeles event months later, said they noticed a notable diminishment in Biden's presence.\n\nThe person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private interactions with the president, recalled being struck by how tired and \"out of it\" the president seemed during backstage conversations at the Los Angeles event, adding that they gave Biden the benefit of the doubt for not being as voluble and showing lower energy off-stage because he arrived in Los Angeles after traveling from Italy where he had attended an international summit.\n\nAsked for comment on Clooney's essay, Biden's campaign pointed to the president's letter to congressional Democrats earlier in the week vowing to stay in the race.\n\nHis team also disputed the actor's representation of Biden's demeanor during the Los Angeles fundraiser, with campaign officials who attended the event pointing out that the president stayed for more than three hours at the event, despite just having returned from Europe.\n\nLuminaries from the entertainment world have increasingly lined up to help Biden's campaign. Leading up to the fundraiser, Clooney's name appeared on numerous fundraising missives from the campaign, which he called \"the fight of our lives.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Clooney did not immediately return a message seeking comment on insight into his decision, when precisely he had made it or how recently he had spoken with Biden.\n\nBiden has refused to end his reelection bid after his weak debate performance against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump on June 27.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Movie star and lifelong Democrat George Clooney is adding his voice to calls for Joe Biden to leave the presidential race. Clooney says in a New York Times opinion piece Wednesday that he loves Biden, but the party would lose the presidential race as well as any control in Congress with him as the nominee. Manuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press file\n\nGeorge Clooney called Wednesday for President Biden to exit the 2024 presidential election race, urging Democrats to pick a new nominee.\n\nThe Academy Award-winning actor's defection adds to a wave of outcry from prominent Democrats calling for Biden, 81, to step aside after his halting, confused performance in a June 27 presidential debate against Donald Trump, 78, who has long claimed Biden is mentally unfit to lead the country.\n\nClooney's criticism is especially notable because he was one of Biden's biggest, best-known supporters in Hollywood - a major base of support for the president that now appears to be teetering.\n\nRelated George Clooney, Julia Roberts help Biden raise $28 million at fundraiser\n\n\"I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president,\" Clooney wrote in a New York Times op-ed. \"I consider him a friend, and I believe in him.\"\n\n\"But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time,\" he continued. \"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nSimon Halls, a representative for Clooney, declined to comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClooney added that Democrats have become so focused on defeating Trump in the upcoming election that they have \"opted to ignore every warning sign\" about the president's age. He said Biden's debate performance, as well as his ABC interview with George Stephanopoulos, created concerns that Democrats would lose the White House, the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\n\"This is about age. Nothing more,\" Clooney wrote. \"But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president.\"\n\nThough Clooney did not name a specific person to replace Biden, he pointed to Vice President Harris and several Democratic governors (such as Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and California Gov. Gavin Newsom) as potential candidates.\n\nClooney's criticisms Wednesday weren't quite out of the blue. In early June, the actor called one of Biden's top aides to complain about Biden's denunciation of the International Criminal Court's action against Israeli leaders. Clooney's wife, Amal Clooney, worked on that case. The call caused some Biden officials to worry that Clooney would withdraw from the fundraiser, which featured former president Barack Obama, late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel and actress Julia Roberts. The event, at which Kimmel interviewed Biden and Obama, reportedly raised more than $30 million, according to the Associated Press.\n\nBiden has firmly denounced calls from Washington \"elites\" to step aside since the presidential debate against Trump last month, but the outcry from celebrities who have significantly bolstered his fundraising efforts adds public and financial pressure - and might be snowballing.\n\n\"I think it's a valid point,\" actor Michael Douglas, who hosted a fundraiser for Biden in April, said of Clooney's op-ed on \"The View\" on Wednesday. \"I'm deeply, deeply concerned.\" He stopped short of calling for Biden to drop out of the race, however.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added that Biden's \"difficulty with the debate\" could have been easily avoided. \"First of all, they should have just told the president 'stand up,' put a little makeup on him and then where to look,\" he said. \"And just don't deal with all your facts, just deal with [Trump's] lies.\"\n\nActor and filmmaker Rob Reiner also backed Clooney's op-ed in a post shared on X.\n\n\"My friend George Clooney has clearly expressed what many of us have been saying. We love and respect Joe Biden,\" Reiner wrote. \"We acknowledge all he has done for our country. But Democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside.\"\n\nOther Hollywood players who have lost faith in Biden include CBS \"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert, Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, filmmaker Michael Moore, actor John Cusack and author Stephen King.\n\n\"Joe Biden has been a fine president, but it's time for him - in the interests of the America he so clearly loves - to announce he will not run for reelection,\" King wrote on X.\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines George Clooney, Julia Roberts help Biden raise $28 million at fundraiser\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\"

As a vice president and as president.\" Clooney said, \"I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\"\n\nBut, Clooney said, \"the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time.\"\n\nClooney also emphasized that this isn't just his opinion, but \"the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nWith that, Clooney called on party leaders to speak up and call on Biden to step aside, saying that the party is filled with \"a very exciting bench\" of potential contenders, including Kamala Harris, Wes Moore, Gretchen Whitmer, Gavin Newsom, Andy Beshear, J.B. Pritzker and others. Clooney acknowledged that the process of selecting a new nominee will be \"messy,\" but he said \"democracy is messy\" and it would \"enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out.\"\n\nClooney concluded his op-ed by saying \"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020.

In 2020, he donated more than $500,000 to Biden's campaign effort and co-hosted a virtual fundraiser for him that raised $7 million.\n\nOn June 16, Clooney co-hosted a star-studded fundraiser for Biden with fellow actors Julia Roberts and Barbara Streisand in Los Angeles which took in more than $30 million for his reelection campaign. At that event, Biden and former President Barack Obama were interviewed onstage by late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nIn his op-ed, Clooney said Biden's has noticeably deteriorated.\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010,\" Clooney wrote. \"He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nClooney said that after Biden's halting performance in last month's debate, he no longer believes the president is capable of defeating former President Donald Trump in the fall.\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president,\" Clooney writes. \"On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\n\n\"The dam has broken,\" he added. \"We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth.\"\n\nClooney has deep ties to Washington, D.C., and this administration. In December 2022, he visited the White House when he received the Kennedy Center honors. And last year, Biden appointed Clooney to the President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, which advises the president on cultural policy.\n\nAnd in May, the Washington Post reported that Clooney called one of Biden's top aides to complain about the president's criticism of the International Criminal Court's action against Israeli leaders -- a case his wife, Amal Clooney, is an international human rights lawyer, worked on.\n\nClooney is not the first high-profile Hollywood donor to call on Biden to leave the race. Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings and Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel have said that Biden should step aside as the nominee. And billionaire IAC chairman Barry Diller, who donated $100,000 to the president and the Democratic Party's joint 2024 super PAC, said this week he wouldn't donate to Biden anymore and is no longer supporting him.\n\nIn the op-ed, Clooney dismissed concerns that if Democrats chose a new nominee that the cash raised by the Biden-Harris campaign would go to waste.\n\n\"All of the scary stories that we're being told about what would happen next are simply not true,\" he writes. \"In all likelihood, the money in the Biden-Harris coffers could go to help elect the presidential ticket and other Democrats.\"\n\nClooney argued that the party should pick a new nominee at its convention next month, and said he'd like to \"hear from\" Vice President Kamala Harris and Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gavin Newsom of California and Andy Beshear of Kentucky.\n\n\"We Democrats have a very exciting bench,\" Clooney writes. \"We don't anoint leaders or fall sway to a cult of personality;

In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced,\" the \"Ticket to Paradise\" star, one of Hollywood's most prominent Democratic supporters, said in an editorial published Wednesday in The New York Times.\n\n\"But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time.

On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate,\" he said, citing \"the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor\" that he said he had spoken with privately.\n\n\"We love to talk about how the Republican Party has ceded all power, and all of the traits that made it so formidable with Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, to a single person who seeks to hold on to the presidency, and yet most of our members of Congress are opting to wait and see if the dam breaks,\" Clooney said.\n\n\"But the dam has broken,\" he said.\n\n\"We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth.\"\n\nReached for comment, Biden's campaign pointed to his earlier remarks indicating he has no intention of dropping out of the race.\n\n\"It is disingenuous, at best, to argue that Democrats have already spoken with their vote and therefore the nomination is settled and done, when we just received new and upsetting information,\" Clooney said.\n\nThe entertainer argued that top Democrats, including Sen. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) \"need to ask this president to voluntarily step aside.\"\n\n\"Would it be messy? Yes. Democracy is messy. But would it enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out? It sure would,\" Clooney said.\n\nBiden, Clooney wrote, \"is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020.\"", "source": {"uri": "wgntv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WGN-TV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "judy_kurtz@wgntv.com", "name": "Judy Kurtz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julia Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George H.

His state of mental and physical fitness has been a concern among voters for months, but was especially heightened after a low-energy debate performance that showed Biden with a quiet, raspy voice.\n\nIt would be nearly impossible for Democrats to replace Biden against his will based on several factors.\n\nEvery state has already held its presidential primary. Democratic rules mandate that the delegates Biden won remain bound to support him at the party's upcoming national convention unless he tells them he's leaving the race, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe conventions and their rules are controlled by the political parties. The Democratic National Committee could meet before the convention opens on Aug. 19 and change how things will work, but that isn't likely as long as Biden wants to continue seeking reelection.\n\nIf Biden chose to step aside, the process of replacing him would be unprecedented.\n\n\"Would it be messy? Yes. Democracy is messy. But would it enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out?

Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi even stopped short of a full endorsement on Wednesday, saying \"it's up to the president to decide.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020,\" Clooney finished in his essay. \"We need him to do it again in 2024.\"", "source": {"uri": "fox5dc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 DC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elissa_salamy@fox5dc.com", "name": "Elissa Salamy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wes Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Whitmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Maryland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Maryland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

After headlining a glitzy Los Angeles fundraiser and allowing his name to be attached to fundraising emails for President Joe Biden and his 2024 re-election campaign last month, actor George Clooney has decided to abandon ship.\n\nIn a guest essay published in The New York Times, Clooney says it's time for Democrats to get a new nominee to face Trump in November and Biden must step aside to save democracy, or whatever.\n\nA bit braggadocious, Clooney reminds readers that he has \"led some of the biggest fund-raisers in my party's history\" including for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Joe Biden's 2020 campaign. \"Last month I co-hosted the single largest fund-raiser supporting any Democratic candidate ever, for President Biden's re-election.\"\n\nClooney's support for Biden, however, has run out. While gushing about his love for Biden as a person and praising the president for winning \"many of the battles he's faced\" since taking office, Clooney reaches a conclusion that's spreading among his fellow Democrats: the one battle Biden can't win \"is the fight against time.\"\n\n\"It's devastating to say it,\" Clooney explains, \"but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nDevastating indeed, especially to Biden. Clooney's bleak evaluation of Biden continues:\n\nWas he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\n\nWhile Biden's questionable fitness to serve as president has been apparent to honest observers for three years now, Clooney has just now concluded that \"[w]e are not going to win in November with this president.

As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him.\"\n\nBut, Clooney added, the Biden he saw during the June 15 fundraiser, which also included former President Barack Obama, \"was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020.\"\n\n\"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney added, referencing Biden's faltering and disastrous performance at the June 27 presidential debate on CNN.\n\nThat statement was a stunning assessment of Biden's current state from someone who has interacted with the president privately -- that the way the president presented himself during that debate, which the White House and Biden campaign have alternatively blamed on a cold and a tiring travel schedule, was not an aberration.\n\nClooney is not just a movie star and a prominent donor: He's someone who has spent time with Biden over the years and has always been a big fan. This goes all the way back to Biden's early days as vice president, when Clooney came by the White House and dropped in to Biden's then-office down the hall in the West Wing from the Oval Office and ended up having an extended visit talking about helping Darfur.\n\nClooney is friendly with Obama too, but he and Biden have stayed in touch over the years, and the strength of that relationship held even when Biden criticized the International Criminal Court's May decision to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a result of his actions in Gaza - which Clooney's wife, international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, had been a key part of crafting. Clooney called a top White House adviser to complain, but he did not pull back on his support then, or on his participation in the June fundraiser. Biden forcefully criticized the ICC's efforts because of the implication of an equivalence between Israel and Hamas.\n\nClooney is also seen by many Democratic backers in Hollywood as a sort of compass given his engagement and activism. His standing with Biden until now helped rally wider donor and celebrity support, even among some who had never been big Biden fans and were not enthused about backing him long before the debate.\n\nAsked for comment Wednesday, Biden's campaign pointed toward the letter the president wrote to members of Congress on Monday indicating he would remain in the race.\n\nClooney's opinion piece represents the biggest defection against Biden in Hollywood, which the party has long relied on for big-named support and money. It comes as a handful of Democrats in Congress have also publicly demanded Biden step aside due to persistent concerns about his age and mental acuity.\n\nThe fundraiser that Clooney headlined raised $28 million for Biden's reelection campaign, the most for the Democratic Party from a single event in history. A source familiar with the event says that part of the reason that the Los Angeles fundraiser took place on June 15 - immediately after Biden's travel to the G7 summit in Italy - was because that was the one date Clooney said would work for him. Biden has cited his intense travel ahead of last month's debate as one reason for his poor performance.\n\nIn the opinion piece, Clooney called on key Democrats -- naming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- to ask Biden to \"voluntarily step aside.\"\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president,\" Clooney warned, adding that the lawmakers he has spoken with privately shared this view.\n\nHe said the country deserves to hear from other politicians who are seen as potential replacements for Biden on the ticket, including Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Vice President Kamala Harris, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker.\n\nSaying \"the dam has broken,\" Clooney wrote \"we can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth.\"\n\nClooney's opinion piece comes amid the most crucial week of Biden's reelection campaign, as cracks in the coalition of Democratic support behind Biden continued to grow. At least eight members of Congress from his own party have publicly asked Biden to step down from the ticket.\n\nOn Wednesday, CNN reported organizers for at least one Chicago fundraiser scheduled during the Democratic National Convention have decided to not to proceed with the mid-August event, according to a source with knowledge of the discussions. Organizers paused conversations on planning the fundraiser until after the July 4 holiday to allow the dust to settle. This week, the host committee decided not to proceed with the event, citing a disagreement over how to proceed given the continued erosion of support for Biden's candidacy.\n\nThe event, designed as a lunch for a few dozen wealthy Windy City denizens, is just one of many events planned in conjunction with the party's convention, when the campaign was expecting to tap into high-dollar supporters' enthusiasm and wallets for the home stretch of the race. A spokesperson for the Biden campaign told CNN the event was not affiliated with their official fundraising schedule.\n\nClooney isn't the only prominent Hollywood Democrat who has asked Biden to step down. Rob Reiner, a Biden surrogate who attended a fundraiser alongside Harris after the debate, also called for the president to step aside.\n\n\"My friend George Clooney has clearly expressed what many of us have been saying. We love and respect Joe Biden. We acknowledge all he has done for our country. But Democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside,\" Reiner said in a post to social media platform X Wednesday in which he linked to Clooney's op-ed.\n\nReiner began his calls on Biden to step down earlier this week.\n\n\"It's time to stop (expletive) around. If the Convicted Felon wins, we lose our Democracy. Joe Biden has effectively served US with honor, decency, and dignity. It's time for Joe Biden to step down,\" he wrote Sunday.\n\nBiden is participating in high-stakes meetings with NATO allies on Wednesday and will hold a solo news conference -- his first since the debate -- on Thursday.\n\nCNN's Arlette Saenz, Betsy Klein and Isaac Dovere contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

On top of that, we won\u00b4t win the House, and we\u00b4re going to lose the Senate.\"\n\n\"This isn\u00b4t only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I\u00b4ve spoken with in private,\" Clooney wrote. \"Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nBiden said he had a \"bad night\" at the debate and has vowed to stay in the presidential race.\n\nClooney expressed admiration for Biden and said he considered him a friend.\n\n\"I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he\u00b4s won many of the battles he\u00b4s faced,\" Clooney said.\n\n\"But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time.\" (Reporting by Lisa Richwine; Editing by Heather Timmons and Howard Goller)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 31, "textEnd": 38}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

His most recent one last month pulled in $30 million for the Biden campaign.\n\nBut Clooney is sharing some unexpected thoughts from the night in a lengthy opinion for the New York Times.\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney wrote.\n\nBiden's debate performance has been dividing Democrats for weeks, with many others calling on him to bow out of the race. Biden maintains he's staying in the race.\n\nBut Clooney is among those who believe Biden isn't the right Democratic candidate to win the presidency.\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president,\" Clooney wrote, adding that this is about Biden's age and nothing more.\n\nPresident Biden is 81 years old, and would be 82 come a January 2025 inauguration. His state of mental and physical fitness has been a concern among voters for months, but was especially heightened after a low-energy debate performance that showed Biden with a quiet, raspy voice.\n\nIt would be nearly impossible for Democrats to replace Biden against his will based on several factors.\n\nEvery state has already held its presidential primary. Democratic rules mandate that the delegates Biden won remain bound to support him at the party's upcoming national convention unless he tells them he's leaving the race, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe conventions and their rules are controlled by the political parties. The Democratic National Committee could meet before the convention opens on Aug. 19 and change how things will work, but that isn't likely as long as Biden wants to continue seeking reelection.\n\nIf Biden chose to step aside, the process of replacing him would be unprecedented.\n\n\"Would it be messy? Yes. Democracy is messy. But would it enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out? It sure would,\" Clooney wrote.\n\nPresident Biden has conceded the debate didn't go well for him, but has maintained he is staying in the race and is up for the fight to win a second term as president.\n\nHe is publicly urging his supporters to stay unified, and said Sunday at a public appearance in Pennsylvania that he feels the most optimistic he's ever felt about America's future.\n\nOn Monday, he sent a letter to Hill Democrats insisting he's \"declining\" to step aside and said it's time for the party drama \"to end.\"\n\nBut more top Democrats this week continue to call for his exit. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi even stopped short of a full endorsement on Wednesday, saying \"it's up to the president to decide.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020,\" Clooney finished in his essay. \"We need him to do it again in 2024.\"", "source": {"uri": "fox4news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 4 News Dallas-Fort Worth"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_inauguration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential inauguration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_nominating_convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential nominating convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2024/07/1280/720/GettyImages-1446779135.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-19", "textStart": 1854, "textEnd": 1861}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

The evening raised over $30 million for Biden and his larger political operation, according to NBC News.\n\nBiden's fumbling debate performance opposite former President Donald Trump was on June 27, nearly two weeks after the fundraiser in Los Angeles.\n\nClooney's op-ed was published on Wednesday, nearly two weeks after the disastrous debate, and the same day former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. refused to explicitly endorse Biden as the nominee.\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president,\" wrote Clooney. \"On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nReached for comment, a Biden campaign spokesman pointed CNBC to the president's comments insisting that he will stay in the race.\n\nAs Biden digs in, the delicate question of how to convince him to abandon the race is vexing Democrats on Capitol Hill. Clooney implored Democratic leaders like Pelosi to ask the president to stand down.\n\n\"Top Democrats -- Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi -- and senators, representatives and other candidates who face losing in November need to ask this president to voluntarily step aside,\" Clooney wrote.\n\nClooney also wrote that the president's performances after the late June debate hadn't been good enough to quell concerns, including Biden's recent interview on ABC.\n\n\"The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before,\" wrote Clooney.\n\n\"As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question,\" Clooney wrote.\n\nClooney was also careful to praise the president, who has racked up a string of legislative accomplishments in office. \"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.\"\n\nBut for the Biden campaign, Clooney represents only the latest wealthy Democratic party contributor to call on the president to step down.\n\nAbigail Disney, Stewart Bainum Jr. and Reed Hastings are among the party's donors who have already publicly said the president should pass the baton to another candidate.\n\nDisney and philanthropist and investor Gideon Stein both told CNBC they were done helping Democrats raise money, unless Biden announces that he won't run for reelection.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"},

'He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020.'\n\n'He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,' Clooney admitted.\n\nThe op/ed was a commanding call from Clooney for Biden to step-down as the party's candidate in November and allow someone else to lead the ticket.\n\nLifelong Democrat George Clooney revealed what he thinks about President Joe Biden as he demanded in a scathing op/ed that he step aside from the 2024 race after his disastrous debate. Above is George Clooney, President Biden, Julia Roberts and Barack Obama at a June 16 fundraiser that raised $28 million\n\nClooney co-hosted a fundraiser for Biden in Los Angeles last month where Obama had to Biden's arm a gentle tug and leading him off the stage after the president froze during the applause\n\nThe Hollywood megastar, who has hosted many fundraisers, said the Biden can't win the 'battle against time' in a scathing op-ed for the New York Times on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe actor also condemned Democratic party leaders for ignoring 'every warning sign' of Biden's declining physical and mental health and for trying to defend his car-crash performance against Donald Trump .\n\nHe added that Democrat voters 'collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.'\n\nClooney's LA fundraiser last month - hosted along with Obama and actress Julia Roberts - helped raise $28 million for Biden's reelection campaign.\n\nRead More Biden FREEZES at star-studded fundraiser before Obama comes to his rescue and pulls him off stage\n\nThe event, however, was overshadowed with questions about the president's health after a video appeared to show Obama needing to grab Biden's arm and guide him off stage.\n\nIn the video, Biden and Obama are seen waving and smiling while receiving a standing ovation in the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles. Biden applauds and gives the audience a thumbs up but then he stops moving as he stares out over the crowd for several long seconds.\n\nObama, still smiling and waving at this point, took Biden by the wrist and gave him a gentle tug. That's when the president appears to snap out of it.\n\nThey proceed to walk off the stage together with Obama speaking into Biden's ear as he pats him on the back as they go.\n\nThe White House called the video a fake. Officials also noted the fundraiser took place the day after Biden returned from participating in the G7 summit in Italy.\n\nClooney joins the scores of Democrats and Biden allies who have called for the president to step down in the two weeks since his meandering and mumbling showing on CNN. The actor hosted some of the biggest fundraisers in the party's history, including one last month for Biden's reelection.\n\nBiden has insisted he is not going anywhere and that he will still beat Trump in November, but Clooney's comments are an enormous blow to his embattled campaign.\n\nGeorge Clooney visited the White House where he was honored by the President in 2022\n\nRead MoreEXCLUSIVE The real reason Amal Clooney skipped George's $28M fundraiser for Biden\n\n'Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024,' the actor wrote in the op-ed.\n\nClooney, who hosted a star-studded fundraiser for Biden in Los Angeles on June 16, said the person he saw there was the candidate the world saw at last week's presidential debate.\n\n'I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced,' Clooney wrote.\n\nBiden and Clooney have a long relationship, going back to Biden's day as chairman of the Senate Foreign Services Committee. Clooney was working on issues in Darfur and connected with him.\n\nThe president has honored Clooney for his support, hosting him at the White House for the Kennedy Center Honors in December 2022.\n\nThe actor has become a major force in the Democratic Party, raising millions for its candidates. He's seen as an influential voice in American politics.\n\nHis dis-endorsement of Biden could also hurt the Democratic Party in the pocket book.\n\nHollywood donors, with their deep pockets, were said to be furious with campaign co-chair Jeffrey Katzenberg after Biden's debate performance.\n\nThe donors, like many Biden supporters, said they felt misled and betrayed about the president's health.\n\nClooney argued it was more important to beat Donald Trump in November than to keep Biden on the ticket.\n\n'Our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign,' he wrote.\n\nAlready some prominent Democrats are saying Clooney has a point.\n\n'I am concerned.' Michael Douglas, a longtime Biden supporter, told ABC's The View. 'I think it's a valid point,' he said of Clooney's op-ed.\n\nBiden has been struggling to rally Democrats around his presidential bid as calls for him to exit the presidential race grow.\n\nFormer Speaker Nancy Pelosi is among those appearing to question Biden's decision to remain in the contest.\n\n'It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision. Because time is running short,' she said on Morning Joe on Wednesday.\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers have expressed their doubts about Biden's ability to beat Trump.\n\nClooney said he's heard this concern from members of Congress he has spoken to, including worries the Democratic Party will lose the House and Senate.\n\n'We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly,' he wrote.\n\nHe argues a nominee should be picked at the Democratic National Convention, which will be held in Chicago August 19th through August 22nd.\n\nAnd the actor suggested an array of candidates who could replace Biden and go on to win in November.\n\n'Let's hear from Wes Moore and Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom and Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker and others,' he said, name checking several governors and the vice president.\n\n'Let's agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar. Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out,' he adds.\n\nAmal Clooney and George Clooney - Clooney was reportedly furious at the White House decision to question Amal's work on the war in Gaza\n\nClooney met with then-President Barack Obama at the White House in 2010 to talk about the Sudan\n\nGeorge Clooney with Bill Clinton at the White House Correspondents' dinner\n\nBiden has insisted he will stay in the race.\n\nHe sent a letter to all Democratic lawmakers on Monday, announcing his decision. He's also reached out to party officials, donors and mayors as he tries to shore up his support with the party faithful.\n\n'I want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere, I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump,' Biden wrote to Democrats.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Julia Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amal_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amal Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air Force One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Gretchen Whitmer and California Gov. Gavin Newsom as potential candidates.\n\n\"We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth,\" he said.\n\nCalling on Biden to prioritize the country's future, Clooney said: \"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020.

The Hollywood megastar, who has hosted fundraisers for the 81-year-old, said Biden can't win the 'battle against time' in a scathing op-ed for the New York Times on Wednesday morning. The actor also condemned Democratic party leaders for ignoring 'every warning sign' of Biden's declining physical and mental health and for trying to defend his car crash performance against Donald Trump.\n\nHe added that Democrat voters 'collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.' Clooney joins the scores of Democrats and Biden allies who have called for the president to step down in the two weeks since his meandering and mumbling showing on CNN. Biden has insisted he is not going anywhere and insists he will still beat Trump in November, but Clooney's comments are an enormous blow to his embattled campaign.\n\n'Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024,' the actor wrote in the op-ed. Clooney, who hosted a star-studded fundraiser for Biden in Los Angeles on June 16, said the person he saw there was the candidate the world saw at last week's presidential debate. 'I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced,' Clooney wrote.\n\n'But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \"big [expletive] deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,' he said. Biden and Clooney have a long relationship, going back to Biden's day as chairman of the Senate Foreign Services Committee. Clooney was working on issues in Darfar and connected with him. The president has honored Clooney for his support, hosting him at the White House for the Kennedy Center Honors in December 2022. The actor has become a major force in the Democratic Party, raising millions for its candidates. He's seen as an influential voice in American politics.\n\nClooney argued it was more important to beat Donald Trump in November than to keep Biden on the ticket. 'Our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign,' he wrote. But the two men also hit some bumps in their relationship. The actor was reportedly furious at the White House in early June after Biden attacked an attempt by Amal, Clooney's lawyer wife, to jail the Prime Minister of Israe l, it emerged on Thursday.\n\nAmal Clooney signed off a bid by the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court last month to seek the arrest of Benjamin Netanyahu alongside Hamas leaders for war crimes - a move the President denounced as 'outrageous'. Clooney reportedly called one of Biden's closest advisers to make his feelings known. But he still hosted a fundraiser - along with actress Julia Roberts and former President Barack Obama - later that month that helped raise $30 million for Biden's campaign last month. The fundraiser, however, was overshadowed with questions about the president's health after a video appeared to show Obama having to guide Biden off stage.\n\nIn the video, Biden and Obama are seen waving and smiling while receiving a standing ovation in the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles. Biden applauds and gives the audience a thumbs up but then he stops moving as he stares out over the crowd for several long seconds. That's when Obama, still smiling and waving, took Biden by the wrist and gave him a gentle tug. That's when the president appears to snap out of it. They proceed to walk off the stage together with Obama speaking into Biden's ear as he pats him on the back as they go. The White House called the video a fake. Biden has been struggling to rally Democrats around his presidential bid as calls for him to exit the presidential race grow.\n\nFormer Speaker Nancy Pelosi is among those appearing to question Biden's decision to remain in the contest. 'It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision. Because time is running short,' she said on Morning Joe on Wednesday. Some Democratic lawmakers have expressed their doubts about Biden's ability to beatTrump. Clooney said he's heard this concern from members of Congress he has spoken to, including worries the Democratic Party will lose the House and Senate. 'We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly,' he wrote.\n\nHe argues a nominee should be picked at the Democratic National Convention, which will be held in Chicago August 19th through August 22nd. And the actor suggested an array of candidates who could replace Biden and go on to win in November. 'Let's hear from Wes Moore and Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom and Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker and others,' he said, name checking several governors and the vice president. 'Let's agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar. Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out,' he adds. Biden has insisted he will stay in the race.

The actor hosted some of the biggest fundraisers in the party's history, including one last month for Biden's reelection.\n\nBiden has insisted he is not going anywhere and that he will still beat Trump in November, but Clooney's comments are an enormous blow to his embattled campaign.\n\n'Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024,' the actor wrote in the op-ed.\n\nClooney, who hosted a star-studded fundraiser for Biden in Los Angeles on June 16, said the person he saw there was the candidate the world saw at last week's presidential debate.\n\n'I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced,' Clooney wrote.\n\n'But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,' he said.\n\nBiden and Clooney have a long relationship, going back to Biden's day as chairman of the Senate Foreign Services Committee. Clooney was working on issues in Darfur and connected with him.\n\nThe president has honored Clooney for his support, hosting him at the White House for the Kennedy Center Honors in December 2022.\n\nThe actor has become a major force in the Democratic Party, raising millions for its candidates. He's seen as an influential voice in American politics.\n\nHis dis-endorsement of Biden could also hurt the Democratic Party in the pocket book.\n\nHollywood donors, with their deep pockets, were said to be furious with campaign co-chair Jeffrey Katzenberg after Biden's debate performance.\n\nThe donors, like many Biden supporters, said they felt misled and betrayed about the president's health.\n\nClooney argued it was more important to beat Donald Trump in November than to keep Biden on the ticket.\n\n'Our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign,' he wrote.\n\nBut the two men also hit some bumps in their relationship.\n\nThe actor was reportedly furious at the White House in early June after Biden attacked an attempt by Amal, Clooney's lawyer wife, to jail the Prime Minister of Israel, it emerged on Thursday.\n\nAmal Clooney signed off a bid by the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court last month to seek the arrest of Benjamin Netanyahu alongside Hamas leaders for war crimes - a move the President denounced as 'outrageous'.\n\nClooney reportedly called one of Biden's closest advisers to make his feelings know.\n\nBut he still hosted a fundraiser - along with actress Julia Roberts and former President Barack Obama - later that month that helped raise $30 million for Biden's campaign last month.\n\nThe fundraiser, however was overshadowed with questions about the president's health after a video appeared to show Obama having to guide Biden off stage.\n\nIn the video, Biden and Obama are seen waving and smiling while receiving a standing ovation in the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nBiden applauds and gives the audience a thumbs up but then he stops moving as he stares out over the crowd for several long seconds.\n\nThat's when Obama, still smiling and waving, took Biden by the wrist and gave him a gentle tug. That's when the president appears to snap out of it.\n\nThey proceed to walk off the stage together with Obama speaking into Biden's ear as he pats him on the back as they go.\n\nThe White House called the video a fake. Officials also noted the fundraiser took place the day after Biden returned from participating in the G7 summit in Italy.\n\nBiden has been struggling to rally Democrats around his presidential bid as calls for him to exit the presidential race grow.\n\nFormer Speaker Nancy Pelosi is among those appearing to question Biden's decision to remain in the contest.\n\n'It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision. Because time is running short,' she said on Morning Joe on Wednesday.\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers have expressed their doubts about Biden's ability to beat Trump.\n\nClooney said he's heard this concern from members of Congress he has spoken to, including worries the Democratic Party will lose the House and Senate.\n\n'We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly,' he wrote.\n\nHe argues a nominee should be picked at the Democratic National Convention, which will be held in Chicago August 19th through August 22nd.\n\nAnd the actor suggested an array of candidates who could replace Biden and go on to win in November.\n\n'Let's hear from Wes Moore and Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom and Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker and others,' he said, name checking several governors and the vice president.\n\n'Let's agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar. Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out,' he adds.\n\nBiden has insisted he will stay in the race.\n\nHe sent a letter to all Democratic lawmakers on Monday, announcing his decision. He's also reached out to party officials, donors and mayors as he tries to shore up his support with the party faithful.\n\n'I want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere, I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump,' Biden wrote to Democrats.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air Force One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amal_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amal Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Center_Honors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Center Honors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Katzenberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeffrey Katzenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darfur", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darfur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Darfur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Clooney cites troublesome poll numbers suggesting that Americans lack confidence in Biden following his frail performance in the June 27 presidential debate against Donald Trump.\n\nIn the article, Clooney calls himself a \"lifelong Democrat\" and reminds readers that he co-hosted the Biden campaign's star-studded Hollywood fundraiser only a few weeks ago, which he noted was the \"single largest fund-raiser supporting any Democratic candidate ever.\"\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020,\" Clooney said, \"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nClooney expressed his personal fondness for the current president, writing, \"I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\"\n\nHowever, the two-time Oscar winner said that \"the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time,\" referencing the 81-year-old's age, which remains a top concern to voters.\n\nAddressing Biden's weak debate performance specifically, the actor said, \"Our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign.\"\n\nHe added that Biden's primetime interview with George Stephanopoulos on July 5 -- which the White House hoped would revive his candidacy -- \"only reinforced what we saw the week before.\"\n\nClooney called upon leading Democrats -- specifically naming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- to put pressure on Biden to \"voluntarily step aside.\" (Within hours of the essay's publication, Politico reported that Jeffries told House Democrats he would relay their concerns to Biden.)\n\nAccording to Clooney, \"every single\" lawmaker he's spoken with has said that they worry Biden will not only lose in November, but that he will hurt Democratic candidates down the ballot and potentially give Republicans full control of Congress. Clooney suggested that some of the skeptical Democrats he's spoken with are still publicly backing Biden.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nLater in his essay, Clooney expressed optimism for the future of the political party if Biden steps aside, writing, \"We can easily foresee a group of several strong Democrats stepping forward to stand and tell us why they're best qualified to lead this country and take on some of the deeply concerning trends we're seeing from the revenge tour that Donald Trump calls a presidential campaign.\"\n\nThe clock is ticking with the Democratic National Convention beginning on Aug. 19 -- during which time the party will formally nominate its candidate -- but Clooney insists that there's still time to \"hear from Wes Moore and Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom and Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker and others\" who have been named as possible replacements.\n\nClooney also requested that Democrats stay united if the ticket sees a switch-up, writing, \"Let's agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar. Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.\"\n\nThe actor suggested that Biden stepping aside could \"enliven our party\" and \"wake up voters\" who have \"checked out.\"\n\nClooney concluded the essay by expressing gratitude for the president -- and a plea: \"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.\"\n\nClooney's essay comes as a slow trickle of liberal lawmakers break from the president. As of Wednesday afternoon, eight Democratic members of Congress have publicly called for Biden to drop out of the race, and many more have expressed doubts -- including Pelosi, who has cautiously suggested that there's reason to be skeptical of Biden's candidacy.\n\nSeveral celebrities seem to share Clooney's fears, with author Stephen King writing on social media earlier this week, \"Joe Biden has been a fine president, but it's time for him -- in the interests of the America he so clearly loves -- to announce he will not run for re-election.\"\n\nEmmy winner Rob Reiner praised Clooney for his essay, writing on social media, \"My friend George Clooney has clearly expressed what many of us have been saying. We love and respect Joe Biden. We acknowledge all he has done for our country. But Democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back.

As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him.\"\n\nBut, Clooney added, the Biden he saw during the June 15 fundraiser, which also included former President Barack Obama, \"was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020.\"\n\n\"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney added, referencing Biden's faltering and disastrous performance at the June 27 presidential debate on CNN.\n\nThat statement was a stunning assessment of Biden's current state from someone who has interacted with the president privately -- that the way the president presented himself during that debate, which the White House and Biden campaign have alternatively blamed on a cold and a tiring travel schedule, was not an aberration.\n\nClooney is not just a movie star and a prominent donor: He's someone who has spent time with Biden over the years and has always been a big fan. This goes all the way back to Biden's early days as vice president, when Clooney came by the White House and dropped in to Biden's then-office down the hall in the West Wing from the Oval Office and ended up having an extended visit talking about helping Darfur.\n\nClooney is friendly with Obama too, but he and Biden have stayed in touch over the years, and the strength of that relationship held even when Biden criticized the International Criminal Court's May decision to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a result of his actions in Gaza - which Clooney's wife, international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, had been a key part of crafting. Clooney called a top White House adviser to complain, but he did not pull back on his support then, or on his participation in the June fundraiser. Biden forcefully criticized the ICC's efforts because of the implication of an equivalence between Israel and Hamas.\n\nClooney is also seen by many Democratic backers in Hollywood as a sort of compass given his engagement and activism. His standing with Biden until now helped rally wider donor and celebrity support, even among some who had never been big Biden fans and were not enthused about backing him long before the debate.\n\nAsked for comment Wednesday, Biden's campaign pointed toward the letter the president wrote to members of Congress on Monday indicating he would remain in the race.\n\nClooney's opinion piece represents the biggest defection against Biden in Hollywood, which the party has long relied on for big-named support and money. It comes as a handful of Democrats in Congress have also publicly demanded Biden step aside due to persistent concerns about his age and mental acuity.\n\nThe fundraiser that Clooney headlined raised $28 million for Biden's reelection campaign, the most for the Democratic Party from a single event in history. A source familiar with the event says that part of the reason that the Los Angeles fundraiser took place on June 15 - immediately after Biden's travel to the G7 summit in Italy - was because that was the one date Clooney said would work for him. Biden has cited his intense travel ahead of last month's debate as one reason for his poor performance.\n\nIn the opinion piece, Clooney called on key Democrats -- naming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- to ask Biden to \"voluntarily step aside.\"\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president,\" Clooney warned, adding that the lawmakers he has spoken with privately shared this view.\n\nHe said the country deserves to hear from other politicians who are seen as potential replacements for Biden on the ticket, including Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Vice President Kamala Harris, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker.\n\nSaying \"the dam has broken,\" Clooney wrote \"we can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth.\"\n\nClooney's opinion piece comes amid the most crucial week of Biden's reelection campaign, as cracks in the coalition of Democratic support behind Biden continued to grow. At least eight members of Congress from his own party have publicly asked Biden to step down from the ticket.\n\nOn Wednesday, CNN reported organizers for at least one Chicago fundraiser scheduled during the Democratic National Convention have decided to not to proceed with the mid-August event, according to a source with knowledge of the discussions. Organizers paused conversations on planning the fundraiser until after the July 4 holiday to allow the dust to settle. This week, the host committee decided not to proceed with the event, citing a disagreement over how to proceed given the continued erosion of support for Biden's candidacy.\n\nThe event, designed as a lunch for a few dozen wealthy Windy City denizens, is just one of many events planned in conjunction with the party's convention, when the campaign was expecting to tap into high-dollar supporters' enthusiasm and wallets for the home stretch of the race. A spokesperson for the Biden campaign told CNN the event was not affiliated with their official fundraising schedule.\n\nClooney isn't the only prominent Hollywood Democrat who has asked Biden to step down. Rob Reiner, a Biden surrogate who attended a fundraiser alongside Harris after the debate, also called for the president to step aside.\n\n\"My friend George Clooney has clearly expressed what many of us have been saying. We love and respect Joe Biden. We acknowledge all he has done for our country. But Democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside,\" Reiner said in a post to social media platform X Wednesday in which he linked to Clooney's op-ed.\n\nReiner began his calls on Biden to step down earlier this week.\n\n\"It's time to stop (expletive) around. If the Convicted Felon wins, we lose our Democracy. Joe Biden has effectively served US with honor, decency, and dignity. It's time for Joe Biden to step down,\" he wrote Sunday.\n\nBiden is participating in high-stakes meetings with NATO allies on Wednesday and will hold a solo news conference -- his first since the debate -- on Thursday.\n\nCNN's Arlette Saenz, Betsy Klein and Isaac Dovere contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Clooney cites troublesome poll numbers suggesting that Americans lack confidence in Biden following his frail performance in the June 27 presidential debate against Donald Trump.\n\nIn the article, Clooney calls himself a \"lifelong Democrat\" and reminds readers that he co-hosted the Biden campaign's star-studded Hollywood fundraiser only a few weeks ago, which he noted was the \"single largest fund-raiser supporting any Democratic candidate ever.\"\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010.

In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\"\n\nHowever, the two-time Oscar winner said that \"the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time,\" referencing the 81-year-old's age, which remains a top concern to voters.\n\nAddressing Biden's weak debate performance specifically, the actor said, \"Our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign.\"\n\nHe added that Biden's primetime interview with George Stephanopoulos on July 5 -- which the White House hoped would revive his candidacy -- \"only reinforced what we saw the week before.\"\n\nRelated: Joe Biden Admits He 'Screwed Up' During Presidential Debate but Isn't Dropping Out: 'I Had a Bad Night'\n\nClooney called upon leading Democrats -- specifically naming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- to put pressure on Biden to \"voluntarily step aside.\" (Within hours of the essay's publication, Politico reported that Jeffries told House Democrats he would relay their concerns to Biden.)\n\nAccording to Clooney, \"every single\" lawmaker he's spoken with has said that they worry Biden will not only lose in November, but that he will hurt Democratic candidates down the ballot and potentially give Republicans full control of Congress. Clooney suggested that some of the skeptical Democrats he's spoken with are still publicly backing Biden.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nLater in his essay, Clooney expressed optimism for the future of the political party if Biden steps aside, writing, \"We can easily foresee a group of several strong Democrats stepping forward to stand and tell us why they're best qualified to lead this country and take on some of the deeply concerning trends we're seeing from the revenge tour that Donald Trump calls a presidential campaign.\"\n\nThe clock is ticking with the Democratic National Convention beginning on Aug. 19 -- during which time the party will formally nominate its candidate -- but Clooney insists that there's still time to \"hear from Wes Moore and Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom and Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker and others\" who have been named as possible replacements.\n\nRelated: Can Joe Biden Be Replaced on the Democratic Ticket? What the DNC Rules Say About Switching Nominees\n\nClooney also requested that Democrats stay united if the ticket sees a switch-up, writing, \"Let's agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar. Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.\"\n\nThe actor suggested that Biden stepping aside could \"enliven our party\" and \"wake up voters\" who have \"checked out.\"\n\nClooney concluded the essay by expressing gratitude for the president -- and a plea: \"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.\"\n\nClooney's essay comes as a slow trickle of liberal lawmakers break from the president. As of Wednesday afternoon, eight Democratic members of Congress have publicly called for Biden to drop out of the race, and many more have expressed doubts -- including Pelosi, who has cautiously suggested that there's reason to be skeptical of Biden's candidacy.\n\nSeveral celebrities seem to share Clooney's fears, with author Stephen King writing on social media earlier this week, \"Joe Biden has been a fine president, but it's time for him -- in the interests of the America he so clearly loves -- to announce he will not run for re-election.\"\n\nEmmy winner Rob Reiner praised Clooney for his essay, writing on social media, \"My friend George Clooney has clearly expressed what many of us have been saying. We love and respect Joe Biden. We acknowledge all he has done for our country. But Democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2024_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2024 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Modern liberalism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney said.\n\nClooney also criticised prominent figures within the Democratic Party for attempting to re-write history following the recent debate, claiming they are \"telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw.\"\n\nThe actor also said that the unanimous support for Biden has come because \"we're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign,\" but Clooney is refusing to stay silent any longer.\n\nHe continued: \"Is it fair to point these things out? It has to be. This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate.\"\n\nWhile few senior politicians have raised their head above the surface to share Clooney's view, the actor claims that \"every senator and congress member and governor\" he has spoken to privately since the debate is allegedly in agreement.\n\n\"We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth,\" Clooney concluded by saying.\n\nThe US election is set to take place on November 5th, and as it stands Biden will be standing against Trump. The current president is adamant he will continue, recently telling party members, \"I want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere, I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe official Democratic Party nominee will be named at the upcoming Democratic National Convention DNC in Chicago from August 19th until 22nd.

He's hosted several high-dollar Hollywood fundraisers, including for Biden last month.\n\nClooney argued the party should pick a new nominee at its convention next month, saying the process would be \"messy\" but \"wake up\" voters in the party's favor, mentioning Vice President Kamala Harris and Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gavin Newsom of California among those from who the country should now hear.\n\nFocusing much of his piece around Biden's age, Clooney noted differences he saw in the 81-year-old president during their recent Los Angeles event compared to years past.\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010,\" Clooney wrote. \"He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020.

Leading up to the fundraiser, Clooney's name appeared on numerous fundraising missives from the campaign, which he called \"the fight of our lives.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Clooney did not immediately return a message seeking comment on insight into his decision, when precisely he had made it or how recently he had spoken with Biden.\n\nBiden has refused to end his reelection bid after his weak debate performance against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump on June 27.\n\n___\n\nKinnard reported from Chapin, South Carolina.

His most recent one last month pulled in $30 million for the Biden campaign.\n\nBut Clooney is sharing some unexpected thoughts from the night in a lengthy opinion for the New York Times.\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney wrote.\n\nBiden's debate performance has been dividing Democrats for weeks, with many others calling on him to bow out of the race. Biden maintains he's staying in the race.\n\nBut Clooney believes Biden isn't the right Democratic candidate to win the presidency - and he said several senators, congress members and governors have agreed with him in private conversations.\n\nRELATED: ABC's George Stephanpoulos asserts Biden can't serve 2nd term\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president,\" Clooney wrote, adding that this is about Biden's age and nothing more.\n\nPresident Biden is 81 years old, and would be 82 come a January 2025 inauguration. His state of mental and physical fitness has been a concern among voters for months, but was especially heightened after a low-energy debate performance that showed Biden with a quiet, raspy voice.\n\nIt would be nearly impossible for Democrats to replace Biden against his will based on several factors.\n\nEvery state has already held its presidential primary. Democratic rules mandate that the delegates Biden won remain bound to support him at the party's upcoming national convention unless he tells them he's leaving the race, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe conventions and their rules are controlled by the political parties.

None of us can.\"\n\nClooney helped raise $30 million for Biden's campaign last month at the high-profile Los Angeles fundraiser with former President Barack Obama and actor Julia Roberts. However, in his New York Times essay, Clooney admitted he noticed a change in Biden during that event.\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney wrote.\n\nBiden's poor performance in last month's debate against Trump renewed doubts about his age and chances as the Democrat nominee. Despite calls from some House Democrats for him to withdraw from the race, Biden has stood firm.\n\n\"Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign,\" Clooney, said.\n\n\"Is it fair to point these things out? It has to be. This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed.\"\n\nReferencing remarks by senators, congress members, and governors he spoke with privately, Clooney added, \"We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate.\"\n\n\"We love to talk about how the Republican Party has ceded all power, and all of the traits that made it so formidable with Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, to a single person who seeks to hold on to the presidency, and yet most of our members of Congress are opting to wait and see if the dam breaks,\" Clooney continued.\n\n\"But the dam has broken,\" he said. \"We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth.\"\n\nLast week, Biden released a statement saying, \"I'm the sitting President of the United States. I'm the nominee of the Democratic party. I'm staying in the race.\"\n\n\"It is disingenuous, at best, to argue that Democrats have already spoken with their vote and therefore the nomination is settled and done, when we just received new and upsetting information,\" Clooney remarked, calling on top Democrats who \"need to ask this president to voluntarily step aside.\"\n\n\"Would it be messy? Yes. Democracy is messy. But would it enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out?

Movie star and lifelong Democrat George Clooney is adding his voice to calls for Joe Biden to leave the presidential race. Clooney says in a New York Times opinion piece Wednesday that he loves Biden, but the party would lose the presidential race as well as any control in Congress with him as the nominee. Manuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press file\n\nGeorge Clooney called Wednesday for President Biden to exit the 2024 presidential election race, urging Democrats to pick a new nominee.\n\nThe Academy Award-winning actor's defection adds to a wave of outcry from prominent Democrats calling for Biden, 81, to step aside after his halting, confused performance in a June 27 presidential debate against Donald Trump, 78, who has long claimed Biden is mentally unfit to lead the country.\n\nClooney's criticism is especially notable because he was one of Biden's biggest, best-known supporters in Hollywood - a major base of support for the president that now appears to be teetering.\n\n\"I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president,\" Clooney wrote in a New York Times op-ed. \"I consider him a friend, and I believe in him.\"\n\n\"But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time,\" he continued. \"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nSimon Halls, a representative for Clooney, declined to comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClooney added that Democrats have become so focused on defeating Trump in the upcoming election that they have \"opted to ignore every warning sign\" about the president's age. He said Biden's debate performance, as well as his ABC interview with George Stephanopoulos, created concerns that Democrats would lose the White House, the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\n\"This is about age. Nothing more,\" Clooney wrote. \"But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president.\"\n\nThough Clooney did not name a specific person to replace Biden, he pointed to Vice President Harris and several Democratic governors (such as Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and California Gov. Gavin Newsom) as potential candidates.\n\nClooney's criticisms Wednesday weren't quite out of the blue. In early June, the actor called one of Biden's top aides to complain about Biden's denunciation of the International Criminal Court's action against Israeli leaders. Clooney's wife, Amal Clooney, worked on that case. The call caused some Biden officials to worry that Clooney would withdraw from the fundraiser, which featured former president Barack Obama, late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel and actress Julia Roberts. The event, at which Kimmel interviewed Biden and Obama, reportedly raised more than $30 million, according to the Associated Press.\n\nBiden has firmly denounced calls from Washington \"elites\" to step aside since the presidential debate against Trump last month, but the outcry from celebrities who have significantly bolstered his fundraising efforts adds public and financial pressure - and might be snowballing.\n\n\"I think it's a valid point,\" actor Michael Douglas, who hosted a fundraiser for Biden in April, said of Clooney's op-ed on \"The View\" on Wednesday. \"I'm deeply, deeply concerned.\" He stopped short of calling for Biden to drop out of the race, however.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added that Biden's \"difficulty with the debate\" could have been easily avoided. \"First of all, they should have just told the president 'stand up,' put a little makeup on him and then where to look,\" he said. \"And just don't deal with all your facts, just deal with [Trump's] lies.\"\n\nActor and filmmaker Rob Reiner also backed Clooney's op-ed in a post shared on X.\n\n\"My friend George Clooney has clearly expressed what many of us have been saying. We love and respect Joe Biden,\" Reiner wrote. \"We acknowledge all he has done for our country. But Democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside.\"\n\nOther Hollywood players who have lost faith in Biden include CBS \"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert, Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, filmmaker Michael Moore, actor John Cusack and author Stephen King.\n\n\"Joe Biden has been a fine president, but it's time for him - in the interests of the America he so clearly loves - to announce he will not run for reelection,\" King wrote on X.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nRepublicans jump-start 2024 election challenges with Trump-inspired lawsuits filed

But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time.\"\n\nA self-described \"lifelong Democrat,\" Clooney last month co-hosted a star-studded fundraiser with Biden in Los Angeles, which also featured former president Barack Obama.\n\nThe Biden campaign said that the event brought in a record $28 million.\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010,\" Clooney wrote, referencing a famous hot-mic clip from Biden's vice presidency.\n\n\"He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020.

We don't anoint leaders or fall sway to a cult of personality; we vote for a president,\" he said.\n\nThe party should hear from contenders such as Vice President Kamala Harris, Maryland Governor Wes Moore and others, Clooney wrote, \"then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.\"\n\nbur-des/bgs\n\nFOX41 Yakima\u00a9FOX11 TriCities\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "nbcrightnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Right Now"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@nbcrightnow.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air Force One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Maryland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Maryland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_personality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cult of personality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wes Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian_Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian Democracy", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.fox41yakima.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/668eb46717a2aimage_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

This comes just three weeks after Clooney helped Biden raise $30 million at a Hollywood fundraiser.\n\nClooney, known for his political engagements and outspoken views, expressed deep respect and admiration for Biden, stating, \"I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\"\n\nHowever, Clooney's recent statements underscore a growing concern among some Democrats about Biden's chances in the upcoming election. \"We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate,\" Clooney warned.\n\nThe actor's comments reflect a sentiment he claims is shared by many within the Democratic Party. \"This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly,\" he asserted.\n\nClooney described a significant change in Biden's demeanor and performance, noting, \"None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020.

Chief among Clooney's concerns was Biden's performance during the first presidential debate just two weeks ago, in which he flubbed early remarks and performed with a hoarse voice. Clooney said those concerns were only exacerbated during Biden's primetime interview last week with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos.\n\n\"Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw,\" Clooney writes. \"We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before.\"\n\nClooney, a self-described lifelong Democrat who has been the architect behind some of the democrats' biggest fundraisers in the party's history, underscored his admiration for Biden and the work he's accomplished over the last four years. But there's one battle Clooney says Biden can't win, and that's the battle against Father Time, a notion Clooney says was first reaffirmed during his star-studded fundraiser for Biden last month, featuring Clooney, Biden, former President Barack Obama and Jimmy Kimmel.\n\n\"The one battle he cannot win is the fight against time,\" Clooney said. \"None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nClooney insists that Biden step aside and allow democrats to pick a new presumptive nominee. He called on a slew of elected officials -- from Vice President Kamala Harris and California Governor Gavin Newsom -- to step forward \"and tell us why they're best qualified to lead this country.\"\n\n\"Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out,\" Clooney explained of his blueprint for a path forward.\n\nClooney is far from the only notable figure who has called on Biden to end his re-election campaign. Clooney's friend and Hollywood giant Rob Reiner echoed the Ocean's Eleven star's remarks in a tweet that included a link to Clooney's Op-Ed.\n\n\"My friend George Clooney has clearly expressed what many of us have been saying,\" Reiner tweeted. \"We love and respect Joe Biden. We acknowledge all he has done for our country. But Democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside.\"\n\nFor his part, Biden emphatically said last week -- ahead of his Stephanopoulos interview -- that he's staying in the race.\n\nBiden tweeted, \"Let me say this as clearly as I can: I'm the sitting President of the United States. I'm the nominee of the Democratic party. I'm staying in the race.\"", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Kimmel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Reiner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Reiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2024-07/mk-Joe-Biden-and-George-Clooney-1280-X-720-HERO-2-SPLIT.jpg?h=f55f7b2b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Today, he's calling for the nation's leader to exit the race.\n\nIn a New York Times op-ed published Wednesday, Clooney wrote of his love for the president in his position now, as the former vice president, a former senator and as his friend. But despite the \"lifelong Democrat\" still saying \"I believe in him,\" he doesn't believe the president can succeed at another term.\n\n\"In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced. But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time,\" Clooney wrote. \"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nPresident Biden and his campaign have insisted his shaky debate performance against Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump last month was just a \"bad night\" compounded by his having a cold, as he told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos in his first post-debate TV interview.\n\nBut Clooney is now just one of a chorus of big-name voices -- including author Stephen King, Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, director Rob Reiner and Abigail Disney -- who aren't convinced the Democrat can beat the Republican choice. At least eight members of Congress have agreed, and Clooney says even more are holding their tongue.\n\nRELATED STORY | In emphatic campaign speech, Biden says, 'I am running and going to win again'\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate,\" he wrote. \"This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nClooney insisted his call is \"about age. Nothing more,\" while asking top Democrats like Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries and Nancy Pelosy to ask President Biden to \"voluntarily step aside.\" He then mentioned Vice President Kamala Harris, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and California Gov. Gavin Newsom as possible replacements that could be chosen at the party's convention next month.\n\n\"Would it be messy? Yes. Democracy is messy. But would it enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out? It sure would,\" Clooney wrote.\n\nYet a replacement situation would prove to be an about-face for the Biden administration and his political allies. Earlier this week, the president sent a letter to congressional Democrats acknowledging the concerns of everyone from party leaders to voters, but vowed to stay in the race.\n\n\"I can respond to all this by saying clearly and unequivocally: I wouldn't be running again if I did not absolutely believe I was the best person to beat Donald Trump in 2024,\" the letter said.", "source": {"uri": "ksby.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSBY"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_arger@ksby.com", "name": "Alex Arger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_Center_for_the_Performing_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him.\"\n\nBut, Clooney added, the Biden he saw during the June 15 fundraiser, which also included former President Barack Obama, \"was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020.\"\n\n\"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney added, referencing Biden's faltering and disastrous performance at the June 27 presidential debate on CNN.\n\nThat statement was a stunning assessment of Biden's current state from someone who has interacted with the president privately -- that the way the president presented himself during that debate, which the White House and Biden campaign have alternatively blamed on a cold and a tiring travel schedule, was not an aberration.\n\nAsked for comment Wednesday, Biden's campaign pointed toward the letter the president wrote to members of Congress on Monday indicating he would remain in the race.\n\nClooney's opinion piece represents the biggest defection against Biden in Hollywood, which the party has long relied on for big-named support and money. It comes as a handful of Democrats in Congress have also publicly demanded Biden step aside due to persistent concerns about his age and mental acuity.\n\nThe fundraiser that Clooney headlined raised $28 million for Biden's reelection campaign, the most for the Democratic Party from a single event in history.\n\nIn the opinion piece, Clooney called on key Democrats -- naming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- to ask Biden to \"voluntarily step aside.\"\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president,\" Clooney warned, adding that the lawmakers he has spoken with privately shared this view.\n\nHe said the country deserves to hear from other politicians who are seen as potential replacements for Biden on the ticket, including Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Vice President Kamala Harris, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker.\n\nSaying \"the dam has broken,\" Clooney wrote \"we can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth.\"\n\nAlthough Clooney has been one of Biden's biggest bundlers, fractures in their relationship began showing before the high-profile fundraiser he hosted for the president. Clooney's wife, Amal Clooney, is an international human rights lawyer who was among the group of legal experts who asked the International Criminal Court to seek arrest warrants for both Israeli and Hamas leaders due to the continued war between those two factions.\n\nBiden forcefully criticized the ICC's efforts because of the implication of an equivalence between Israel and Hamas.\n\nClooney's opinion piece comes amid the most crucial week of Biden's reelection campaign, as cracks in the coalition of Democratic support behind Biden continued to grow. At least eight members of Congress from his own party have publicly asked Biden to step down from the ticket.\n\nClooney isn't the only prominent Hollywood Democrat who has asked Biden to step down. Rob Reiner, a Biden surrogate who attended a fundraiser alongside Harris after the debate, also called for the president to step aside.\n\n\"My friend George Clooney has clearly expressed what many of us have been saying. We love and respect Joe Biden. We acknowledge all he has done for our country. But Democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside,\" Reiner said in a post to social media platform X Wednesday in which he linked to Clooney's op-ed.\n\nReiner began his calls on Biden to step down earlier this week.\n\n\"It's time to stop [expletive] around. If the Convicted Felon wins, we lose our Democracy. Joe Biden has effectively served US with honor, decency, and dignity. It's time for Joe Biden to step down,\" he wrote Sunday.\n\nBiden is participating in high-stakes meetings with NATO allies on Wednesday and will hold a solo news conference -- his first since the debate -- on Thursday.\n\nCNN's Betsy Klein contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nClooney did not mince words about his belief that Biden cannot win a second term. \"We are not going to win in November with this president,\" he wrote. \"On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private.

His wife, Amal Clooney, was under threat of being sanctioned by the U.S. as an adviser to the International Criminal Court's investigation into possible war crimes committed by both Israel and Hamas. The White House eventually stepped back from the possibility of sanctioning the ICC, but Clooney still lodged a complaint. The actor reportedly called top Biden aide Steve Ricchetti to criticize Biden's use of the word \"outrageous\" in describing his wife's work. It seems as though the Biden team made it up to Clooney, though, as the actor co-hosted a fundraiser last month that raised $28 million for the president's war chest. Per the Washington Post, the Biden campaign \"disputed the notion that there were serious worries about Clooney dropping out of the fundraiser.\"\n\nDespite his personal feelings about Biden, Clooney made sure to reiterate his admiration for the president multiple times in his op-ed.

But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time.\"\n\nA self-described \"lifelong Democrat,\" Clooney last month co-hosted a star-studded fundraiser with Biden in Los Angeles, which also featured former president Barack Obama.\n\nThe Biden campaign said that the event brought in a record $28 million.\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010,\" Clooney wrote, referencing a famous hot-mic clip from Biden's vice presidency.\n\n\"He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney said -- a direct challenge to Biden's claim that his poor debate showing was a one-off.\n\n\"As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\"\n\nHe said that with Biden at the top of the ticket, Democrats \"are not going to win in November,\" will lose control of the Senate, and won't gain a majority in the House of Representatives.\n\n\"This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private,\" Clooney wrote.\n\n\"This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed.\"\n\n- Not a 'cult of personality' -\n\nHe also joined critics who have likened Democrats' hesitancy to jettison Biden to the Republican Party's unshakeable loyalty to Trump.\n\n\"We love to talk about how the Republican Party has ceded all power... to a single person who seeks to hold on to the presidency, and yet most of our members of Congress are opting to wait and see if the dam breaks,\" he said.\n\nBut with several lawmakers already openly calling for Biden to step aside and more expressing worries, \"the dam has broken,\" Clooney said, asking more come forward.\n\n\"Top Democrats -- Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi -- and senators, representatives and other candidates who face losing in November need to ask this president to voluntarily step aside.\"\n\nThe Oscar-winner brushed aside worries that Biden's exit would create chaos four months before an election in which the Democrats hope to keep Trump from power, and did not endorse a replacement candidate.\n\n\"We Democrats have a very exciting bench. We don't anoint leaders or fall sway to a cult of personality; we vote for a president,\" he said.\n\nThe party should hear from contenders such as Vice President Kamala Harris, Maryland Governor Wes Moore and others, Clooney wrote, \"then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.\"\n\nbur-des/bgs\n\nMore from this section\n\nVice Capital Markets Launches Integration

As a senator. As a vice president and as president,\" the former \"ER\" star wrote in his opinion piece. \"I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\"\n\n\"But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time,\" Clooney continued. \"None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010,\" referencing his offhanded 2010 remark to then-President Barack Obama about the passage of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020,\" Clooney added. \"He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nClooney expressed his fears that Biden's performance at last month's debate, which has sparked fear among Democrats in the days since, would translate to not only a return to Republican Donald Trump in November, but would quash hopes of retaking the House of Representatives and result in the U.S. Senate flipping to GOP control.\n\n\"This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private,\" Clooney charged. \"Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nAt least nine sitting congressional Democrats have publicly called on Biden to exit the race, despite his repeated insistence that he is staying on the ticket. While Democratic leaders and several other prominent figures have reiterated their support for the incumbent, the party is far from unified. Ex-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said earlier Wednesday that congressional Democrats are encouraging Biden Biden to make a decision soon about whether he's remaining in the race for the White House.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" Pelosi, D-Calif., said during an interview on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \"We're all encouraging him to to make that decision because time is running short.\" (A spokesperson for Pelosi later clarified that the California Democrat \"fully supports whatever President Biden decides to do\" and the party \"must turn our attention\" to defeating Trump.)\n\nClooney called on Pelosi and other leaders, namely Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., to ask Biden to step aside.\n\n\"It is disingenuous, at best, to argue that Democrats have already spoken with their vote and therefore the nomination is settled and done, when we just received new and upsetting information,\" he said. \"We all think Republicans should abandon their nominee now that he's been convicted of 34 felonies. That's new and upsetting information as well.\"\n\nClooney, the star of \"Oceans Eleven\" and \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?,\" praised the \"very exciting bench\" of Democrats as he pleaded for a new nominee, writing: \"We can easily foresee a group of several strong Democrats stepping forward to stand and tell us why they're best qualified to lead this country and take on some of the deeply concerning trends we're seeing from the revenge tour that Donald Trump calls a presidential campaign.\"\n\n\"Let's hear from [Maryland Gov.] Wes Moore and [Vice President] Kamala Harris and [Michigan Gov.] Gretchen Whitmer and [California Gov.] Gavin Newsom and [Kentucky Gov.] Andy Beshear and [Illinois Gov.] J.B. Pritzker and others,\" the former \"Batman\" wrote. \"Let's agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar. Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.\"\n\n\"Would it be messy? Yes,\" said Clooney, who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for \"Syriana\" in 2005. \"Democracy is messy. But would it enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out? It sure would. The short ramp to Election Day would be a benefit for us, not a danger. It would give us the chance to showcase the future without so much opposition research and negative campaigning that comes with these ridiculously long and expensive election seasons.\"\n\n\"This can be an exciting time for democracy, as we've just seen with the 200 or so French candidates who stepped aside and put their personal ambitions on hold to save their democracy from the far right,\" he concluded. \"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.\"\n\nClooney headlined a star-studded Hollywood fundraiser for Biden last month alongside Julia Roberts, Jimmy Kimmel and Obama that raised a record thirty-plus million dollars for the incumbent Democrat's campaign.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_Care_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Affordable Care Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

If anything, he's a huge supporter of the president.\n\nAt the end of the day though, Clooney is worried about Biden's age. After all, he's set to turn 82 this November.\n\n\"I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced,\" Clooney wrote. \"But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time.\"\n\nClooney then said that he believes the Democratic Party will lose if Biden is their nominee for the upcoming election. That's something he doesn't want to see happen.\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate,\" Clooney wrote. \"This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private.

Some Hollywood bigwigs, including Netflix cofounder Reed Hastings and IAC chairman Barry Diller, have also backed away from Biden.\n\nBiden has repeatedly declared that he's not going anywhere, but there are still murmurs in Washington and elsewhere about his standing. Before Clooney's column was published, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi notably ignored Biden's declaration that he was staying in the race during an interview on MSNBC. Seven House Democrats, including a pair of the chamber's most vulnerable incumbents, have called on Biden to step aside.\n\nThe president has tried to portray the backlash against him as simply \"the elites,\" something Clooney's public break will likely feed into. But the Academy-Award winner is more than just an A-lister. As he wrote, he's been a loyal Democrat. Clooney, Julia Roberts, and Barbra Streisand helped Biden raise roughly $30 million, a jaw-dropping sum, during a June fundraising event that also featured former President Barack Obama.\n\n\"I'm a lifelong Democrat; I make no apologies for that. I'm proud of what my party represents and what it stands for,\" Clooney wrote.\n\nHe added that he help put on, \"some of the biggest fund-raisers in my party's history. Barack Obama in 2012. Hillary Clinton in 2016.

And he's not alone.\n\nDespite being one of the many famous faces to endorse President Biden in the past -- and even very recently -- he has also seemed to grow skittish following the first Presidential debate of the season.\n\nBiden's 2024 reelection bid is a complex decision, for him and for America. It is also a vital one. Particularly as the grim specter of disgraced former president Donald Trump extends across the nation.\n\nJust last month, Clooney was co-hosting Biden fundraisers. Now, he's asking the \"hero\" POTUS to bow out.\n\nPresident Joe Biden should make way for a new nominee, George Clooney argues\n\nOn Wednesday, July 10, George Clooney wrote about President Biden and the 2024 election in a guest column in The New York Times.\n\n\"I love Joe Biden,\" Clooney began. \"As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him.\"\n\nHe then elaborated: \"Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\"\n\n\"But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time,\" George Clooney lamented pessimistically. \"None of us can.\"\n\nClooney expressed: \"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe big F-ing deal Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nBiden's first 2024 presidential debate with his opponent did not go well. And though the opposition party has made it clear in recent years that debates do not matter to them any more than personal conduct or a laundry list of crimes, the Democratic Party seems to lack the will to match that energy. Instead, pundits on the Left have been in a panic, metaphorically running around like headless chickens. And it seems that Clooney feels similarly.\n\nClooney wrote that this was about more than Biden's debate performance\n\nHis NYT op ed also mentioned that he did not find BIden's answers to George Stephanopoulos to adequately explain why he struggled during the debate.\n\nIronically, Stephanopoulos, was approached a day earlier by a stranger in NYC and asked for his thoughts on President Joe Biden's fitness for office.\n\n\"I don't think he can serve four more years,\" candidly replied the ABC News anchor, who had just sat down with Biden a few days earlier for his first on-camera television interview following the CNN presidential debate.\n\n\"Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw,\" Clooney alleged in his essay.\n\n\"We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign,\" Clooney expressed. \"The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before.\"\n\n\"As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One, or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question,\" George Clooney then claimed without evidence.\n\nHe highlighted his concern about how this is about more than the Oval Office. This is about retaking the House, about retaining the Senate -- vitally important in holding the line.\n\nAnd then there are state legislatures and governor races, all of which could fall victim to feckless, easily swayed voters who would let hand-wringing pundits or their own general lack of enthusiasm sway their votes -- or prevent them from voting at all. That's not quite how Clooney described it, but still.\n\nOther A-list actors of a certain age share his concerns\n\nClooney repeatedly emphasized that his issue with Biden is age -- and \"nothing more\" than that. And, of course, his fear that America cannot win in November with Biden at the helm.\n\nThat's likely true during this present news cycle. The fact that corporate media grows bored with a topic and moves on to something else is both a blessing and a curse.\n\nUltimately, Clooney may be right or wrong. Come a Second Term Biden or a new nominee, come victory or bitter defeat, there will be no end of hindsight arguments and \"told you so\" arguments. Squabbling is, as always, inevitable and self-defeating.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Michael Douglas appeared as a guest on The View. Though he was not there to address the (very new at the time) op ed, he did weigh in on George Clooney's argument.\n\n\"This is such a tough one. I adore the guy. Fifty years of public service, a wonderful guy, and this just happens to be one of these elections that's just so crucial,\" Douglas remarked.\n\nHe added: \"I don't necessarily worry about today or tomorrow but a year down the line, I worry. I am concerned.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehollywoodgossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Gossip"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_delott@thehollywoodgossip.com", "name": "Simon Delott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_View_(talk_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The View (talk show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Douglas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Douglas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air Force One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State legislature (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/0710_georgeclooney_header-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 735, "textEnd": 742}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

You can bet that White House and Team Biden staffers won't sing that tune today, not after George Clooney's op-ed in the New York Times. Clooney, a long-time supporter of Biden and the Democrat Party, just stripped both of their main post-debate spin -- the \"one bad night\" narrative.\n\nIt wasn't just a bad night, Clooney writes, and he should know -- because Biden was just as bad three weeks earlier at his fundraiser. And what's more, Clooney declares that he's done with the gaslighting:\n\nI love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\n\nBut the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\n\nWas he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\n\nClooney then accuses Democrat officeholders of a conspiracy of silence:\n\nWe are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\n\nJust how many elected Democrats does Clooney know? Most of them, probably, because he raises money for them constantly. That's damning information all on its own, underscoring the rank dishonesty of Democrats about Biden's condition. Although Clooney doesn't address it, it also raises questions about why the DNC opted to prevent any challenge to Biden in the primaries despite obvious evidence of his cognitive decline, going back to at least April 2022 when the Easter Bunny ordered Biden away from reporters on the White House lawn.\n\nWhat does Clooney want? He proposes what Jon Stewart proposed on Monday evening -- an emergency open convention. Clooney dismisses talk of difficulties and legal obstacles, not to mention that other Democrats and factions -- such as Big Labor -- have already lined up behind Biden:\n\nLet's hear from Wes Moore and Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom and Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker and others. Let's agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar. Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.\n\nWould it be messy? Yes. Democracy is messy. But would it enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out? It sure would.\n\nAll of this is predicated, however, on Clooney's \"hero\" withdrawing from the nomination. Biden has already made it clear he won't go quietly, or at all. Clooney's op-ed probably intends to shame Biden into changing his mind, but that's not going to change Biden's lifelong aspiration to this particular office and his grip on it. Nor will it change the fact that the Biden family businesses are all tied to Biden's grip on power, and that a withdrawal will put an end to the cashflow, permanently. And it also ignores that this will rip off the bandage on factional disputes that nearly derailed the Democrats in 2020 without any way to resolve them in a few short weeks of what would be merely a televised \"smoke filled back room\" to determine who wields the power within the party.\n\nThe time for Clooney to speak up was in 2023, or 2022, when public evidence made Biden's decline obvious to everyone. For that matter, why didn't Clooney himself speak up after the fundraiser, or immediately after the debate?

He's hosted several high-dollar Hollywood fundraisers, including for Biden last month.\n\nClooney argued the party should pick a new nominee at its convention next month, saying the process would be \"messy\" but \"wake up\" voters in the party's favor, mentioning Vice President Kamala Harris and Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gavin Newsom of California among those from who the country should now hear.\n\nFocusing much of his piece around Biden's age, Clooney noted differences he saw in the 81-year-old president during their recent Los Angeles event compared to years past.\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010,\" Clooney wrote. \"He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nLast month, Clooney, Julia Roberts and Barbra Streisand were among those who took the stage for a fundraiser that took in a record $30 million-plus for Biden, in hopes of energizing would-be supporters for a White House contest they said may rank among the most consequential in U.S. history.\n\nClooney isn't alone in his characterization of his recent exchange with Biden.\n\nA person who interacted closely with Biden described the president as vibrant and engaging at a fundraiser in March but, at the Los Angeles event months later, said they noticed a notable diminishment in Biden's presence.\n\nThe person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private interactions with the president, recalled being struck by how tired and \"out of it\" the president seemed during backstage conversations at the Los Angeles event, adding that they gave Biden the benefit of the doubt for not being as voluble and showing lower energy off-stage because he arrived in Los Angeles after traveling from Italy where he had attended an international summit.\n\nAsked for comment on Clooney's essay, Biden's campaign pointed to the president's letter to congressional Democrats earlier in the week vowing to stay in the race.\n\nHis team also disputed the actor's representation of Biden's demeanor during the Los Angeles fundraiser, with campaign officials who attended the event pointing out that the president stayed for more than three hours at the event, despite just having returned from Europe.\n\nLuminaries from the entertainment world have increasingly lined up to help Biden's campaign. Leading up to the fundraiser, Clooney's name appeared on numerous fundraising missives from the campaign, which he called \"the fight of our lives.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Clooney did not immediately return a message seeking comment on insight into his decision, when precisely he had made it or how recently he had spoken with Biden.\n\nBiden has refused to end his reelection bid after his weak debate performance against presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump on June 27.\n\nKinnard reported from Chapin, South Carolina.

who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private interactions with the president, recalled being struck by how tired and \"out of it\" the president seemed during backstage conversations at the Los Angeles event, adding that they gave Biden the benefit of the doubt for not being as voluble and showing lower energy off-stage because he arrived in Los Angeles after traveling from Italy where he had attended an international summit.\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here.\n\nLuminaries from the entertainment world have increasingly lined up to help Biden's

Clooney, who co-hosted a huge Hollywood fundraiser for Biden in June that raised a record $28 million, has seemingly changed his tune after Biden's disastrous performance in the first presidential debate against Donald Trump.\n\n\"I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president,\" Clooney wrote. \"I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals.

He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nClooney noted that Democrats have been \"all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign\" when it comes to Biden's aging. The Oscar winner said that Biden's post-debate interview with ABC News and George Stephanopoulos \"only reinforced\" that Biden should not be the Democratic nominee.\n\n\"This is about age. Nothing more,\" Clooney wrote. \"But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024,\" Clooney concluded.\n\nClooney is one of many Hollywood names who have now spoken out against Biden remaining the Democratic nominee, including Rob Reiner, Stephen King and Michael Moore. The latter said on a recent episode of his \"Rumble\" podcast that Biden's disastrous debate was \"the cruelest form of elder abuse I've ever been forced to watch.\"\n\n\"This is not about whether he's fit to serve another four years,\" Moore added about Biden. \"After what we saw on debate night, this is about whether he should serve another four days in the toughest job in the world. That's the question we should be asking. Leave Mr. Biden alone! Let him rest. Let him go home. He has done his job. Let him have his dignity. Please. Do him this favor.\"\n\nDuring his interview with ABC News following the debate, Biden pushed back against his critics and stressed he currently has no intention of dropping out of the presidential race.\n\nHead over to The New York Times' website to read Clooney's op-ed in its entirety.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nAwards Season Calendar (2024-2025): Key Dates and Timeline for Oscars, Emmys, Golden Globes, Grammys, SAG and More\n\nHere's Where To Buy Retro Arcade1Up Cabinets To Re-Live Your Childhood Online\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\nSign up for Variety's Newsletter.

They were willing to pretend that Biden was fine and competent so long as he hid from unscripted interactions (such as press conferences, which Biden has avoided for most of his presidency) and read off a teleprompter every once and a while.

Rolf Vennenbernd / picture alliance via Getty Images file\n\nActor George Clooney published a guest essay in The New York Times on Wednesday calling for Democratic leaders to coalesce behind a new presidential nominee amid mounting pressure from within the party for President Joe Biden to withdraw from the race.\n\nClooney, a major Democratic fundraiser, issued his call as prominent Democrats continue to step forward to question Biden's ability to win re-election against former President Donald Trump following the president's debate performance last month.\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010,\" Clooney wrote. \"He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nNBC News has reached out to the Biden campaign for comment.\n\nAmid Democratic handwringing in the days since the debate, Biden has defied calls to drop out and has dismissed polling broadly showing him trailing Trump in key states, although often within the margin of error.\n\nDemocratic donors, meanwhile, have been divided on how to chart a path forward on a nominee amid the dissension. Referring to the debate, Clooney, who called himself friend of Biden, wrote that party leaders \"need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw.

Today, he wrote a guest Op/Ed in the New York Times calling for his friend Joe Biden to drop out of the 2024 Presidential Race and for a new candidate to be named. Well after all, when you've lost George Clooney, there goes the money. Doctor Jill is stamping her tiny feet and shaking her tiny fists.\n\nClooney's Op-Ed begins with him telling us how much George Clooney has done for the Democrat Party in the column titled, \"I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee.\".\n\nI'm a lifelong Democrat; I make no apologies for that. I'm proud of what my party represents and what it stands for. As part of my participation in the democratic process and in support of my chosen candidate, I have led some of the biggest fund-raisers in my party's history. Barack Obama in 2012. Hillary Clinton in 2016. Joe Biden in 2020. Last month I co-hosted the single largest fund-raiser supporting any Democratic candidate ever, for President Biden's re-election. I say all of this only to express how much I believe in this process and how profound I think this moment is.\n\nDayum y'all, George Clooney is effing wonderful even if he does say so himself. He has deep, deep pockets and if he doesn't know where more deep, deep pockets are, his wife, Amal Clooney does.\n\nWith these next words, George Clooney becomes Brutus to Joe Biden's Caesar:\n\nI love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\n\nBut the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\n\nEt tu, Brute?\n\nHold up there Cowboy Clooney. \"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\" So Clooney knew and didn't say anything. Not for the good of his country, that's for sure. Clooney wouldn't have said squat, if Joe hadn't had a \"bad\" night. Not a patriot, eh George?\n\nWas he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\n\nTerrified of a second Trump term? What would Trump do? Build the economy so that people can afford to go to your sucky movies? Keep America's sons and daughters out of another foreign war? Keep them from being slaughtered in another Afghanistan-type withdrawal? For those of us military families, this is not a video game.\n\nGeorge Clooney knew and said not one damn word. And those of us who have seen it for four freaking years were abused and derided.\n\nThis next part is a hoot coming from people who lecture us about DEMOCRACY.\n\nIt is disingenuous, at best, to argue that Democrats have already spoken with their vote and therefore the nomination is settled and done, when we just received new and upsetting information. We all think Republicans should abandon their nominee now that he's been convicted of 34 felonies. That's new and upsetting information as well. Top Democrats -- Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi -- and senators, representatives and other candidates who face losing in November need to ask this president to voluntarily step aside.\n\nWe know the 34 felonies is a lot of bull, just like George Clooney saying that Biden's dementia is news. Clooney's Op-Ed and Pelosi on MSNBC. A crescendo is starting to build.\n\nNot for nothing but shouldn't the Dems return the Clooney raised money?", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julius Caesar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patriotism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air Force One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Wes Moore of Maryland, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois.\n\n\"Would it be messy? Yes. Democracy is messy. But would it enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out? It sure would,\" Clooney wrote. \"The short ramp to Election Day would be a benefit for us, not a danger. It would give us the chance to showcase the future without so much opposition research and negative campaigning that comes with these ridiculously long and expensive election seasons. This can be an exciting time for democracy, as we've just seen with the 200 or so French candidates who stepped aside and put their personal ambitions on hold to save their democracy from the far right.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020,\" Clooney concluded. \"We need him to do it again in 2024.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Kohl", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helmut Kohl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Bill_Clinton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nThe actor's blunt assessment comes at a critical time for Biden, who faces calls from more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers to bow out before it's too late. The New York Times editorial board has urged Biden to step aside in two separate op-eds, saying he has \"continued to appear as a man in decline\" in the wake of the debate.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, former House speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested Biden could still change his mind about his re-election bid and refused to say whether she personally feels the president should press on with his campaign.\n\n\"It's up to the president to [decide] if he's going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short,\" she insisted.\n\nClooney, a longtime supporter of the Democratic Party whose wife, Amal Clooney, is a prominent human rights attorney, insists he \"loves\" Biden as a senator, vice president, and president, praising the many \"battles\" he's won since taking office in January 2021.\n\nBut Biden's halting, often confused and generally low-energy appearance on an Atlanta debate stage opposite Trump was consistent with what he observed from the 81-year-old president when he hosted him at the record-breaking fundraising event last month, Clooney wrote.\n\nIt was reported last month that Clooney's attendance at that Los Angeles fundraiser was thrown into doubt after the actor directly called a top Biden aide to complain about the administration's rebuke of an international arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a case that his wife had backed. But the actor and the president have enjoyed a long and warm relationship, with Biden praising Clooney in 2022 for his \"deep empathy.\"\n\nIn his op-ed, Clooney said Democratic Party leaders need to stop \"telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw\" after the June 27 debate.\n\n\"We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign,\" he said.\n\n\"Is it fair to point these things out? It has to be. This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate,\" he continued, adding later that his opinion is shared by \"every senator and congress member and governor\" he has spoken to privately since the debate.\n\nThe actor and activist also compared the reaction from Democrats to how Republicans have ceded their party to Trump -- \"a single person who seeks to hold on to the presidency\" -- and chided members of Congress for \"opting to wait and see if the dam breaks\" rather than speaking up.\n\n\"We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaslighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amal_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amal Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/95b342c3a515052b84273c7cbda3b0c0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 2744, "textEnd": 2751}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nOn June 15, Clooney co-hosted a star-studded fundraiser for Biden at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles. The Biden campaign said the event raised a record-setting $28 million. In addition to Clooney, actress Julia Roberts was on hand for the event, along with Jack Black, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Jason Bateman and Kathryn Hahn. Jimmy Kimmel moderated a discussion between Biden and former President Barack Obama.\n\nElected officials in attendance included Gov. Gavin Newsom, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, and Reps.

Biden has worked in the days since the debate to reassure Democrats and voters about his commitment and ability to run the country, but Clooney wrote in his essay that he remains unconvinced.\n\n\"Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw.

Pritzker and others,\" Clooney wrote. \"Let's agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar.

Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel interviewed Biden and former President Barack Obama, who both stressed the need to defeat former President Donald Trump in a race that's expected to be exceedingly close.\n\nDuring more than half an hour of discussion, Kimmel asked if the country was suffering from amnesia about the presumptive Republican nominee, to which Biden responded, \"all we gotta do is remember what it was like\" when Trump was in the White House.\n\nLuminaries from the entertainment world have increasingly lined up to help Biden's campaign, and just how important the event was to his reelection bid could be seen in Biden's decision to fly through the night across nine time zones, from the G7 summit in southern Italy to Southern California, to attend.\n\nIn addition to Clooney urging Biden to drop out of the race, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would not explicitly throw her support behind him.\n\n[WATCH] Nancy Pelosi Asked If Joe Biden Has Her Support", "source": {"uri": "en-volve.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "enVolve"}, "authors": [{"uri": "a_m_smith@en-volve.com", "name": "A.M.

It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe big F-ing deal Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nOn June 15, Clooney co-hosted a star-studded fundraiser for Biden at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles. The Biden campaign said the event raised a record-setting $28 million. In addition to Clooney, actress Julia Roberts was on hand for the event, along with Jack Black, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Jason Bateman and Kathryn Hahn. Jimmy Kimmel moderated a discussion between Biden and former President Barack Obama.\n\nElected officials in attendance included Gov. Gavin Newsom, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, and Reps. Nanette Barrag\u00c3\u00a1n, D-San Pedro; Tony C\u00c3\u00a1rdenas, D-Pacoima, Robert Garcia, D-Long Beach, Ted Lieu, D-Torrance, Grace Napolitano, D-Norwalk, and Maxine Waters, D-Los Angeles.\n\nBut questions about Biden's stamina and presidential credentials have heightened following his woeful performance in a CNN debate against presumptive Republican candidate Donald Trump. Biden has worked in the days since the debate to reassure Democrats and voters about his commitment and ability to run the country, but Clooney wrote in his essay that he remains unconvinced.\n\n\"Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\n\n\"... This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and Congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nClooney did not offer an opinion on who should replace Biden as the Democratic candidate, but said there should be a process for potential candidates to make a case for themselves.\n\n\"Let's hear from Wes Moore and Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom and Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker and others,\" Clooney wrote. \"Let's agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar. Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.\"\n\nActor Rob Reiner, another major Democratic Party supporter, called on Biden to step aside over the weekend. In response to Clooney's essay, Reiner wrote on X, \"My friend George Clooney has clearly expressed what many of us have been saying. We love and respect Joe Bide. We acknowledge all he has done for our country. But Democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside.\"\n\nAnother major figure in the party, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, appeared on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Wednesday, suggesting that Biden -- despite his insistence about remaining in the race -- could still reconsider.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he's going to run,\" she said. \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\"\n\nPelosi declined on the show to explicitly endorse Biden, but called on other congressional members to \"hold off\" on making public statements about the incumbent.\n\n\"Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week,\" Pelosi said.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, whose name often surfaces as a presidential candidate, has continued to steadfastly support Biden. Newsom was in New Hampshire earlier this week on the Biden campaign trail, insisting that Biden \"is going to be our nominee.\"\n\nAccording to The Hill, Newsom spoke to Biden's campaign staff on a phone call this week, pumping up Biden's reelection bid.\n\n\"Every single event we had, every single stop we had, we exceeded expectations in terms of the number of people that showed up,\" Newsom said, according to The Hill. \"They're not giving into the cynicism. They're not giving into the fear. They're not giving into the anxiety. They're showing up because they care. They care about the work you're doing. They care about this president.\"", "source": {"uri": "mynewsla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My News LA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Lee_Ralph", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheryl Lee Ralph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julia Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Bateman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Bateman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Black", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_Hahn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kathryn Hahn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Kimmel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Garcia_(California_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Garcia (California politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxine_Waters", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maxine Waters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Lieu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ted Lieu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Reiner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Reiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Bass", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karen Bass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Napolitano", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grace Napolitano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air Force One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Why? Because of Biden's \"fight against time,\" which Clooney characterized as the only battle that POTUS cannot win.\n\n\"None of us can,\" Clooney wrote Wednesday in an opinion piece for the New York Times titled \"I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee.\" \"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F- deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nDemocrats took in $30 million at that downtown L.A. fundraiser, setting a record for money generated by the party in a single night. In addition to Clooney, Julia Roberts and former President Barack Obama headlined the event and Jimmy Kimmel acted as emcee.\n\nClooney wrote that Biden was a \"hero\" who had \"saved democracy\" in 2020 and called upon him to \"do it again in 2024.\" But, citing Biden's poor performance during CNN's debate last month, he joined a growing number of Hollywood backers, including those who previously wrote large checks to the campaign, feeling skittish about Biden's prospects despite the president's resolve to remain in the race.\n\nSome of those going public with their angst about Biden include \"Lost\" co-creator Damon Lindelof, Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, media titan Barry Diller, Disney heir Abigail Disney and Endeavor Chief Executive Ari Emanuel, brother of Rahm Emanuel, who is currently U.S. ambassador to Japan and formerly Obama's chief of staff. Filmmaker Rob Reiner wrote Wednesday on X (formerly Twitter) that \"Democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside.\"\n\nIn his op-ed, Clooney wondered if Biden was tired or suffering from a cold during his head-to-head with Trump. But he mostly took issue with the next-day narrative being spun by his party, arguing that Biden's nomination was not yet a sure thing ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August. (The GOP convention starts Monday.)\n\n\"[O]ur party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before,\" Clooney wrote. \"As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\"\n\nClooney said it's \"fair\" to point these things out: \"This is about age. Nothing more.\"\n\nHe predicted the Democrats are \"not going to win in November with this president,\" nor would they win the House of Representatives or retain their majority in the Senate. He said this isn't just his opinion, but \"the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\n\"[T]he dam has broken. We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth,\" the \"Argo\" and \"Syriana\" Academy Award winner wrote. \"It is disingenuous, at best, to argue that Democrats have already spoken with their vote and therefore the nomination is settled and done, when we just received new and upsetting information. We all think Republicans should abandon their nominee now that he's been convicted of 34 felonies.\"\n\nAs such, Clooney also criticized the presumptive Republican candidate and \"the revenge tour that Donald Trump calls a presidential campaign\" and called for the Democrats to seriously consider potential replacements. Who? Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Vice President Kamala Harris, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear or Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, he suggests.\n\n\"Let's agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar. Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.\"\n\nIt would be \"messy,\" he said, but \"democracy is messy\" and a fresh contest would \"enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Clooney said Wednesday that they had \"nothing to add\" and that the essay presented his thinking \"in its entirety.\"\n\nAlso on Wednesday morning, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., sent a rare public signal that suggested she is trying to nudge Biden to consider dropping out of the election, telling MSNBC that it's \"up to the president to decide if he is going to run\" and that \"we're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\"", "source": {"uri":

Barack Obama took Biden by the hand to lead him off the stage and the media tried to call video of the event a \"cheap fake,\" despite the fact those were the facts. It's just they didn't like to hear it at this point.\n\nNow, however, the boot suppressing the facts seems to have been lifted.

We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\n\nAnother blow to the \"cheap fake\" narrative - Clooney himself is confirming what we all saw at that fundraiser. Heck, it's what we've all seen for a long time at all kinds of events before Democrats like him started to admit it.\n\nIt isn't just \"one bad night,\" it's every day and night that is bad.\n\nThen why didn't he tell the truth when the \"cheap fake\" lie hit -- that he'd seen Biden wasn't up to it? He waited until after the debate, even though he knew.\n\nREAD MORE: Biden Has Another Embarrassing Moment at Fundraiser -- Obama Has to Intervene\n\nClooney owned up to the fact they are likely going to lose with Biden.\n\nWe are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly. [....]\n\nWe can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth.\n\nClooney said Democratic leaders like Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) had to tell.him to step aside.\n\nHe argues that it might be messy but they have a strong bench.\n\nUh, no, you don't, that's part of the problem. The possibles are also getting beaten by former President Donald Trump in the polls.\n\nDemocrats are caught between the devil they know and the deep blue sea of the chaos of trying to pick someone else. Clooney wants us to go around the votes for Biden because \"democracy,\" so the elites at the convention can pick someone else. So he's going to get some blowback for that position from the folks on the left till hanging with Biden, literally.\n\nBut this is going to be the big problem, even if Biden stays in. If people that supportive are throwing him under the bus, he's going to be losing even more folks. You need money to run and this is going to kill that money coming in.

As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\n\n\"But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe big F-ing deal Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nOn June 15, Clooney co-hosted a star-studded fundraiser for Biden at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles. The Biden campaign said the event raised a record-setting $28 million. In addition to Clooney, actress Julia Roberts was on hand for the event, along with Jack Black, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Jason Bateman and Kathryn Hahn. Jimmy Kimmel moderated a discussion between Biden and former President Barack Obama.\n\nElected officials in attendance included Gov. Gavin Newsom, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, and Reps. Nanette Barrag\u00c3\u00a1n, D-San Pedro; Tony C\u00c3\u00a1rdenas, D-Pacoima, Robert Garcia, D-Long Beach, Ted Lieu, D-Torrance, Grace Napolitano, D-Norwalk, and Maxine Waters, D-Los Angeles.\n\nBut questions about Biden's stamina and presidential credentials have heightened following his woeful performance in a CNN debate against presumptive Republican candidate Donald Trump. Biden has worked in the days since the debate to reassure Democrats and voters about his commitment and ability to run the country.\n\nBass, a longtime Biden supporter, issued a brief statement Wednesday reiterating her backing of the president.\n\n\"I was on a call with the president and mayors from across the country last night,\" Bass wrote on X. \"I'm supporting our nominee, President Joe Biden.\"\n\nNewsom, whose name often surfaces as a potential presidential candidate, has continued to steadfastly support Biden. Newsom was in New Hampshire earlier this week on the Biden campaign trail, insisting that Biden \"is going to be our nominee.\"\n\nAccording to The Hill, Newsom spoke to Biden's campaign staff on a phone call this week, pumping up Biden's reelection bid.\n\n\"Every single event we had, every single stop we had, we exceeded expectations in terms of the number of people that showed up,\" Newsom said, according to The Hill. \"They're not giving into the cynicism. They're not giving into the fear. They're not giving into the anxiety. They're showing up because they care. They care about the work you're doing. They care about this president.\"\n\nClooney wrote in his essay that he remains unconvinced about Biden's stamina.\n\n\"Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before.

Pritzker and others,\" Clooney wrote. \"Let's agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar. Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.\"\n\nActor Rob Reiner, another major Democratic Party supporter, called on Biden to step aside over the weekend. In response to Clooney's essay, Reiner wrote on X, \"My friend George Clooney has clearly expressed what many of us have been saying. We love and respect Joe Bide. We acknowledge all he has done for our country. But Democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back.

But she added, \"It's up to the president to decide if he's going to run.

But many more representatives and Senators are understood to privately believe that Biden, after his debate performance on June 27, was poised to lose to the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J Trump. Lawmakers fear that having Biden at the top of the presidential ticket will also have an adverse effect on prospects of Democratic candidates in Senate, House and even some state races.\n\nBiden also got another jolt on Wednesday when actor George Clooney, a lifelong Democrat who just hosted a fund-raiser for Biden last month, called on him to drop out in an essay on the New York Times.\n\n\"I love Joe Biden...But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time.

He underlined how critical it is to acknowledge the party's current circumstances and the requirement for a fresh, stronger candidate to spearhead the opposition to Trump.\n\nClooney said that despite their outward support for Biden, many Democratic senators and leaders secretly had worries similar to his own. Clooney claims that this feeling is indicative of a larger party disquiet regarding Biden's viability and the possible repercussions of another Trump presidency.\n\nLooking ahead, Clooney proposed several possible contenders, including Vice President Kamala Harris and several well-known governors, who might enter the campaign if Biden withdrew. He emphasized how critical it is to choose a candidate who can successfully oppose Trump and defend democratic principles.\n\nIn his concluding remarks, Clooney acknowledged Biden's prior achievements in democracy but emphasized the need for a leader who can take on the issues of the present.

He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nReached for comment, a Biden campaign spokeswoman pointed to the president's previous comments saying that he's staying in the race.\n\nAmid Democratic handwringing in the days since the debate, Biden has defied calls to drop out and has dismissed polling showing him trailing Trump, although broadly within the margin of error.\n\nDemocratic donors, meanwhile, have been divided on how to chart a path forward on a nominee amid the dissension. Referring to the debate, Clooney, who called himself friend of Biden, wrote that party leaders \"need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw.

Clooney praised the president and his character, but said that he was simply too old to run in an election with such high stakes.\n\n\"I love Joe Biden. As a senator.

Instead, Democrats seen as potential successors -- including Harris -- should make the case for themselves, he suggested, \"Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.\"\n\nThe actor's op-ed comes amid serious disarray among congressional Democrats about Biden's insistence on running in the election and how that could affect down-ballot races. It also comes just weeks after Clooney hosted a star-studded fundraiser with Biden's campaign in Los Angeles, raising almost $30 million for the president's re-election bid. (Biden had flown from Europe to Los Angeles for the event, and he said his intense travel schedule in the weeks leading up to the debate contributed to his exhaustion and poor performance.)\n\nClooney is a Hollywood powerhouse in Democratic politics, raising significant amounts of money for liberal causes and Democratic candidates. He supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, and Hillary Clinton in 2016. He also supported Biden's 2020 campaign -- and, until Wednesday, his 2024 campaign.\n\nClooney himself had previously ruled out a career in politics. In 2021, when asked by the BBC if he would ever consider running for office, he said, \"No, because I would actually like to have a nice life.\"", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2021-11/211105-george-clooney-ew-1158a-01744f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

None of us can,\" he wrote.\n\nClooney's plea came as Biden continues to insist on staying in the race while senior Democrats agonise about how to apply pressure on him to change his mind, and serious questions continue over Biden's health and viability for re-election.\n\nThe actor called on leading party figures to come off the fence and make the case to Biden, while dismissing as \"disingenuous\" the president's argument - stated in a letter to Democrats in Congress this week - that the party's membership had already chosen the nominee in the primaries.\n\n'Most of our members of Congress are opting to wait and see if the dam breaks,\" he wrote in remarks clearly critical of continuing inaction. \"But the dam has broken.

We need him to do it again in 2024.\"\n\nClooney's intervention comes weeks after a disagreement with the White House over Biden's criticism of the international criminal court's move to issue an arrest warrant for Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, over allegations of war crimes in Gaza.\n\nThe actor's wife, Amal Alamuddin Clooney, worked on the case. Clooney called Steve Ricchetti, the president's counsel, to complain about Biden's labeling the warrant as \"outrageous\".\n\nWarrants were being sought for the arrest of Yoav Gallant, Israel's defense minister, and three leaders of Hamas, which controls Gaza.\n\nShortly afterwards, however, Clooney appeared at a huge fundraising event in Los Angeles for the campaign, which headlined with Biden and Barack Obama.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ricchetti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Ricchetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amal_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amal Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian_Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian Democracy", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_the_guardian_uk_429/60c4bb764cef5f2ec034ccce64c8d69a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel interviewed Biden and former President Barack Obama, who both stressed the need to defeat former President Donald Trump in a race that's expected to be exceedingly close.\n\nDuring more than half an hour of discussion, Kimmel asked if the country was suffering from amnesia about the presumptive Republican nominee, to which Biden responded, \"all we gotta do is remember what it was like\" when Trump was in the White House.\n\nLuminaries from the entertainment world have increasingly lined up to help Biden's campaign, and just how important the event was to his reelection bid could be seen in Biden's decision to fly through the night across nine time zones, from the G7 summit in southern Italy to Southern California, to attend.\n\nIn addition to Clooney

As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\n\n\"But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe big F-ing deal Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nThere was no immediate reply to emails sent to the Biden-Harris campaign seeking a response to Clooney's comments.\n\nOn June 15, Clooney co-hosted a star-studded fundraiser for Biden at the Peacock Theater in downtown Los Angeles. The Biden campaign said the event raised a record-setting $28 million. In addition to Clooney, actress Julia Roberts was on hand for the event, along with Jack Black, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Jason Bateman and Kathryn Hahn. Jimmy Kimmel moderated a discussion between Biden and former President Barack Obama.\n\nElected officials in attendance included Gov. Gavin Newsom, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, and Reps. Nanette Barrag\u00c3\u00a1n, D-San Pedro; Tony C\u00c3\u00a1rdenas, D-Pacoima, Robert Garcia, D-Long Beach, Ted Lieu, D-Torrance, Grace Napolitano, D-Norwalk, and Maxine Waters, D-Los Angeles.\n\nBut questions about Biden's stamina and presidential credentials have heightened following his woeful performance in a CNN debate against presumptive Republican candidate Donald Trump. Biden has worked in the days since the debate to reassure Democrats and voters about his commitment and ability to run the country.\n\nBass, a longtime Biden supporter, issued a brief statement Wednesday reiterating her backing of the president.\n\n\"I was on a call with the president and mayors from across the country last night,\" Bass wrote on X. \"I'm supporting our nominee, President Joe Biden.\"\n\nNewsom, whose name often surfaces as a potential presidential candidate, has continued to steadfastly support Biden. Newsom was in New Hampshire earlier this week on the Biden campaign trail, insisting that Biden \"is going to be our nominee.\"\n\nAccording to The Hill, Newsom spoke to Biden's campaign staff on a phone call this week, pumping up Biden's reelection bid.\n\n\"Every single event we had, every single stop we had, we exceeded expectations in terms of the number of people that showed up,\" Newsom said, according to The Hill. \"They're not giving into the cynicism. They're not giving into the fear. They're not giving into the anxiety. They're showing up because they care. They care about the work you're doing. They care about this president.\"\n\nClooney wrote in his essay that he remains unconvinced about Biden's stamina.\n\n\"Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\n\n\"... This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and Congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nClooney did not offer an opinion on who should replace Biden as the Democratic candidate, but said there should be a process for potential candidates to make a case for themselves.\n\n\"Let's hear from Wes Moore and Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom and Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker and others,\" Clooney wrote. \"Let's agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar. Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.\"\n\nActor Rob Reiner, another major Democratic Party supporter, called on Biden to step aside over the weekend. In response to Clooney's essay, Reiner wrote on X, \"My friend George Clooney has clearly expressed what many of us have been saying. We love and respect Joe Bide. We acknowledge all he has done for our country. But Democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside.\"\n\nAnother major figure in the party, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, appeared on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" program Wednesday, suggesting that Biden -- despite his insistence about remaining in the race -- could still reconsider.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he's going to run,\" she said. \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\"\n\nPelosi declined on the show to explicitly endorse Biden, but called on other congressional members to \"hold off\" on making public statements about the incumbent.\n\n\"Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week,\" Pelosi said.\n\nAnother prominent Southland Democrat, Los Angeles County Supervisor Janice Hahn, told KNX News Wednesday morning she's still behind Biden.\n\n\"I'm supporting him. I'm going to vote for him,\" Hahn said. \"I think Democrats should line up and say we're voting for Joe Biden. Just like the Republicans are lining up and saying we're voting for a convicted felon.\n\n\"I do think Joe Biden does need to own being old, and I think he needs to say, 'We're both old.' President Trump and President Biden are both older, and there's nothing wrong with that,\" she said.\n\nBiden is scheduled to attend a fundraiser in Laguna Beach on July 26.", "source": {"uri": "mynewsla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My News LA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Bass", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karen Bass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Downtown Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Garcia_(California_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Garcia (California politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryl_Lee_Ralph", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheryl Lee Ralph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julia Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Black", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_Hahn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kathryn Hahn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Kimmel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxine_Waters", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maxine Waters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Lieu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ted Lieu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Napolitano", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grace Napolitano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

On Wednesday, Nancy Pelosi urged him to \"make a decision quickly\" on the presidential race.\n\nThe former speaker of the house said on MSNBC she was encouraging her colleagues on Capitol Hill with concerns about Mr Biden to refrain from airing them while he hosts Nato leaders in Washington this week.\n\n\"I've said to everyone: let's just hold off. Whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately, but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week,\" she said.\n\nShe also declined to say that she wanted Mr Biden to run. \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do,\" she said. \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\"\n\nMr Biden's campaign referred to a letter Biden sent Democrats in Congress that said he was \"firmly committed\" to staying in the race and beating Trump. It also noted Pelosi's remark on Tuesday that she had \"always been committed\" to Biden.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "victoria_craw@inews.co.uk", "name": "Victoria Craw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups/Twelve_Step", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups/Twelve Step", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SEI_212266533.jpg?w=1200&h=675&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

But We Need a New Nominee.\"\n\nThe star, who said Biden was his first choice in 2016 election and who excused the president's slipping poll numbers in 2021, comparing Biden to a \"battered child\" on his first day of school, finally crossed the Rubicon on Wednesday.\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president,\" he declared.\n\n\"I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals.

It was very, very, very unnerving,\" Favreau's podcast co-host Tommy Vietor, who was also at the fundraiser, recalled.\n\nClooney added that \"every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private\" concurred with him that Biden was a liability not only for the presidency. \"We won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate,\" if he stays at the top of the ticket, he added.\n\n\"Most of our members of Congress are opting to wait and see if the dam breaks. But the dam has broken. We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth.\" Clooney wrote, specifically addressing Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Rep. Nancy Pelosi to call on Biden to step aside.\n\nI've Seen Joe Biden Up Close. Nobody Can Deny His Decline.\n\nClooney also floated Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Vice President Kamala Harris as \"strong\" alternates who should be \"stepping forward to stand and tell us why they're best qualified to lead this country.\"\n\n\"Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.\" Clooney suggested. \"Would it be messy? Yes. Democracy is messy. But would it enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out? It sure would.\"\n\nClooney closed the letter with praise for the president: \"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020.

I'm proud of what my party represents and what it stands for. As part of my participation in the democratic process and in support of my chosen candidate, I have led some of the biggest fund-raisers in my party's history,\" he wrote. \"Barack Obama in 2012. Hillary Clinton in 2016. Joe Biden in 2020. Last month I co-hosted the single largest fund-raiser supporting any Democratic candidate ever, for President Biden's re-election. I say all of this only to express how much I believe in this process and how profound I think this moment is.\"\n\n\"I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him,\" the actor continued. \"Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\"\n\nHis love of the president isn't enough to keep him from stating the obvious.\n\n\"But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney admits.\n\nThe actor blames fear of Trump for people choosing to ignore \"warning signs,\" but the debate was a problem even the most proficient spinmeister couldn't explain away.\n\n\"Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, Clooney admitted a reality that many Democrats were forced to confront in the days following the debate: Biden can't win.\n\n\"Is it fair to point these things out? It has to be. This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president,\" he wrote. \"On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nHe then pointed to some popular names in leftist circles as potential replacements for POTUS.\n\n\"Let's hear from Wes Moore and Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom and Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker and others. Let's agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar. Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.\"\n\nIn closing out his piece, Clooney called Joe Biden a \"hero\" who \"saved democracy in 2020,\" and wrote that the president needs to step down as a way to \"do it again in 2024.\"\n\nX users weighed in on the piece:\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Barack Obama took Biden by the hand to lead him off the stage and the media tried to call video of the event a \"cheap fake,\" despite the fact those were the facts. It's just they didn't like to hear it at this point.\n\nNow, however, the boot suppressing the facts seems to have been lifted. Not only that, we now have a bit of a stunning op-ed from George Clooney, saying Democrats need a new nominee, not Biden.\n\nBut the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\n\nWas he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\n\nAnother blow to the \"cheap fake\" narrative - Clooney himself is confirming what we all saw at that fundraiser. Heck, it's what we've all seen for a long time at all kinds of events before Democrats like him started to admit it.\n\nIt isn't just \"one bad night,\" it's every day and night that is bad.\n\nThen why didn't he tell the truth when the \"cheap fake\" lie hit -- that he'd seen Biden wasn't up to it? He waited until after the debate, even though he knew.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nClooney owned up to the fact they are likely going to lose with Biden.\n\nWe are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly. [....]\n\nWe can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth.\n\nClooney said Democratic leaders like Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) had to tell.him to step aside.\n\nHe argues that it might be messy but they have a strong bench.\n\nUh, no, you don't, that's part of the problem. The possibles are also getting beaten by former President Donald Trump in the polls.\n\nDemocrats are caught between the devil they know and the deep blue sea of the chaos of trying to pick someone else. Clooney wants us to go around the votes for Biden because \"democracy,\" so the elites at the convention can pick someone else. So he's going to get some blowback for that position from the folks on the left till hanging with Biden, literally.\n\nBut this is going to be the big problem, even if Biden stays in. If people that supportive are throwing him under the bus, he's going to be losing even more folks. You need money to run and this is going to kill that money coming in.

Why? Because of Biden's \"fight against time,\" which Clooney characterized as the only battle that POTUS cannot win.\n\n\"None of us can,\" Clooney wrote Wednesday in an opinion piece for the New York Times titled \"I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee.\" \"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F -- deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nDemocrats took in $30 million at that downtown L.A. fundraiser, setting a record for money generated by the party in a single night. In addition to Clooney, Julia Roberts and former President Obama headlined the event and Jimmy Kimmel acted as emcee.\n\nClooney wrote that Biden was a \"hero\" who had \"saved democracy\" in 2020 and called upon him to \"do it again in 2024.\" But, citing Biden's poor performance during CNN's debate last month, he joined a growing number of Hollywood backers, including those who previously wrote large checks to the campaign, feeling skittish about Biden's prospects despite the president's resolve to remain in the race.\n\nSome of those going public with their angst about Biden include \"Lost\" co-creator Damon Lindelof, Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, Endeavor Chief Executive Ari Emanuel (brother of Rahm Emanuel, currently U.S. ambassador to Japan), media titan Barry Diller and Disney heir Abigail Disney.\n\nThe actor wondered if Biden was tired or suffering from a cold during his head-to-head with Trump. But he mostly took issue with the next-day narrative being spun by his party, arguing that Biden's nomination was not yet a sure thing ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August. (The GOP convention starts Monday.)\n\n\"[O]ur party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign.

Nothing more.\"\n\nHe predicted the Democrats are \"not going to win in November with this president,\" nor would they win the House of Representatives or retain their majority in the Senate. He said this isn't just his opinion, but \"the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\n\"[T]he dam has broken. We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth,\" the \"Argo\" and \"Syriana\" Academy Award winner wrote. \"It is disingenuous, at best, to argue that Democrats have already spoken with their vote and therefore the nomination is settled and done, when we just received new and upsetting information. We all think Republicans should abandon their nominee now that he's been convicted of 34 felonies.\"\n\nAs such, Clooney also criticized the presumptive Republican candidate and \"the revenge tour that Donald Trump calls a presidential campaign\" and called for the Democrats to seriously consider potential replacements.

But by joining the whimpering chorus of Democrats calling for Biden to step aside after his disastrous debate performance, Clooney is taking on a noted grudge-holder in Joe Biden. Their relationship has been a little tense for over a couple months now.\n\nBefore May, Clooney was in lockstep with the Biden campaign, bundling millions for his effort in 2020 -- as he did for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama (a friend) before him. But two months ago, Amal Clooney, the esteemed human rights lawyer who happens to be the actor's wife, sat on a review board that essentially greenlit the International Criminal Court prosecutor's decision to apply for a warrant to charge Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant with war crimes over the invasion in Gaza. (A recent calculation by The Lancet puts the civilian death toll in Gaza at around 186,000 people, roughly 8 percent of the territory's population.) As the administration supplying Israel with its munitions to carry out the war, the Biden camp wasn't thrilled by this action, coming from an international body that the U.S. is not even a party to. White House officials called the decision an \"overreach,\" while Secretary of State Antony Blinken reportedly told Republican Senator Lindsay Graham he would \"welcome working with you\" on sanctioning ICC members.\n\nWith the prospect of his wife facing sanctions by the U.S. government, the Washington Post reported that Clooney texted Biden fundraiser and adviser Steve Ricchetti to express his concerns -- and hinted that his support of the president was not unconditional. It appears that the beef was partially resolved: In June, Clooney hosted a star-studded event for Biden's reelection\n\nthat raised $28 million. But after Oldgate, Clooney went in on just the issues. \"Is it fair to point these things out?\" Clooney asked in his op-ed. \"It has to be. This is about age. Nothing more.\"\n\nWith presidential powers at an all-time high, thanks to the Supreme Court, we would advise that Clooney does not take any un-chaperoned drives upstate anytime soon.", "source": {"uri": "nymag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NYMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_stieb@nymag.com", "name": "Matt Stieb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gallant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yoav Gallant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amal_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amal Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lancet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Lancet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ricchetti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Ricchetti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c7b/35a/f77c5eaf1848f9fb7646c358983fe2aea3-biden-clooney.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

In the op-ed, Clooney said that the Biden he saw at a June 15 fundraising event for the president's reelection bid was the same Biden at the debate, referring to his mental difficulties. (RELATED: 'That Is The End Of It': Former Clinton Pollster Says Dems Would 'Commit Suicide' By Trying To Replace Biden)\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney wrote.\n\nDespite Clooney's admission that Biden appeared in decline at the June fundraiser, his op-ed was published on July 10.\n\n\"Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw,\" Clooney added. \"We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before.\"\n\nDuring an interview with ABC News host George Stephanopoulos, a former Clinton administration official, Biden repeatedly dismissed polls showing him trailing Trump.\n\nBiden's age and mental fitness were issues dogging the president's campaign before the June 27 debate. On multiple occasions, Biden said he spoke with people who had died, including claiming Feb. 8 to have spoken with former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, even though Kohl died in 2017.\n\n\"It is disingenuous, at best, to argue that Democrats have already spoken with their vote and therefore the nomination is settled and done, when we just received new and upsetting information,\" Clooney wrote. \"We all think Republicans should abandon their nominee now that he's been convicted of 34 felonies. That's new and upsetting information as well. Top Democrats -- Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi -- and senators, representatives and other candidates who face losing in November need to ask this president to voluntarily step aside.\"\n\nClooney said that the Democrats should turn to \"a very exciting bench\" that included Vice President Kamala Harris, Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Gov. J.B. Pritzker of Illinois. (RELATED: CNN Data Guru Says He Would 'Take A Roll Of The Dice' On Kamala Harris If He Were Dem Donor)\n\n\"Would it be messy? Yes. Democracy is messy. But would it enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out? It sure would,\" Clooney wrote. \"The short ramp to Election Day would be a benefit for us, not a danger. It would give us the chance to showcase the future without so much opposition research and negative campaigning that comes with these ridiculously long and expensive election seasons. This can be an exciting time for democracy, as we've just seen with the 200 or so French candidates who stepped aside and put their personal ambitions on hold to save their democracy from the far right.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020,\" Clooney concluded. \"We need him to do it again in 2024.\"\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, Disney heir Abigail Disney, and filmmaker Rob Reiner have also urged Biden to withdraw.\n\nClooney recommended that the Democratic Party choose a new nominee at its August convention, mentioning Vice President Kamala Harris and several state governors as potential candidates.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abigail_Disney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abigail Disney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Reiner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Reiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed_Hastings", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reed Hastings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/20_12_2023_13_37_33_4955347.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nThe actor's blunt assessment comes at a critical time for Biden, who faces calls from more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers to bow out before it's too late. The editorial board of The New York Times has also urged Biden to step aside in two separate op-eds, saying he has \"continued to appear as a man in decline\" in the wake of the debate.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested that Biden could still change his mind about his re-election bid, as she refused to say whether she personally felt that the president should press on with his campaign.\n\n\"It's up to the president to [decide] if he's going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short,\" she insisted.\n\nClooney, who is a longtime supporter of the Democratic Party, and whose wife, Amal, is a prominent human rights lawyer, spoke of his \"love\" for Biden as a senator, vice-president and president, praising the many \"battles\" the White House incumbent has won since taking office in January 2021.\n\nBut he suggested that Biden's halting, often confused, and generally low-energy appearance on an Atlanta debate stage opposite Trump was consistent with what he had observed when he hosted the president at the record-breaking fundraising event last month.\n\nIt was reported in June that Clooney's attendance at that Los Angeles fundraiser had been thrown into doubt after the actor directly called a top Biden aide to complain about the administration's rebuke over the issuing of an international arrest warrant for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a case that his wife had backed. But the actor and the president have enjoyed a long and warm relationship, with Biden praising Clooney in 2022 for his \"deep empathy\".\n\nIn his op-ed, Clooney said Democratic Party leaders needed to stop \"telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw\" after the 27 June debate.\n\n\"We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign,\" he said.\n\n\"Is it fair to point these things out? It has to be. This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate,\" he continued, adding later that his opinion was shared by \"every senator and congress member and governor\" he had spoken to privately since the debate.\n\nThe actor and activist also compared the behaviour of Democrats to the way in which Republicans have ceded their party to Trump - \"a single person who seeks to hold on to the presidency\" - and chided members of Congress for \"opting to wait and see if the dam breaks\" rather than speaking up.\n\n\"We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaslighting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/95b342c3a515052b84273c7cbda3b0c0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 2844, "textEnd": 2851}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\n\n\"But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time.\"\n\nMr Biden's re-election effort has been under intense scrutiny since a disastrous performance in a debate with Trump last month.\n\nThe president, 81, has so far resisted calls to step down, including from some in his own party, saying he is \"firmly committed\" to staying in the race - and urging his fellow Democrats to put the debate to rest.\n\nBut Clooney wrote: \"This is about age.

His co-host Tommy Vietor, a former spokesperson for the Obama administration, added that the event was \"chilling, it was very, very, very unnerving.\"\n\nThe hosts pointed out that recent incidents like the fundraiser and the debate had fundamentally changed the calculus of Biden's nomination, a sentiment that Clooney echoed in his piece for the Times.\n\n\"It is disingenuous, at best, to argue that Democrats have already spoken with their vote and therefore the nomination is settled and done, when we just received new and upsetting information,\" he wrote.\n\nClooney is not the only prominent Hollywood Democrat to call on Biden to step down from his campaign.\n\nActor and director Rob Reiner wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that \"It's time to stop fucking around/ If the Convicted Felon wins, we lose our Democracy. Joe Biden has effectively served US with honor, decency, and dignity. It's time for Joe Biden to step down,\"\n\nEarlier this week, author and longtime Democrat Stephen King wrote on X that \"Joe Biden has been a fine president, but it's time for him -- in the interests of the America he so clearly loves -- to announce he will not run for re-election.\"\n\nOscar-winning film director Michael Moore accused those advising the president to stay in the race of \"elder abuse,\" during Monday's episode of his Rumble podcast. \"He was in epic distress [during the debate],\" Moore said. \"Every cognitive default in his mind seemed to be shutting down.

This is a famous actor and Democratic donor\n\nGeorge Clooney, actor, director, and Casamigo, has called for President Joseph Biden to step down in The New York Times. A proud Democrat who loves Joe Biden, Clooney considers Biden a friend, and like any good friend, he's telling him to quit his job because he's old. Clooney has long been the brave face of Tinseltown, where people talked about AIDS when it was \"just being whispered\" and Civil Rights when \"it wasn't really popular.\" He co-hosted \"the single largest fund-raiser supporting any Democratic candidate ever.\" But all that money can't stop time.\n\n\"The one battle he cannot win is the fight against time,\" Clooney writes. \"None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nSince the debate, Biden hasn't improved his perception within the party, and his unforced errors, like the Stephenopolis interview, have only made things worse. Meanwhile, the media has run with the \"Incumbent presidential candidate is weaker than three-day-old dog shit\" narrative, scaring the hell out of Democratic voters. If only someone had called for him to step aside earlier, say, over the ongoing war in Gaza, or the 2020 primary when a contingent of voters reminded our gerontocracy that this guy would be eighty-fucking-one in 2024.\n\nBeing a large-scale Democratic donor, Clooney has access to the real gossip. \"Every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private\" doesn't think Biden can do the job \"irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\" Currently, no one calling for him to step down has shown us what this process might look like because there is no historical precedent. There are no procedures or guidelines to follow. But, despite asking the party to wander into uncertainty, Clooney doesn't want us to worry. The actor is sure \"all of the scary stories that we're being told about what would happen next are simply not true.\" The money that Clooney collected for Biden would \"help elect the presidential ticket and other Democrats. The new nominee wouldn't be left off ballots in Ohio.\" That's all well and good, but he's not exactly presenting a path to get there other than \"let's hear from Wes Moore and Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom and Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker and others.\" Okay, then what?\n\nWith four months until the election, Clooney believes the time crunch would be a \"benefit to us, not a danger,\" giving \"us a chance to showcase the future without so much opposition research and negative campaigning.\" That's a rosy way of looking at a party currently negatively campaigning against its own candidate. At least the debacle gave an overzealous conservative movement the confidence to reveal its terrifying and unpopular Project 2025 transition platform.\n\nWe at The A.V. Club are not political experts. We joke about Crazy Frog and watch all the Minions movies for fun and torture. We speak confidently about these things because we spend lots of time thinking about them.

As such, many are suggesting Biden be swapped out with a different candidate, with some polling data indicating Vice President Kamala Harris could beat former President Donald Trump in a possible matchup.\n\nHere are the latest celebrities to ask Biden to step aside ahead of the November election:\n\nActor George Clooney is perhaps the biggest celebrity to ask Biden to call it quits, writing in an op-ed that Biden is unable to win the battle against time and is no longer \"the Joe Biden of 2020.\"\n\nThe publishing of the op-ed comes only about a month after Clooney hosted a fundraiser for Biden's campaign. The fundraiser also featured actress Julia Roberts, actor Jack Black, and several other celebrities, and raised $28 million.\n\nThe director of iconic films such as The Princess Bride and When Harry Met Sally has also suggested Biden step aside, referencing how Clooney \"expressed what many of us have been saying.\" A frequent critic of Trump, Reiner argued that \"Democracy is facing an existential threat\" in the election, and the Democratic Party needs \"someone younger to fight back.\"\n\nOn Monday, Reiner stated Biden should make public appearances in the same way he appeared on his Morning Joe interview, as that would \"shut up people like me\" who want him replaced. The day prior, he claimed it was time to \"stop f***ing around\" and have Biden step down.\n\nDouglas, who once played a president in The American President, said Clooney made \"a valid point\" in asking Biden to step aside, adding that he was \"deeply concerned\" about the outcome of the election. He also argued that the Democratic Party has \"a lot of talent,\" possibly in reference to replacements for Biden.\n\nEarlier this year, Douglas became one of several actors to play a president to appear in a video giving the president advice for his State of the Union address.\n\nThe co-host of the Pod Save America, and former aide to former President Barack Obama, said he was not surprised Clooney said, at the fundraiser, that Biden was not the same Biden at the debate, citing how he himself was at Clooney's fundraiser and saw it for himself. He added that Clooney is \"exactly right\" and everyone else at the fundraiser believed the same.\n\nIn recent days, other celebrities, such as author Stephen King, have said Biden should step aside. Elon Musk, owner of X, has increased his criticism of Biden but said he would not donate to Biden or Trump's campaign.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nNumerous Democratic lawmakers are also calling for Biden to step down as the Democratic Party's presidential nominee, including Reps. Pat Ryan (D-NY), Adam Smith (D-WA), and Lloyd Doggett (D-TX).\n\nDespite these growing calls, Biden has insisted that he will not step down, stating during a television appearance Monday that he was \"so frustrated by the elites\" asking him to step aside. He also offered Democrats concerned about him to \"challenge me\" at the Democratic National Convention.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "asher_notheis@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Asher Notheis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julia Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Black", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pod_Save_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pod Save America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Doggett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lloyd Doggett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/President-Biden-scaled.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nClooney was one of the most high-profile personalities to participate in a record-breaking $30 million fundraiser in Los Angeles last month to support the 46th president's reelection bid.\n\nHe wrote in his op-ed that while he considers Biden a friend, but believes the octogenarian is losing \"the fight against time.\"\n\nThe backlash against Biden began after the 81-year-old president bombed during a June 27 debate with Trump. The Democratic stalwart showed few signs of mental acuity.\n\nHe became confused while answering questions and offered little resistance as his opponent rattled off a steady stream of disinformation during that 90-minute debacle.\n\nEarlier this week, progressive horror novelist Stephen King and left-leaning filmmaker Rob Reiner publicly called for Biden to make room for another Democratic nominee to challenge Donald Trump in November.\n\nAccording to Clooney, he has privately spoken to lawmakers and governors who agree Biden isn't up for the task of defeating Trump. Biden and his surrogates insist the incumbent is staying in the race and will again defeat the GOP challenger he trounced in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nDespite calling on Biden to bow out of the race, it's unlikely Clooney would support Trump under any circumstances.

As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. ... In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced,\" Clooney wrote.\n\nAxios noted that Biden had been begging donors to stay at his side, yet a lot of the Hollywood ones have pulled out, or said they wouldn't donate to Biden anymore.\n\nNow that Clooney has gone public, the latest et tu Brute, the most likely explanation is that the Hand of Obama is behind this about-face, as podcaster Stephen L. Miller noted. Clooney and Obama have always been particularly close, both infatuated with the Hollywood glamour factor.\n\nWhat's vivid here is what's happening. Clooney hosted the biggest fundraiser Biden had, raising $28 million for the old fool less than a month ago.\n\nNow he's saying he sees how senile Joe Biden is, and thus, has changed his mind. He didn't know that Biden was in this condition as he handed him $28 million dollars?\n\nThat fundraiser, recall, featured this two-step that happened in front of the Cloonster's very eyes:\n\nWhat a flaming hypocrite. Of course, Clooney knew. He just seemed upset that voters now knew.\n\nAnd he was hardly the first to call on Biden to step down, he waited until all the moneybags had closed their knapsacks, and then he said Biden needed to go.\n\nHe may consider Biden a friend, but he doesn't exactly sound like one when the 'in crowd' is going someplace else, and Obama gets out his pen and his phone. He's a Hollywood \"friend,\" it seems.\n\nWhether Biden gets the cash now, I can't say.\n\nBut I am guessing that this betrayal will cheese the Bidens off, since old Joe did change U.S. foreign policy just for George, who was concerned that his U.K. citizen wife would face U.S. sanctions over the recent International Criminal Court measure to arrest the prime minister of Israel over the Gaza war and get her U.S. visa yanked. Joe was for sanctioning the ICC for its meddling, before he was against it. I wrote about that here.\n\nAnd the fundraising went through, Clooney obviously cognizant of Biden's state, along with anyone else who watched the thing.\n\nNow he's calling for Biden to get out. That's some gratitude for changing U.S. foreign policy to please George and scarf up the money.\n\nDon't be surprised to see Biden change U.S. foreign policy yet again to get wifey Amal sanctioned. The quid pro quo will be blindingly obvious, along with the evidence that Clooney knew all about Biden's bad shape even as he sought money from others for Joe.\n\nThen Obama will plot another stab in the back for Joe.\n\nWhat a lovely presidency this is shaping up to be. /s", "source": {"uri": "americanthinker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Thinker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Deere", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Deere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beverly Hills, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverly Hills, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quid_pro_quo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quid pro quo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://images.americanthinker.com/wv/wvt9rwnxuo4eyqutslva_800.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 245, "textEnd": 252}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\n\nThe actor wrote, \"The one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010.\"\n\nThis revelation comes after Clooney and other Hollywood A-listers helped Biden raise an eye-watering $28 million at a Los Angeles fundraiser last month. The event, which took place at the Peacock Theater, saw late-night host Jimmy Kimmel interviewing Biden and former President Barack Obama.\n\nHowever, no amount of Hollywood glamour could hide Biden's frailty. After the fundraiser ended, Obama had to physically guide Biden off stage - a scene that has since been widely circulated and criticized.\n\nWhite House Senior Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates defended Biden in comments that attacked the New York Post and other conservative websites for its reporting on the incident.\n\n\"Fresh off being fact checked by at least 6 mainstream outlets for lying about @POTUS with cheap fakes, Rupert Murdoch's sad little super pac, the New York Post, is back to disrespecting it's readers & itself once again. Their ethical standards could deal with a little unfreezing,\" he wrote.\n\n\"By pretending the President taking in an applauding crowd for a few seconds is somehow wrong, all they're really admitting is - once again - is they can't take on the leadership that's fueling the strongest economic growth in the world & bringing violent crime to a 50 year low.\"\n\nWhite House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre expressed her frustration over the growing trend of \"edited videos\" designed to make the President appear frail or mentally confused and called it cheap fake video.\n\n\"I think you all have called this the cheap fakes video, and that's exactly what they are. They are cheap, fake videos. They are done in bad faith. And some of your news organizations have been very clear, have stressed that the right-wing critiques of the President have a credibility problem because the fact checkers have repeatedly caught them pushing misinformation, disinformation. And so we see this, and this is something coming from your part of the world, calling them cheap fakes and misinformation,\" Pierre said.\n\nNow, suddenly, a growing chorus of voices is calling for Biden to step aside from this year's presidential election. Don't be fooled; they knew that Joe Biden is old, feeble, and senile.\n\nIn his op-ed, Clooney calls for Biden to \"voluntarily step aside,\" saying, \"I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee.\"\n\nClooney wrote:\n\nI'm a lifelong Democrat; I make no apologies for that. I'm proud of what my party represents and what it stands for. As part of my participation in the democratic process and in support of my chosen candidate, I have led some of the biggest fund-raisers in my party's history. Barack Obama in 2012. Hillary Clinton in 2016. Joe Biden in 2020. Last month I co-hosted the single largest fund-raiser supporting any Democratic candidate ever, for President Biden's re-election. I say all of this only to express how much I believe in this process and how profound I think this moment is.\n\nI love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\n\nBut the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\n\nWas he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\n\nIs it fair to point these things out? It has to be. This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\n\nRead more here.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Gateway Pundit.com.", "source": {"uri": "wnd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WND"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Press secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Kimmel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Murdoch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rupert Murdoch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air Force One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/george-clooney-joe-biden-julia-roberts-barack-obama-1600x900.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

In a bluntly-worded guest op-ed in the New York Times, Clooney made clear he thinks President Biden should bow out, and the result is intense conversations and ruffled feathers.\n\nOther celebrities have already voiced their opinion on Biden, strongly urging the President of the United States of America not to run for a second term.\n\nRob Reiner has been vocal about it on a daily basis on X, while Bill Maher has been stating it for months on his show Real Time with Bill Maher. Recently, Stephen King applauded Biden's presidency, but also opined it was time for him to go.\n\nHowever, there has been pushback to Clooney's NYT essay, with many Democrat voters expressing their belief that if Biden doesn't run for re-election, then Donald Trump will certainly win the presidency. This viewpoint hasn't garnered as much attention, unfortunately, because the opinions of celebrities seem to wield a significantly bigger influence within the party, which also adds to the frustration of the common voter.\n\nEnter George Clooney. He hosted a fundraiser for Biden three weeks ago when he helped the party raise $14 million for his campaign. Surely, he will be a vote for Biden.\n\nApparently, Clooney partly based his NYT op-ed on his experience with Biden at that fundraiser.\n\nIn his essay, Clooney calls Biden a friend, but also claims that the President is not the same man from 2020, adding, \"This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president.\"\n\nThe op-ed is one of the biggest topics on social media presently, and adds to the big celeb scramble to push Biden out of the presidency.\n\nHowever, not all reactions to Clooney's op-ed are positive, because many non-celebrity voters -- whose lives are more impacted by who the president is than a celebrity's -- are infuriated by Clooney's statements. They speak with their vote, as they did in the primary, and they strongly believe that Biden is the ONLY one who can beat Trump, especially considering that changing the candidate now would likely be the same as stating that the Democratic party doesn't know what it's doing.\n\nClooney disagrees in his op-ed, more or less dismissing the primary as insignificant, explaining, \"It is disingenuous, at best, to argue that Democrats have already spoken with their vote and therefore the nomination is settled and done, when we just received new and upsetting information.\"\n\nThe new and upsetting information that Clooney is referring to is Biden's health and cognitive issues, something that has been a hot topic for two years on social media and, contrary to Clooney's claim, is not really news at all. The debate did not reveal anything that the common voter didn't already know.\n\nThe question now is whether or not the party will heed the common voter or the celebrity.\n\nFurthermore -- and perhaps lost in all of this -- if Biden wins re-election but his health issues ultimately force him to step down, then that's what the Vice President is for. Thus, a call for Biden to step down is no different than a lack of confidence in Kamala Harris. This signifies to the independent voter that the donkey party doesn't believe in either the President or Vice President.\n\nClooney singed off on the op-ed by suggesting that Biden could be a hero if he steps down, penning, \"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.\"\n\nThe Democratic National Convention will be held in Chicago from August 19 to 22, and given the inter-party grumbling and extremely high stakes, it could be the most contentious convention yet.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "curtis_roberts@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Curtis Roberts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Maher", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Maher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Reiner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Reiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_with_Bill_Maher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Time with Bill Maher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_voter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent voter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_7724.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-19", "dateEnd": "2024-08-22", "textStart": 3779, "textEnd": 3794}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Mentioned early into the piece is a recent fundraiser co-hosted by Clooney, where the Tender Bar director observed a change in the current POTUS from which he argues there is no recovery.\n\n\"I love Joe Biden,\" Clooney, whose history of top-tier political support also includes fundraising for Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, wrote. \"As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\"\n\nClooney continued, writing: \"But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nElsewhere, Clooney urged Democrats to \"stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw,\" again referencing Biden's subpar debate performance against Donald Trump, and pointed out that every political leader he's discussed this issue with are in agreement with one key takeaway from recent developments.\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president,\" Clooney said.\n\nRead the full piece here.\n\nDespite growing concerns, Biden, at least as of this writing, has remained adamant that he has no intention of stepping aside for a new nominee. To be clear, this line of messaging is exactly what we would be hearing right now regardless of what he's actually planning to do, because that's just how this shit works.\n\nBiden kicked off the week by sharing a letter he says he sent to Capitol Hill Democrats. In it, Biden said he was \"firmly committed to staying in this race,\" regardless of speculation suggesting he's not up to the task.\n\n\"The question of how to move forward has been well-aired for over a week now,\" Biden said. \"And it's time for it to end. We have one job. And that is to beat Donald Trump. We have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election. Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us. It is time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump.\"\n\nIt's a pivotal time not only for Democrats and the larger effort to prevent another Trump shitshow in the White House, but arguably for the American political infrastructure at large. Namely, there is an underlying condescension and arrogance to the current Biden predicament that is not going unnoticed by younger would-be voters.\n\nIf anything, many have felt pushed to the brink of forced indifference post-COVID.

It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nLast month, Clooney co-hosted a USD 28 million fund-raiser in Hollywood for Biden, which the campaign cited as the largest ever for a Democratic candidate. Now, his public plea makes him the most high-profile figure within the party to urge President Biden to withdraw from the race, as reported by The New York Times.\n\nClooney's essay came just hours after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested in a television interview that \"it's up to the president to decide if he is going to run.\" This statement has added fuel to the ongoing discussions within the Democratic Party about Biden's viability as a candidate.\n\nDespite the mounting concerns, President Biden and his top aides have maintained that he will stay in the race. On Monday, Biden reassured top donors that he would not address the debate controversy any further, though he mentioned it again during a video call with Democratic mayors on Tuesday night.\n\nClooney's essay echoes the personal sentiments of many Democrats, who worry that Biden's continued candidacy could jeopardise not only his own re-election but also the prospects of fellow Democrats in down-ballot races.\n\nClooney wrote, \"We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nThe actor's stance comes at a critical juncture, as Biden had seemingly managed to stabilise his standing within the party after recent debates. However, the combination of Pelosi's comments and Clooney's public call for Biden to step down is likely to intensify the scrutiny on the president and his campaign.\n\nA representative for the Biden campaign referred back to the president's letter to congressional Democrats on Monday, in which he reiterated his commitment to stay in the race, The New York Times reported.\n\nNotably, Biden's health at 81 years old has raised many concerns among voters as the November elections near.\n\nSeveral top House Democrats have urged President Biden to step aside from the 2024 campaign, expressing deep concerns about his potential impact on the Democratic Party's chances in the upcoming elections, CNN reported.\n\nFormer Obama senior adviser David Axelrod too publicly called for President Biden to step aside from the 2024 race, citing concerns over Biden's age and performance.\n\nIn an op-ed for CNN, Axelrod emphasised that he believes Biden's duty to the country should prompt him to withdraw, suggesting that failing to do so could overshadow his legacy. Axelrod's stance underscores growing pressures within the White House following Biden's lacklustre showing in a recent CNN presidential debate.

It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nAlso Read | PM Narendra Modi Urges Austria CEOs To Invest in India's Fast-Growing Economy.\n\nLast month, Clooney co-hosted a USD 28 million fund-raiser in Hollywood for Biden, which the campaign cited as the largest ever for a Democratic candidate. Now, his public plea makes him the most high-profile figure within the party to urge President Biden to withdraw from the race, as reported by The New York Times.\n\nClooney's essay came just hours after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested in a television interview that \"it's up to the president to decide if he is going to run.\" This statement has added fuel to the ongoing discussions within the Democratic Party about Biden's viability as a candidate.\n\nAlso Read | Spain: 18-Year-Old British Tourist Allegedly Assaults Female Police Officer, Damages Her Phone in Magaluf, Arrested.\n\nDespite the mounting concerns, President Biden and his top aides have maintained that he will stay in the race. On Monday, Biden reassured top donors that he would not address the debate controversy any further, though he mentioned it again during a video call with Democratic mayors on Tuesday night.\n\nClooney's essay echoes the personal sentiments of many Democrats, who worry that Biden's continued candidacy could jeopardise not only his own re-election but also the prospects of fellow Democrats in down-ballot races.\n\nClooney wrote, \"We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nThe actor's stance comes at a critical juncture, as Biden had seemingly managed to stabilise his standing within the party after recent debates. However, the combination of Pelosi's comments and Clooney's public call for Biden to step down is likely to intensify the scrutiny on the president and his campaign.\n\nA representative for the Biden campaign referred back to the president's letter to congressional Democrats on Monday, in which he reiterated his commitment to stay in the race, The New York Times reported.\n\nNotably, Biden's health at 81 years old has raised many concerns among voters as the November elections near.\n\nSeveral top House Democrats have urged President Biden to step aside from the 2024 campaign, expressing deep concerns about his potential impact on the Democratic Party's chances in the upcoming elections, CNN reported.\n\nFormer Obama senior adviser David Axelrod too publicly called for President Biden to step aside from the 2024 race, citing concerns over Biden's age and performance.\n\nIn an op-ed for CNN, Axelrod emphasised that he believes Biden's duty to the country should prompt him to withdraw, suggesting that failing to do so could overshadow his legacy. Axelrod's stance underscores growing pressures within the White House following Biden's lacklustre showing in a recent CNN presidential debate.

A handful of senators have also expressed concerns.\n\nLate Tuesday, Colorado's Michael Bennet became the first Senate Democrat to publicly turn on the president, saying Biden would lose if he stayed

Joe BidenAs the former Speaker of Parliament and his ally for several years, Nancy PelosiActor, director and producer George Clooney, a major donor to the Democratic Party, today called on the US president to withdraw from the presidential race scheduled for next November, in the face of doubts about the state of his country. Health.\n\nPreviously His disastrous appearance in the June debateagainst Donald Trump, which confirmed doubts and concerns about whether Joe Biden is fit for a second four-year term, with a split emerging in the Democratic Party.\n\nwith Opinion article on The New York TimesThe US actor, a staunch Democrat who is actively involved in raising funds for the party, wrote that he loves Joe Biden \"but we need a new candidate.\"\n\n\"I am a lifelong Democrat, and I make no apologies for that. I am proud of what my party stands for and what it represents. As part of my participation in the democratic process and in support of the candidate I chose, I have led some of the largest fundraising campaigns in my party's history. Barack Obama in 2012. Hillary Clinton in 2016. Joe Biden in 2020. Last month, I helped organize the largest fundraiser ever for any Democratic candidate to re-elect President Biden.\"I say all of this just to express how much I believe in this process and how deeply I believe in this moment,\" Clooney initially states in his essay, then goes on to list the reasons why he loves the current president.\n\n\"I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As vice president and as president. I consider him my friend and I believe in him. I believe in his character. I believe in his morals. And over the last four years, he has won many battles that he has fought.\n\nBut the one battle he can't win is the battle against time. None of us can. It pains me to say this, but the Joe Biden I was with at the charity event three weeks ago was not the \"big deal\" Joe Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the Joe Biden of 2010. The same guy we all saw at the debate.\n\nWas he tired? Yes. Did he have a cold? Maybe.But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We are all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we have chosen to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview reinforced what we saw last week. \"As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down our volume every time we see a president, whom we respect, step off Air Force One or return to the microphone to answer a free-flowing question,\" Clooney said.\n\n\"Is it fair to point these things out? It has to be. It's about age. Nothing else. But also nothing that can be reversed,\" he asks. We will not win in November with this president.. On top of that, we won't win the House and we'll lose the Senate.. And that's not just my opinion, it's the opinion of every senator, congressman, and governor that I've spoken to personally. With everyone, regardless of what they say publicly.\"\n\n\"We like to talk about how the Republican Party has ceded all the power and all the characteristics that made it so formidable under Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush to one person seeking to retain the presidency, and yet most members of Congress are choosing to wait and see if the dam breaks. But the dam has been broken. We can stick our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can tell the truth.\"Senior Democratic leaders, senators, House members, and other candidates who are at risk of losing in November, should follow suit,\" he said in another part of the text published by The New York Times. \"I am asking this president to voluntarily retire.\"\n\nClosing his article, George Clooney described democracy as \"messy,\" but stressed that the short period until Election Day \"will give us the opportunity to project the future without so much negative campaigning that accompanies ridiculously long and expensive pre-election periods.\" This can be an exciting time for democracy, as we have just seen with the two hundred or so French candidates who have put aside their personal ambitions to save their democracy from the far right.\"", "source": {"uri": "thevalleypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Valley Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air Force One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George W.

That's why actor George Clooney was able to get so many of them to open their checkbooks and donate to President Biden's reelection effort at a recent fundraiser:\n\nSome of Hollywood's brightest stars headlined a fundraiser for President Joe Biden that took in a record $30 million-plus for a Democratic candidate, according to his campaign, in hopes of energizing would-be supporters for a White House contest they said may rank among the most consequential in U.S. history.\n\nGeorge Clooney, Julia Roberts and Barbra Streisand were among those who took the stage at the 7,100-seat Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on Saturday night. Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel interviewed Biden and former President Barack Obama, who both stressed the need to defeat former President Donald Trump in a race that's expected to be exceedingly close.\n\nThat fundraiser was just a few days before the debate, and you know how that went.\n\nHere's where things stand for Clooney now:\n\nAs usual, the real issue with these lefties is that they're now unable to pretend that Biden's condition is just a \"cheap fake\" Republican talking point.\n\nAccording to Clooney, everybody can put the spin about Biden's debate performance being a one-off bad night to rest:\n\nBut the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\n\nWas he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\n\nIsn't it pitiful how these people are only now stepping forward now that the evidence of Biden's decline is irrefutable?\n\nPermission has definitely been granted for lefty fundraisers to start saying things like that.", "source": {"uri": "twitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Twitchy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "doug_p@twitchy.com", "name": "Doug P.", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julia Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbra_Streisand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barbra Streisand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Kimmel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air Force One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/tw/images/up/2023/175/6f611dc5-a6b2-41ed-8782-ae756233d9f5.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nClooney said that Biden would lose the presidential election, and Democrats would also lose in the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nAt the fundraiser in Los Angeles co-hosted by Clooney and fellow movie star Julia Roberts, Biden appeared tired as he took to the stage alongside former president Barack Obama.\n\nHe had flown straight to California from the G7 summit in Italy and has since blamed jetlag, and a cold, for his disastrous performance in a June 27 television debate with Donald Trump.\n\nFellow actor Michael Douglas followed up Wednesday, saying he was \"deeply, deeply\" concerned about Biden's prospects.\n\nIn response to Clooney's editorial, the Biden campaign pointed to the president's statements on Monday saying he was \"committed\" to running again in November.\n\n- 'Overwhelmingly negative' -\n\nWhile top Democrats broadly but unenthusiastically backed him on Tuesday, Biden's efforts to stop the bleeding increasingly looked to be in vain.\n\nFormer House speaker Pelosi, 86, said time was running out for Biden to decide whether to end his candidacy, ignoring Biden's repeated insistence that he is committed to run.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" she told MSNBC.\n\n\"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because the time is running short.\"\n\nPelosi said Biden should however delay any final decision until after NATO's 75th anniversary summit in Washington, which ends on Thursday with what will be a closely watched press conference by the president.\n\nFellow NATO leaders appeared to rally round Biden as he greeted them on arrival.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, himself under pressure after calling an inconclusive snap election, gave the older man a hug and a firm handshake on the podium.\n\nBiden, who gave a forceful speech pledging new air defenses for Ukraine as the summit opened on Tuesday, got through his opening remarks with only a couple of verbal stumbles.\n\nBut his every move from now until November will now be watched for evidence of age-related frailty or ill health.\n\nHe also dropped in on union leaders on Wednesday in another bid to shore up his key supporters.\n\nAt least eight House Democrats have openly called on Biden to not seek reelection, with New York Congressman Pat Ryan jumping ship on Tuesday.\n\nColorado's Michael Bennet became the first Senate Democrat to publicly turn on the president, saying Biden would lose if he stayed on the ballot.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide and take with it the Senate and the House,\" Bennet told CNN.\n\nFormer White House communications director Kate Bedingfield, who served under Biden for two years, urged his campaign to show a \"path to victory\" despite the \"overwhelmingly negative\" polls.\n\nRepublican challenger Trump, 78, is meanwhile back on the warpath after a long interval of silence following the June 27 debate, accusing Biden of hiding secrets about his health.\n\n\"It's the biggest cover-up in political history,\" Trump thundered at a rally in Florida on Tuesday.\n\nThe former president dared his successor to another debate without moderators and challenged him to a round of golf.\n\ndk/bgs\n\nFOX41 Yakima\u00a9FOX11

Almost all of the drag content on this site is my fault (you're welcome).\n\nHollywood icon and longtime Democratic fund-raising leader George Clooney has joined a growing list of political and entertainment figures calling for President Joe Biden to bow out of the 2024 election race against Donald Trump.\n\nLike many before him, the Oscar-winning actor and producer cited concerns over Biden's 81 years of age impacting his ability to lead the party to victory in November, but added that, before Biden's disastrous performance at the June 27 debate, he witnessed Biden's decline in person at a political event nearly three weeks ago.\n\n\"I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced,\" Clooney wrote in a New York Times essay published Wednesday, in which he acknowledged his friendship with Biden. \"But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F---ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\"\n\nClooney also alleged that he's spoken to numerous Democratic senators and members of congress in private in recent days, and that \"every single one\" shares the sentiment that \"we are not going to win in November with this president.\" He also claimed that many of the politicians he spoke with have different forward-facing stances on the issue, and are \"saying publicly\" things that contradict how they really feel about Biden's acuity.\n\nThe 63-year-old goes on to suggest that several prominent Democrats could step up to lead the November ticket, noting that the nominating process at the 2024 Democratic National Convention could \"enliven our party and wake up voters\" among the base.\n\n\"We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth,\" Clooney wrote, finishing the essay with a final note of praise for Biden before calling on him to bow out once again. \"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.\"\n\nEntertainment Weekly has reached out to the White House and the Biden campaign for a response. When reached for comment, Clooney's publicist tells EW there's \"nothing to add\" to the actor's New York Times essay.\n\nOthers who've attended recent events with Biden have praised the president on social media, including diplomat James Costos, who tweeted Wednesday that he was \"proud to be with\" Biden in person in Los Angeles.\n\nAmid sustained calls from both Democrats and Republicans to drop out of the matchup against Trump, both Biden and White House representatives have maintained that he'll remain in the race. Biden confirmed in a July 5 X post that he's \"not letting one 90-minute debate wipe out three and a half years of work. I'm staying in the race, and I will beat Donald Trump.\"\n\nNew York's governor, Kathy Hochul, also recently told MSNBC that Biden is the best candidate running, and that she felt emboldened to support him after meeting with him less than a day after the debate.\n\nWant more movie news? Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free newsletter to get the latest trailers, celebrity interviews, film reviews, and more.\n\n\"What I saw less than 24 hours after the performance the night before, was Joe Biden himself, at his best, energetic, fully alert, and conversational,\" Hochul said. \"One bad night does not affect three-and-a-half years of stellar accomplishment, and I'm really excited about the next four years ahead as well.\"\n\nOther entertainment figures calling for Biden to let another Democratic candidate tap in for the party include several cohosts on The View -- particularly Sara Haines and former Trump White House communications staffer Alyssa Farah Griffin.\n\n\"It kind of pains me to say this today, but I think President Biden needs to step down and be replaced if we want to defeat Donald Trump in November,\" Haines said, urging Democrats to stop \"twisting the age issue\" by making excuses for Biden's performance.\n\nAlso amongst Biden's critics are Stephen King, Rob Reiner, Michael Moore, and Michael Douglas -- the last of whom said Wednesday on The View that he worries about Biden's fitness for office in the near future if he's elected to a second term.",

That is a truism that we could ask our beloved President, Joe Biden, to sign off on because if anything is evident to him this July morning, it is precisely that. George Clooney, who is a very wealthy and popular actor, withdrew his support from Joe Biden and asked him to publicly step down in a guest essay in the New York Times. That is reverberating all through social media right now. Some people are claiming this is revenge on Clooney's part for the president's criticism of the International Criminal Court's action against Israeli leaders -- a case his wife, Amal Clooney, worked on.\n\nThat was quite the story last month when it happened. People were even speculating that Clooney might bail on his fundraiser for Biden. He did not, but now we see him bailing on Biden altogether. And to what extent this is a personal issue and not a public one, we don't know.\n\nMake no mistake, this is seismic. Clooney is a major DNC fundraiser and he has clout. He also has a lot of public clout and is one of those celebrities with a certain A-List aura about him. What has happened this morning is monumental in scope. I don't know what will happen. Maybe we will all rise to the occasion and produce a new presidential candidate out of thin air, like it was a movie script.\n\nWe can easily foresee a group of several strong Democrats stepping forward to stand and tell us why they're best qualified to lead this country and take on some of the deeply concerning trends we're seeing from the revenge tour that Donald Trump calls a presidential campaign.\n\nLet's hear from Wes Moore and Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom and Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker and others. Let's agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar. Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.\n\nOh yeah, man. Let's just \"go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.\" Right. That's how you win an election. You dump the presumptive nominee the month before the election and you \"figure it out.\" Right. Now if this was a movie script, the heroic star could do just that. Unfortunately, this is real life.\n\nHis villa is in Italy (it's atop this piece) and he's also got a mansion in England and I'm not sure what he has in New York. But he'll be fine. He's not going to suffer from a Trump presidency and from the ruination of this country like the yous and mes will.\n\nClooney knows how America suffered in the eyes of the world the first time. Now he's opened the door to a second Trump presidency. I don't pretend to know what is going to happen next but I feel very comfortable in saying that this situation has taken on a life of its own. It's just snowballing now. It's reaching avalanche proportions.\n\nWe need to get behind the Democratic candidate. You recall Lincoln's comment, \"Public sentiment is everything. With public sentiment, nothing can fail. Without it, nothing can succeed.\" Fine. Let's just grant for the sake of argument that Joe Biden is too old. He may have come to a place in his life where he's turned the corner. We all get there someday and it may have happened for him. But whether he can govern effectively or not, the PERCEPTION that he can't is now being implanted by Clooney, Stephen King, Rob Reiner, Michael Moore, people with large voices in the vox populii.\n\nSo whatever happens next it needs to happen now. And I mean now. We need to get this show on the road and if the understudy is going to take the lead, fine. Let's just make it happen. Because every day that this fundamental dispute about Biden's ability to lead goes on, the likelihood of a Trump presidency increases.\n\nI think what Clooney did was wrong, I think what these naysayers are all doing is wrong, but they're doing it. So let's just get to the end of this conflict. Either the naysayers need to unite behind Biden, or if it's too late for that, (and frankly I think it is. This Clooney denouncement is the last straw) then fine. Go retire, Joe. Pass the torch. But whatever happens, do it freaking NOW.\n\nTo be completely honest, I think the worst blow Clooney dealt was not about Joe's age, it was the revelation that other senators and congress members are not behind Joe. That's what is lethal here.\n\nI guess we live in a world where movie stars and reality TV stars now have all the power. Now we know. If you want a life in politics, become a celebrity first. We lived in Idiocracy for four years, and maybe a movie star is going to send us back there for another four -- or forever.\n\nAs cynical as I am, I like to think the best about people. I like to think that George Clooney totally searched his soul before taking this step and understood fully what he was doing. But I don't know. It could be that yes, he's one American sharing an opinion, which he has a right to do, but given that he's a major DNC fundraiser and given the other celebrity opinions before him, this may be the death knell.\n\nI sincerely don't know what our party is going to do. I guess I'm going to find out. We're all going to find out. Democrats are individuals first, that's our magic, but Republicans stick together. That's their strength. And they're united behind the worst candidate they, or any political party in this country has ever run, but they're united behind him. That may be enough, shitshow that the Trump candidacy is.", "source": {"uri": "politizoom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PolitiZoom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ursula_faw@politizoom.com", "name": "Ursula Faw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amal_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amal Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nClooney said that Biden would lose the presidential election, and Democrats would also lose in the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nAt the fundraiser in Los Angeles co-hosted by Clooney and fellow movie star Julia Roberts, Biden appeared tired as he took to the stage alongside former president Barack Obama.\n\nHe had flown straight to California from the G7 summit in Italy and has since blamed jetlag, and a cold, for his disastrous performance in a June 27 television debate with Donald Trump.\n\nFellow actor Michael Douglas followed up Wednesday, saying he was \"deeply, deeply\" concerned about Biden's prospects.\n\nIn response to Clooney's editorial, the Biden campaign pointed to the president's statements on Monday saying he was \"committed\" to running again in November.\n\n- 'Overwhelmingly negative' -\n\nWhile top Democrats broadly but unenthusiastically backed him on Tuesday, Biden's efforts to stop the bleeding increasingly looked to be in vain.\n\nFormer House speaker Pelosi, 86, said time was running out for Biden to decide whether to end his candidacy, ignoring Biden's repeated insistence that he is committed to run.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" she told MSNBC.\n\n\"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because the time is running short.\"\n\nPelosi said Biden should however delay any final decision until after NATO's 75th anniversary summit in Washington, which ends on Thursday with what will be a closely watched press conference by the president.\n\nFellow NATO leaders appeared to rally round Biden as he greeted them on arrival.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, himself under pressure after calling an inconclusive snap election, gave the older man a hug and a firm handshake on the podium.\n\nBiden, who gave a forceful speech pledging new air defenses for Ukraine as the summit opened on Tuesday, got through his opening remarks with only a couple of verbal stumbles.\n\nBut his every move from now until November will now be watched for evidence of age-related frailty or ill health.\n\nHe also dropped in on union leaders on Wednesday in another bid to shore up his key supporters.\n\nAt least eight House Democrats have openly called on Biden to not seek reelection, with New York Congressman Pat Ryan jumping ship on Tuesday.\n\nColorado's Michael Bennet became the first Senate Democrat to publicly turn on the president, saying Biden would lose if he stayed on the ballot.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide and take with it the Senate and the House,\" Bennet told CNN.\n\nFormer White House communications director Kate Bedingfield, who served under Biden for two years, urged his campaign to show a \"path to victory\" despite the \"overwhelmingly negative\" polls.\n\nRepublican challenger Trump, 78, is meanwhile back on the warpath after a long interval of silence following the June 27 debate, accusing Biden of hiding secrets about his health.\n\n\"It's the biggest cover-up in political history,\" Trump thundered at a rally in Florida on Tuesday.\n\nThe former president dared his successor to another debate without moderators and challenged him to a round of golf.\n\ndk/bgs\n\nMore from this section\n\nThe Legacy of Civil Rights Leader Rev.

But We Need a New Nominee.\"\n\n\"This is about age. Nothing more,\" Mr. Clooney writes, urging Democratic party leaders to \"stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw\" during last month's debate.\n\nMr. Clooney's announcement comes just a few weeks after he hosted a star-studded event to raise money for Mr. Biden's campaign at the end of June.\n\nThough he writes that \"the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser,\" was not the \"same\" Biden of 2010, or even the same Biden of 2020.\n\nThe fundraiser, led by Mr. Clooney, Julia Roberts, and Jimmy Kimmel, succeeded in raising $30 million, breaking previous Democratic fundraising records, his campaign reported.\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president,\" Mr. Clooney writes plainly, adding that the Democrats will likely lose the Senate and the House as well.\n\nIt's an opinion, he claims, that is \"the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nWhile he warns that the replacement process will likely \"be messy,\" he suggests that it may also \"enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out.\"\n\nHe echoes the sentiment of some 74 percent of voters who view Mr. Biden as too old for the job, and 50 percent who believe that \"age is such a problem that he is not capable of handling the job of president.\"\n\nMr. Clooney seemingly pitches Governor Moore, Vice President Harris, Governor Whitmer, Governor Newsom, Governor Beshear, and Governor J.B. Pritzker as potential candidates, adding \"let's hear\" from them and others.\n\nFellow American actor Rob Reiner chimed in on X, sharing Mr. Clooney's piece and adding, \"We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside.\"\n\nMr. Reiner broke his silence on his concerns over Mr. Biden's on the social media platform a few days ago.\n\nMr. Clooney's piece was published mere hours after former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi refrained from outright endorsing Mr. Biden as the Democratic nominee.\n\nHe also joins the cohort of other Hollywood Democrats who have called for Mr. Biden to recuse himself from the race, including John Cusack, Reed Hastings, Michael Moore, Stephen King, and others.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "novi_zhukovsky@nysun.com", "name": "Novi Zhukovsky", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julia Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Kimmel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nClooney said that Biden would lose the presidential election, and Democrats would also lose in the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\nAt the fundraiser in Los Angeles co-hosted by Clooney and fellow movie star Julia Roberts, Biden appeared tired as he took to the stage alongside former president Barack Obama.\n\nHe had flown straight to California from the G7 summit in Italy and has since blamed jetlag, and a cold, for his disastrous performance in a June 27 television debate with Donald Trump.\n\nFellow actor Michael Douglas followed up Wednesday, saying he was \"deeply, deeply\" concerned about Biden's prospects.\n\nIn response to Clooney's editorial, the Biden campaign pointed to the president's statements on Monday saying he was \"committed\" to running again in November.\n\n- 'Overwhelmingly negative' -\n\nWhile top Democrats broadly but unenthusiastically backed him on Tuesday, Biden's efforts to stop the bleeding increasingly looked to be in vain.\n\nFormer House speaker Pelosi, 86, said time was running out for Biden to decide whether to end his candidacy, ignoring Biden's repeated insistence that he is committed to run.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" she told MSNBC.\n\nMore from this section US: Beryl Causes Widespread Power Outages And Flooding, Leaves Multiple Dead In Texas 2 Germany has become increasingly reliant on Chinese renewable energy tech Defense continues Sen.

delay any final decision until after NATO's 75th anniversary summit in Washington, which ends on Thursday with what will be a closely watched press conference by the president.\n\nFellow NATO leaders appeared to rally round Biden as he greeted them on arrival.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, himself under pressure after calling an inconclusive snap election, gave the older man a hug and a firm handshake on the podium.\n\nBiden, who gave a forceful speech pledging new air defenses for Ukraine as the summit opened on Tuesday, got through his opening remarks with only a couple of verbal stumbles.\n\nBut his every move from now until November will now be watched for evidence of age-related frailty or ill health.\n\nHe also dropped in on union leaders on Wednesday in another bid to shore up his key supporters.\n\nAt least eight House Democrats have openly called on Biden to not seek reelection, with New York Congressman Pat Ryan jumping ship on Tuesday.\n\nColorado's Michael Bennet became the first Senate Democrat to publicly turn on the president, saying Biden would lose if he stayed on the ballot.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide and take with it the Senate and the House,\" Bennet told CNN.\n\nFormer White House communications director Kate Bedingfield, who served under Biden for two years, urged his campaign to show a \"path to victory\" despite the \"overwhelmingly negative\" polls.\n\nRepublican challenger Trump, 78, is meanwhile back on the warpath after a long interval of silence following the June 27 debate, accusing Biden of hiding secrets about his health.\n\n\"It's the biggest cover-up in political history,\" Trump thundered at a rally in Florida on Tuesday.\n\nThe former president dared his successor to another debate without moderators and challenged him to a round of golf.\n\ndk/bgs", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"},

He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nAt the fundraiser in Los Angeles co-hosted by Clooney and fellow movie star Julia Roberts, Biden appeared tired as he took to the stage alongside former president Barack Obama.\n\nHe had flown straight to California from the G7 summit in Italy and has since blamed jetlag, and a cold, for his disastrous performance in a June 27 television debate with Donald Trump.\n\nBiden's bid for a second term in the White House has been under severe pressure since the debate, in which he slurred his words and stood with mouth agape while Trump talked.\n\nWhile top Democrats broadly but unenthusiastically backed him on Tuesday, Biden's efforts to turn the page took a leap backwards with the interventions of Pelosi and Clooney.\n\nFormer House speaker Pelosi, 86, said time was running out for Biden to decide whether to end his candidacy, ignoring Biden's repeated insistence that he is committed to run.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" she told MSNBC.\n\n\"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because the time is running short.\"\n\nPelosi said Biden should however delay any final decision until after NATO's 75th anniversary summit in Washington, which the US president is hosting this week.\n\n- 'Cover-up' -\n\nOn the way to the summit on Wednesday, Biden dropped in on US union leaders in a further bid to shore up backing for his reelection bid.\n\nBiden's appearances at the NATO gathering are being closely watched as he tries to reassure allies of his continued ability to lead as the alliance backs Ukraine's fight against Russia.\n\nSeven House Democrats have openly called on Biden to not seek reelection. A handful of senators have also expressed concerns.\n\nLate Tuesday, Colorado's Michael Bennet became the first Senate Democrat to publicly turn on the president, saying Biden would lose if he stayed on the ballot -- and perhaps cause congressional Democrats to lose as well.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide and take with it the Senate and the House,\" Bennet told CNN, adding he believes the White House \"has done nothing\" to demonstrate they have a plan to win in November.\n\nRepublican challenger Trump, 78, is meanwhile back on the warpath after a long interval of silence following the June 27 debate, accusing Biden of hiding secrets about his health.\n\n\"It's the biggest cover-up in political history,\" Trump thundered at a rally in Florida on Tuesday.\n\nThe former president dared his successor to another debate without moderators and challenged him to a round of golf.\n\ndk/bgs\n\nMore from this section\n\nMocPOGO Pokemon GO Hacks Updated: Fixes Failed to Detect Location Error 12\n\nDirect Mail Benchmark Report 2024 reveals 61% of marketers have increased direct mail investments in the last year\n\nThe Legacy of Civil Rights Leader Rev.

Joe Biden has effectively served US with honor, decency, and dignity. It's time for Joe Biden to step down,\" Reiner wrote on X.\n\nLost co-creator Damon Lindelof, a self-proclaimed \"lifelong Democrat,\" declared that \"Biden has to go & the Dems need to wake up.\"\n\nIn a guest column written for Deadline, Lindelof urged others to withhold their donations to the Democratic party until \"there's change at the top of the ticket.\"\n\n\"When Joe finally leaves the mound, I will stand and applaud. Because he truly pitched a great game,\" he said.\n\nOne of the Democrat's biggest donors, Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings has also called for Biden to drop out of the race. \"Biden needs to step aside to allow a vigorous Democratic leader to beat Trump and keep us safe and prosperous,\" he sent in an email to The New York Times.\n\nDirector Michael Moore (Bowling for Columbine, Fahrenheit 9/11) was a bit more extreme in his argument against Biden. During an appearance on MSNBC, Moore, 70, accused the Democratic party of committing \"elder abuse\" by pushing Biden to continue with his election campaign.\n\n\"The problem here is that I think there is a form of elder abuse going on here where the Democratic Party and the people that are part of the apparatus are pushing and pushing him to stay. And then he comes out and says 'I am staying,' and the family says 'I am staying,'\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know about you, but in spite of my criticisms with Biden, watching the debate a week ago was heartbreaking. It was like, imagine that was your father up there,\" Moore added. \"I'm thinking, why isn't anybody doing anything? Why did they let him go out on the stage in this condition? Who is looking out for him? Who is looking out for him right now?\"\n\nLast week, Disney heiress Abigail Disney, a longstanding Democratic donor, hailed the president as \"a good man\" who had served his country \"admirably,\" but warned that the GOP would win in November if a change of leadership was not made.\n\n\"I intend to stop any contributions to the party unless and until they replace Biden at the top of the ticket,\" she said in a statement shared with CNBC.\n\nThe View hosts were among the first major commentators to insist on Biden's exit from the race. The day after Biden's debate, the talk show hosts discussed his poor performance, with Sara Haines declaring: \"It kind of pains me to say this today, but I think President Biden needs to step down and be replaced if we want to defeat Donald Trump in November.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Pat Ryan became the eighth House Democrat to call on President Biden to step aside from the 2024 running on Wednesday.\n\n'Trump is an existential threat to American democracy; it is our duty to put forward the strongest candidate against him. Joe Biden is a patriot but is no longer the best candidate to defeat Trump,' Ryan, a moderate from a swing district, wrote on X.\n\n'For the good of our country, I am asking Joe Biden to step aside -- to deliver on his promise to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders.'\n\nNew York Rep. Pat Ryan became the eighth House Democrat to call on President Biden to step aside from the 2024 running on Wednesday\n\nRyan was first elected in 2022 and Republicans have made his district a top target for 2024.\n\nAs the White House tries to tamp down dissent, Biden's chances of being the Democratic nominee in November are waffling.\n\nDemocrats who haven't called on him to step down have insisted the door is still open for him to do so - even though Biden adamantly insists he'll remain in the race.\n\n'It's up to the president to decide if he's going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running out,' former Speaker Nancy Pelosi told MSNBC's Morning Joe on Tuesday morning.\n\nReminded that Biden has made up his mind, Pelosi said: 'I want him to do whatever he decides to do.'\n\n'Whatever he decides, we go with.'\n\nRep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., said Biden's insistence that he'll remain in the race doesn't mean that decision is final.\n\n'It doesn't work that way.'\n\n'I had totally decided to take an Uber to dinner. And then I heard about the gridlock in DC because of the NATO traffic. And I redirected to the Metro and it was a really smart decision,' he told reporters.\n\nBiden wrote in a letter to hill Democrats on Monday: 'I want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere, I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump.'\n\n'Trump is an existential threat to American democracy; it is our duty to put forward the strongest candidate against him. Joe Biden is a patriot but is no longer the best candidate to defeat Trump,' Ryan, a moderate from a swing district, wrote on X\n\nRead MoreBREAKING NEWS George Clooney calls on Joe Biden to STEP DOWN from the 2024 presidential race and rips his brutal debate performance\n\nAlso on Wednesday actor George Clooney, a longtime ally of top Democrats, called on Biden to step aside.\n\n'I love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced,' Clooney wrote in a New York Times op-ed.\n\n'But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020.

That's according to those who were on the call.\n\nReactions from some mayors:\n\n\u00b7 Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a letter that Biden was \"pretty fired up,\" and that he and Kamala Harris are \"exactly the leaders we need at this moment.\"\n\n\u00b7 Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson told AP \"the president is in it to win it.\"\n\n\u00b7 Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Quinton Lucas said in an online post he will \"proudly stand with Joe!\"\n\nNew York congressman calls on Biden to step aside\n\nAn eighth Democratic member of Congress has publicly called on President Joe Biden to step aside, the New York Times reported.\n\nU.S. Rep. Pat Ryan of New York said he no longer believed Biden could make the case necessary to defeat Trump.\n\nHe called Trump an \"existential threat\" to American democracy and said that he was asking Biden to drop out \"for the good of the country.\"\n\nIt comes as Democrats continue to wrestle with the extraordinary question of whether to stand behind the president or push him to bow out.\n\nGeorge Clooney joins calls for Biden to step aside\n\nMovie star and lifelong Democrat George Clooney is adding his voice to calls for Biden to leave the presidential race.\n\nClooney said in a New York Times opinion piece Wednesday that he loves Biden, but the party would lose the presidential race and any control in Congress with him as the nominee.\n\n\"This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private,\" wrote Clooney, who has hosted high-dollar Hollywood fundraisers.\n\nClooney argued the party should pick a new nominee at its convention next month.\n\nUS will need strong allies no matter who wins, Finnish president says\n\nThe president of Finland says that regardless of whether Biden or Trump win the presidency in November, the U.S. will remain a superpower. That will require it to have strong allies -- especially in Europe.\n\nAlexander Stubb said he is worried about the \"polarization of the political climate,\" calling it \"quite toxic.\"\n\nStubb spoke to reporters as he arrived at the NATO summit Wednesday.\n\nStubb also said there is \"strong bipartisan support\" for Ukraine and NATO, following a meeting with 15 U.S. senators.\n\nUkraine is on 'irreversible' path to joining NATO -- after end of war with Russia, US says\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Ukraine is on an \"irreversible\" path to NATO membership.\n\nThat advances American assurances that Ukraine will be allowed to join the Western self-defense alliance after its war against Russia ends.\n\nAll 32 allies are expected to issue a joint communique Wednesday cementing that \"irreversible\" commitment to Ukraine. That's according to a European official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss before the release.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy has battled for a firm guarantee Ukraine can join. The U.S. and some others have opposed to avoid an escalation with Russia that could lead to a larger war.\n\n-- Associated Press reporter Ellen Knickmeyer contributed to this story.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass released a one-sentence statement after the president held a virtual event with nearly 200 Democratic mayors.\n\n\"I'm supporting our nominee, President Biden,\" she said.\n\nBass is a former member of Congress who was on Biden's vice-presidential shortlist during his 2020 campaign.\n\nU.S. Sen. Alex Padilla of California has also backed the president, sending a fundraising appeal on behalf of Biden's campaign.\n\n\"The stakes of this election are simply too high to continue fretting and worrying,\" he wrote.\n\nPelosi stops short of saying Biden should continue\n\nSpeaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi stopped short of saying President Joe Biden should continue his re-election campaign, saying \"it's up to the president to decide\" if he's going to run.\n\n\"We're all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short,\" Pelosi said early Wednesday on MSNBC.\n\nPressed on whether she personally wants Biden to stay on the top of the ticket, Pelosi said, \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do.\"\n\nShe said she watched as he delivered a forceful speech at NATO, and while foreign leaders are in Washington she encouraged Democrats to \"hold off\" with any announcements about his campaign.\n\nPelosi has been widely watched for signals of how top Democrats are thinking about Biden's candidacy.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press",

Axios published a report with a headline that read, \"Biden rebels in Congress see their revolt crumbling.\"\n\nThe article quoted one unnamed House Democrat who said, \"As someone who wanted the reckoning and is really disappointed that it's over, trust me: It's over.\"\n\nIt's not that congressional Democrats met behind closed doors and came to the conclusion that Biden was the party's best and strongest choice for the November ballot. Rather, the members felt stuck: They don't think the president can win re-election, but they also don't think he'll quit. The result was an awkward dilemma for Democratic lawmakers: Either take the pressure campaign to an aggressive new level and hope Biden reverses course, or grudgingly fall in line and accept the status quo.\n\nAt this point yesterday, a variety of Democratic members appeared to embrace the latter option. The president's position had strengthened, at least in his own party, in ways that seemed difficult to predict a couple of days earlier.\n\nBut the funny thing about pendulums is that they keep swinging. NBC News reported this morning:\n\nDuring an MSNBC appearance, the speaker emerita said, in reference to Biden, \"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\"\n\nAsked in the same interview if she wants the president to move forward with his re-election plans, Pelosi added, \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do, and that's -- that's the way it is.\"\n\nThe significance of the comments was obvious: Biden has told Democrats that the discussion about his electoral future is over, while Pelosi left little doubt that the conversation remains ongoing. If the headline yesterday was that the party was prepared to move on, the former House speaker's on-air comments -- delivered on a program the president is known to watch -- suggested otherwise.\n\nThe California Democrat isn't alone. Despite the incumbent president's declarations, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey announced late yesterday that she wants Biden to stand aside for the good of the country. Around the same, Rep. Andy Kim, the Democratic Senate nominee in New Jersey, expressed \"concerns\" about Biden's candidacy, adding that he's open to discussions about a new party nominee.\n\nA few hours later, Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado appeared on CNN and said in no uncertain terms that he does not believe Biden can win a second term.\n\nThis morning, Democratic Rep. Pat Ryan, who represents a competitive swing district in New York, also publicly called on Biden to forgo his re-election plans. In case that weren't quite enough, The New York Times published an op-ed from actor George Clooney, who last month co-hosted the largest fundraising event ever for any Democratic candidate, and who now believes the president should stand down.\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney wrote. \"Was he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw.\"\n\nThe actor added, \"We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nI won't pretend to know what's likely to happen, but it's clear that the debate that Biden tried to shut down isn't over, and uncertainty about the near future reigns.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikie_Sherrill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikie Sherrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Ryan_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Ryan (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Kim_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Kim (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Qa7xouYOqnsGOCuVNSOKsQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/msnbc_articles_593/417ea8fcb97fdde0dd25d4befae514ed", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account?

This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nClooney's broadside comes as congressional Democrats continue to grapple over what to do about Biden following his disastrous debate performance. Some Hollywood bigwigs, including Netflix cofounder Reed Hastings and IAC chairman Barry Diller, have also backed away from Biden.\n\nBiden has repeatedly declared that he's not going anywhere, but there are still murmurs in Washington and elsewhere about his standing. Before Clooney's column was published, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi notably ignored Biden's declaration that he was staying in the race during an interview on MSNBC. Seven House Democrats, including a pair of the chamber's most vulnerable incumbents, have called on Biden to step aside.\n\nThe president has tried to portray the backlash against him as simply \"the elites,\" something Clooney's public break will likely feed into.

But it is here now. We can't argue it away. Our democracy has gotten to a place where show business and politics are intertwined as never before. And the cult of celebrity rules. George Clooney just publlshed a piece in the New York Times asking Joe Biden to step down. While it is certainly his right to do so, as an American, I don't know if he has fully assessed what he is asking to happen. This is a development of monumental proportion here.\n\nI love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\n\nBut the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe \"big F-ing deal\" Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\n\nWas he tired? Yes. A cold? Maybe. But our party leaders need to stop telling us that 51 million people didn't see what we just saw. We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\n\nIs it fair to point these things out? It has to be. This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\n\nWe love to talk about how the Republican Party has ceded all power, and all of the traits that made it so formidable with Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, to a single person who seeks to hold on to the presidency, and yet most of our members of Congress are opting to wait and see if the dam breaks. But the dam has broken. We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, or we can speak the truth.\n\nIt is disingenuous, at best, to argue that Democrats have already spoken with their vote and therefore the nomination is settled and done, when we just received new and upsetting information. We all think Republicans should abandon their nominee now that he's been convicted of 34 felonies. That's new and upsetting information as well. Top Democrats -- Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi -- and senators, representatives and other candidates who face losing in November need to ask this president to voluntarily step aside.\n\nAll of the scary stories that we're being told about what would happen next are simply not true. In all likelihood, the money in the Biden-Harris coffers could go to help elect the presidential ticket and other Democrats. The new nominee wouldn't be left off ballots in Ohio. We Democrats have a very exciting bench. We don't anoint leaders or fall sway to a cult of personality; we vote for a president. We can easily foresee a group of several strong Democrats stepping forward to stand and tell us why they're best qualified to lead this country and take on some of the deeply concerning trends we're seeing from the revenge tour that Donald Trump calls a presidential campaign.\n\nLet's hear from Wes Moore and Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom and Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker and others. Let's agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar. Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.\n\nThis is a major turning point here. Now in all honesty, every nerve in my body is screaming that this was a wrong thing for George Clooney to do. But he has done it. They've all done it. Michael Moore has done it. I canceled a subscription to Moore's newsletter yesterday because of his anti-Biden stance. I believe, with all my heart, we should stand behind Joe. But it would appear that there are too many celebrities, too many people with clout, who have decided to take this election a different direction.\n\nOn that basis, maybe Joe Biden will step aside. And maybe this can all work out. I will support the Democratic candidate with all my heart and soul. I just pray to God that this doesn't blow up in our faces and that we don't have Donald Trump headed back down to Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nI think this is a terrible mistake, what is taking place now. But I've lived long enought to know that events sometimes take on a life of their own and this is clearly one of them.", "source": {"uri": "politizoom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PolitiZoom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ursula_faw@politizoom.com", "name": "Ursula Faw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air Force One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George H.

His remarks follow growing concerns within the party about Biden's recent performance and the challenges he faces against Donald Trump.\n\nIn a piece published in The New York Times, Clooney expressed his deep admiration for Biden's past achievements but voiced doubts about his current ability to lead effectively. Referring to a recent fundraising event that generated a record $30 million for Biden's campaign, Clooney highlighted that despite the financial support, there's widespread unease among party members about Biden's candidacy.\n\n\"This is about age. Nothing more,\" Clooney emphasized, suggesting that Biden's debate performance and subsequent public appearances have raised valid concerns about his readiness to compete against Trump in November.\n\nClooney's call coincides with similar sentiments expressed by other Democratic leaders, including Nancy Pelosi, who acknowledged the urgency for Biden to make a decision about his candidacy. Despite Biden's insistence on continuing his campaign, several Democratic figures have openly suggested that he should reconsider, citing fears of a potential Trump victory if Biden remains the nominee.\n\nWhile Biden's campaign has reaffirmed his commitment to stay in the race, dissent within the party continues to grow. Elected Democrats, including some prominent figures, have publicly urged Biden to step aside, arguing that his current trajectory may not lead to success in the general election.\n\nAs the debate within the Democratic Party intensifies, the question of Biden's candidacy remains unsettled, with various voices both supporting and questioning his ability to defeat Trump in November.", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/George-Clooney-.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

In a new op-ed written for The New York Times, the 63-year-old movie star emphasized that the 81-year-old politician is a \"hero\" but claimed he \"cannot\" win against Donald Trump.\n\n\"I love Joe Biden,\" George began in the essay that was published on Wednesday, July 10. \"As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals. In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced.\"\n\nHowever, the Up in the Air actor noted, \"But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. None of us can.\"\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010,\" George admitted, before adding, \"He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nGeorge was referring to the June 27 debate between Joe and Donald, 78. Throughout the televised event, viewers witnessed the former senator stumble over a few responses. As a result, many have alleged that Joe's age has affected his leadership capabilities.\n\n\"This is about age. Nothing more,\" George continued. \"But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nWithout naming any of the apparent politicians he's spoken to, George concluded his op-ed by calling the president a \"hero\" and noted that he \"saved democracy in 2020.\"\n\n\"We need him to do it again in 2024,\" George added, referring to the choice for Joe to withdraw from the race.\n\nAfter the debate against Donald aired last month, multiple politicians have publicly pleaded for Joe to step aside. However, the president insisted that he is staying in the race, according to a letter obtained by CNN earlier this week.\n\n\"I want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere, I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump,\" Joe wrote. \"We have 42 days to the Democratic Convention and 119 days to the general election. Any weakening of resolve or lack of clarity about the task ahead only helps Trump and hurts us. It is time to come together, move forward as a unified party, and defeat Donald Trump.\"", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodlife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hollywood Life"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elisabeth_mcgowan@hollywoodlife.com", "name": "Elisabeth McGowan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/george-clooney-joe-biden-featured.jpg?quality=100&w=620", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 372, "textEnd": 379}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1010, "textEnd": 1017}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

As part of my participation in the democratic process and in support of my chosen candidate, I have led some of the biggest fund-raisers in my party's history. Barack Obama in 2012. Hillary Clinton in 2016. Joe Biden in 2020. Last month I co-hosted the single largest fund-raiser supporting any Democratic candidate ever, for President Biden's re-election. I say all of this only to express how much I believe in this process and how profound I think this moment is.\n\nI love Joe Biden. As a senator. As a vice president and as president. I consider him a friend, and I believe in him. Believe in his character. Believe in his morals.

We're all so terrified by the prospect of a second Trump term that we've opted to ignore every warning sign. The George Stephanopoulos interview only reinforced what we saw the week before. As Democrats, we collectively hold our breath or turn down the volume whenever we see the president, who we respect, walk off Air Force One or walk back to a mic to answer an unscripted question.\n\nIs it fair to point these things out? It has to be. This is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private.

Bush, to a single person who seeks to hold on to the presidency, and yet most of our members of Congress are opting to wait and see if the dam breaks. But the dam has broken.

Russell had a physical confrontation during the filming of Three Kings . Despite the conflict, Three Kings turned out to be a compelling anti-war satire, showcasing Clooney's acting talents. Both Clooney and Russell went on to have successful careers after Three Kings , but their collaboration ended there.\n\nGeorge Clooney is one of those actors who practically all of Hollywood would jump at the chance to work with. He's proven himself to be an impressive performer with his work in movies such as The Descendants, The Ides of March, Michael Clayton, and Up in the Air. He's also directed a fair number of films, most notably the stellar Good Night, and Good Luck, which he is bringing to the stage for his Broadway debut. This has led Clooney to interact with a wide range of actors and directors, and even reunite with them; Jon Watts' crime drama Wolfs will see him re-team with Brad Pitt. But there's one director that Clooney has sworn off working with, due to the fact that a confrontation between him and said director turned physical. That director? None other than David O. Russell, who directed Clooney in 1999's Three Kings.\n\nThree Kings RActionComedyWar Release Date September 27, 1999 Director David O. Russell Cast George Clooney , Mark Wahlberg , Ice Cube , Spike Jonze , Cliff Curtis , Nora Dunn Runtime 114 minutes Main Genre Adventure Writers John Ridley , David O. Russell Expand What Is 'Three Kings' About?\n\nThree Kings opens in the closing days of the Persian Gulf War, as Major Archie Gates (Clooney) is struggling with a heavy bout of disillusionment. After another soldier, Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg), finds a map on a deceased Iraqi soldier, Archie manages to convince him that it leads to a shipment of gold that was stolen from Kuwait. They decide to take it for themselves, but end up running into several obstacles along the way, including the uprisings against Saddam Hussein. Gates and Barlow, alongside fellow soldiers Elgin (Ice Cube) and Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze) try to stay one step ahead of the combat while holding onto their ill-gotten gains.\n\nThree Kings marked a change of pace for both Clooney and Russell. Clooney was looking to transition from his role on ER into movies, but his previous efforts, including the infamous Batman & Robin, hadn't lit the world on fire. After reading the script for Three Kings, Clooney was blown away by it, and lobbied to play the role. (He got lucky when Nicolas Cage wound up signing on to Martin Scorsese's Bringing Out The Dead.) Russell, on the other hand, was used to working in indie films. Three Kings was his biggest project to date, which led to conflict with Clooney and other figures.\n\nDavid O. Russell Was a Problem Before the Movie Started\n\nFrom the jump, Three Kings was plagued with behind the scenes problems. Chief among them was conflict between Russell and Warner Bros., as the studio reduced both the shooting time and the budget over concerns about the source material. \"Some people at the studio thought we might be in danger making the film -- danger from terrorists,\" Clooney told Entertainment Weekly in a 2005 interview covering the making of Three Kings. There was also the matter of the screenplay; John Ridley originally wrote a script tilted Spoils of War, which would focus on a heist set during the Gulf War.\n\nRelated In Defense of George Clooney's Batman Nipple Suit\n\nFree the nipple!\n\nWhen Warner Bros. approached Russell, they showed him a list of scripts and Spoils of War appealed to him due to the heist angle, which caused conflict with Ridley. Ridley ended up getting a \"story by\" credit on the final cut of Three Kings, but he blocked Russell's efforts to get the screenplay published in book form. \"I get calls all the time from the producers and the studio asking me to please let him publish this thing. But I've been completely disrespected through this whole process and now they're asking for a favor? The answer is no.\" Russell's also been linked to abusive incidents throughout his career. This includes screaming at Lily Tomlin on the set of I Heart Huckabees and putting Christopher Nolan into a headlock to demand that Jude Law drop out of filming The Prestige so that he could work with Russell.\n\nGeorge Clooney Hated How David O. Russell Treated People During Production\n\nThis eventually led to the infamous fist fight between Clooney and Russell. During shooting, an extra had an epileptic seizure and Clooney rushed to his aid, later taking Russell to task for his indifference. Then, in a scene featuring Ice Cube's character Elgin, an extra was having difficulty throwing him to the ground, so Russell stepped in. Clooney thought he was being too rough with the extra, which led to the two fighting and Clooney putting Russell into a headlock. Producer Charles Roven recalled the fight in detail during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter:\n\nNow we're shooting the climax of the movie. Helicopters, explosions, gunfire. It's chaos, madness. And George sees David talking to the extras' [assistant director], and it looks like he's yelling at him. But he's yelling to be heard. And George comes running over and goes, \"I told you, motherf -- er, if you're going to pick on somebody, pick on me.\" And David goes, \"Why don't you just f -- ing remember your lines for once?\" And boom! They grab each other, and they're tussling. And so I pulled George away. That was it.\n\nBoth Clooney and Russell gave their own conflicting version of the event; Clooney told EW that he saw Russell going \"nuts\" on the extra and decided to step in. \"So I got him by the throat. And I was yelling at him and he was screaming at me and we were at it.\" Russell had a far more charged response back in 2004: \"I never physically attacked him. If I ran into him, I'd say, 'Shut the fuck up, you lying-ass bitch.'\"\n\n'Three Kings' Turned Out To Be a Compelling Anti-War Satire\n\nDespite the chaotic production, Three Kings turned out to be a truly unique war film. Part of that was due to how the film was shot, as Russell opted to use handheld cameras throughout shooting. The end result makes the audience feel like they're a part of the film, resulting in some truly disturbing sequences. Case in point: when soldier Conrad Vig (Spike Jonze) is fatally wounded, the point of view shifts to inside his body, showing a bullet piercing multiple organs. The same happens when a bullet pierces Barlow's chest, causing air to crush one of his lungs. None of this is pretty, but it's a compelling picture of the physical toll war takes on its combatants. Russell also leaves room for some truly absurd moments, including a moment in the third act where Elgin finds a Nerf football stuffed with C4...and takes out a helicopter with it.\n\nThe real highlight of the movie, however, is Clooney's performance as Gates. This is a man who's been thoroughly demoralized by war; he's sunken into a pit of debauchery and sees the heist as a way to find a sense of purpose. When he asks the other soldiers what the most important thing in life is, the answers range from respect (Barlow) to \"God's will\" (Elgin). Gates responds, \"Necessity,\" and when pressed to expand upon this, he continues: \"As in, people do what is most necessary to them at any given moment.\" This is a haunting line, made all the more haunting by Clooney's intense stare as well as the way he delivers his lines with fierce, unwavering clarity. Clooney also gets to deliver some stinging one-liners, including a bit about a map of Saddam Hussein's bunkers that should not be as funny as it is. This ability to shift between acerbic and melancholic was proof of Clooney's talents, and it's a balance he'd employ in future roles.\n\nGeorge Clooney and David O. Russell Hit Highs and Lows After 'Three Kings' Close\n\nThree Kings proved to be a major career boost for both Clooney and Russell, as they'd continue to score high profile projects and work with the cream of Hollywood's crop. Clooney would join forces with Pitt and Steven Soderbergh for Ocean's Eleven, one year after Three Kings. Russell went on to direct a trio of critical hits, including The Fighter, Silver Linings Playbook, and American Hustle, pairing him with the likes of Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Amy Adams and Christian Bale. But in recent years, both men have seen a dip in the reception of their projects. Clooney's last two directorial efforts, The Tender Bar and The Boys in the Boat, debuted to mixed reception, while Russell's most recent film, Amsterdam, was a star-studded box office bomb. It's a miracle the pair were able to complete Three Kings, though it's probably for the best that they never work together again.\n\nThree Kings is available to rent on Prime Video in the U.S.\n\nRent on Prime Video", "source": {"uri": "collider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Collider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_Magi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Biblical Magi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ridley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Ridley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_Cube", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ice Cube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Russell", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David O.

Mike Lawler (R-NY) asked Powell.\n\n\"No,\" the Fed chairman responded under oath.\n\nImmediately following the exchange, Rep. Al Green (D-TX) interjected with a point of order.

But do celebrity interventions have an impact on elections?", "body": "LONDON -- Soccer supremo Kylian Mbappe may not have been able to propel France to victory in Euro 2024 but did he score a personal political win by trying to derail the far-right's path to government?\n\nBefore the first round of voting in the National Assembly elections last month, Mbappe had urged France's young voters to reject extremism. His message did not stop National Rally, Marine Le Pen's anti-immigration party, from securing a third of all votes cast, putting it on track to form a government.\n\nWith Le Pen's far-right cohort on the march, Mbappe decided it was time for a more direct approach ahead of the second round of voting on July 7.\n\n\"We cannot leave our country in the hands of these people, it is really urgent,\" the 25-year-old said during a press conference in Germany two days before polls opened. \"We saw the results of the first round, it's catastrophic. We really hope that this will change and that everyone will mobilize to vote ... and vote for the right side.\"\n\nMbappe did not get the result he wanted in the Euros, with Les Bleus crashing out after a 2-1 defeat to Spain in the semifinal on Tuesday. The outcome of the second round of voting in the parliamentary election will likely have been far more satisfying to him, however.\n\nNational Rally was pushed into third place as tactical voters rallied behind the New Popular Front, a left-wing coalition, and President Emmanuel Macron's second-place centrist Together alliance in a result that produced a hung parliament.\n\nIn the United States, actor George Clooney made headlines on Wednesday when he called on President Joe Biden to step aside in his race against former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a New York Times guest essay, Clooney cited fears the 81-year-old Democratic president is ailing.\n\n\"This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private,\" Clooney wrote.\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010,\" Clooney wrote. \"He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nCelebrity endorsements are common in the U.S. and they are becoming mainstream in the U.K. as well.\n\n\"Love, Actually\" and \"Notting Hill\" star Hugh Grant spent the 2019 general election campaigning for anti-Brexit candidates, while Robert Del Naja from British trip-hop group Massive Attack voiced support for Green Party leader Carla Denyer in her successful bid for election as a member of Parliament in last week's national vote.\n\nIn a culture where potential lawmakers have to try to shout above the daily noise of competing interests, Josephine Harmon, an assistant professor of political science at Northeastern University in London, says endorsements by popular celebrities can \"add a bit of gold dust to a politician's status.\"\n\n\"I think it helps them seem humanized and popular,\" Harmon says. \"Ultimately, that is what politics is about and I think it can give politicians a boost if people associate them with a favored celebrity.\"\n\nCelebrities and other so-called \"influencers,\" with their huge social media followings and ability to generate headlines, can also broaden appeal for politicians slugging it out on the campaign trail.\n\n\"In 2020, Taylor Swift came out for [U.S. President] Joe Biden and during the election [American rapper] Cardi B did a lot with Bernie Sanders,\" Harmon says.\n\n\"That can clearly reach a younger audience who may not otherwise follow politics. \"If you suddenly see it in your social media feed or on TikTok or wherever, and see your favorite celebrity has done an interview or had a conversation with a politician, that politician is much more likely to get traction just by having that entry into people's attention spans.\"", "source": {"uri":

(Scripps News)\n\nJust weeks ago, actor George Clooney headlined a record-breaking fundraiser for President Joe Biden's reelection campaign. Today, he's calling for the nation's leader to exit the race.\n\nIn a New York Times op-ed published Wednesday, Clooney wrote of his love for the president in his position now, as the former vice president, a former senator and as his friend. But despite the \"lifelong Democrat\" still saying \"I believe in him,\" he doesn't believe the president can succeed at another term.\n\n\"In the last four years, he's won many of the battles he's faced. But the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time,\" Clooney wrote. \"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nPresident Biden and his campaign have insisted his shaky debate performance against Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump last month was just a \"bad night\" compounded by his having a cold, as he told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos in his first post-debate TV interview.\n\nBut Clooney is now just one of a chorus of big-name voices -- including author Stephen King, Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings, director Rob Reiner and Abigail Disney -- who aren't convinced the Democrat can beat the Republican choice. At least eight members of Congress have agreed, and Clooney says even more are holding their tongue.\n\nRELATED STORY | In emphatic campaign speech, Biden says, 'I am running and going to win again'\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate,\" he wrote. \"This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nClooney insisted his call is \"about age. Nothing more,\" while asking top Democrats like Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries and Nancy Pelosy to ask President Biden to \"voluntarily step aside.\" He then mentioned Vice President Kamala Harris, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and California Gov. Gavin Newsom as possible replacements that could be chosen at the party's convention next month.\n\n\"Would it be messy? Yes. Democracy is messy. But would it enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out? It sure would,\" Clooney wrote.\n\nYet a replacement situation would prove to be an about-face for the Biden administration and his political allies. Earlier this week, the president sent a letter to congressional Democrats acknowledging the concerns of everyone from party leaders to voters, but vowed to stay in the race.\n\n\"I can respond to all

Photograph: Mario Anzuoni/Reuters\n\nIn a New York Times guest essay published on Wednesday, Clooney wrote, 'The one battle he cannot win is the fight against time. It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.'\n\nLast month, Clooney co-hosted a $28 million fund-raiser in Hollywood for Biden, which the campaign cited as the largest ever for a Democratic candidate.\n\nNow, his public plea makes him the most high-profile figure within the party to urge President Biden to withdraw from the race, as reported by The New York Times.\n\nClooney's essay came just hours after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested in a television interview that 'it's up to the president to decide if he is going to run'.\n\nThis statement has added fuel to the ongoing discussions within the Democratic Party about Biden's viability as a candidate.\n\nDespite the mounting concerns, President Biden and his top aides have maintained that he will stay in the race.\n\nOn Monday, Biden reassured top donors that he would not address the debate controversy any further, though he mentioned it again during a video call with Democratic mayors on Tuesday night.\n\nClooney's essay echoes the personal sentiments of many Democrats, who worry that Biden's continued candidacy could jeopardise not only his own re-election but also the prospects of fellow Democrats in down-ballot races.\n\nClooney wrote, 'We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.'\n\nThe actor's stance comes at a critical juncture, as Biden had seemingly managed to stabilise his standing within the party after recent debates. However, the combination of Pelosi's comments and Clooney's public call for Biden to step down is likely to intensify the scrutiny on the president and his campaign.\n\nA representative for the Biden campaign referred back to the president's letter to congressional Democrats on Monday, in which he reiterated his commitment to stay in the race, The New York Times reported.\n\nNotably, Biden's health at 81 years old has raised many concerns among voters as the November elections near.\n\nSeveral top House Democrats have urged President Biden to step aside from the 2024 campaign, expressing deep concerns about his potential impact on the Democratic Party's chances in the upcoming elections, CNN reported.\n\nFormer Obama senior adviser David Axelrod too publicly called for President Biden to step aside from the 2024 race, citing concerns over Biden's age and performance.\n\nIn an op-ed for CNN, Axelrod emphasised that he believes Biden's duty to the country should prompt him to withdraw, suggesting that failing to do so could overshadow his legacy.\n\nAxelrod's stance underscores growing pressures within the White House following Biden's lacklustre showing in a recent CNN presidential debate.", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rediff.com India Ltd."}, "authors": [{"uri": "utkarsh_mishra@rediff.com", "name": "Utkarsh Mishra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_2012_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama 2012 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Axelrod_(political_consultant)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Axelrod (political consultant)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://im.rediff.com/news/2024/jul/11clooney.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721959", "eventUri": "eng-9721959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 458340562, "relevance": 2}

A growing chorus from Democrats is sinking the president's hopes of steadying his campaign this week - and perhaps ever.\n\nJust when it appeared he had turned a corner, with the influential Congressional Black Caucus and key liberal members of Congress voicing their support for him, the ground has shifted once again - and all in the midst of a high-profile Nato summit with US allies here in Washington.\n\nNow the stakes for Mr Biden's press conference at the end of the Nato summit tomorrow afternoon are even higher. It will be the biggest unscripted test for him since his botched debate two weeks prior which triggered this crisis.\n\nMr Biden also has a sit-down interview scheduled with NBC News presenter Lester Holt on Monday. A fumble or misstep in the days ahead could buttress all the most damaging assertions Mr Clooney, a top Democratic fundraiser, makes in his New York Times piece.\n\nThe actor writes that the president's decline is not an illusion; it's real. He points to a Los Angeles fundraiser he threw for the president last month. \"The Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe... of 2010,\" he writes. \"He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nThe president is not up to the task of beating Donald Trump in November, Clooney continues. He calls the Biden campaign's claim that he is the choice of Democratic primary voters \"disingenuous, at best\". And, perhaps most devastating, he says every prominent Democrat he has spoken with knows all this - whether they're willing to publicly admit it or not.\n\n\"We can put our heads in the sand and pray for a miracle in November, he writes, \"or we can speak the truth.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign is already pushing back against the Clooney piece, noting that the president had flown across nine time zones, from the G7 summit in Italy, to attend the star's fundraiser.\n\nCampaign officials also note that the president has had serious disagreements recently with the star and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, about his administration's Gaza policy. The opinion piece, published three weeks after that Los Angeles fundraiser, could be viewed like a strike timed for maximum effect.\n\nBut Clooney isn't just any movie star. He's a powerful fundraiser for Democrats and has been for years. Given that California, and the Hollywood industry in particular, is a key part of the party's money base, Clooney's comments present a very real threat to Mr Biden.\n\nIt also comes on the heels of expressions of dissatisfaction from other big-money Democratic donors, such as Netflix chair Reed Hastings and IAC chair Barry Diller.\n\nThe actor is also plugged in to party politics, with close ties to former President Barack Obama. It is difficult to imagine that he would have taken to the pages of the New York Times in such a dramatic way, with a double-barrel blast against the sitting president, without at least some tacit sign-off from prominent Democrats.\n\nAnd, increasingly, prominent Democrats are saying things that should give Mr Biden pause.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, hours before Clooney's opinion piece was published, former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi - who still holds considerable influence within the party - stopped notably short of endorsing his bid for re-election.\n\nShe said the president's critics should hold their tongues until after this week's Nato summit. \"Whatever your thinking,\" she said, \"you didn't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week.\"\n\nShe added that Mr Biden should make a decision quickly about whether to continue his campaign. When prodded that the president had already clearly said he would stay in the race, she dodged. \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do,\" Mrs Pelosi said.\n\nAnd later in the day, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine - Hillary Clinton's vice-presidential running mate in 2016 - offered similar lines, about how the president \"will do the patriotic thing for the country\" and \"make that decision\".\n\nCongresswoman Pramila Jaypal of Washington, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, put it even more bluntly: \"I'm fully behind him as our nominee until he's not our nominee.\"\n\nIt's as if Mr Biden's tepid supporters simply won't take \"yes, I'm still running\" as an answer.\n\nMeanwhile, even some of Mr Biden's staunchest supporters have started to engage in \"what if\" scenarios. California Governor Gavin Newsom said he still backs the president, and would not run against Vice-President Kamala Harris as the nominee if Mr Biden stepped aside.\n\nSenate Democrats are meeting with Biden campaign officials on Thursday to discuss the future of the campaign. And Speaker of the House Hakeem Jeffries said he would speak to the president directly about Democratic concerns by Friday.\n\nWheels are turning, but it's unclear whether they are grinding toward a resolution or spinning in place.\n\nIf Mr Biden were to bow out, it's still unclear what happens next. Some have suggested that Ms Harris, as the president's running mate, is next in line.\n\nThe solution, according to Clooney, is for Democrats to regroup and pick a new nominee, although he is vague about how the process could unfold. And his suggestion that, because of the shortened campaign season, whoever the party chooses would be able to avoid opposition research and negative campaigning - either from fellow Democrats or Republicans - seems naive in the extreme.\n\nWhile the mood in Washington has taken a new turn against the president in the past 24 hours, the mathematics of his situation has not changed.\n\nMr Biden still controls the lion's share of national convention delegates who ultimately decide the party's presidential ticket. And while those delegates aren't explicitly bound to support him, he could replace any who show insufficient loyalty.\n\nThe opinion polls, while indicating he is trailing Trump, have not changed dramatically since his ill-fated debate. And few show any of the most obvious alternatives to him - the vice-president and prominent Democratic governors - doing substantially better.\n\nEven Mr Biden's critics, with their appeals to his patriotism, sense of duty and concern for American democracy given the potential for a second Trump presidency, implicitly acknowledge that the decision ultimately lies with him.\n\nWhat Wednesday demonstrated, though, is that if he presses ahead, he may never be able to fully put the concerns about his age behind him. His debate performance may end up being a self-inflicted wound that never heals.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"\n\nHe saw that Biden was a shell of his former self, and yet still helped to raise $30 million for a political lemon. Hey, the show must go on.\n\nWhat took Clooney so long?\n\nAfter all, this was not a rare case of rapid onset aging.\n\nHe and our Tinseltown betters told us this octogenarian career pol was the only guy for the job, spry at 81 and in fighting shape to slay the MAGA boogyman.\n\nThat is, until the debate -- when the showbiz myth of Biden collided with reality. There, Biden was free from teleprompters, protective handlers and press reps who vet every question.\n\nHe was undeniably in a cognitive free fall.\n\nOnly now, Clooney admits that what we saw on TV, he saw in private. Everybody knows it. The jig is finally up.\n\nSadly, that's what this Biden candidacy has been all along: smoke and mirrors, which happens to be the specialty of Hollywood. Clooney is one of the few industry A-listers left. He oozes sex appeal, glamour and a cheekiness that makes him sparkle on the big screen.\n\nHe also oozes elitist bull -- t.\n\nClooney and his celebrity pals -- led by movie mogul Jeffrey Katzenberg, who has been the executive producer of this Biden fantasy -- and accused by angry donors of \"agewashing\" Biden, put on a star studded night despite their weak, confused looking candidate.\n\nBut it was a summer blockbuster doomed to flop because the script was crap and none of the players believed in the project. They were just hoping hype would mask its obvious faults and it would deliver at the box office. Or in this case, at the ballot box.\n\nHow cynical and arrogant. We all saw Biden freeze up on stage. We saw him being gingerly led off by President Obama at the fundraiser (Where's that guy btw?).\n\nAnd The Post, in reporting on his obvious physical shortcomings there and at the G7 summit in Europe, were dismissed by the White House. Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre called the sad videos of Biden, \"cheap fakes\" and accused us of spreading \"misinformation.\"\n\nA familiar refrain dating back to Hunter Biden's lap top.\n\nClooney got the kill sign from the party base who want Biden put out to pasture because they know he can't win. The time arrived for a public and coordinated mass knifing in ol' Joe's back, so the actor obliged.\n\nIt's craven.\n\n\"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024,\" Clooney wrote.\n\nThe left is simply blinded by their hatred of Donald Trump, whom they've promised would end democracy back in 2016 and 2020. In true Hollywood form, they are trotting out another bad dystopian sequel, with the same old script and a new villain: the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025.\n\nLike most Americans, I was and still am clamoring for youth and new ideas for this 2024 election. But this shameful unraveling only emboldens Trump's insistence that we need to look for leadership outside of the establishment. Someone like him.\n\nAs Clooney said in his murderous Times piece, \"democracy is messy.\"\n\nSo is the truth. And the truth is, Hollywood is full of hypocritical, out of touch blowhards, who think so little of the American public.\n\nAnd in concert with the Biden White House, democrat donors, politicians and a conveniently incurious press, they tried to sell us an elaborate Biden lie.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Clooney had said that Biden \"cannot win\" following his disastrous performance in the first debate against predecessor and Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010.

American filmmaker and actor Jon Favreau, who is known for directing famed movies like the Iron Man, told CNN that he agrees with Clooney.\n\n\"I was there. Clooney was exactly right, and every single person I talked to at the fundraiser thought the same thing, except for the people working for Joe Biden, or at least they didn't say that,\" Favreau said.\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president.

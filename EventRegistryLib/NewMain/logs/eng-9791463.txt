She had been in power ever since.\n\nMs Zia, 78, is in poor health and confined to hospital after she was sentenced to 17 years in prison for graft in 2018, with top BNP leaders also behind bars.\n\nRead more: Military takes over in Bangladesh as prime minister flees\n\nSupporters have praised Ms Hasina for leading Bangladesh through an economic boom, largely on the back of the mostly

6% each year since 2009.\n\nPoverty has plummeted and more than 95% of its 170 million people now have access to electricity, with per capita income overtaking India in 2021.\n\nMs Hasina was also hailed for a decisive crackdown on Islamist militants in the Muslim-majority nation after five Bangladeshi extremists stormed a Dhaka cafe popular with Western expatriates and killed 22 people in 2016.\n\nSilencing dissent\n\nHowever, her government's intolerance of dissent gave rise to resentment at home and concern from Washington and elsewhere.\n\nFive top Islamist leaders and a senior

What began as peaceful demonstrations by students frustrated with a quota system for government jobs unexpectedly grew into a major uprising against Hasina and her ruling Awami League party.\n\nThe recent upheaval was the largest and last crisis for the 76-year-old leader, the world's longest-serving female head of government, who won a fourth consecutive term in January in an election boycotted by the main opposition amid concerns that the polls were not free or fair.\n\nHasina first became prime minister in 1996, and then returned in 2008 to win the office she held until Monday.\n\nAnalysts who have tracked her rise say her political life was driven by tragedy. On Aug. 15, 1975, her father and the first leader of independent Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujib Rahman was assassinated in a military coup.\n\nThat fateful night, while 28-year-old Hasina was in Germany with her younger sister, a group of army officers burst into the family\u00b4s Dhaka home and killed her parents, three other siblings and the household staff - 18 people in all.\n\nFILE- Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina gestures as she speaks during a press conference in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Monday, Jan. 6, 2014. Hasina resigned on Monday, June 5, 2024, ending 15 years in power as thousands of protesters defied a military curfew and stormed her official residence. (AP Photo/Rajesh Kumar Singh, File)\n\nSome say the brutal act pushed her to consolidate unprecedented power. It was also what motivated her throughout her political career, analysts say.\n\n\"Hasina has one very powerful quality as a politician - and that is to weaponize trauma,\" said Avinash Paliwal, a former university lecturer who specialized in South Asian strategic affairs said in January ahead of the general election.\n\nTo Hasina, her father was the founder of independent Bangladesh after its forces, aided by India, defeated Pakistan in 1971.\n\nAfter the assassination, Hasina lived for years in exile in India, then made her way back to Bangladesh and took over the Awami League. But the country's military rulers had her in and out of house detention all through the 1980s until, after general elections in 1996, she became prime minister for the first time.\n\nWhat followed was a decadeslong power struggle between Hasina and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, the chief of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, who's now ailing and under house arrest.\n\nThe two women ran the country alternatively for years in a bitter rivalry that polarized Bangladesh politics. Hasina has often accused the BNP of courting hard-line extremists that her party, which calls itself moderate and secular, had worked to stamp out, while Zia\u00b4s BNP claims the Awami League is using oppressive tactics to stay in power.\n\nThe two traded blame as the recent protests turned violent. The BNP, which backed the student protesters, repeated calls for Hasina to step down while she accused them of stoking the violence.\n\nShe said the protests had been overtaken by the BNP and another opposition party that her government banned recently.\n\nAfter Hasina lost the general election in 2001, she became the leader of the opposition. Political violence, unrest and military interventions marked the years until she was reelected.\n\nBack in power, she fixed her sights on the economy and built infrastructure previously unseen in Bangladesh. A strong electricity grid that reaches far-flung villages; big-ticket projects such as highways, rail lines and ports. The country\u00b4s garment industry became one of the world\u00b4s most competitive.\n\nThe development gains sparked other advances: girls were educated on par with boys, and an increasing swell of women joined the workforce. Those close to her described Hasina as hands-on and passionate about uplifting women and poor people.\n\nOn the international stage, Hasina cultivated ties with powerful countries including both India and China. But the United States and other Western nations expressed concerns over human rights violations and press freedoms, straining relations. In January, after she won a fourth consecutive term, the U.S. and the United Kingdom said the polls were not credible, free and fair. Previous elections in 2018 and 2014 were also marred by allegations of vote rigging and a boycott from opposition parties.\n\nHer critics for years accused her government of using harsh tools to muzzle dissent, shrink press freedoms and curtail civil society. Rights groups have also cited forced disappearances of critics, which her government denied.\n\nHer government employed the same heavy-handed approach when these protests began, which inflamed tensions even more, analysts said.\n\nThe student-led movement also came as Bangladesh underwent an economic churn given the recent global slowdown. Ahead of the January polls, there was labor unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nBut the latest furore highlighted the extent of economic distress in the country, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low. Experts say there\u00b4s a lack of quality jobs for young graduates, who increasingly seek the more stable and lucrative government jobs.\n\n\"There have been plenty of protests during Awami League\u00b4s regime over the last 15 years, but nothing as large, long, and violent as this one,\" said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center. He added that the especially ferocious government response of excessive force and deep pent up anger at the state as well as growing economic stress led to the escalation.\n\nAfter 15 years of Hasina's administration, it\u00b4s not clear what comes next.\n\nShortly after she was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country\u00b4s military chief, Gen. Waker-uz-Zaman, said he would seek the president\u00b4s guidance on forming an interim government.\n\nHe promised that the military would launch an investigation into the deadly crackdown on student-led protests that fueled outrage against the government.\n\n\"Keep faith in the military, we will investigate all the killings and punish the responsible,\" he said. \"I have ordered that no army and police will indulge in any kind of firing.\"\n\n\"Now, the students\u00b4 duty is to stay calm and help us,\" he added.\n\nThousands of protesters celebrated in the capital, waving Bangladeshi flags as the news broke, while others looted her official residence, carrying out furniture and even fish from the kitchens.\n\nIt is an \"end of a regime that delivered a lot of development but was increasingly authoritarian, as we saw with the mass killings these past weeks,\" said Naomi Hossain, a research professor specializing in Bangladesh at the London-based SOAS University.\n\nThe country has seen interim governments in the past, Hossain said, adding that for now the hope is that the army will ensure peace.\n\nBut there are fears of reprisal violence. \"It could get ugly if the army isn\u00b4t able to calm people down and defuse the issue. It could be a while before we are out of the woods,\" she added.\n\nPathi reported from New Delhi.\n\nFILE- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina interacts with journalists in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Monday, Dec. 31, 2018.

What began as peaceful demonstrations by students frustrated with a quota system for government jobs unexpectedly grew into a major uprising against Hasina and her ruling Awami League party.\n\nThe recent upheaval was the largest and last crisis for the 76-year-old leader, the world's longest-serving female head of government, who won a fourth consecutive term in January in an election boycotted by the main opposition amid concerns that the polls were not free or fair.\n\nHasina first became prime minister in 1996, and then returned in 2008 to win the office she held until Monday.\n\nAnalysts who have tracked her rise say her political life was driven by tragedy. On Aug. 15, 1975, her father and the first leader of independent Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujib Rahman was assassinated in a military coup.\n\nThat fateful night, while 28-year-old Hasina was in Germany with her younger sister, a group of army officers burst into the family's Dhaka home and killed her parents, three other siblings and the household staff -- 18 people in all.\n\nSome say the brutal act pushed her to consolidate unprecedented power. It was also what motivated her throughout her political career, analysts say.\n\n\"Hasina has one very powerful quality as a politician -- and that is to weaponize trauma,\" said Avinash Paliwal, a former university lecturer who specialized in South Asian strategic affairs said in January ahead of the general election.\n\nTo Hasina, her father was the founder of independent Bangladesh after its forces, aided by India, defeated Pakistan in 1971.\n\nAfter the assassination, Hasina lived for years in exile in India, then made her way back to Bangladesh and took over the Awami League. But the country's military rulers had her in and out of house detention all through the 1980s until, after general elections in 1996, she became prime minister for the first time.\n\nWhat followed was a decadeslong power struggle between Hasina and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, the chief of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, who's now ailing and under house arrest.\n\nThe two women ran the country alternatively for years in a bitter rivalry that polarized Bangladesh politics. Hasina has often accused the BNP of courting hard-line extremists that her party, which calls itself moderate and secular, had worked to stamp out, while Zia's BNP claims the Awami League is using oppressive tactics to stay in power.\n\nThe two traded blame as the recent protests turned violent. The BNP, which backed the student protesters, repeated calls for Hasina to step down while she accused them of stoking the violence.\n\nShe said the protests had been overtaken by the BNP and another opposition party that her government banned recently.\n\nAfter Hasina lost the general election in 2001, she became the leader of the opposition. Political violence, unrest and military interventions marked the years until she was reelected.\n\nBack in power, she fixed her sights on the economy and built infrastructure previously unseen in Bangladesh. A strong electricity grid that reaches far-flung villages; big-ticket projects such as highways, rail lines and ports. The country's garment industry became one of the world's most competitive.\n\nThe development gains sparked other advances: girls were educated on par with boys, and an increasing swell of women joined the workforce. Those close to her described Hasina as hands-on and passionate about uplifting women and poor people.\n\nOn the international stage, Hasina cultivated ties with powerful countries including both India and China. But the United States and other Western nations expressed concerns over human rights violations and press freedoms, straining relations. In January, after she won a fourth consecutive term, the U.S. and the United Kingdom said the polls were not credible, free and fair. Previous elections in 2018 and 2014 were also marred by allegations of vote rigging and a boycott from opposition parties.\n\nHer critics for years accused her government of using harsh tools to muzzle dissent, shrink press freedoms and curtail civil society. Rights groups have also cited forced disappearances of critics, which her government denied.\n\nHer government employed the same heavy-handed approach when these protests began, which inflamed tensions even more, analysts said.\n\nThe student-led movement also came as Bangladesh underwent an economic churn given the recent global slowdown. Ahead of the January polls, there was labor unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nBut the latest furore highlighted the extent of economic distress in the country, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low. Experts say there's a lack of quality jobs for young graduates, who increasingly seek the more stable and lucrative government jobs.\n\n\"There have been plenty of protests during Awami League's regime over the last 15 years, but nothing as large, long, and violent as this one,\" said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center. He added that the especially ferocious government response of excessive force and deep pent up anger at the state as well as growing economic stress led to the escalation.\n\nAfter 15 years of Hasina's administration, it's not clear what comes next.\n\nShortly after she was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief, Gen. Waker-uz-Zaman, said he would seek the president's guidance on forming an interim government.\n\nHe promised that the military would launch an investigation into the deadly crackdown on student-led protests that fueled outrage against the government.\n\n\"Keep faith in the military, we will investigate all the killings and punish the responsible,\" he said. \"I have ordered that no army and police will indulge in any kind of firing.\"\n\n\"Now, the students' duty is to stay calm and help us,\" he added.\n\nThousands of protesters celebrated in the capital, waving Bangladeshi flags as the news broke, while others looted her official residence, carrying out furniture and even fish from the kitchens.\n\nIt is an \"end of a regime that delivered a lot of development but was increasingly authoritarian, as we saw with the mass killings these past weeks,\" said Naomi Hossain, a research professor specializing in Bangladesh at the London-based SOAS University.\n\nThe country has seen interim governments in the past, Hossain said, adding that for now the hope is that the army will ensure peace.\n\nBut there are fears of reprisal violence. \"It could get ugly if the army isn't able to calm people down and defuse the issue. It could be a while before we are out of the woods,\" she added.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Rights groups have also cited forced disappearances of critics, which her government denied.\n\nOpposition rises\n\nHer government employed the same heavy-handed approach when these protests began, which inflamed tensions even more, analysts said.\n\nThe student-led movement also came as Bangladesh underwent an economic churn given the recent global slowdown. Ahead of the January polls, there was labor unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nBut the latest furore highlighted the extent of economic distress in the country, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low. Experts say there's a lack of quality jobs for young graduates, who increasingly seek the more stable and lucrative government jobs.\n\n\"There have been plenty of protests during Awami League's regime over the last 15 years, but nothing as large, long, and violent as this one,\" said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center. He added that the especially ferocious government response of excessive force and deep pent up anger at the state as well as growing economic stress led to the escalation.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nAfter 15 years of Hasina's administration, it's not clear what comes next.\n\nShortly after she was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief, Gen. Waker-uz-Zaman, said he would seek the president's guidance on forming an interim government.\n\nHe promised that the military would launch an investigation into the deadly crackdown on student-led protests that fueled outrage against the government.\n\n\"Keep faith in the military, we will investigate all the killings and punish the responsible,\" he said. \"I have ordered that no army and police will indulge in any kind of firing.\"\n\n\"Now, the students' duty is to stay calm and help us,\" he added.\n\nThousands of protesters celebrated in the capital, waving Bangladeshi flags as the news broke, while others looted her official residence, carrying out furniture and even fish from the kitchens.\n\nIt is an \"end of a regime that delivered a lot of development but was increasingly authoritarian, as we saw with the mass killings these past weeks,\" said Naomi Hossain, a research professor specializing in Bangladesh at the London-based SOAS University.\n\nThe country has seen interim governments in the past, Hossain said, adding that for now the hope is that the army will ensure peace.\n\nBut there are fears of reprisal violence. \"It could get ugly if the army isn't able to calm people down and defuse the issue. It could be a while before we are out of the woods,\" she added.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

She served as her father's political liaison during his imprisonment by the Pakistani government.\n\nAfter Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan in 1971, her father Mujibur Rahman became the president and then prime minister of the country. However, in August 1975, Rahman, his wife and their three sons were assassinated in their home by military officers.\n\nHasina and her younger sister Sheikh Rehana survived the purge as they were abroad. Hasina, who spent six years in exile in India, was elected as the leader of the Awami League, a party founded by her father.\n\nIn 1981, Hasina returned home and became vocal about democracy in the country ruled by the military, which placed her under house arrest on multiple occasions.\n\nIn the 1991 general elections, the Hasina-led Awami League failed to secure a majority. Her rival Khaleda Zia of the BNP became prime minister.\n\nFive years later, Hasina was elected prime minister in the 1996 general elections.\n\nHasina was voted out of office in the 2001 elections but returned to power with a thumping victory in 2008 polls. Khaleda Zia-led BNP has been left in the lurch since then.\n\nHasina escaped an assassination bid in 2004 when a grenade exploded at her rally.\n\nSoon after coming to power in 2009, Hasina set up a tribunal to try 1971 war crimes cases. The tribunal convicted some high-profile members of the opposition, sparking violent protests.\n\nJamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist party and a key ally of BNP, was banned from participating in elections in 2013. BNP chief Khaleda Zia was sentenced to 17 years in prison on corruption charges.\n\nThe BNP boycotted the 2014 elections but joined the one in 2018, which party leaders later said was a mistake, alleging that the voting was marred with widespread rigging and intimidation.\n\nIn the 2024 elections, the BNP and its allies boycotted the votes, demanding polls under a non-party caretaker government. They alleged that Hasina cannot deliver credible voting.\n\nThe polls were fought by 27 political parties, including the parliamentary opposition Jatiya Party. The rest were members of the ruling Awami League-led coalition, which experts dubbed as the \"satellite parties.\" The BNP's boycott, however, raised questions about the credibility of the polls, which registered a low turnout.\n\nSix months after the elections, a massive protest erupted against her government over a controversial quota system that reserved 30 per cent of government jobs for relatives of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's War of Independence in 1971. Over 300 protesters were killed in violence during the protests that led to her dramatic ouster.\n\nHasina presided over one of the world's fastest-growing economies and improved living standards in the South Asian nation in the past 15 years. The NEWSNEXTBD.com dubbed her the \"Iron Lady\" several years back and since then it was used by the Western media to refer to her.\n\nHer supporters credit Hasina with humming development projects and providing stability in the country, which has witnessed military rule for years.\n\nHasina won praise for the handling of the world's biggest refugee crisis as over a million Rohingyas have taken shelter in Bangladesh after fleeing for their lives in neighbouring Myanmar to evade persecution after a 2017 army crackdown at their homeland.\n\nHasina is also credited for skilfully negotiating the rival interests of India and China as Bangladesh is virtually sandwiched between the two Asian giants. She got the support of both the big neighbours and Russia ahead of the elections.\n\nBangladesh's per capita income tripled since Hasina took power in January 2009 while its gross domestic product (GDP) clocked at a growth rate of 7.28 per cent last year.\n\nThe country of nearly 170 million people has achieved near self-sufficiency in food production and raised average life expectancy to levels higher than neighbouring India.\n\nPeople close to her used to say that the premier is a \"workaholic\" and she performs the daily Islamic rituals.\n\nRising energy and commodity prices in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, however, forced her government to seek IMF support amid falling foreign reserves.\n\nThe workers in Bangladesh's main export-earning garment industry were dissatisfied with a recent wage hike and lodged protests in recent years.\n\nPolitical opponents described Hasina's government an \"autocratic\" and corrupt regime, while many civil society figures and rights groups accused it of rights abuses.\n\nThe 2022 US human rights report highlighted widespread abuses, yet security forces enjoyed impunity. Corruption has been the other major issue.\n\nHasina is the mother of a mental health expert daughter and an ICT specialist son, who is also her ICT affairs adviser. Her husband was a nuclear scientist who died in 2009.

Only Ms Hasina and her younger sister survived as they were travelling abroad at the time.\n\nAfter living in exile in India, Ms Hasina returned to Bangladesh in 1981 and became the leader of the political party her father belonged to, the Awami League.\n\nShe joined hands with other political parties to hold pro-democracy street protests during the military rule of General Hussain Muhammed Ershad. Propelled by the popular uprising, Ms Hasina quickly became a national icon.\n\nShe was first elected to power in 1996. She earned credit for signing a water-sharing deal with India and a peace deal with tribal insurgents in the south-east of the country.\n\nBut at the same time, her government was criticised for numerous allegedly corrupt business deals and for being too subservient to India.\n\nShe later lost to her former ally turned nemesis, Begum Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), in 2001.\n\nAs heirs to political dynasties, both women have dominated Bangladesh politics for more than three decades and are known as the \"battling Begums\". Begum refers to a Muslim woman of high rank.\n\nObservers say their bitter rivalry has resulted in bus bombs, disappearances and extrajudicial killings becoming regular occurrences.\n\nMs Hasina eventually came back to power in 2009 in polls held under a caretaker government.\n\nA true political survivor, she endured numerous arrests while in opposition as well as several assassination attempts, including one in 2004 that damaged her hearing.

What began as peaceful demonstrations by students frustrated with a quota system for government jobs unexpectedly grew into a major uprising against Hasina and her ruling Awami League party.\n\nThe recent upheaval was the largest and last crisis for the 76-year-old leader, the world's longest-serving female head of government, who retained power for a fourth consecutive term in January in an election boycotted by the main opposition amid concerns that the polls were not free or fair.\n\nHow it all began\n\nHasina first became prime minister in 1996, and then returned in 2008 to win the office she held until Monday.\n\nAnalysts who have tracked her rise say her political life was driven by tragedy. On Aug. 15, 1975, her father and the first leader of independent Bangladesh, Sheikh Mujib Rahman was assassinated in a military coup.\n\nThat fateful night, while 28-year-old Hasina was in Germany with her younger sister, a group of army officers burst into the family's Dhaka home and killed her parents, three other siblings and the household staff -- 18 people in all.\n\nSome say the brutal act pushed her to consolidate unprecedented power. It was also what motivated her throughout her political career, analysts say.\n\n\"Hasina has one very powerful quality as a politician -- and that is to weaponize trauma,\" said Avinash Paliwal, a former university lecturer who specialized in South Asian strategic affairs said in January ahead of the general election.\n\nTo Hasina, her father was the founder of independent Bangladesh after its forces, aided by India, defeated Pakistan in 1971.\n\nAfter the assassination, Hasina lived for years in exile in India, then made her way back to Bangladesh and took over the Awami League. But the country's military rulers had her in and out of house detention all through the 1980s until, after general elections in 1996, she became prime minister for the first time.\n\nTwo women, two parties\n\nWhat followed was a decadeslong power struggle between Hasina and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, the chief of the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, who's now ailing and under house arrest.\n\nThe two women ran the country alternatively for years in a bitter rivalry that polarized Bangladesh politics. Hasina has often accused the BNP of courting hard-line extremists that her party, which calls itself moderate and secular, had worked to stamp out, while Zia's BNP claims the Awami League is using oppressive tactics to stay in power.\n\nThe two traded blame as the recent protests turned violent. The BNP, which backed the student protesters, repeated calls for Hasina to step down while she accused them of stoking the violence.\n\nShe said the protests had been overtaken by the BNP and another opposition party that her government banned recently.\n\nYears of turmoil\n\nAfter Hasina lost the general election in 2001, she became the leader of the opposition. Political violence, unrest and military interventions marked the years until she was reelected.\n\nBack in power, she fixed her sights on the economy and built infrastructure previously unseen in Bangladesh. A strong electricity grid that reaches far-flung villages; big-ticket projects such as highways, rail lines and ports. The country's garment industry became one of the world's most competitive.\n\nThe development gains sparked other advances: girls were educated on par with boys, and an increasing swell of women joined the workforce. Those close to her described Hasina as hands-on and passionate about uplifting women and poor people.\n\nOn the international stage, Hasina cultivated ties with powerful countries including both India and China. But the United States and other Western nations expressed concerns over human rights violations and press freedoms, straining relations. In January, after she retained power for a fourth consecutive term, the U.S. and the United Kingdom said the polls were not credible, free and fair. Previous elections in 2018 and 2014 were also marred by allegations of vote rigging and a boycott from opposition parties.\n\nHer critics for years accused her government of using harsh tools to muzzle dissent, shrink press freedoms and curtail civil society. Rights groups have also cited forced disappearances of critics, which her government denied.\n\nOpposition rises\n\nHer government employed the same heavy-handed approach when these protests began, which inflamed tensions even more, analysts said.\n\nThe student-led movement also came as Bangladesh underwent an economic churn given the recent global slowdown. Ahead of the January polls, there was labor unrest and dissatisfaction with the government.\n\nBut the latest furore highlighted the extent of economic distress in the country, where exports have fallen and foreign exchange reserves are running low. Experts say there's a lack of quality jobs for young graduates, who increasingly seek the more stable and lucrative government jobs.\n\n\"There have been plenty of protests during Awami League's regime over the last 15 years, but nothing as large, long, and violent as this one,\" said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center. He added that the especially ferocious government response of excessive force and deep pent up anger at the state as well as growing economic stress led to the escalation.\n\nWhat's next?\n\nAfter 15 years of Hasina's administration, it's not clear what comes next.\n\nShortly after she was seen on TV boarding a military helicopter with her sister, the country's military chief, Gen. Waker-uz-Zaman, said he would seek the president's guidance on forming an interim government.\n\nHe promised that the military would launch an investigation into the deadly crackdown on student-led protests that fueled outrage against the government.\n\n\"Keep faith in the military, we will investigate all the killings and punish the responsible,\" he said. \"I have ordered that no army and police will indulge in any kind of firing.\"\n\n\"Now, the students' duty is to stay calm and help us,\" he added.\n\nThousands of protesters celebrated in the capital, waving Bangladeshi flags as the news broke, while others looted her official residence, carrying out furniture and even fish from the kitchens.\n\nIt is an \"end of a regime that delivered a lot of development but was increasingly authoritarian, as we saw with the mass killings these past weeks,\" said Naomi Hossain, a research professor specializing in Bangladesh at the London-based SOAS University.\n\nThe country has seen interim governments in the past, Hossain said, adding that for now the hope is that the army will ensure peace.\n\nBut there are fears of reprisal violence. \"It could get ugly if the army isn't able to calm people down and defuse the issue. It could be a while before we are out of the woods,\" she added.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

She will be in India, but for a short while, according to sources. It could be a short halt and Hasina would be flying to the United Kingdom.\n\nHasina, along with her sister, would be landing in Delhi, after pressure mounted for the Bangladesh PM's resignation, amid anarchy and a day of clashes that saw 98 people dead.\n\nThe last time a troubled Hasina sought refuge in India was after the massacre of her family, including her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in 1975. Sheikh Hasina took refuge in India along with her husband, children, and sister. They lived in Delhi's Pandara Road under an assumed identity for six years, from 1975 to 1981.\n\nOn August 15, 1975, Sheikh Hasina's father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of Bangladesh, was brutally assassinated along with 18 members of her family, nearly four years after taking over as the newly former country's president.\n\nHasina, in 2022, recalled receiving the news of the mass execution of her family and said it was \"unbelievable\".\n\nThis incident sent shockwaves throughout Bangladesh, plunging the country into political turmoil and military rule.\n\nHasina, who was then in West Germany with her husband, MA Wazed Miah, was left with no choice but to seek refuge in India, a country that had played a crucial role in Bangladesh's 1971 Liberation War against Pakistan.\n\nUnder the leadership of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, India extended a helping hand to Hasina, providing her with security and shelter.\n\n\"Mrs Indira Gandhi immediately sent information that she wanted to give us security and shelter... We decided to come back here (Delhi) because we had in our mind that if we go to Delhi, from Delhi we'll be able to go back to our country. And then we'll be able to know how many members of family are still alive,\" Hasina said in the 2022 interview, recounting the moments after her Mujibur Rahman's assassination.\n\nAfter leaving Germany, Hasina, along with her family, including her two young children, was initially placed in a secure house in Delhi, where they lived under tight security due to fears for their lives.\n\nShe said in the 2022 interview how she was a secret resident of Delhi.\n\nHasina's six-year exile in India was a formative period in her life.\n\nAfter landing in Delhi, Hasina met Indira Gandhi, and it was at this meeting that she learnt about the killing of 18 members of her family.\n\n\"She (Indira Gandhi) made all the arrangements for us. A job for my husband and the Pandara Road house. We stayed there,\" Hasina told ANI in 2022.\n\nDuring this time, she forged strong bonds with Indian leaders, including Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee and the Gandhi family. Her stay in India not only ensured her safety but also allowed her to build connections that would later prove instrumental in her political career.\n\nHasina in 2022 said the first two to three years of her exile in India was \"difficult\", especially for her two children - a son and a daughter, who were toddlers then.\n\nHasina said the children would cry and request to be taken to their grandparents, especially their maternal uncle.\n\n\"They remembered my younger brother [Sheikh Russell] mostly,\" Sheikh Hasina recounted in the interview.\n\nIn Delhi, Hasina first lived at 56 Ring Road, Lajpat Nagar-3, then shifted to a house in Lutyens Delhi's Pandara Road.\n\nHasina still remembers those days and remains thankful to India and the Gandhi family. She mostly meets members of the Gandhi family whenever she is in India.\n\nIt was after six years, on May 17, 1981, that Hasina returned to Bangladesh, where she was elected in absentia as the General Secretary of the Awami League.\n\nHer return marked the beginning of a long and arduous battle against the military regimes that had taken hold of the country. Despite facing numerous challenges, including imprisonment on corruption charges, Hasina persevered and eventually rose to power in 1996, becoming the Prime Minister of Bangladesh for the first time.\n\nFast-forward to 2024, and Sheikh Hasina finds herself once again in India during a difficult moment of her life.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India

While this might come as a surprise to some, it's hardly unexpected.\n\nIt's almost as if the writing had been on the wall for quite some time. The recent escalation of protests certainly played a role, but it seems clear that the powers that be were already determined to remove her.\n\nAs 2023 drew to a close, Bangladesh was gearing up for its general elections, slated for January 2024. The United States had publicly expressed its discontent with Hasina.\n\nAs is often the case with US criticisms, the pretext was the defence of \"democracy.\"\n\nThe US imposed sanctions on military officers deemed close to the prime minister, citing allegations of misconduct. It also engaged with the opposition, specifically the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which had ties with Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist group linked to extremists and terrorists. It had even issued veiled threats to Hasina, warning that American cooperation with Dhaka would be jeopardised unless she conceded to opposition demands for a caretaker government to oversee the elections.\n\nThe actions of the US not only emboldened the Islamist Opposition but also granted unwarranted legitimacy to its demands.\n\nHasina, fully aware of the machinations unfolding, defiantly refused to budge.\n\nIn the January elections, the Awami League won 223 out of 300 seats in Parliament. Despite this decisive victory, the US and Western allies maintained that the elections were neither free nor fair. Their criticism stemmed from Hasina's refusal to meet the demands of Islamist opposition, with which the US had aligned itself.\n\nJust seven months later, Hasina has been pushed out of power.\n\nThe main spark for the unrest was frustration over the quota system, but it's not out of the question that those behind the regime change received some backing or encouragement from the US and other international players.\n\nIt's no secret that Hasina travelled to New Delhi twice in quick succession in June this year, right after India's election season ended. Clearly, something was brewing, and both Dhaka and New Delhi were well aware of it.\n\nThey had faced similar situations before, most notably in 2009, when India had prepared a military unit to deploy in Dhaka to protect Hasina.\n\nIt was India's intervention on Hasina's behalf that had forced the US to back off from escalating tensions with the Awami League government ahead of the January elections.\n\nHasina is viewed as a reliable ally in New Delhi.\n\nShe has not only delivered political stability and economic growth for Bangladesh but also kept Islamist groups in check, ensuring that no anti-India factions, which had flourished under the BNP, could operate from there.\n\nWhile many of India's neighbours have struggled with instability and Chinese influence, Bangladesh has stayed steady.\n\nIndia used this argument with the US, and it seems to have been effective.\n\nHowever, with Hasina now out of power, New Delhi's position is precarious. If the situation in Bangladesh deteriorates, India could face serious consequences.\n\nSuch a scenario could not only open the door for the ISI to re-enter Bangladesh, as it did during BNP rule, but also give China a freer hand in the region.\n\nThe opposition in Bangladesh has portrayed Hasina as an Indian puppet, and if they manage to take power in Dhaka, they're unlikely to cooperate on these critical issues.\n\nBut for now, it seems, this is the reality that India must contend with -- the forces of regime change have prevailed.", "source": {"uri": "swarajyamag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Swarajyamag"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaat-e-Islami", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaat-e-Islami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caretaker_government", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caretaker government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puppet state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-Services_Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inter-Services Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regime_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Regime change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://swarajya.gumlet.io/swarajya%2F2024-02%2Fe9ddc11a-99ee-4337-8fc7-cd6ddc5b0e93%2F1.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791463", "eventUri": "eng-9791463", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Bangladesh's iron lady who resigned after 15 years - Times of India", "body": "Sheikh Hasina, once hailed as the leader who rescued Bangladesh from military rule, saw her 15-year rule come to an abrupt end on Monday as protesters stormed her palace in Dhaka. Hasina's long rule, noted for economic growth and crackdowns, ended amid rising calls for her resignation.\n\nHasina is the daughter of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of Bangladesh.At 27, she lost her father, mother, and three brothers in a 1975 military coup. Returning to Bangladesh six years later, she took the lead of the Awami League party, initiating a decade-long struggle that included multiple house arrests. Hasina played a key role in ousting military dictator Hussain Muhammad Ershad in 1990, alongside her rival Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).\n\nHasina first became prime minister in 1996 but lost the position to Zia five years later. Both leaders were jailed on corruption charges in 2007 following a military-backed coup but were released to contest the 2008 elections, which Hasina won decisively. She has remained in power since, most recently securing a controversial fifth term in January amid accusations of election rigging.\n\nUnder her leadership, Bangladesh experienced significant economic growth, driven largely by its garment export industry. Since 2009, the economy has grown an average of over six percent annually, lifting millions out of poverty and providing over 95 percent of the population with access to electricity. In 2021, Bangladesh's per capita income surpassed that of India.\n\nHowever, Hasina's rule has been criticised for its harsh tactics. Her government faced international condemnation for human rights abuses, including the mass arrest of political opponents and the execution of top Islamist leaders. In 2021, the United States imposed sanctions on an elite branch of Bangladesh's security forces and seven top officers for alleged widespread abuses.\n\nProtests that began in July, initially led by university students against civil service job quotas, quickly escalated into a broader movement demanding Hasina's resignation. The situation intensified last month when police and pro-government student groups violently attacked demonstrators.\n\nDespite her efforts to defend her legacy, including touring areas affected by the unrest, Hasina's grip on power weakened. \"Over 15 years, I've built this country,\" she insisted. However, her autocratic methods and inability to handle dissent ultimately led to her downfall.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

However, her increasingly autocratic methods and failure to address dissent effectively culminated in the end of her long rule.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Standard of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2008 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussain_Muhammad_Ershad", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hussain Muhammad Ershad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda_Zia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khaleda Zia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Mujibur_Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Mujibur Rahman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Zia-ul-Haq", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military dictatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Per_capita_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Per capita income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112291196,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-1031190,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791463", "eventUri": "eng-9791463", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

This recent upheaval recalls a dramatic event from Bangladesh's history in 1975, when Sheikh Hasina's father, then-Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was assassinated, leading Hasina to seek refuge in India.\n\nAfter Bangladesh gained independence, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman became the country's Prime Minister. However, in 1975, a faction of the army revolted against him, resulting in the assassination of Mujibur Rahman and 18 members of his family. This led to significant political upheaval in Bangladesh, with military rule dominating the country for several years following the coup. His assassination marked a dark chapter in the nation's history.\n\nThe coup led to the establishment of a series of military regimes in Bangladesh, causing significant political and social upheaval. The country's political landscape changed drastically following these events.\n\nJust 15 days before Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's assassination, Sheikh Hasina and her sister had already left Bangladesh and went to Germany. At the time, Hasina was in Germany with her husband, MA Wajed Mia, who was conducting research as a nuclear scientist. It was there that she learned of the tragic murder of her entire family.\n\nFollowing the assassination, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi offered Sheikh Hasina protection and asylum in India. Hasina and her family were brought to New Delhi and placed under strict security to ensure their safety. They were provided with accommodation on Pandara Road, and her husband stayed with her. After living in India for about six years, Sheikh Hasina returned to Bangladesh in 1981.\n\nAlso Read: Bangladesh protests: Sheikh Hasina arrives in India after resigning as PM, will move to London, say sources", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arushi_jaiswal@indiatvnews.com", "name": "Arushi Jaiswal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Mujibur_Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Mujibur Rahman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Partition of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military dictatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martial law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indira Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/08/sheikh-hasina-1722858898.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791463", "eventUri": "eng-9791463", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 276, "textEnd": 284}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

It was delivered directly to Sheikh Hasina, 65, the prime minister of Bangladesh. It warned her that Islamist radicals embedded within the Bangladesh Army were planning a coup. Hasina had reason to fear coups. On the night of August 15, 1975, her father, Bangladesh's first president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, her mother and three brothers were massacred by officers of the Bangladesh Army. Hasina and her sister would have been dead as well, but were abroad on a tour of Europe.\n\nAlong with the letter, India had worked out a contingency plan to evacuate the prime minister, her cabinet and key figures of her Awami League party in the event of a coup. There was a military plan as well. Indian helicopter gunships would be launched from two airbases in West Bengal and Tripura into Dhaka to provide air cover for the operation. Landing zones and evacuation sites were identified in and around the capital for the air corridor.\n\nAll through December, Bangladesh's spy agency, the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI), which reports directly to Hasina, quietly went to work. It was headed by Major General Sheikh Mamun Khaled, whom Hasina had personally chosen. They tapped phone communications, SMSs and emails of suspects in the conspiracy. Social networking sites were monitored. A series of arrests was made from December-end to January.\n\nOpposition leader Begum Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh National Party (BNP), who is anti-India by conviction and hates Hasina with a rare passion, alleged at a public rally in Chittagong that army officers were becoming victims of \"sudden disappearance\". The army's media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations Directorate (ISPR), warned Khaleda to refrain from making any statements. The army was worried that public discourse might soon include details of the impending coup. The coup attempt began innocuously.\n\nPosts on a Facebook group, 'Soldiers Forum', instigated soldiers to work against the government. Major Syed Mohammad Ziaul Haq, a graduate of the military academy who was training at the Military Institute of Science and Technology, Dhaka, was identified as the mastermind. He used a mobile phone with a UK number to share details of the conspiracy with 11 other army officers. On his Facebook account, he bragged that \"mid-level officers of Bangladesh Army are bringing changes soon\". On January 8, the banned fanatical organisation Hizb ut-Tahrir (Party of Liberation) distributed provocative leaflets based on his post.\n\nMajor Zia regularly updated his Facebook account with \"information\" on arrests of army officers by \"anti-terrorism agents\", including those of India's external intelligence agency the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW). His messages spread to blogs and were even picked up by a pro-BNP newspaper, Amar Desh. The DGFI and other security agencies kept the suspected plotters under surveillance. They discovered that the likely date of the coup was January 10 or 11.\n\nOne by one, the plotters were picked up and are now detained in military headquarters, Dhaka.\n\nOn January 19, the army unveiled the plot. In its first ever press conference, held at the Army Officers' Club in Dhaka, ISPR spokesperson Brigadier General Muhammad Masud Razzaq took questions, didn't reveal specifics, but talked about the threat to Hasina's \"pro-secular and democratically elected government\". Brigadier Razzaq claimed between 14 and 16 former and active mid-level radical Muslim officers were behind the conspiracy to topple the government and install an Islamist regime. Two retired officers, Lt Col Ehsan Yousuf and Major Zakir, were arrested on charges of conspiracy to overthrow the government and they \"admitted their role in the plot\".\n\nMajor General Mohammad Kamruzzaman, commander of the Comilla-based 33rd Infantry Division, was removed from his command and detained in Dhaka. Another brigadier, Tariqul Alam, commander of 71st Brigade of 9th Division, and Major General Shabbir Ahmad, commander of the Rangpur-based 66 Division, are under surveillance. Eleven other officers from Dhaka and other cantonments across the country have been confined in the capital.\n\nBangladesh Army chief General Mohammad Mainul Islam says the major general and some religious bigots had planned to indoctrinate pious officers. \"They had targeted the deeply religious officers, who they felt would be amenable because they were pious, to execute their conspiracy to overthrow the democratically elected government,\" he says.\n\nOn January 21, Hasina said, \"I would like to thank the Bangladesh Army. Had they not unearthed the conspiracy in time, a great disaster could have taken place. The army saved the patriotic forces and the country as well by throttling the conspiracy to topple the democratic government.\" She accused arch-rival Khaleda of plotting to overthrow her government. The BNP dismissed this as well as allegations that self-exiled BNP leader Tarique Rahman, Khaleda's son, was involved in the aborted coup attempt.\n\nThe Bangladesh Army says Major Zia, the alleged coup mastermind, evaded arrest. His whereabouts are unknown. Yet, it was the resurfacing of an underground Islamist organisation that caused concern. The Bangladesh Army linked the conspirators to the Hizb ut-Tahrir. The Tahrir, an international Sunni pan-Islamist political organisation, advocates an Islamic Caliphate governed by Shariah law. Founded in 1953 in Jerusalem, it has spread to more than 40 countries, and is also active in Pakistan.\n\nThe Hasina government had banned the Tahrir in October 2009. Agencies such as the Rapid Action Battalion, National Security Intelligence and Detective Branch repeatedly claimed they had succeeded in containing them. They based these claims on the detention of key figures such as Towfiq Elahi, a teacher of a prominent private university, and Dr Golam Haider Rasul, 45, who practises at Dhaka's United Hospital, besides hundreds of others. Tahrir leader Maulana Mamunur Rashid, principal of a Dhaka madrassa, remains a fugitive.\n\nNearly 500 Tahrir members were detained mostly for organising rallies and distributing leaflets. Police officers now admit their inability to curb the well-funded organisation merely through arrests. \"It's tough because families of the detained activists get money from their global network,\" says Lt Col Ziaul Ahsan, director of the Intelligence Wing of the elite anti-crime Rapid Action Battalion. Most of the detained militants released on bail rejoin the outfit. The outfit has resurfaced more aggressively after its ban. Besides the men in uniform, the Hizb ut-Tahrir has spread its invisible tentacles among the social elite, government professionals, academics and politicians. \"They have a new approach to radicalism, the cuckoo's eggs in the crow's nest (trying to covertly embed themselves in society),\" says Nazmul Ahsan Kalimullah, a political scientist in Dhaka University.\n\nSince their 1975 putsch that killed Mujib, the Father of the Nation, the military in Bangladesh has overthrown the civilian government four times. The army has killed two elected presidents and coerced three other presidents into declaring military-backed emergency. The last coup was in January 2007 and since then, attempts have been made to keep the military in the barracks.\n\nThe Supreme Court has been a key force. A landmark judgment by a full bench headed by former chief justice Mohammad Tafazzul Islam on July 28, 2010, declared three military regimes between August 15, 1975, and February 1979 as illegal. The new constitution, adopted by parliament in November 2011, has restored equality of religions. But as UK-based terror analyst Chris Blackburn says, \"The recent coup plot shows that extremism in South Asia has many forms.\n\nThere has always been a trend within the ranks of the military to push the importance of religion in binding a country together. There are certainly officers who see themselves as guardians of both state and religion. But I still think it is too early right now to speculate on Hizb ut-Tahrir's role in the attempted coup. They are an extremist group.\" Hasina has been under threat since she swept to power in early 2009. More than 1,000 paramilitary border guards of Bangladesh Rifles, now renamed Border Guards Bangladesh, revolted against the military's hegemony over their institution. It was symptomatic of the unrest in the armed forces.\n\nIndia helped even then. Sources in the prime minister's office said that as soon as the mutiny broke out, India kept its special forces 50 Parachute Independent Brigade on standby to fly into Dhaka in case of an emergency. New Delhi's support for Hasina is clear. In her third stint as prime minister, Bangladesh has ceased to become a safe haven for militant groups operating in India.\n\nThe military has moved in swiftly to initiate a court of inquiry against the rogue officers. The military brass, meanwhile, reassured the president of its secular credentials and their support. \"There is no room for religious zealots in the Bangladesh Army,\" army chief General Islam told a seminar in Dhaka a week after the botched coup. The civilian government can only hope that it is true.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The numbers are much higher if taken into account the Budget for allied ministries and fertilisers subsidy, he added.\n\nDuring the discussion, opposition parties said the Modi government has not done anything for the agriculture sector in the 10-year rule, and even the latest Union Budget falls short of expectations.\n\nRegarding the charges to cut fertiliser subsidy, Chouhan said farmers are getting fertilisers at highly subsidised prices and assured that they will continue to get the farm nutrients at low prices. The Centre provides extra budget, if required to ensure that farmers continue to get crop nutrients at an affordable rate.\n\nIn 2013-14, he said, the fertilisers subsidy was meagre Rs 71,280 crore, while it was Rs 1,95,420 crore in 2023-24.\n\nThe minister stressed that the Modi government considers farmers as \"God\" and not a \"vote bank\" and attacked the Congress for remembering farmers only during elections.\n\nChouhan said the Modi government is committed to providing remunerative prices to farmers by purchasing quantities at the MSP.\n\nThe agriculture minister also criticised the Congress for not focusing on providing irrigation facilities to farmers, which he said was crucial for boosting productivity and production of crops.

His remarks came during a discussion on the working of his ministry in the Upper House, where he underlined the work done by the Narendra Modi government in the last 10 years while also affirming the Centre's commitment to providing remunerative prices of crops to farmers as well as urea and DAP fertilisers at a highly subsidised rates.\n\nThe Minister listed out the government's six priorities for the growth of the agriculture sector, which include increasing farm production, reducing input cost for farming, providing remunerative prices to farmers, adequate relief to farmers in case of natural calamities, diversification and value addition in agriculture, and promoting natural farming.\n\nChouhan, also a former Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, assured the Opposition that the Centre was open to taking into consideration the concrete suggestions and would also try to implement the workable ones for farmers' welfare.\n\nIn his one-hour-long speech, which will also continue on Monday, Chouhan slammed the Opposition for the accusation that the Modi government was working against the interest of the farmers and also rejected the charges of reduction in allocation of funds to the agriculture sector in the Union Budget 2024-25.\n\nHe also dismissed the allegation that the government was not buying enough quantity of foodgrains from farmers at the minimum support price (MSP).\n\n\"Congress ke DNA mein hi kisan-virodh hai. Aaj se nahi, prarambh se hi Congress ki prathmiktayein galat rahi hai (Congress DNA is anti-farmer. Not from today, but since the beginning, it has misplaced priorities),\" he said.\n\nThe minister also said the agriculture sector was ignored and priorities were misplaced during the Congress rule. People had to eat bad wheat imported from America during the tenure of first Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru, he added.\n\nDuring the rule of late prime minister Indira Gandhi, he said, the government used to forcibly collect levies from farmers.\n\nLate PM Rajiv Gandhi did talk about agriculture price policy but did not take any concrete steps to improve farmers' income, Chouhan said, adding that the late PV Narasimha Rao government did not de-license the industries related to the farm sector.\n\nThe minister pointed out that the UPA rule during the 2004-2014 period was full of scams.\n\n\"The priorities of Congress were wrong. Under the leadership of Modi ji, the priorities were changed,\" Chouhan said and asserted that the BJP-led NDA government is working with a road map for growth of the farm sector.\n\nOn the opposition charge of reduction in the Budget allocations, Chouhan said the Budget outlay for the agriculture department alone is Rs 1,32,470 crore for 2024-25 against Rs 27,663 crore in 2013-14. The numbers are much higher if taken into account the Budget for allied ministries and fertilisers subsidy, he added.\n\n(With PTI inputs)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivraj_Singh_Chouhan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shivraj Singh Chouhan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Agriculture_and_Farmers'_Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Modi_ministry", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Modi ministry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Action_Party_(Malaysia)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Urea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiership_of_Narendra_Modi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premiership of Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fertilizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madhya Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madhya Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._V._Narasimha_Rao", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P.

Similarly, Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP), valued at Rs2,433, is available for Rs1,350.\n\nChouhan stated that the government has increased fertilizer subsidies over the years, with the subsidy amount rising from Rs71,280 crore in 2013-14 to Rs1,95,420 crore in 2023-24.\n\n\"We did not let the burden of increased prices of DAP due to international conditions fall on the farmers. Instead, we introduced a special package of an additional Rs2,625 crore to ensure that farmers could access affordable fertilizers,\" he said.\n\nChouhan emphasized the six key priorities set by the government to enhance India's agricultural sector: increasing production, reducing the cost of production, paying the right price for the produce, providing adequate relief in case of natural calamity, diversifying agriculture, and promoting natural farming.\n\nTaking a dig at the Congress party, Chouhan accused them of neglecting irrigation infrastructure during their time in power. He pointed out that under Congress rule, irrigation facilities in Madhya Pradesh were limited to just 7.5 lakh hectares.\n\n\"Congress was in power for years but never paid serious attention to irrigation facilities.

But it has never done that. It was PM Narendra Modi who launched the PM-Kisan scheme (a cash-transfer programme for farmers).\"\n\nThe attack on Congress triggered vehement protests by lawmakers Randeep Singh Surjewala and Digvijaya Singh, who were joined Aam Aadmi Party's Sanjay Singh. The discussion on the farm ministry was raised by Surjewala on Friday when Chouhan gave the first leg of his speech.\n\nCongress's Singh, a former CM of MP, pointed towards Chouhan's tenure as Madhya Pradesh chief minister, when six protesting farmers were allegedly killed in police firing in Mandsaur.\n\nChouhan responded by saying, \"I have warned to not poke me. If you do, I'll not spare you.\" He then listed out instances of farmer killings during the Congress's various tenures.\n\n\"Digvijaya Singh has blood on his hands... 24 farmers were killed. In 1986, 23 farmers were killed by police during Congress rule in Bihar. In 1988 in Delhi, on the occasion of the death anniversary of Indira Gandhi ji, two farmers fell to police bullets. In 1988, they killed five farmers in Meerut. In August 1995, six farmers in Haryana were killed in police shooting,\" Chouhan said.\n\nThe Opposition struck back with loud protests, disrupting the House, and walked out. The Congress also pressed its demand for a right to reply, which chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar rejected. \"There is no right of reply under rule 238(2). If any grievance is raised according to correct provisions, I will consider.\"\n\nSurjewala and Divijaya Singh had sent two letters to the chairman, one seeking a right to reply since the agriculture minister had taken names of Congress prime ministers and the other on Chouhan naming Digvijaya Singh himself.\n\nContinuing his speech after the walkout, Chouhan said he had read all speeches of former PMs given from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day. \"I am sad to present this fact, farmers were never the priority for farmers by the Congress.\"\n\nIn as many as 15 speeches made by Jawaharlal Nehru, the country's first PM, there was no mention of the word \"farmer\", Chouhan said. Without naming leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi, Chouhan said \"one leader, who went to Sonipat during his yatra (march) to meet farmers, was found asking how best to pose with them\".\n\nThe agriculture minister presented a video recording of the Sonepat visit, which the chairman asked the minister to authenticate and submit.\n\nTalking on farm sector, Chouhan said the Modi government was moving towards climate resilient agriculture. \"Nearly 1,500 climate smart biofortified crop varieties will be developed. The PM will launch 109 such varieties this year.\"\n\nThe minister said PM Modi's vision is to take a holistic view of health - of humans, of soil, of animals and plant, and said the central government plans to set up 100 horticulture clusters and amend the Pesticides Act for safe use of farm chemicals.\n\nAdditionally, Chouhan said the government had launched an oilseeds mission worth \u20b968,000 crore and expand irrigation to 1.30 lakh hectares.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Similarly, Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP), valued at Rs2,433, is available for Rs1,350.\n\nChouhan stated that the government has increased fertilizer subsidies over the years, with the subsidy amount rising from Rs71,280 crore in 2013-14 to Rs1,95,420 crore in 2023-24.\n\n\"We did not let the burden of increased prices of DAP due to international conditions fall on the farmers. Instead, we introduced a special package of an additional Rs2,625 crore to ensure that farmers could access affordable fertilizers,\" he said.\n\nChouhan emphasized the six key priorities set by the government to enhance India's agricultural sector: increasing production, reducing the cost of production, paying the right price for the produce, providing adequate relief in case of natural calamity, diversifying agriculture, and promoting natural farming.\n\nTaking a dig at the Congress party, Chouhan accused them of neglecting irrigation infrastructure during their time in power. He pointed out that under Congress rule, irrigation facilities in Madhya Pradesh were limited to just 7.5 lakh hectares.\n\n\"Congress was in power for years but never paid serious attention to irrigation facilities. There are not just one but many examples of this. When there was a Congress government in Madhya Pradesh, there was irrigation facility in only 7.5 lakh hectares.

He said the Centre had set six priorities for the growth of the agriculture sector - increasing production, reducing input cost, providing remunerative prices, granting proper compensation in case of natural calamities, diversification and value addition in agriculture, and promotion of natural farming.

The market price of many crops, including basmati rice, is much higher than the MSP,\" he said.\n\nAt this point, Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar said: \"Less procurement at MSP means the situation of farmers is good and they are getting good prices in the market.\" The problems of farmers must be understood from the right perspective, he said and asked the Centre to regularly raise the MSP.

Congress talked about direct assistance to farmers but Congress never made a scheme like Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi. Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi made this scheme. They (opposition) will not understand but the amount of Rs 6000 matters for small farmers. Due to this Kisan Samman Nidhi, farmers have become self-reliant, farmers have also become empowered and the respect of farmers has also increased. They (opposition) cannot see the respect of farmers,\" Chouhan said.\n\nThe Union Minister claimed that farmers were killed during the rule of Congress governments and listed out such incidents that occurred in different states of the country.\n\n\"When this Congress was in power in different states, farmers were killed. In 1986 when the Congress was in power in Bihar, 23 were killed in firing. In 1988, on the death anniversary of Indira Gandhi in Delhi, 2 farmers were killed. In 1988, they fired on farmers in Meerut and 5 farmers were killed. In August 1995, six farmers in Haryana were killed in police shooting,\" Chouhan said.\n\n\"When I became Agriculture Minister, I felt that I should read the speeches of all the Prime Ministers. When I read those speeches, I was surprised and shocked as farmers were never a priority of the Congress...When our leader Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of India, I read his speeches, you will find that he talked about farmers in his speeches...PM Narendra Modi has farmer welfare in his heart and that is why he talks about farmers,\" the Union Minister added.\n\nChouhan also launched a veiled attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for making a \"reel\" with the farmers in Sonipat.\n\n\"A leader who organises big yatras. During that yatra, he went to Sonipat in Haryana. He made a reel to make it look real. There were more cameramen than farmers...He goes to the field with cameras and does drama. When he is shown the plough he asks what is this? When a former Prime Minister came to know that the price of red chilli is more than green chilli, he asked the farmers why don't you grow red chilli,\" he said.\n\nIn July 2023, on his way from Delhi to Shimla (Himachal Pradesh), Rahul Gandhi reached Sonipat, where he met farmers at various villages of Baroda. He joined them in the sowing process, as they worked at the fields in Baroda and Madina.\n\nEarlier on Friday, Shivraj Singh Chouhan highlighted the Narendra Modi government's decade-long efforts to support farmers, promising the continued availability of affordable fertilizers.\n\nIn an address to the Rajya Sabha, Chouhan said, \"I want to assure the crores of farmer brothers and sisters across the country that the government under Modi Ji and the Bharatiya Janata Party will continue to provide cheap fertilizers.\"\n\nChouhan detailed the significant subsidies being offered, noting that urea, typically worth Rs2,366, is provided to farmers at just Rs266. Similarly, Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP), valued at Rs2,433, is available for Rs1,350.\n\nChouhan stated that the government has increased fertilizer subsidies over the years, with the subsidy amount rising from Rs71,280 crore in 2013-14 to Rs1,95,420 crore in 2023-24.\n\n\"We did not let the burden of increased prices of DAP due to international conditions fall on the farmers. Instead, we introduced a special package of an additional Rs 2,625 crore to ensure that farmers could access affordable fertilizers,\" he said.

Under Narasimha Rao, agricultural exports rose, with their share in total exports increasing from 10% in 1990 to 20% by 1996,\" he said.\n\nKhera said the National Food Security Mission (NFSM), launched in 2007, boosted rice, wheat and pulse production from 218 million tons in 2007 to 265 million tons in 2014.\n\n\"The list can go on. Whereas under Mr Modi: Over 750 farmers died fighting for their rights while the government paid no heed,\" he alleged.\n\nKhera further said GST increased farming costs, with taxes on tractors (12%), tires (18%) and fertilizers (5%).\n\nMSP increases under the BJP have remained much lower than during the times of the UPA, not keeping up with inflation, he said.\n\nThe promise to double the farmers' income by 2022 was unmet, with real income growing only 2.8% annually from 2015-16 to 2018-19, Khera said.\n\nFarmer debt has surged by 58% since 2013, leading to a high rate of suicides, he added.\n\n\"Frankly, blaming Nehru for all your failures has become a little boring now. Do better,\" the Congress leader said.\n\nIn his remarks in the Rajya Sabha, Chouhan had said, \"Congress ke DNA mein hi kisan-virodh hai. Aaj se nahi, prarambh se hi Congress ki prathmiktayein galat rahi hai (Congress DNA is anti-farmer. Not from today, but since the beginning, it has misplaced priorities).\" PTI ASK AS AS", "source": {"uri": "newsdrum.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsDrum"}, "authors": [{"uri": "newsdrum_desk@newsdrum.in", "name": "NewsDrum Desk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivraj_Singh_Chouhan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shivraj Singh Chouhan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jawaharlal_Nehru", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jawaharlal Nehru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wheat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Agricultural_Research_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Agricultural Research Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irrigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian independence movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhakra_Dam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bhakra Dam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._V._Narasimha_Rao", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "P.

In Delhi, in 1988, on the occasion of the death anniversary of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, two farmers were shot dead by the police. In 1988, they killed five farmers in Meerut. In 1995, six farmers were killed by police in Haryana,\" the Union Minister added.\n\nMeanwhile, the Opposition held loud protests and walked out of the House.\n\nThe Congress pushed for a reply but the demand was denied by Rajya Sabha Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar.\n\n\"There is no right of reply under rule 238(2). If any grievance is raised as per the correct provisions, I will consider it,\" Dhankhar said.\n\nThe Agriculture Minister continued that during Congress rule, on August 23, 1995, a similar action took place.\n\nHe said, \"On August 23, 1995, farmers were shot at in Haryana, resulting in the deaths of six farmers.

He was asking the cameramen where to stand and what to do.\"\n\nReferring to this incident, he said that farmers' welfare will not happen through \"drama.\"\n\n\"I am a farmer's son, and I farm myself,\" he added.\n\nRegarding the farm sector, Chouhan mentioned that the PM Modi-led Central government is moving towards climate-resilient agriculture. He said that nearly 1,500 climate-smart biofortified crop varieties will be developed, and 109 such varieties will be launched by the Prime Minister this year.\"\n\nHe stated that PM Modi's vision is to take a holistic view of health, including that of humans, soil, animals and plants.,The Central government plans to set up 100 horticulture clusters and amend the Pesticides Act for safe use of

While late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi talked about agricultural price policies, Chouhan argued that he did not take concrete steps to improve farmers' income.\n\nAdditionally, he pointed out that the UPA government from 2004 to 2014 was marked by scandals.\n\n\"The priorities of Congress were wrong.

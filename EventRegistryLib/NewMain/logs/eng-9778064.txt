It comes as the Duke has been involved in a long-running legal battle with the UK Government over security arrangements for himself and his family when they visit Britain.\n\nA close source to King Charles has accused Harry of \"emotionally blackmailing\" his father, allegedly using the threat of keeping Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet from meeting their grandfather unless he receives automatic security in the UK. But now, a source close to Prince Harry has shared the real reason he is not coming back.\n\nThe monarch's friend told the Daily Beast: \"Harry has lost his security case in court, and is now trying the emotional blackmail route to get what he wants instead, cynically using the threat of Archie and Lilibet never meeting their grandfather again as a tactic to coerce the king into overruling RAVEC.\n\n\"The idea that the security forces are going to allow the Sussexes to be attacked by an acid-throwing or knife-wielding maniac on British soil is absurd, and Harry knows it. Using it as leverage, as a reason to withhold his kids from their grandfather, is beyond contempt.\n\n\"Charles is being treated for very serious cancer, so even if he could find the time, he cannot just fly to Los Angeles at the drop of a hat, like Harry can -- and actually did earlier this year -- in the other direction.\"\n\nHowever, one of the insiders from the Sussex team dismissed these claims insisting that the \"neo-Nazis and extremist\" threats are \"very real.\" They argue that Harry's insistence on police security in the UK is driven by his desire for his children to \"know his home country.\"\n\nThe source also mentioned that Harry has offered to \"cover the cost of security, so as not to impose on the British taxpayer.\" The Prince lost his case against the Home Office in February as High Court judge Sir Peter Lane found \"there has not been any unlawfulness in reaching the decision\" to revise his security.\n\n\"Any departure from the policy was justified,\" the judge continued. \"The decision was not irrational. The decision was not marred by procedural unfairness.\"\n\nIn April, Harry also lost his initial bid to appeal and was ordered to pay 90 per cent of the Home Office's legal costs. But an order by Lord Justice Bean, dated May 23, showed that the Duke was allowed to challenge Sir Peter's dismissal at the Court of Appeal. Another insider also claimed: \"When Harry was being kicked out of Frogmore Cottage, one of his lines was that Charles would never see the kids again. This is him going public with that threat.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rashi_agarwal@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Rashi Agarwal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackmail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blackmail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_blackmail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emotional blackmail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bean_(judge)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Bean (judge)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogmore_Cottage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frogmore Cottage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Appeal_(England_and_Wales)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Court of Appeal (England and Wales)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prince", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Prince"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_judge_(England_and_Wales)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High Court judge (England and Wales)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_law", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Procedural law"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sussex"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33362384.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_The-Invictus-Games-Foundation-10th-Anniversary-Service.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778064", "eventUri": "eng-9778064", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-05-23", "textStart": 2564, "textEnd": 2570}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

Harry wanted to discuss his ongoing battle for security, which he has been fighting for in court for more than four years and believes Charles, 75, has the power to reinstate. (Buckingham Palace will not comment on security provisions, but a palace source tells PEOPLE the notion that Harry's security is in Charles's hands is \"wholly incorrect.\")\n\nThe family rift that first became public in 2020 when Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, stepped back from their royal roles has been marked by blistering attacks and unresolved tensions. But for Harry, no single issue is a greater sticking point than that of security, multiple well-placed insiders in his circle tell PEOPLE in this week's exclusive cover story.\n\nDespite a positive meeting between the father and son in February following the King's cancer diagnosis, their communication has since deteriorated. Those close to Prince Harry say the monarch no longer takes his son's calls or responds to his letters.\n\n\"He gets 'unavailable right now,' \" says a friend of Harry's. \"His calls go unanswered. He has tried to reach out about the King's health, but those calls go unanswered too.\"\n\nRelated: Prince Harry Shares Why He Won't Bring Meghan Markle Back to the U.K.: 'It's Still Dangerous'\n\nAmid the estrangement, Prince Harry remains deeply concerned for the safety of his wife and children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, and has, according to sources, repeatedly asked his father for help.\n\n\"Harry is frightened and feels the only person who can do anything about it is his father,\" a royal insider tells PEOPLE. Another source close to the situation says, \"Harry is determined to protect his own family at all costs.\"\n\nNow the fight is boiling over. In the ITV documentary Tabloids on Trial, which aired in the U.K. on July 25, Prince Harry voiced his fears that negative press could provoke a violent attack on his wife.\n\n\"All it takes is one lone actor,\" he said, citing these \"genuine concerns\" as his reason for not bringing Meghan, 42, Archie, 5, and Lilibet, 3, back to the U.K.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex has also taken the battle to the courts, where he lost his bid to restore his taxpayer-funded security earlier this year. (He has plans to appeal.)\n\nExactly what is stopping Harry from securing the protection he seeks is a matter of bitter contention. Constitutionally, the monarch has no governmental power in the U.K., and the power to bestow police protection lies with the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (RAVEC), which operates on behalf of the U.K. government.\n\nBut Harry, whose offer to personally cover the cost of police protection was also rejected in court, feels that as King, Charles could intervene to ensure such protection is extended.\n\nThe issue has created an impenetrable wall between Harry and Charles. The conversation has now shifted from frustration to \"complete silence\" from the King, claims the friend.\n\nRelated: Prince Harry Says Late Queen Elizabeth Is 'Up There' Saying 'See This Through to the End' amid His Legal Battles\n\nSources close to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who have established a new life in Montecito, California, say the palace is mindful of what happened when Princess Diana left royal life -- and instantly eclipsed the institution.\n\n\"Charles' fear is a repeat of the past,\" the insider says. \"When his wife divorced the institution, she took the headlines, overshadowed his work and became a global superstar. Seeing his son leave with his wife was not part of the plan.\"\n\nSafety has always been a cornerstone of why Meghan and Harry say they decided to leave. The Duchess of Sussex has cited negative press and the lack of royal support during her time as a working royal as reasons she contemplated suicide.\n\nThe couple \"didn't feel they had a choice,\" says the friend. \"The only option was to leave -- for their sanity. I do think they thought if they got out of this bubble, there would be less focus on them.\"\n\nAt the Sandringham Summit in January 2020, which decided their fate as non-working royals, Prince Harry emerged from the meeting -- attended by the future King Charles, Prince William, Queen Elizabeth and palace staff -- confident that their security would remain intact during their transition. Court documents also reveal that the Queen, who died on Sept. 8, 2022, at age 96, deemed it \"imperative\" for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to have \"effective security\" after their departure. Despite this, Harry was informed just weeks later that their police protection had been withdrawn.\n\n\"The Queen made it clear that effective security was necessary due to the threats against them, but somewhere along the line there was interference,\" the royal insider alleges.\n\nThe security downgrade was ultimately enacted by RAVEC. Its membership includes the Home Office (the U.K. version of Homeland Security), the Metropolitan Police and the Royal Household. Although the King has no direct involvement with RAVEC, his staff sits on the committee. A government spokesperson says they provide \"rigorous and proportionate\" security and do not disclose details \"as doing so could compromise their integrity and affect individuals' security.\"\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

If the U.K. acknowledges the threat to them, other countries are likely to follow suit in how they're protected.\n\nFaced with covering their own security expenses -- and with other financial support from the King cut off -- Harry and Meghan quickly struck deals to generate income when they came to the U.S. in 2020, including Harry's lucrative book deal for his 2023 memoir Spareand the couple's 2022 Netflix docuseries, Harry & Meghan.\n\nA key factor in their decision to move to California was the ability to have armed private security in the U.S., say sources in their circle, pointing to daily social media threats, potential home intrusions and alarming incidents such as a chaotic paparazzi chase in New York City in May 2023.\n\n\"The U.K. government acknowledges numerous threats against them, but we are not privy to specific details due to lack of cooperation,\" says Joe Funk, senior vice president of Torchstone Global Security, which oversees the couple's private protection in the states.\n\nPrince Harry, who is fifth in line to the throne, is also worried about the public's safety when he is out, as well as the risk to his staff.\n\n\"The staff is concerned when they travel with them,\" says a former employee of their Archewell Foundation.\n\nThe fact that Harry and Meghan stepped away from royal duty should not be a factor in their protection level, says the source close to the situation: \"'Working royal or not, this is the King's son.\"\n\nNeil Basu, a former head of counterterrorism for the Metropolitan Police, has spoken out about the fact that Meghan faced serious threats while in the U.K., noting that both Harry and Meghan had among the highest threat assessments within the royal family. (In recent years various people have been arrested and imprisoned for making threats against the couple.)\n\n\"Harry's military service, his global recognition and his marriage to a mixed-race woman all contribute to his high threat level,\" Basu tells PEOPLE.\n\nWith both sides firmly entrenched -- and Harry's brother Prince William, 42, seemingly aligned with his father -- any hope for reconciliation appears distant at best.\n\nSome close to the palace suggest that Harry's memoir and public interviews have compromised the family's trust in him; others close to Harry counter that if he had proper security, he wouldn't need to speak publicly in order to help pay for it. If the matter of security is resolved, says the friend, \"it's 'swords down.' \"\n\nIndeed, nothing \"would give [Harry] more happiness than being able to rekindle his bond with his father. At the end of the day,\" adds the friend, \"you can't undo bloodlines. He's not asking his dad for a nicer house or nicer cars. He's asking because of the reality of the situation. He is at risk.\"\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!\n\nRead the original article on People.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"},

(Well, I'm assuming).\n\nBut chess? Not so much.\n\nThe Duke might be many things (passionate, dedicated, naive, testy, a lost soul, in need of a hug, happy as Larry ... take your pick) but a master tactician?\n\nThat's the question we must bravely grapple with today after a friend of the royal family claimed to the Daily Beast's Tom Sykes, in a corker of an exclusive, that Harry is using his children Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet to \"emotionally blackmail\" King Charles over his British security arrangements.\n\nOof. And just when you thought The Days of Our Palace Lives couldn't get any sudsier ...\n\nA quick spot of background - up until the gong crash of Megxit in 2020, Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex were protected by specialist police officers provided by the government. Decisions over who does and does not get taxpayer-funded bodyguards are made by an independent Home Office body called the Royal and VIP Executive Committee (RAVEC), which also handles security for people like the Prime Minister. Got it?\n\nThen came the seismic events of January 2020 and we now know, thanks to court documents, that within days of Megxit, Harry's private secretary was already being warned by the cabinet secretary that the duke's government security continuing was no sure thing.\n\nA month later, in February 2020, RAVEC officially notified Buckingham Palace that the Sussexes would no longer be automatically entitled to police protection.\n\nSince then, Harry has spent more than $1.9 million - so far unsuccessfully - to fight that RAVEC ruling, saying that he does not feel it is safe to bring his family back to the UK. (He and Meghan have, since 2020, paid for their own security and those bodyguards can and do travel with them, but are not allowed to carry guns in the UK).\n\nThe issue of the Duke and Duchess and their family's British protection was aired again last week when Harry appeared on camera for a doco about phone hacking called Tabloids on Trial.\n\n\"All it takes is one lone actor, one person who read this stuff, to act on what they have read and whether that is a knife or acid ... they are genuine concerns for me,\" Harry said.\n\n\"They are one of the reasons I won't bring my wife back to this country.\"\n\nNow a royal friend, who used to be pally with both Prince William and Harry but is now Team Wales, has told the Beast's Sykes that they think there was more going on with Harry's comments than might have met the eye.\n\nThis friend told the Beast: \"When Harry was being kicked out of Frogmore Cottage, one of his lines was that Charles would never see the kids again. This is him going public with that threat.\"\n\nEnter stage left a second royal intimate, this one \"an old family friend of several generations of royals\".\n\n\"Harry has lost his security case in court, and is now trying the emotional blackmail route to get what he wants instead, cynically using the threat of Archie and Lilibet never meeting their grandfather again as a tactic to coerce the king into overruling RAVEC,\" they told Sykes.\n\n\"The idea that the security forces are going to allow the Sussexes to be attacked by an acid-throwing or knife-wielding maniac on British soil is absurd, and Harry knows it. Using it as leverage, as a reason to withhold his kids from their grandfather, is beyond contempt.\n\n\"Charles is being treated for very serious cancer, so even if he could find the time, he cannot just fly to Los Angeles at the drop of a hat, like Harry can - and actually did earlier this year - in the other direction.\"\n\nBut wait! There's more from a third source, a palace insider, who told the Beast: \"I think Harry needs to ask himself why Charles hasn't overruled RAVEC, which, for all the insistence that he couldn't, he could, being the king and all. It's because the last thing the Palace wants is Harry and Meghan turning up unannounced regularly or setting up a rival royal court in the UK.\n\n\"As things stand now, they have to give 28 days notice when they are coming and essentially need to pre-agree with the cops where they are going to be, or might be, at all times. That suits the Palace down to the ground.\"\n\nThere is much, as a kale-certified Californian might say, to unpack here.\n\nWhat is demonstrably true is that, yes, the King has seen very little of his Sussex grandchildren over the last few years. It has been widely reported that Charles has only ever\n\nmet Archie on a handful of occasions and Lilibet, a poppet controversially named after the\n\nKing's own late mother, only once and that was in 2022.\n\nSo too is it irrefutable that in January 2023, reportedly within 24 hours of Harry's memoir Spare being released, the King informed the Sussexes he wanted the keys back to Frogmore Cottage, their home inside the Windsor security cordon. Hardly the stuff of a doting grandfather intent on building strong relationships with his youngest grandchildren.\n\nHowever, the idea of Harry \"cynically\" using his adored little ones to exert some sort of pressure on his father doesn't sit particularly comfortably. The Duke might be (insert your own thoughts here), but his devotion to and love for his wife and kids is unassailable.\n\nInterpreting Harry raising the same concerns about Meghan's safety that he has been making for years as him trying to use Archie and Lili as \"leverage\" requires assuming the 39-year-old is playing some sort of three-dimensional chess game with his father, and there is not a jot of evidence to back up the notion of Harry as cunningly manoeuvring his pawns (and children) around a checkerboard like the Gary Kasparov of family feuds.\n\nAlso, can Charles actually \"overrule\" RAVEC? The days of the Sovereign being able to imperiously rule over government mandarins was pretty much extinguished about the exact same time that the plough was being replaced by the first steam engine. (Shout out to the industrial revolution!)\n\nLate last year, a letter from Queen Elizabeth's most trusted aide, her private secretary Sir Edward Young, was revealed in court in which she pushed for the Home Office to continue to provide official protection for the Sussexes after Megxit, saying it was of \"paramount importance to Her Majesty and her family ... that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex remain safe\".\n\nFar from blindly chucking Harry and Meghan to the wolves, Sir Edward's letter suggests that the royal family was aware of the threats they face, writing: \"Given the Duke's public profile by virtue of being born into the Royal Family, his military service, the Duchess's own independent profile and the well-documented history of targeting of the Sussex family by extremists, it is imperative that the family continues to be provided with effective security\".\n\nYet even despite the late Queen's intervention, RAVEC still made the call to strip them of their protection. Could Charles succeed where Her late Majesty failed?\n\nIn September 2021, Harry started legal proceedings over the RAVEC ruling, however, late last year, a High Court judge ruled against the Duke. Early this year he was given permission to appeal that decision, so on this mess will chug for a while yet.\n\nThe ousting this month of a conservative government from power after 14 years will not necessarily have any impact here. An official spokesperson has told Newsweek's Jack Royston: \"The UK government's protective security system is rigorous and proportionate\".\n\nOne line from all of these royal sources that makes some good sensible sense is that the notion of the Sussexes' deplaning in the UK whenever they fancy, thus creating a massive public and press ruckus as every available journalist rushed to cover their trip, is the \"last thing\" that Crown Inc would want.\n\nRemember that \"old family friend\" who spoke to the Beast? They also commented: \"I wonder, when they are older, how those kids will feel about being denied a meaningful relationship with the King of England. To deprive them of that experience, with all its importance and heritage, seems very misguided\".\n\nBut who, I wonder, is really depriving them of spending more time in the UK? If Archie and Lili do spend time in the UK in the future, I really hope they like jumping on hotel beds and have a lax nanny willing to let them pillage from the minibar.\n\nDaniela Elser is a writer,

Harry wanted to discuss his ongoing battle for security, which he has been fighting for in court for more than four years and believes Charles, 75, has the power to reinstate. (Buckingham Palace will not comment on security provisions, but a palace source tells PEOPLE the notion that Harry's security is in Charles's hands is \"wholly incorrect.\")\n\nThe family rift that first became public in 2020 when Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, stepped back from their royal roles has been marked by blistering attacks and unresolved tensions. But for Harry, no single issue is a greater sticking point than that of security, multiple well-placed insiders in his circle tell PEOPLE in this week's exclusive cover story.\n\nDespite a positive meeting between the father and son in February following the King's cancer diagnosis, their communication has since deteriorated. Those close to Prince Harry say the monarch no longer takes his son's calls or responds to his letters.\n\n\"He gets 'unavailable right now,' \" says a friend of Harry's. \"His calls go unanswered. He has tried to reach out about the King's health, but those calls go unanswered too.\"\n\nRelated: Prince Harry Shares Why He Won't Bring Meghan Markle Back to the U.K.: 'It's Still Dangerous'\n\nAmid the estrangement, Prince Harry remains deeply concerned for the safety of his wife and children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, and has, according to sources, repeatedly asked his father for help.\n\n\"Harry is frightened and feels the only person who can do anything about it is his father,\" a royal insider tells PEOPLE. Another source close to the situation says, \"Harry is determined to protect his own family at all costs.\"\n\nNow the fight is boiling over. In the ITV documentary Tabloids on Trial, which aired in the U.K. on July 25, Prince Harry voiced his fears that negative press could provoke a violent attack on his wife.\n\n\"All it takes is one lone actor,\" he said, citing these \"genuine concerns\" as his reason for not bringing Meghan, 42, Archie, 5, and Lilibet, 3, back to the U.K.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex has also taken the battle to the courts, where he lost his bid to restore his taxpayer-funded security earlier this year. (He has plans to appeal.)\n\nExactly what is stopping Harry from securing the protection he seeks is a matter of bitter contention. Constitutionally, the monarch has no governmental power in the U.K., and the power to bestow police protection lies with the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (RAVEC), which operates on behalf of the U.K. government.\n\nBut Harry, whose offer to personally cover the cost of police protection was also rejected in court, feels that as King, Charles could intervene to ensure such protection is extended.\n\nThe issue has created an impenetrable wall between Harry and Charles. The conversation has now shifted from frustration to \"complete silence\" from the King, claims the friend.\n\nRelated: Prince Harry Says Late Queen Elizabeth Is 'Up There' Saying 'See This Through to the End' amid His Legal Battles\n\nSources close to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who have established a new life in Montecito, California, say the palace is mindful of what happened when Princess Diana left royal life -- and instantly eclipsed the institution.\n\n\"Charles' fear is a repeat of the past,\" the insider says. \"When his wife divorced the institution, she took the headlines, overshadowed his work and became a global superstar. Seeing his son leave with his wife was not part of the plan.\"\n\nSafety has always been a cornerstone of why Meghan and Harry say they decided to leave. The Duchess of Sussex has cited negative press and the lack of royal support during her time as a working royal as reasons she contemplated suicide.\n\nThe couple \"didn't feel they had a choice,\" says the friend. \"The only option was to leave -- for their sanity. I do think they thought if they got out of this bubble, there would be less focus on them.\"\n\nAt the Sandringham Summit in January 2020, which decided their fate as non-working royals, Prince Harry emerged from the meeting -- attended by the future King Charles, Prince William, Queen Elizabeth and palace staff -- confident that their security would remain intact during their transition. Court documents also reveal that the Queen, who died on Sept. 8, 2022, at age 96, deemed it \"imperative\" for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to have \"effective security\" after their departure. Despite this, Harry was informed just weeks later that their police protection had been withdrawn.\n\n\"The Queen made it clear that effective security was necessary due to the threats against them, but somewhere along the line there was interference,\" the royal insider alleges.\n\nThe security downgrade was ultimately enacted by RAVEC. Its membership includes the Home Office (the U.K. version of Homeland Security), the Metropolitan Police and the Royal Household. Although the King has no direct involvement with RAVEC, his staff sits on the committee. A government spokesperson says they provide \"rigorous and proportionate\" security and do not disclose details \"as doing so could compromise their integrity and affect individuals' security.\"\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage? Sign up for our free Royals newsletter to get the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle and more!\n\nHarry, whose team notes that the Sussexes' annual threat assessment has not been updated by the government since 2019, perceives the roadblock to be his father, even as the palace disputes this.\n\nRAVEC's decision could have international implications as well. If the U.K. acknowledges the threat to them, other countries are likely to follow suit in how they're protected.\n\nFaced with covering their own security expenses -- and with other financial support from the King cut off -- Harry and Meghan quickly struck deals to generate income when they came to the U.S. in 2020, including Harry's lucrative book deal for his 2023 memoir Spare and the couple's 2022 Netflix docuseries, Harry & Meghan.\n\nA key factor in their decision to move to California was the ability to have armed private security in the U.S., say sources in their circle, pointing to daily social media threats, potential home intrusions and alarming incidents such as a chaotic paparazzi chase in New York City in May 2023.\n\n\"The U.K. government acknowledges numerous threats against them, but we are not privy to specific details due to lack of cooperation,\" says Joe Funk, senior vice president of Torchstone Global Security, which oversees the couple's private protection in the states.\n\nPrince Harry, who is fifth in line to the throne, is also worried about the public's safety when he is out, as well as the risk to his staff.\n\n\"The staff is concerned when they travel with them,\" says a former employee of their Archewell Foundation.\n\nThe fact that Harry and Meghan stepped away from royal duty should not be a factor in their protection level, says the source close to the situation: \"'Working royal or not, this is the King's son.\"\n\nNeil Basu, a former head of counterterrorism for the Metropolitan Police, has spoken out about the fact that Meghan faced serious threats while in the U.K., noting that both Harry and Meghan had among the highest threat assessments within the royal family. (In recent years various people have been arrested and imprisoned for making threats against the couple.)\n\n\"Harry's military service, his global recognition and his marriage to a mixed-race woman all contribute to his high threat level,\" Basu tells PEOPLE.\n\nWith both sides firmly entrenched -- and Harry's brother Prince William, 42, seemingly aligned with his father -- any hope for reconciliation appears distant at best.\n\nSome close to the palace suggest that Harry's memoir and public interviews have compromised the family's trust in him; others close to Harry counter that if he had proper security, he wouldn't need to speak publicly in order to help pay for it. If the matter of security is resolved, says the friend, \"it's 'swords down.' \"\n\nIndeed, nothing \"would give [Harry] more happiness than being able to rekindle his bond with his father. At the end of the day,\" adds the friend, \"you can't undo bloodlines. He's not asking his dad for a nicer house or nicer cars. He's asking because of the reality of the situation. He is at risk.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex",

She wants him to live in a world where he is not burdened by this,\" says the former staffer.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex, 39, has been involved in several legal battles in recent years, but according to multiple well-placed insiders, no issue is more critical to him than security. Stripped of his Metropolitan Police bodyguards in 2020, Harry has been fighting ever since to reinstate police protection for himself and his family. He lost his bid to restore his taxpayer-funded security earlier this year. (He has plans to appeal.)\n\nMultiple well-placed insiders in the Duke of Sussex's circle tell PEOPLE that Harry believes his father has the power to reinstate his security. Buckingham Palace will not comment on security provisions, but a palace source tells PEOPLE the notion that Harry's security is in Charles's hands is \"wholly incorrect.\"\n\nThe issue has created an impenetrable wall between Harry and Charles. The conversation has now shifted from frustration to \"complete silence\" from the King, claims a friend of Harry's.\n\nThose close to Harry say the monarch no longer takes his son's calls or answers his letters.\n\n\"He gets 'unavailable right now,' \" says the friend. \"His calls go unanswered. He has tried to reach out about the King's health, but those calls go unanswered too.\"\n\nExactly what is stopping Harry from securing the protection he seeks is a matter of bitter contention: Constitutionally, the monarch has no governmental power in the U.K., and the power to bestow police protection lies with the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (RAVEC), which operates on behalf of the U.K. government. But Harry, whose offer to personally cover the cost of police protection was also rejected in court, feels that as King, Charles could intervene to ensure such protection is extended.\n\nAmid the royal rift, the Duke of Sussex is deeply concerned for the safety of his wife and their children, Prince Archie, 5, and Princess Lilibet, 3.\n\n\"Harry is frightened and feels the only person who can do anything about it is his father,\" a royal insider tells PEOPLE.\n\nAdds another close source, \"Harry is determined to protect his own family at all costs.\"\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

Despite reuniting and appearing to be on good terms after the monarch's cancer diagnosis in February, their relationship has further deteriorated, with Harry's calls to his father now going 'unanswered.'\n\nHarry, 39, traveled to the United Kingdom in May to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games. At the time, Charles, 75, was thought to have skipped out on Harry's rare visit due to his busy schedule.\n\nHowever, sources informed PEOPLE on Wednesday, July 31, that Harry aimed to use the visit to discuss his ongoing battle for security with his father. The automatic right to U.K. police security was removed by the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (RAVEC) in 2020 after he and his wife, Meghan Markle, stepped down as senior royals.\n\nHarry believes his father has the power to reinstate the security but their communication has since worsened, with insiders dishing that Charles no longer responds to Harry's calls or letters.\n\n\"He gets 'unavailable right now,'\" a source close to Harry told the outlet. \"He has tried to reach out about the King's health, but those calls go unanswered too.\"\n\nHarry challenged the committee's decision in a December 2023 hearing, stating that he felt \"forced to step back\" from the royal family due to safety concerns of his wife, 42, and children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.\n\n\"Harry is frightened and feels the only person who can do anything about it is his father,\" another source told the outlet, with an additional insider adding, \"Harry is determined to protect his own family at all costs.\"\n\nAlthough the duke offered to cover the costs of security, his proposal was rejected. High Court judge Peter Lane upheld the U.K. government's decision to downgrade security in February.\n\nHarry got candid about his concerns for his family, opening up during an interview for the ITV documentary Tabloids on Trial and revealed he has no plans for his wife to return to the U.K. anytime soon.\n\n\"It's still dangerous, and all it takes is one lone actor, one person who reads this stuff to act on what they have read,\" Harry said on July 25. \"And whether it's a knife or acid, whatever it is, and these are things that are of genuine concern for me. It's one of the reasons why I won't bring my wife back to this country.\"\n\nAfter stepping down from their positions as senior royals, Harry and Meghan moved to California with their son Archie, 5, in 2020. One year later, the couple welcomed daughter Lilibet, 3, in 2021.\n\nNeil Basu, the former head of counterterrorism for the Metropolitan Police, confirmed in 2022 that Meghan faced genuine threats against her life while she lived in the U.K.\n\n\"We had teams investigating it.

Oof.\n\nAs Perezcious readers know, the royal family has been battling it out for years ever since Harry and Meghan Markle walked away from their working roles in 2020. In a new ITV documentary, Harry claimed a \"central piece\" of the \"rift\" was caused by his fight against the tabloids -- and it turns out his fight for safety is also a big issue.\n\nAccording to People sources on Wednesday, the 39-year-old was hoping to sit down with his father in May, when he was in town for the tenth anniversary of the Invictus Games (a ceremony his entire fam snubbed). Charles avoided getting together with his youngest son, claiming he was too busy. As it turns out, Harry reportedly wanted to discuss his ongoing push for security in the country, which he believes the 75-year-old has the power to reinstate (though a palace source told the outlet that theory is \"wholly incorrect.\") Either way, Charles is giving Harry the complete SILENT TREATMENT!\n\nRelated: Prince William 'Dumped' Princess Catherine Over A 30-Minute Phone Call\n\nEver since their last meeting in February, when the Spare author rushed to his home country to see Charles after his cancer diagnosis (a brief meeting the sources claimed was positive but many have said was a downright disaster), Charles has stopped communicating with Prince Haz. A friend of the Archewell founders said His Majesty has ignored Harry's calls and letters, saying:\n\n\"He gets 'unavailable right now.' His calls go unanswered. He has tried to reach out about the King's health, but those calls go unanswered too.\"\n\nJeez.\n\nHis father is battling cancer and nobody will tell Harry how he's doing? They probably don't have any trust in him, worried he might spill the tea to the public... but damn. That seems really heartless! This man's already lost one parent, the least they could do is keep him informed. So sad.\n\nWhile Harry is obviously frustrated over this lack of communication, his attention remains on making sure his family is safe. With legitimate risks to his wife and their kids Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet's safety, he's repeatedly asked for his father's help, a royal insider noted:\n\n\"Harry is frightened and feels the only person who can do anything about it is his father.\"\n\nAnother source chimed in:\n\n\"Harry is determined to protect his own family at all costs.\"\n\nAs Perezcious readers know, in the doc Tabloids on Trial, the activist minced no words when describing his fear for his loved ones, noting all it would take is \"one lone actor\" to do something rash and put his family and team in danger. Despite his \"genuine concerns,\" the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (RAVEC) has been unwilling to grant him taxpayer-funded police protection while in the country. They won't even let him pay for it himself.\n\nBut given Charles' high status, Harry feels like his dad could intervene and help get his security granted. But rather than try to help, his friend said this debate has made Charles shift from being frustrated to reverting to \"complete silence.\" Insiders close to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex believe Charles may be worried about once again getting overshadowed by another ex-royal, as he was when Princess Diana left royal life, they explained:\n\n\"Charles' fear is a repeat of the past. When his wife divorced the institution, she took the headlines, overshadowed his work and became a global superstar. Seeing his son leave with his wife was not part of the plan.\"\n\nBut as Harry has argued in the past, it was never his desire to leave altogether. He was given no choice. And regardless, isn't Charles' silent treatment just prolonging this rift and creating more headlines that overshadow his work as monarch?? Just saying...\n\nAccording to sources, safety's always been a major reason why the Sussexes ultimately walked away from the royal family (that and to protect the Suits alum's mental health). Their friend said they \"didn't feel they had a choice,\" elaborating:\n\n\"The only option was to leave -- for their sanity. I do think they thought if they got out of this bubble, there would be less focus on them.\"\n\nBut here's what's really shady! After meeting with family members at Sandringham Summit in January 2020 to discuss his life as a non-working royal, Harry left the meeting with the reassurance that he'd have security as they made the transition. In fact, court documents proved Queen Elizabeth II called it \"imperative\" for the Sussexes to have \"effective security\" after their exit. And yet, just weeks later, Harry was stripped of his police protection! The royal insider shared:\n\n\"The Queen made it clear that effective security was necessary due to the threats against them, but somewhere along the line there was interference.\"\n\nThe decision was ultimately made by RAVEC (whose discussion on security could impact how the Sussexes are dealt with internationally, as other countries would likely follow their example). The group includes members of the Royal Household, such as the King's staff but not Charles himself. A government spokesperson told the outlet that they provide \"rigorous and proportionate\" security and do not disclose details \"as doing so could compromise their integrity and affect individuals' security.\"\n\nBut Harry, sadly, thinks the only reason he hasn't been given his security back is because of his father, despite denials from the palace. His team noted that his family's annual threat assessment hasn't been updated by the government since 2019 -- despite them being in some of the most danger!\n\nNeil Basu, a former head of counterterrorism for the Metropolitan Police, has claimed that the actress has faced serious threats while in the UK, calling Harry and Meghan among the highest threat assessments within the royal family. Per the outlet, several people have even been arrested and imprisoned for making threats against the couple! So, Harry's not making this up! Basu added:\n\n\"Harry's military service, his global recognition and his marriage to a mixed-race woman all contribute to his high threat level.\"\n\nPlus, just 'cause he walked away from a job doesn't mean he's walked away from any of the risk he was born into (he's still fifth in line to the throne, after all), a source pointed out:\n\n\"Working royal or not, this is the King's son.\"\n\nSo true!\n\nThe main reason the couple decided to settle down in California was so they could have private armed security, people in their close circle noted. They added that the couple gets daily social media threats and potential home intrusions, and have faced harrowing incidents like the 2023 NYC paparazzi chase.\n\nEven Joe Funk, senior vice president of Torchstone Global Security -- who oversees their private security in the US -- called out the UK for being aware of the danger and doing little about it, adding:\n\n\"The U.K. government acknowledges numerous threats against them, but we are not privy to specific details due to lack of cooperation.\"\n\nAs is the case with any influential individual, the security risk extends far beyond just Harry and Meg or their children -- their team is also potentially in harm's way, which makes the lack of security nerve-wracking for them all. A former employee of the Archewell Foundation shared:\n\n\"The staff is concerned when they travel with them.\"\n\nWe get why they'd be worried. Harry feels the threat risk is SO high in the UK that he will no longer allow his wife and children to visit with him. That says a lot!\n\nYou'd think that all of this would bother the royal family, but they are not letting up their anger when it comes to the Sussexes speaking out about The Firm -- something they've only done to maintain a steady stream of income to pay for all their security needs after getting cut off. While some sources argued that Harry's book and interviews have compromised the family's trust in him, others are hitting back, insisting he never would have spoken out if he had proper security. And if the issue is resolved, his friend claimed, \"it's 'swords down.'\"\n\nSo, as we pointed out, Charles -- and Prince William, who seems to be siding with the patriarch -- giving Harry the silent treatment just seems to be making this all worse! While it may be hard for the family to trust anything Harry says at this point, his pal urged that nothing \"would give [Harry] more happiness than being able to rekindle his bond with his father.\" The friend ultimately concluded:\n\n\"You can't undo bloodlines. He's not asking his dad for a nicer house or nicer cars. He's asking because of the reality of the situation. He is at risk.\"\n\nAll of this is terrible on its own, but when you put this into the context of Charles' health crisis, it's even more heartbreaking. We'd hate to see them leave off on such a bad note when some simple communication could go a long way...\n\nThoughts?

However, weeks later when the Duke of Sussex returned to the UK for a 10th anniversary service for the Invictus Games at St Paul's Cathedral, there was no meeting between the duo - with Harry suggesting his dad was too busy to schedule in a meeting.\n\nNow sources close to the Sussexes have claimed that Harry's calls to his dad are going unanswered as he tries to discuss his security arrangements with his father. The Duke has been embroiled in a long-running battle over his security when he comes to the UK after he automatically lost the right to his police protection when he stepped down as a working royal.\n\nHe lost his subsequent court battles to have it reinstated for him, wife Meghan and their two children and is planning an appeal. According to PEOPLE magazine, Harry believes his dad could help to have this reinstated, although this has been dismissed as \"wholly inaccurate\" by a palace source.\n\nAnd now a friend of Harry's told the magazine: \"He gets 'unavailable right now'. His calls go unanswered. He has tried to reach out about the King's health, but those calls go unanswered too.\" While another friend added: \"Harry is frightened and feels the only person who can do anything about it is his father,\" while another source added: \"Harry is determined to protect his own family at all costs.\"\n\nThey added that the couple \"didn't feel they had a choice\". \"The only option was to leave - for their sanity. I do think they thought if they got out of this bubble, there would be less focus on them,\" the insider said.\n\nHarry took legal action over the February 2020 decision by the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (Ravec) which ruled he would no longer be given the \"same degree\" of publicly-funded protection when in the country. Ravec's decision came as a result of a change in the duke's 'status' after he stopped being a \"full-time working member of the royal family \", a judge was told.\n\nIn February, retired High Court judge Sir Peter Lane rejected the duke's case that he was \"singled out\" and treated \"less favourably\" by the decision and concluded Ravec's approach was not irrational nor procedurally unfair.

The king and his son were hardly on speaking terms after Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, left the royal family in favor of a more private live in the United States back in 2020.\n\nSince moving to the US, Harry has seldom brought his kids over to the UK, which he has repeatedly said is for security purposes. And royal experts aren't in total agreement over whether Harry or Charles is in the right.\n\nWhen Harry and Meghan left the royal family in 2020, they took their son, Prince Archie, with them. In 2021, Harry and Meghan welcomed their second child, a daughter named Princess Lilibet. Archie and Lilibet flew to the UK with their parents in June 2022, which was the last time anyone saw them in-person. After resigning from royal duties, Harry and Meghan lost their HRH titles and effectively also lost their taxpayer-funded security in the UK. As a result, Harry refuses to bring his wife and kids back to his home country. But is it Charles' fault for not doing more to grant Harry the proper security, or is Harry being selfish by keeping his kids from their grandfather?\n\nThose who have followed the royals for years seem to be at odds over who is right and wrong here. According to Express, commentator Lee Harris appeared on GB News and was asked whether he thought Harry was being \"selfish,\" to which he replied, \"Yes, I do. And it does feel a little bit like he is doing this to make a point.\" Harris referred to Harry's actions as \"emotionally blackmailing\" his father by keeping his kids from their grandfather.\n\nBut on the contrary, Express also reports that commentator Joanna Jarjue disagrees. \"I can't fathom why -- if your kids and grandkids are not coming to see you -- why you wouldn't just grant them security,\" she questioned of Charles' decision not to step in and work out a security agreement with his son.\n\nHarry has made it abundantly clear that he will not let his wife and kids return to the UK because he is doing his best to protect them. He recently appeared in an ITV documentary, where he reinforced how important security is for his family. And it looks like if Charles isn't willing to help Harry achieve the proper security, the king might never be close with Archie and Lili.\n\nHarry and Meghan are able to live a much more private life in the US, and Meghan doesn't receive nearly the same negative press in America as she does in the UK. It seems the two are generally happier over here, though Harry hasn't ruled out a UK return if he and Meghan could obtain proper security for their family.", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julia_mullaney@cheatsheet.com", "name": "Julia Mullaney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Lilibet_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Princess Lilibet of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Archie_of_Sussex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Archie of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GB News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/General_Merchandise/O", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/General Merchandise/O", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/King-Charles-Prince-Harry-2.webp?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778064", "eventUri": "eng-9778064", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

However, weeks later when the Duke of Sussex returned to the UK for a 10th anniversary service for the Invictus Games at St Paul's Cathedral, there was no meeting between the pair.\n\nThis raised eyebrows at the time, with a statement from Harry suggesting his father was too busy to see him and reports later claiming the King had offered his son a place to stay in a royal residence.\n\nHowever, sources close to the Sussex have now claimed that Harry's calls to his dad are going unanswered as Harry tries to discuss his security arrangements with his father. The Duke has been embroiled in a long-running battle over his security when he comes to the UK after he automatically lost the right to his police protection when he stepped down as a working royal.\n\nHe has lost his subsequent court battles to have it reinstated for him, wife Meghan and their two children and is planning an appeal. According to PEOPLE magazine, Harry believes his dad could help to have this reinstated, although this has been dismissed as \"wholly inaccurate\" by a palace source.\n\nAnd now a friend of Harry's told the magazine: \"He gets 'unavailable right now'. His calls go unanswered. He has tried to reach out about the King's health, but those calls go unanswered too.\" While another friend added: \"Harry is frightened and feels the only person who can do anything about it is his father,\" while another source added: \"Harry is determined to protect his own family at all costs.\"\n\nThey added that the couple \"didn't feel they had a choice\". \"The only option was to leave - for their sanity. I do think they thought if they got out of this bubble, there would be less focus on them,\" the insider said.\n\nHarry took legal action over the February 2020 decision by the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (Ravec) which ruled he would no longer be given the \"same degree\" of publicly-funded protection when in the country. Ravec's decision came as a result of a change in the duke's 'status' after he stopped being a \"full-time working member of the royal family \", a judge was told.\n\nIn February, retired High Court judge Sir Peter Lane rejected the duke's case that he was \"singled out\" and treated \"less favourably\" by the decision and concluded Ravec's approach was not irrational nor procedurally unfair. After the ruling, a legal spokesperson for Harry said in a statement that the Duke \"hopes to obtain justice from the Court of Appeal\".\n\nDuring a hearing at the High Court, it was told that Harry believes his children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet cannot \"feel at home\" in the UK if it is \"not possible to keep them safe\" there.

He has more than 25 years' experience at PEOPLE covering the royals, human interest and celebrity.\n\nPrince Harry's desperation to protect his wife and kids has deepened his estrangement from his father, King Charles.\n\nWhen the Duke of Sussex, 39, returned to the U.K. in May to celebrate the 10th anniversary of one of his proudest achievements, the Invictus Games, his father was notably absent from the ceremony.\n\nThe two were unable to meet during Harry's visit, which the prince's spokesperson attributed to the King's \"full schedule.\" However, sources close to Harry suggest a deeper issue. Harry wanted to discuss his ongoing battle for security, which he has been fighting for in court for more than four years and believes Charles, 75, has the power to reinstate. (Buckingham Palace will not comment on security provisions, but a palace source tells PEOPLE the notion that Harry's security is in Charles's hands is \"wholly incorrect.\")\n\nThe family rift that first became public in 2020 when Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, stepped back from their royal roles has been marked by blistering attacks and unresolved tensions. But for Harry, no single issue is a greater sticking point than that of security, multiple well-placed insiders in his circle tell PEOPLE in this week's exclusive cover story.\n\nDespite a positive meeting between the father and son in February following the King's cancer diagnosis, their communication has since deteriorated. Those close to Prince Harry say the monarch no longer takes his son's calls or responds to his letters.\n\n\"He gets 'unavailable right now,' \" says a friend of Harry's. \"His calls go unanswered. He has tried to reach out about the King's health, but those calls go unanswered too.\"\n\nAmid the estrangement, Prince Harry remains deeply concerned for the safety of his wife and children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, and has, according to sources, repeatedly asked his father for help.\n\n\"Harry is frightened and feels the only person who can do anything about it is his father,\" a royal insider tells PEOPLE. Another source close to the situation says, \"Harry is determined to protect his own family at all costs.\"\n\nNow the fight is boiling over. In the ITV documentary Tabloids on Trial, which aired in the U.K. on July 25, Prince Harry voiced his fears that negative press could provoke a violent attack on his wife.\n\n\"All it takes is one lone actor,\" he said, citing these \"genuine concerns\" as his reason for not bringing Meghan, 42, Archie, 5, and Lilibet, 3, back to the U.K.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex has also taken the battle to the courts, where he lost his bid to restore his taxpayer-funded security earlier this year. (He has plans to appeal.)\n\nExactly what is stopping Harry from securing the protection he seeks is a matter of bitter contention. Constitutionally, the monarch has no governmental power in the U.K., and the power to bestow police protection lies with the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (RAVEC), which operates on behalf of the U.K. government.\n\nBut Harry, whose offer to personally cover the cost of police protection was also rejected in court, feels that as King, Charles could intervene to ensure such protection is extended.\n\nThe issue has created an impenetrable wall between Harry and Charles. The conversation has now shifted from frustration to \"complete silence\" from the King, claims the friend.\n\nSources close to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who have established a new life in Montecito, California, say the palace is mindful of what happened when Princess Diana left royal life -- and instantly eclipsed the institution.\n\n\"Charles' fear is a repeat of the past,\" the insider says. \"When his wife divorced the institution, she took the headlines, overshadowed his work and became a global superstar. Seeing his son leave with his wife was not part of the plan.\"\n\nSafety has always been a cornerstone of why Meghan and Harry say they decided to leave. The Duchess of Sussex has cited negative press and the lack of royal support during her time as a working royal as reasons she contemplated suicide.\n\nThe couple \"didn't feel they had a choice,\" says the friend. \"The only option was to leave -- for their sanity. I do think they thought if they got out of this bubble, there would be less focus on them.\"\n\nAt the Sandringham Summit in January 2020, which decided their fate as non-working royals, Prince Harry emerged from the meeting -- attended by the future King Charles, Prince William, Queen Elizabeth and palace staff -- confident that their security would remain intact during their transition. Court documents also reveal that the Queen, who died on Sept. 8, 2022, at age 96, deemed it \"imperative\" for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to have \"effective security\" after their departure. Despite this, Harry was informed just weeks later that their police protection had been withdrawn.\n\n\"The Queen made it clear that effective security was necessary due to the threats against them, but somewhere along the line there was interference,\" the royal insider alleges.\n\nThe security downgrade was ultimately enacted by RAVEC. Its membership includes the Home Office (the U.K. version of Homeland Security), the Metropolitan Police and the Royal Household. Although the King has no direct involvement with RAVEC, his staff sits on the committee. A government spokesperson says they provide \"rigorous and proportionate\" security and do not disclose details \"as doing so could compromise their integrity and affect individuals' security.\"\n\nCan't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage? Sign up for our free Royals newsletter to get the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle and more!\n\nHarry, whose team notes that the Sussexes' annual threat assessment has not been updated by the government since 2019, perceives the roadblock to be his father, even as the palace disputes this.\n\nRAVEC's decision could have international implications as well. If the U.K. acknowledges the threat to them, other countries are likely to follow suit in how they're protected.\n\nFaced with covering their own security expenses -- and with other financial support from the King cut off -- Harry and Meghan quickly struck deals to generate income when they came to the U.S. in 2020, including Harry's lucrative book deal for his 2023 memoir Spare and the couple's 2022 Netflix docuseries, Harry & Meghan.\n\nA key factor in their decision to move to California was the ability to have armed private security in the U.S., say sources in their circle, pointing to daily social media threats, potential home intrusions and alarming incidents such as a chaotic paparazzi chase in New York City in May 2023.\n\n\"The U.K. government acknowledges numerous threats against them, but we are not privy to specific details due to lack of cooperation,\" says Joe Funk, senior vice president of Torchstone Global Security, which oversees the couple's private protection in the states.\n\nPrince Harry, who is fifth in line to the throne, is also worried about the public's safety when he is out, as well as the risk to his staff.\n\n\"The staff is concerned when they travel with them,\" says a former employee of their Archewell Foundation.\n\nThe fact that Harry and Meghan stepped away from royal duty should not be a factor in their protection level, says the source close to the situation: \"'Working royal or not, this is the King's son.\"\n\nNeil Basu, a former head of counterterrorism for the Metropolitan Police, has spoken out about the fact that Meghan faced serious threats while in the U.K., noting that both Harry and Meghan had among the highest threat assessments within the royal family. (In recent years various people have been arrested and imprisoned for making threats against the couple.)\n\n\"Harry's military service, his global recognition and his marriage to a mixed-race woman all contribute to his high threat level,\" Basu tells PEOPLE.\n\nWith both sides firmly entrenched -- and Harry's brother Prince William, 42, seemingly aligned with his father -- any hope for reconciliation appears distant at best.\n\nSome close to the palace suggest that Harry's memoir and public interviews have compromised the family's trust in him; others close to Harry counter that if he had proper security, he wouldn't need to speak publicly in order to help pay for it. If the matter of security is resolved, says the friend, \"it's 'swords down.' \"\n\nIndeed, nothing \"would give [Harry] more happiness than being able to rekindle his bond with his father. At the end of the day,\" adds the friend, \"you can't undo bloodlines. He's not asking his dad for a nicer house or nicer cars. He's asking because of the reality of the situation. He is at risk.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type":

Tragically, 2024 has been unkind to the Windsors yet again with the sudden and unexpected death of Prince William and Prince Harry's uncle.\n\nLord Robert Fellowes, brother-in-law to Princess Diana and therefore uncle to her two sons, passed away at the age of 82 on July 29, from unknown causes. Lord Fellows served as the former private secretary to the late Queen Elizabeth II, standing at her side throughout the 1990s, a tumultuous decade for his own side of the family -- not least the death of his sister-in-law in 1997, alongside her boyfriend, Dodi Al Fayed.\n\nIn 2008, Fellowes was forced to deny at an official inquest that he had nothing to do with Diana's death, after Al Fayed's father, Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed, accused him of being the brains behind a conspiracy to murder the two of them. Fellowes was able to prove his alibi, however, and the inquest ultimately found that Diana's death in Paris was an accident.\n\nWith a death in the family like this, especially someone so connected to a previous death in the family, it's times like this that leave you wondering if the remaining Royals could ever fully reconcile. Well, if that was to occur one day, it seems the solution rests in the hands of King Charles and King Charles alone.\n\nThe emotional reasons keeping Harry and Meghan apart from the Royal family have been discussed extensively, but maybe the most significant roadblock to a Royal reconciliation is a logistical one. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been barred from receiving police protection if and when they return to British soil.\n\nSince leaving their Royal duties behind in 2020, the couple and their two children, Prince Archie (5) and Princess Lilibet (3), are no longer eligible to receive the state-funded security detail of their relatives. In April, Harry lost a legal bid to challenge the ban on his paying for police protection. As we know from the duke's recent Tabloids on Trial interview, he seriously fears for his wife's safety when she's in the U.K., which is why Meghan returns to England so rarely.\n\nIf only there was someone with the power to overturn this legal decision and allow Harry the security protection he \"so desperately\" desires? Maybe a father who holds the highest office in the land and so can use his sway to help out his estranged son? According to what a Royal insider tells Page Six, it all rests on King Charles to help out Harry and Meghan, which could be just the olive branch this fractured family needs.\n\n\"King Charles can give Harry the security clearance he wants so desperately,\" the source claims. \"As the monarch, he is the ultimate decision-maker. That would be how father and son can reconcile.\"\n\nThis summer, for instance, the Royals are holidaying in the Scottish highlands, but Harry and Meghan have naturally not been invited. If the king could find it in his heart to gift Harry his security clearance, though, then maybe future family vacations could tell a different story.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com",

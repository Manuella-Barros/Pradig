Mr Campbell, who netted 59 goals in 224 appearances for Arsenal, won the league title in 1990/91, as well as the FA Cup, League Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup during his time at Highbury.\n\nIn 1995, he moved to Nottingham Forest where he played for three years before a brief stint at Trabzonspor in Turkey. He then joined Everton in 1999, where he remained until 2005, serving as captain under Walter Smith.\n\nHis football career concluded with spells at West Brom and Cardiff.

He later died on June 15.\n\nAn inquest into his death has revealed on Thursday (July 4) that multi-organ failure led to his death after he was taken Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI). Coroner Zac Golombek said Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, had declared a Level 5 patient safety incident about certain aspects of his care.\n\nGolombek said: \"In terms of the circumstances of his death he had been admitted to Manchester Royal Infirmary on 15 May 2024. He had been reported to have been fit and well until around January 2024 when he had a number of admissions to hospital before this final admission.\n\n\"I have been notified that Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust which manages Manchester Royal Infirmary has declared a Level 5 incident related to aspects of Mr Campbell's care in which there is reference to both a delay in aspects of his care and diagnosis, and also concerns raised over decision-making processes with regards to the institutions of palliative care.\n\n\"Those matters are now subject to internal investigations by the hospital trust. Therefore I am able to direct that there should be additional evidence to be obtained which includes the investigation report, together with associated witness statements from all relevant clinicians involved in Mr Campbell's care and also a statement be obtained from Mr Campbell's next of kin in order to provide an antecedent history for Mr Campbell and to set out any concerns that the family may have had in relation to his care.\n\n\"I have also received notification from the trust that a medical cause of death can be offered and therefore I will consider evidence from the clinicians involved in Mr Campbell's care as to the cause of his death. The provisional cause of death, as it stands, refers to Mr Campbell dying from multi-organ failure as a result of infective endocarditis.\n\n\"So, final determinations on the medical cause of death and the care afforded to Mr Campbell will be made as part of the inquest process. I will adjourn the proceedings to await additional disclosure.\"\n\nAccording to the NHS website, endocarditis is a rare and potentially fatal infection of the inner lining of the heart and is most commonly caused by bacteria entering the blood and travelling to the heart. Mr Campbell scored 59 goals in 224 games for Arsenal and, alongside the 1990/91 league title, he also won the FA Cup, League Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup at Highbury.\n\nHe spent three years at Nottingham Forest after joining them in 1995 and had a one-season stop at Trabzonspor in Turkey before moving to Everton in 1999. He stayed at Everton until 2005, where he spent time as captain under Walter Smith, and ended his career with spells at West Brom and Cardiff.\n\nMr Campbell worked in the media after his playing career and was a member of the Black Footballers Partnership, which works to increase the voice and influence of black footballers.", "source": {"uri": "football.london", "dataType": "news", "title":

He also scored the winner in the Blues' most recent Merseyside derby win at Anfield in front of supporters, back in 1999.\n\nIn an emotional tribute the club, which is planning to honour him at the start of the new season, said: \"Everyone at Everton Football Club is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of one of the club's most popular and much-loved former strikers, Kevin Campbell, at the age of 54. Not just a true Goodison Park hero and huge fans' favourite, Kevin was the Blues' first black captain and also an incredible person, as anyone who had the pleasure of meeting him would know. His contribution to Everton Football Club, however, extends way beyond statistics. One of the most popular men to ever wear the royal blue jersey, he remains an icon amongst Evertonians and was the perfect ambassador who always thoroughly enjoyed returning to Goodison Park in a media capacity or to cheer on the Toffees as a fan... He was a giant of a man, a fabulous footballer and he will be sorely missed by everyone fortunate enough to know him. The thoughts of everyone at Everton are with his family at this extremely sad time and we will, of course, pay a suitable tribute when next season kicks off.\"", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_thomas@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Joe Thomas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "kim_pilling@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Kim Pilling", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Royal_Infirmary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester Royal Infirmary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Campbell_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Campbell (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inquest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic resonance imaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_University_NHS_Foundation_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_football_league_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "English football league system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coroner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palliative care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocarditis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Endocarditis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trabzonspor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trabzonspor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodison_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goodison Park"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article29363983.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1347106728.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706309", "eventUri": "eng-9706309", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-15", "textStart": 635, "textEnd": 642}, {"amb": false, "date": "2015-05-", "textStart": 1133, "textEnd": 1139}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

He is my idol, the one who I wanted to be when I grew up.\n\n'He was the life and soul of every party and room he blessed, a one in a million person that was loved by everyone. A special, special person. I'll miss you Dad.\n\n'I would now ask that the privacy of our family is respected as we mourn the loss of an irreplaceable father, brother, uncle and all-round amazing human being. Love you always Dad.'\n\nCampbell worked as a pundit for Sky Sports, Asia-based Sony TEN and was also a hit star on the Highbury Squad podcast, where he spoke about his boyhood club Arsenal.\n\nHe regularly co-hosted shows alongside presenter Sophie Nicolau called Monday Madness and was dearly loved by viewers who he endearingly referred to as 'squaddies'.\n\nArsenal said in a statement following his death: 'We are devastated to learn that our former striker Kevin Campbell has died after a short illness.\n\n'Kevin was adored by everyone at the club. All of us are thinking of his friends and family at this difficult time. Rest in peace, Kevin.'\n\nCampbell's professional career spanned 20 years, in which he also played for Letyon Orient, Leicester, Nottingham Forest, Turkish side Trabzonspor, West Brom and Cardiff City.\n\nHe was perhaps most well remembered for his time at Everton, where he famously helped the Toffees avoid relegation from the Premier Leage in 1999 with nine goals in just eight games.\n\nEverton said in a statement last month that it was 'deeply saddened' to learn of the passing of one of the club's 'most popular and much-loved former strikers'.\n\nThe club said: 'Not just a true Goodison Park hero and huge fans' favourite, Kevin was the Blues' first black captain and also an incredible person, as anyone who had the pleasure of meeting him would know.\n\n'Kevin was always afforded the warmest of welcomes when he returned to Merseyside - and quite right, too.\n\n'He was a giant of a man, a fabulous footballer and he will be sorely missed by everyone fortunate enough to know him.\n\n'The thoughts of everyone at Everton are with his family at this extremely sad time and we will, of course, pay a suitable tribute when next season kicks off.'\n\nMORE : Cole Palmer

The provisional cause of death, as it stands, refers to Mr Campbell dying from multi-organ failure as a result of infective endocarditis.\"\n\nMr Golumbek confirmed he would \"adjourn the proceedings to await additional disclosure,\" adding that a final decision on the cause of death the care received by Campbell would be \"made as part of the inquest process\".\n\nNo date has been set for a further hearing.\n\nCampbell's death sparked an outpouring of grief from across the footballing family.\n\nSon Tyrese, who plays for Stoke City, tweeted after his father's passing: \"He was the life and soul of every party and room he blessed, a one-in-a-million person that was loved by everyone.\"", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_coleman@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Tom Coleman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Campbell_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Campbell (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coroner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_football_league_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English football league system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Royal_Infirmary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester Royal Infirmary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardiff City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infective_endocarditis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infective endocarditis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Manchester", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Manchester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palliative_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palliative care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stoke City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/First_Aid", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/First Aid", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article29473532.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GettyImages-1636796653.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9706309", "eventUri": "eng-9706309", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Thinking of all his family and friends.

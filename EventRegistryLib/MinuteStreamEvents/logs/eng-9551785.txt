Frost, Powder, Blizzard and Black Diamonds fit in with the state being a skiing destination.\n\nCanyons fits because Utah is the home of Zion, Bryce Canyon and Canyonlands national parks. Outlaws is likely because Butch Cassidy was born in Utah.\n\nUtah Yeti has nice alliteration, and Yeti and Mammoths have good merchandising possibilities.\n\nThe team said it would \"announce the next round of fan favorites and more details on future steps in the name selection process later this summer.\"\n\n\"Once the team name has been selected, SEG will work diligently to craft the team identity - logo, mascot, colors, and other branding elements - which will debut for the 2025-26 NHL season,\" the survey said.\n\nIn a complex transaction, the NHL granted Utah a team to NBA Jazz owner Ryan and Ashley Smith and made the Arizona Coyotes an inactive franchise. Coyotes players and management are heading to Salt Lake City and the Coyotes could get a team in the next five years if it can build a state-of-the-art arena within that time.\n\nThe Utah team will play next season in Delta Center, where the NBA's Utah Jazz play.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Utah NHL team name: Caribou, Frost, Fury, Ice, Venom, Yeti in running", "source":

The difference between the two of them has been noticeable, almost like night and day. It shows how strong a good owner can be in the community and within the actual franchise with a little bit of effort.\n\nThe way Meruelo handled the relocation with the players will go down in infamy. The Coyotes' players were on their final road trip of the season when the rumors started. While the rumors eventually turned to truth, Meruelo did nothing to alert the players, leaving them to find out their fate through social media.\n\nEventually, when the Utah news became official, it was general manager Bill Armstrong who traveled to Edmonton to tell the players about the news, not Meruelo. While the former owner might have a gag order imposed on him by the NHL, Armstrong most likely did as well and chose to put the players' needs in front of his.\n\nEither way, Meruelo didn't show his face at the final game in Arizona. He didn't say goodbye to the players or wish them good luck in Utah. He also didn't appear at any of the potential final Tucson Roadrunners games to inform those players and staff of what is to come.\n\nOutside of the conclusion of the Coyotes' life in Arizona, there hasn't been much that has arisen about Meruelo's treatment of the players. There have been some rumors about Meruelo not paying certain bills but he's publicly denied every single rumor.\n\nOn the other hand, in just a month, Smith has treated the players with a lot of respect. Just hours after the announcement of relocation, the BYU alum flew to Arizona to meet with the players. He introduced himself and met with each of them one-on-one. He asked what the players wanted to see change and when the players said they wanted better hotels on the road, Smith automatically said \"done.\"\n\nSmith took the whole team golfing while trying to understand what his new players needed to be happy. It impressed the players and gave them hope that the new Utah team would be successful and attract free agents, unlike the Coyotes due to their instability.\n\n\"He was a real beauty. He gets it,\" one player source told ESPN.\n\nOn the staff side, Meruelo himself never came into the limelight. His son Alex Meruelo Jr., however, did. Meruelo Jr. has been revealed as the reason why longtime Coyotes forward and captain Shane Doan never got the chance to be promoted to a front-office position. It was he who told Doan that \"he wasn't ready\" to be in a higher-up position within the Coyotes' organization. So, the legendary Coyote left the franchise he had been with since the team moved from Winnipeg back in 1996 and secured a job with the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nRelated: Meet the Delta Center, the Coyotes' New Home in Utah\n\nMeanwhile, Smith met with head coach Andre Tourigny and Armstrong when he met the players down in Arizona. Both men were impressed by Smith and his plan to bring the NHL to Utah. Tourigny was almost in tears when he got off his plane to see hundreds of kids in hockey jerseys cheering for the new team, later calling it the best moment of his career in the NHL.\n\n\"They told us about their story and what they want to accomplish,\" Tourigny said. \"It was amazing to hear about their core values. Why they're doing this, how much they care about Utah, how much they care about the people in Utah and how much they believe in the state. Honestly, they filled us with emotion and with pride, to be part of that moving forward.\"\n\nArmstrong was equally impressed when he got up on the stage in front of 12,000-plus people in Delta Center. The general manager was happy to be in a place that would make his players happy.\n\n\"Utah, you touched my heart today,\" Armstrong said. \"You have no idea what that means to us. We will pay you back for all of that emotion you gave us today.\"\n\nFan treatment in Arizona has never been the greatest. For starters, the Coyotes only won three playoff rounds in their existence, just one of those being within the past five seasons. While that's not necessarily Meruelo's fault, what is his fault is the lack of fanfare. The Coyotes used to have fan fests to begin the season that would give the fans a chance to meet the players before the season began. This is a typical NHL thing to do as many other teams put on a similar event. However, the event seemed to stop as soon as Meruelo bought the team other than a meet-and-greet with Logan Cooley last summer.\n\nFan access to gear also became limited. Thanks to the move to Mullett Arena, the Coyotes didn't have a pro shop anymore. Rather than trying to get merch trucks or a pop-up store anywhere, the team instead offered random streetwear events where fans could purchase designer apparel that rarely featured the Coyotes' logo. The apparel was ridiculously expensive too with a single hat costing $50.\n\nSomething that annoyed fans the most was the team's social media presence of the team. The Coyotes' X (formerly Twitter) account would post ill-worded posts. When it was all but announced the team would be moving to Utah, the account posted their \"committed to Arizona\" hype video. When rumors were flying around about the team moving to Salt Lake City, instead of comforting their fans directly, the social media accounts reposted a post that was a quote from ownership from a fan account with only 2,000 followers saying \"We feel their pain. It sucks.\" The Coyotes announced the sale of the team the next day.\n\nThe biggest slap in the face to fans was the tweet the team put out shortly after their final game in Arizona saying \"See you all next on June 27th. #YotesForever.\" It was one of the worst things the account could've said to their fans after an emotional farewell to their team.\n\nThe social media debacle was another wrongdoing of Meruelo Jr., who reportedly fired the whole social media team before taking over the accounts himself. It's clear Meruelo Jr., who drove away the greatest player in franchise history and turned the fans against the team, knew nothing about what was best for the organization.\n\nAnother big red flag in the Meruelo tenure was another big diss to Doan. One of the most remembered nights in Coyotes' history was when the team retired Doan's #19. However, the banner, along with the lone division championship banner, didn't make it to Mullett Arena. Both banners were found later, just lying around in Glendale by a former employee. The employee, Matthew Jacobson, later reunited the Coyotes' legend with his banner during the final game in Arizona.\n\nWhile there are likely many more instances where Meruelo and the Coyotes have treated fans poorly, the new Utah ownership has done nothing but support fans. One of the first things Smith promised to do as owner of an NHL team is to get the team acclimated to the community. He did just that two weeks later after purchasing them, putting on a free event in Delta Center where fans had the opportunity to meet the Coyotes' players and staff. The fans chanted \"Salt Lake City\" and \"Spicy Tuna\" after Liam O'Brien told the crowd his now-famous nickname.\n\nSmith has also committed to building a practice facility for the new NHL team that will also serve as another community rink for the city. There aren't many community ice rinks in Utah with the main one being on the campus of the University of Utah. However, Smith has publicly said he doesn't want to see ice time be limited like it has in the past and will help to see it grow. It's similar to his treatment with basketball. The billionaire has helped increase youth participation in the sport ever since purchasing the NBA's Utah Jazz. Now, Utah has one of the biggest youth teams in the country thanks to the Junior Jazz.\n\nFinally, Smith has called upon the fanbase to help decide the team's new name. While he has his own opinions on what his franchise should be called, he wants the community to be a part of the shaping of the new NHL team. In just under a month, Smith has formed a strong positive connection with fans Meruelo did in Arizona. It shows how fans can rally behind a team thanks to a strong and positive owner.\n\nMeruelo's treatment of the community and its leaders is one of the reasons why the Coyotes never got an arena built. It was always Coyotes' CEO Xavier Gutierrez speaking for the owner, including when the team was speaking at the Tempe city council. No one got to know Meruelo until his unimpressive press conference.\n\nWhen Meruelo was under siege by the \"Tempe 1st\" campaign that opposed the Tempe arena plans, there was no pushback by the Coyotes' owner to try to salvage the vote. He barely put any money into the campaign despite publicly lying in his press conference that he did. Instead of helping his own team and those who supported the arena deal in the community, he sat in the shadows and did nothing but watch the proposal get rejected.\n\nMeruelo also was the reason why the Coyotes were forced out of Glendale. His disagreement with a lease extension and constant financial errors gave the city no choice but to boot the team out of Gila River Arena. While ultimately, the Coyotes did need to leave Glendale, the way they left gave Meruelo more enemies than supporters and also forced the team with little time to move into the 4,600-seat Mullett Arena.\n\nAfter losing in Tempe, Meruelo never came up with a plan B until it was too late. He didn't hold a press conference and apologize for his shortcomings to the team and its fans. It was Gutierrez once again trying to mend fences in the public. Now, with the potential to eventually bring the Coyotes back, Meruelo has challenged those who plan to outbid him in his ongoing quest to build an entertainment district. While the confidence is a welcomed one, it seems like no one is behind him including those who backed him before. Even more concerning is the fact that a separate group, composed of former NHL players and community leaders, has come together to start a foundation to keep youth hockey alive in Arizona. The billionaire hasn't publicly reached out or supported the foundation.\n\nSmith has had the whole state of Utah's approval since his purchase of the Jazz. He's publicly voiced his love for Utah over and over again. With that devotion and his public meetings with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, the state has fallen in love with him and his wife Ashley. It's come to the point where Republicans, Democrats, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints have all agreed on the want for an NHL team in Utah.\n\n\"I've never seen so many Republicans and Democrats and religious leaders and educational leaders all on the same page before. It's emotional,\" Smith said. \"It's incredible how much people care about this state.\"\n\nSince purchasing the Coyotes, Smith has worked closely with government leaders and has come up with a plan to modernize downtown Salt Lake City. The new NHL owner wants to make a downtown sports district similar to L.A.'s district with Crypto.com Arena that features a theater, bowling alley, clubs, and restaurants surrounding the facility, claiming the fan experience should start before their tickets are scanned. The church has sided with Smith's efforts to revitalize downtown Salt Lake City and it seems like the government will do the same.\n\nMeanwhile, Smith also wants to renovate Delta Center to make it more NHL-friendly and to continue trying to make the arena one of the best in the NBA. However, his whole plan to renovate downtown isn't just about the arena, it's about growing the city.\n\n\"It's not about the arena renovation,\" Smith said. \"It's just not. It's about everything else around it.\"\n\nSmith has already started working with community leaders in Salt Lake City and nearby towns to help make Utah one of the best markets in the NHL. The city of Sandy, which is a suburb of Salt Lake City, has already been working with Smith to bring the new NHL team's practice facility to the area.\n\n\"The city of Sandy could not be more excited to become the home to the new NHL team's long-term practice facility,\" Sandy mayor Monica Zoltanski said in a statement. \"We have worked collaboratively with Smith Entertainment Group for many years and are excited about their expanding presence in our community with one of the world's premier hockey training facilities in our city.\"\n\nThe difference between Smith and Meruelo in just three weeks of the Utah NHL team existence is night and day. The Jazz owner has already accomplished things in the community and with the players and fans to form a strong connection with all three of those outlets that Meruelo could never achieve. While it's sad to see a community in Arizona lose a pro sports team, especially considering that with a good and committed owner, would've never lost their team. It's good to see that same team be treated with respect for once in Utah, and with the devoted ownership of Ryan and Ashley Smith, it seems like a franchise that will exist in the city in harmony for decades to come.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chase_beardsley@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Chase Beardsley",

But that's about all we know after the NHL's Arizona Coyotes moved to Salt Lake City. The rest is still up in the air.\n\nNamely, if you're wondering what the relocated NHL team may be called, you still have to be a little patient. But not significantly more patient. They do have the list of potential nicknames down to 20, team owner Ryan Smith revealed.\n\nSmith, who also owns the NBA's Utah Jazz (and just about every other pro sports franchise in Salt Lake City), sent out the news in a tweet.\n\nAmong the possibilities: Venom, Ice, Freeze, Flurry, Blizzard, Blast, Mountaineers, Caribou, Frost, Outlaws, Canyons, Mammoth, Glaciers, Squall and Powder.\n\nOh, yes, \"Utah HC\" is also listed as one possibility. That means the team would simply be known as \"Utah Hockey Club.\" Let's hope for the sake of sports everywhere that one isn't voted in.\n\nBut yes, for the record, the team intends to keep \"Utah\" in the name, as opposed to Sal Lake City. That makes the entire state feel as if the team is theirs. (Of course, we saw how well that worked out for Arizona.)\n\nBut \"Utah\" is also more identifiable than SLC in headlines. And shorter. And easier to type. We think.\n\nAt any rate, you don't have to be a fan of the Utah team to vote. You can just be a fan of nicknames. So go on in and make your pick. Just make sure to pick \"Outlaws,\" because that's my personal favorite. \"Outlaws\" was the nickname of the first high school team I covered for my first sportswriting job in Wyoming, and it's unique among pro sports franchises. It also has the \"s\" at the end, which I think should be mandatory for team nicknames.\n\nBut call them whatever you like. Just don't call them the Coyotes.", "source": {"uri": "fanbuzz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FanBuzz - Sports News - NFL | NCAA | NBA |  WWE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_amico@fanbuzz.com", "name": "Sam Amico", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Coyotes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Coyotes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Smith_(businessman)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Smith (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia_Mountaineers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia Mountaineers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Utah Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blizzard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blizzard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mammoth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice_Hockey", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/Ice Hockey", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://fanbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/ryan-smith.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551785", "eventUri": "eng-9551785", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

This first round will be open until May 22 and is an attempt to help pare down the number of team names that will actually be considered by the club.\n\nOn Wednesday, Smith Entertainment Group touted this as a \"multi-phase branding process for fans to vote on the name.\"\n\n\"Utah's NHL team is a community asset, and we want to make sure that the community has a say in what the name is,\" Smith said in a statement on Wednesday. \"Utah has shown up for this team from the moment the NHL awarded us the franchise less than three weeks ago, and it is only fitting that our fans get the rare opportunity to help name the team they'll be cheering for. \"\n\nIn the initial voting process, fans are invited to choose up to four potential names from a list of 20 options. The club compiled this list of 20 potential names after conducting initial research on social media.\n\nFans are only permitted to vote once in this process, with the guidelines stating that Qualtrics -- which is Smith's company -- will ensure there is a \"prevention of ballot box stuffing.\" The club also stated that \"backend analysis will also include deduplication and best practice statistical methods to ensure data integrity.\"\n\nThis is only the first step in the selection process, with another round of voting on a shorter list of potential team names taking place at a later date this summer. The club has confirmed it will play its initial season in 2024-25 with jerseys that simply display \"UTAH\" on the front. After a nickname is selected, Smith Entertainment Group says they will \"work diligently to craft the team identity -- logo, mascot, collars and other branding elements\" -- which will be ready in time for the 2025-26 NHL season.\n\nEarlier this spring, Smith told The Athletic that choosing the name for the team is something he believed was vitally important to establishing a connection with the community in Utah and Salt Lake City.\n\n\"It's got to be something that drives people to want to be a part of it, from all ages. It's got to be a momentum builder,\" Smith said. \"The sky is the limit on this one.

Now the 20 names the team is considering are out, and while there are a couple of gems, most are absolute, unadulterated, steaming crap.\n\nIf you want to have your say in the matter, team owner Ryan Smith tweeted out the link on Wednesday evening.\n\nBut, it's always good to go into anything as an informed voter, so let's look at what they've got to choose from. We knew some of what was going to be considered thanks to some trademark applications a couple of weeks ago, but there are some new surprises.\n\nAs you may or not be aware, the team will use the geographic identifier \"Utah\" as opposed to \"Salt Lake City\" so keep that in mind as we go through names...\n\nVenom: Venom is far from the worst, and some snake branding could be cool, but it's still a no from me, dog.\n\nIce: Would you call a football team \"Field\" or a basketball team \"Court?\" No. Hard pass.\n\nFreeze: You're going to see a pretty big ice/cold/snow theme. All I could think of when I read this name was Arnold going, \"Daaaaah, I'm Mistuh Freeze!\" in Batman And Robin which made me like it a little more, but still not good.\n\nFury: Is this supposed to be an NHL team or one of those pro inline hockey teams that used to be on ESPN 2 back in the '90s? Speaking of which a lot of these names feel very '90s...\n\nBlizzard: This team will be playing in the same division as the Avalanche, so no, we don't need two snow names in the same division and neighboring states.\n\nBlast: Blast of what exactly? Frigid air? Nuclear weapons they used to test in the desert? Farts?\n\nMountaineers: Not terrible, but not particularly exciting, although they would make a fortune selling Davy Crocket-style 'coonskin caps. It could be like their cheesehead!\n\nCaribou: Not gonna lie... I kind of love this one. If you don't think caribou are tough enough to be the namesake for a hockey team, take a pair of antlers through your solar plexus and then get back to me.\n\nFrost: Another cold name. We can do better, guys.\n\nOutlaws: No NHL team has adopted a Wild West motif, and that could go in a lot of cool directions. This is one of the top options in my humble (read: correct) opinion.\n\nCanyons: Just a little blah. Also, if you google that, you would just get a list of literal canyons in Utah. Bad SEO.\n\nMammoth: Great name, but there is a lacrosse team in Denver with that name if that matters. Still, a big Mr. Snuffleupagus-looking mascot wandering around the arena? I like it.\n\nUtah HC: That of course stands for \"Hockey Club\" and while it's not exciting, I think it's classy as hell like one of those tuxedo t-shirts. Worth noting, the team was referred to as the \"Utah Hockey Club\" during the NHL Draft Lottery this week.\n\nGlaciers: This is the \"before picture\" of Canyons. Again, just because it's hockey doesn't mean you have to have a cold-weather name.\n\nHive: This is a nod to Utah's nickname \"The Beehive State\" as well as the state flag. Not terrible, but not great. However, if this gets picked and the mascot isn't a beehive hairdo diner waitress, they can kiss my grits.\n\nYeti: This seems to be the crowd-favorite in the early going. As an amateur cryptozoologist (by which I mean I watch History and Travel Channel documentaries about Bigfoot) I like it. Of course, the Yeti is from the Himalayas not the Rockies, and the last NHL team that needed a name -- the Seattle Kraken -- went the mythical creature route too.\n\nSwarm: This is just a more aggressive version of Hive.\n\nBlack Diamonds: Now, this one is interesting... that's obviously a skiing reference, but it would also come with a built-in intro song: \"Black Diamond\" by KISS. Unless, of course, Gene and Paul don't let them which is also possible.\n\n...\n\nThere are some good names in there, but a lot of utter garbage too. I don't know what's up with all the '90s-sounding names, it's weird.\n\nAnyway, if I were to cast a vote -- the survey asks voters to select up to four names -- my ballot would be:\n\nThe first name to just miss out for me is Mammoth. It was so, so close to making the cut.\n\nThe survey also recalled that the team will wear uniforms that say \"UTAH\" in 2024-25, but the permanent identity based on the results of this survey will hit the ice for the 2025-26 season.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_reigle@outkick.com", "name": "Matt Reigle", "type": "author",

A series of recent moves show he is making good on that, indicating the significant level of retail-level politics at play in the team's early days in its new home.\n\nFollowing prior promises to develop a fan survey to help select the team's new name, Smith released late Wednesday a poll with 20 possibilities for that forthcoming moniker. In keeping with Utah's status as a haven for skiing and other winter sports, as well its nickname as the \"Beehive State,\" many of the listed options tracked along those core areas and were initially compiled from a prior social media survey Smith issued.\n\nThe latest options of names being presented include:\n\nThe poll -- developed with the aid of Smith's feedback and experience management company, Qualtrics -- will be open until May 22, with further voting rounds and other steps in that renaming process to be detailed this summer. For the 2024-25 season, the franchise will be known simply as \"Utah,\" with the rebranding going into full effect the following year. Branding agency Doubleday & Cartwright, which has worked with teams such as the NBA's Bucks and Inter Miami in MLS, is aiding in that process.\n\nSmith's outreach to solicit feedback for the franchise name is just one part of a larger-scale push to root the team in Utah. On April 24, he hosted a free fan celebration at the Delta Center, attended by more than 12,000, in which fans meet team players and coaches. Also the owner of the NBA's Jazz and two local pro soccer teams, Smith has been on an extended run of national interviews, including with Pat McAfee, Canada's SportsNet, and the NHL Network -- to discuss the NHL franchise.\n\nA newly announced plan for a permanent training and headquarters site, to be located at the site of a shopping mall in suburban Sandy, will include a community center and plans include a regular presence on the facility's rinks for local youth and amateur leagues.\n\nMore than 29,000 season-ticket deposits were received just in the first week after the April 18

Duke of Sussex would also interact with wounded soldiers and their families in Abuja as well as witness a novelty volleyball match during the visit.\n\nHe added that the couple would visit Lagos on Sunday where they are supporting an NGO, before departing Nigeria on Monday.\n\nAccording to him, the visit scheduled from May 10 to 13, will help wounded soldiers in their recovery efforts.\n\n\"We realised that 80 per cent of our soldiers have been involved in this recovery programme and they are getting better.\n\n\"Their outlook to life is positive because when you experience a permanent disability, it affects your mental health and also your outlook to life.\n\n\"The recovery programme has given them an opportunity to improve their personal self-esteem, mental health, and emotional intelligence.\n\n\"So this engagement with Invictus is giving opportunity of recovery for our soldiers,'' he said.\n\nMarquis said Nigeria would build a state-of-the-art structure for the management of post-traumatic stress syndrome for wounded and injured soldiers involved in counter-insurgency operations.\n\n\"They will be proceeding to Kaduna to visit Nigerian Army Reference Hospital where our wounded and injured soldiers are kept for their medical recovery.\n\n\"On Saturday, we will have a novelty match where the CDS team and the Duke team will be having a volleyball match at Armed Forces Officers Mess.\n\n\"This is just to engage with the wounded and injured soldiers, it's a sitting volleyball match coming in the morning.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenewsguru.com", "dataType": "news",

Amira means warrior princess from a legend, while Ngozi means blessed and Lolo means royal wife.\n\nThe Duke, who has been in London for the past three days, will be reunited with Meghan in Nigeria.\n\n\"The reception will be a quiet reception because they will be travelling 14 hours to get to this place,\" Mr Marquis said. \"They will be taken to the hotel.\"\n\nAfter a rest, the couple will visit the Light Academy, a school in nearby Wuse, before meeting Gen Christopher Musa, the Chief of Defence Staff, at the Nigerian Defence Headquarters.\n\nIn the afternoon, they will travel to Kaduna, where the Duke will meet injured military personnel at the Nigerian Army Reference Hospital.\n\nMr Marquis said the royal visit would help aid the recovery of injured military personnel by boosting their \"their personal self-esteem\" and \"improving mental health\".\n\nThe hospital was at the centre of a local news story in February, when a suspected outbreak of Lassa fever is said to have killed three health workers and a patient within two days.\n\nArmy spokesman Onyema Nwachukwu insisted at the time that the hospital had been fully disinfected after the A&E unit was closed and evacuated.\n\nOn Saturday, the Duke will field his own team during a \"novelty\" seated volleyball match played by Nigeria's Invictus team, at the officer's mess.\n\nThe exhibition match was organised to engage wounded and injured soldiers, Mr Marquis said. It is unclear whether the Duke will take part. At the inaugural Invictus Games in London, 2014, he appeared to delight in joining a team for a demonstration of the sport.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess will then attend a reception for military personnel and their families, as well as the families of soldiers killed in action and serving servicemen and women.\n\nIn the afternoon, Meghan will co-host a Women in Leadership event with Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, a Nigerian-American economist who is director general of the World Trade Organisation.\n\nOn Sunday, the couple will join a basketball clinic with Giants of Africa, an organisation that promotes youth participation in the sport, attending a cultural reception, and a polo fundraiser for the host's Invictus team, Nigeria: Unconquered.\n\nThe invitation to visit Nigeria was extended at the Invictus Games last September, when the Nigerian team joined the event for the first time.\n\nNigerian military chiefs are hoping the Sussexes' visit will give a major boost to their campaign to host the Invictus Games.\n\nVying with Italy and South Korea\n\nThe country is thought to be vying with Italy and South Korea to host the 2029 Games after Canada in 2025 and then either the UK or the US in 2027.\n\nMr Marquis said there were several reasons why they wanted the Sussexes to visit their country.\n\n\"One, because Nigeria is now a member of the Invictus community, and his coming will lay credence to the fact that, you know, being part of the community, you need to be accepted.\n\n\"Number two, that Nigeria is also looking forward to hosting an Invictus Games and three, the need to build a state-of-the-art structure for the management of the wounded and injured soldiers, particularly those with post traumatic stress syndrome.\n\n\"And finally, you know, his wife recently did a DNA genealogy test and it was confirmed that she's 43 per cent Nigerian, so she also is looking forward to coming to Nigeria to explore her ancestry and lineage.\"\n\nAhead of the visit, the Duke attended a charity event for bereaved military children in London on Thursday.\n\nAt the event, he met with 50 children and young people who have experienced the death of a military parent.\n\nHe spent time chatting to them as well as joining them for games such as edible races, flipper challenge and bucket head.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

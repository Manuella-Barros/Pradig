Seattle is 6-3 against the spread on the road and 2-1 against the spread as an underdog in 2024.\n\nWhile Loyd's shooting has been a major concern, the Storm have battled through it with Skylar Diggins-Smith, Nneka Ogwumike, Ezi Magbegor and others stepping up to fill the scoring void.\n\nThe key for Seattle has been its defense (No. 3 in the WNBA), especially since the team ranks just ninth in the league in effective field goal percentage.\n\nThe Storm are also ahead of the Aces so far this season in net rating (+5.6 to +1.2).\n\nUltimately, Vegas' lack of depth is being exposed a bit by Gray's absence and Kelsey Plum's shooting struggles (37.1 percent from the field) early on in 2024. Wilson has been playing at a high level all season, but even that hasn't been enough for Las Vegas to remain over .500.\n\nI can justify laying this many points with the Aces - given their ATS record at home - against a formidable opponent in Seattle.\n\nPick: Storm +6 (-112)\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800-GAMBLER.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Storm vs. Aces Prediction, Odds and Key Players for WNBA on Wednesday, June 19.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_dewey@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Peter Dewey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Aces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Aces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nneka_Ogwumike", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nneka Ogwumike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A'ja_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "A'ja Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewell_Loyd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jewell Loyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Gray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea Gray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-double", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double-double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(WNBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (WNBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezi_Magbegor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ezi Magbegor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylar_Diggins-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skylar Diggins-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Field goal percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Plum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Plum"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Fitness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Fitness", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/cnpow/picture289387024/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/4897c028-ad3b-472b-bdd7-2614be38e6d0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666354", "eventUri": "eng-9666354", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-15", "textStart": 453, "textEnd": 460}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 3279, "textEnd": 3286}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 236, "relevance": 1}

Gray missed the first dozen games of the season -- as well as the clincher last year when Las Vegas beat the Liberty for its second-straight championship.\n\n\"Man I missed this game so much.

Jewell Loyd, who led the league in scoring last season at more than 24 points a game and came in averaging just less than 20, missed nine shots and was held to a single point, ending a streak of 55 games in double figures.

Luckily, I've been able to narrow down the slate to my two favorite plays, focusing on the No. 1 pick in the 2024 WNBA Draft.\n\nI absolutely love this prop for Caitlin Clark against the struggling Washington Mystics, who have won a pair of games in the last week, but are still the No. 11 team in the league in net rating.\n\nClark torched Washington earlier this season, scoring 30 points on 8-of-15 shooting from the field (7-for-13 from 3) in a two-point win back on June 7.\n\nThe Mystics didn't have an answer for the rookie, and Clark has multiple games with 20-plus points over her last four, shooting 7-for-11 to score 23 points in a weekend win over the Chicago Sky.\n\nThere is some volatility with Clark (she's shooting just 38.3 percent from the field), but she's averaging 12.5 field goal attempts and 4.3 free-throw attempts per game. That usage should be enough for her to clear this number against a team she has already fared well against in 2024.\n\nThe Aces have been a dominant home team in recent seasons, but things have changed in 2024 with the team missing Chelsea Gray in the lineup. Gray, who is expected to make her season debut tonight, was listed as active against the New York Liberty on June 15, but she did not play.\n\nStill, I'm not trusting in her playing a big role in this game as we'd usually expect since it's her first of 2024.\n\nLas Vegas is just 3-4 straight up at home, posting a dreadful 1-6 against the spread record in those games.\n\nThat sets up well for the Storm, who already have a 13-point win over Vegas in their back pocket, on Wednesday. Seattle is 6-3 against the spread on the road and 2-1 against the spread as an underdog in 2024.\n\nWhile Jewell Loyd's shooting has been a major concern (34.9 percent from the field), the Storm have battled through it with Skylar Diggins-Smith, Nneka Ogwumike, Ezi Magbegor and others stepping up to fill the scoring void.\n\nThe key for Seattle has been its defense (No. 3 in the WNBA), especially since the team ranks just ninth in the league in effective field goal percentage.\n\nThe Storm are also ahead of the Aces so far this season in net rating (+5.6 to +1.2).\n\nUltimately, Vegas' lack of depth is being exposed a bit by Gray's absence and Kelsey Plum's shooting struggles (37.1 percent from the field) early on in 2024. Wilson has been playing at a high level all season, but even that hasn't been enough for Las Vegas to remain over .500.\n\nI can justify laying this many points with the Aces - given their ATS record at home - against a formidable opponent in Seattle.\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Aces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Aces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewell_Loyd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jewell Loyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Mystics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Mystics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Lynx", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Lynx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A'ja_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A'ja Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napheesa_Collier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Napheesa Collier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Gray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea Gray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezi_Magbegor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ezi Magbegor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nneka_Ogwumike", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nneka Ogwumike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylar_Diggins-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skylar Diggins-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Field goal percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Plum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Plum"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3016,h_1696,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j0p5ea37ne5r35jf1f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666354", "eventUri": "eng-9666354", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 1066, "textEnd": 1072}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-15", "textStart": 1808, "textEnd": 1815}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

(Steve Marcus / Las Vegas Review-Journal via AP)\n\nAt the end of a nine-game stretch, which included seven on the road, the Storm played like a team anxious to return home.\n\nThey began this stretch with four straight wins, but perhaps fatigue finally caught up with Seattle, which is 2-3 in the past five games after a 94-83 defeat Wednesday night against the Las Vegas Aces.\n\nMaybe their minds were on an upcoming nine-game homestand -- the longest in WNBA history -- because the Storm seemed as if they wanted to be anywhere besides Michelob Ultra Arena.\n\n\"Everybody has their moments in the season when you have to kind of be road warriors,\" forward Nneka Ogwumike said. \"That's something that's unavoidable. How you respond and how you show up in those times is important.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to a nine-game homestand, but that's also not a guarantee. It'll give us time at home. It'll give us time to look in the mirror and to look at film. But at the end of the day, we still have to ... play and win these games against some great opponents.\"\n\nFollowing a 78-65 road win against Las Vegas two weeks ago, Seattle entered its rematch concerned about Chelsea Gray, who made her long-awaited season debut after missing 12 games due to a foot injury.\n\nTurns out, the Storm should have been worried about Jackie Young.\n\nIn their first meeting, the sixth-year Aces guard scored a season-low three points, due in part to an illness and a stingy Storm defense that held Las Vegas to its fewest points this year and a season-low 31.3% shooting from the field.\n\nHowever, Seattle's defense has been ineffective during its two-game skid, which prompted blunt criticism from coach Noelle Quinn following Sunday's 87-78 road loss against the Phoenix Mercury.\n\n\"I don't think our defensive effort was where it needed to be against Phoenix,\" she said. \"That's where we want to hang our hat, [but] if we want to say that, then we have to do that.\"\n\nBut the Storm had no defense for Young who scored 32 points -- two shy of her career-high -- on 11-for-19 shooting. She also had four rebounds, two assists and two steals.\n\n\"She's a great player and she was able to get to her spots, but I think we didn't make it tough for her, especially in the first half when she got going,\" forward Ezi Magbegor said. \"When she sees the ball go in, she's going to keep attacking and keep being aggressive.\"\n\nYoung, who scored 14 points in the first quarter, got going early and sank a couple of dribble-drive baskets to cap a 9-2 run that gave the Aces a 21-11 lead with 3:08 left in the first quarter, which prompted a Storm timeout.\n\nAfter a Seattle basket, Young knifed through the defense again for a layup. The Storm never got closer than nine points the rest of the way.\n\n\"I would probably attribute it to our posture,\" Ogwumike said when asked about Seattle's slow starts in the past two games. \"We could have a posture that's a little bit more forthcoming, a little bit more competitive. We have our screens down, and we know what we've got to do when we go out there, but definitely how we approach the game, I think, is something that could really help.\"\n\nThe Aces led 47-32 at halftime, which tied for the most points the Storm have allowed in a half this season.\n\nSeattle outscored Las Vegas 51-47 after the break and had a few nice moments in the second half despite falling behind 84-64 late in the fourth quarter.\n\nOgwumike (21 points), Magbegor (19 points and 13 rebounds) and Jordan Horston, who continued a three-game stretch of impressive outings and finished with 18 points and six rebounds, were a few of the bright spots for the Storm.\n\nSkylar Diggins-Smith added 10 points and six assists.\n\nHowever, Seattle couldn't overcome a 0-for-9 shooting display from Jewell Loyd, who finished with one point, snapping her streak of 56 games with double-digit scoring outings.\n\nIt was also her fewest points since Aug. 7, 2022.\n\nLas Vegas, which lost four of its previous five games and improved to 7-6, received 27 points, nine rebounds and four steals from A'ja Wilson, an early MVP favorite.\n\nFormer Washington Huskies standout Kelsey Plum had 11 points and eight assists, while Tiffany Hayes and former Storm player Alysha Clark each had 10.\n\nThe Storm has a three-game layoff before Sunday's contest against the Connecticut Sun (13-1).\n\n\"It's not going to get easier,\" Quinn said. \"We're going to have [Thursday] off to get our minds and our bodies to where we need to be and two really good days of practice.\n\n\"For a competitive group and a group that needs to get back on track, it's about taking a step away sometimes, recalibrating and coming back with a fresh set of eyes and fresh set of lungs ... Take some time away, come back, get refocused and get right back at it.\"\n\nBOX SCORE", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [],

She also had four rebounds, two assists and two steals.\n\n\"She's a great player and she was able to get to her spots, but I think we didn't make it tough for her, especially in the first half when she got going,\" forward Ezi Magbegor said. \"When she sees the ball go in, she's going to keep attacking and keep being aggressive.\"\n\nYoung, who scored 14 points in the first quarter, got going early and sank a couple of dribble-drive baskets to cap a 9-2 run that gave the Aces a 21-11 lead with 3:08 left in the first quarter, which prompted a Storm timeout.\n\nAfter a Seattle basket, Young knifed through the defense again for a layup. The Storm never got closer than nine points the rest of the way.\n\n\"I would probably attribute it to our posture,\" Ogwumike said when asked about Seattle's slow starts in the past two games. \"We could have a posture that's a little bit more forthcoming, a little bit more competitive. We have our screens down, and we know what we've got to do when we go out there, but definitely how we approach the game, I think, is something that could really help.\"\n\nThe Aces led 47-32 at halftime, which tied for the most points the Storm have allowed in a half this season.\n\nSeattle outscored Las Vegas 51-47 after the break and had a few nice moments in the second half despite falling behind 84-64 late in the fourth quarter.\n\nOgwumike (21 points), Magbegor (19 points and 13 rebounds) and Jordan Horston, who continued a three-game stretch of impressive outings and finished with 18 points and six rebounds, were a few of the bright spots for the Storm.\n\nSkylar Diggins-Smith added 10 points and six assists.\n\nHowever, Seattle couldn't overcome a 0-for-9 shooting display from Jewell Loyd, who finished with one point, snapping her streak of 56 games with double-digit scoring outings.\n\nIt was also her fewest points since Aug. 7, 2022.\n\nLas Vegas, which lost four of its previous five games and improved to 7-6, received 27 points, nine rebounds and four steals from A'ja Wilson, an early MVP favorite.\n\nFormer Washington Huskies standout Kelsey Plum had 11 points and eight assists, while Tiffany Hayes and former Storm player Alysha Clark each had 10.\n\nThe Storm has a three-game layoff before Sunday's contest against the Connecticut Sun (13-1).\n\n\"It's not going to get easier,\" Quinn said. \"We're going to have [Thursday] off to get our minds and our bodies to where we need to be and two really good days of practice.\n\n\"For a competitive group and a group that needs to get back on track, it's about taking a step away sometimes, recalibrating and coming back with a fresh set of eyes and fresh set of lungs ... Take some time away, come back, get refocused and get right back at it.\"\n\nBOX SCORE", "source": {"uri": "theolympian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The  Olympian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "percy_allen@theolympian.com", "name": "Percy Allen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Young_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jackie Young (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nneka_Ogwumike", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nneka Ogwumike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelob_Ultra_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michelob Ultra Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Aces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Aces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_Gray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea Gray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezi_Magbegor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ezi Magbegor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Mercury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Mercury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noelle_Quinn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noelle Quinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewell_Loyd", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jewell Loyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Hayes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut_Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alysha_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alysha Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skylar_Diggins-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skylar Diggins-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A'ja_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A'ja Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Plum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Plum"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.theolympian.com/wps/build/images/theolympian/facebook.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666354", "eventUri": "eng-9666354", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 7}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

How to watch, what to know", "body": "The Connecticut Sun already felt the sting of losing in the WNBA Finals to the Las Vegas Aces back in 2022, and coach Stephanie White knows that her team's path to an elusive first title likely runs through the reigning back-to-back champions.\n\nVegas became the first team since the 2001-02 Los Angeles Sparks to win back-to-back titles last season when they toppled the New York Liberty in a 3-1 series. Coach Becky Hammon has never lost a playoff series in her two seasons at the helm of the Aces, and the team returned four players who went on to become Paris Olympic team members to its starting lineup this year.\n\nBut the Aces in 2024 have yet to play like the team that dominated the league last year. The team didn't suffer its second loss in 2023 until July 7, but Vegas is already 7-6 this season and had lost four of their last five games before a 94-83 win over the Seattle Storm on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Connecticut is in the midst of the best start in franchise history with a WNBA-leading 13-1 record. The Sun are just the seventh team in league history to record a single loss through 14 games, and all six previously have gone on to play in that year's WNBA Finals.\n\nConnecticut will get its first shot at the defending champions in Las Vegas on Friday, looking for their first victory over the Aces on the road since June 2022.\n\n\"We certainly have to go through them to win a championship. They have been there,\" Sun coach Stephanie White said. \"But at the same time it's the next step for us in our journey and the next opponent in front of us. We've just got to be locked in. Winning is tough. Playing on the road is even tougher, and playing on the road against a defending champ takes it up another level. So e've got to be disciplined. We've got to be detailed and come ready to play.\"\n\nDespite the Aces' early struggles, superstar forward A'ja Wilson immediately established herself as the frontrunner for MVP in 2024. Wilson, who finished third for the award last year behind New York Liberty star Breanna Stewart and the Sun's Alyssa Thomas, is averaging a career-high 27.9 points, 11.3 rebounds and 2.5 blocks through her first games. She has recorded a WNBA-record 18 consecutive games with at least 20 points and eight rebounds, 11 more than previous record holder Napheesa Collier.\n\nBut the Sun have an MVP candidate forward of their own in Thomas, who is poised for another career season in 2024. Thomas beat out Wilson for MVP runner-up by just six votes after breaking the WNBA record for regular-season triple-doubles with six last year, and she logged her first of this season in the opener against the Indiana Fever. Thomas is averaging nearly identical numbers to her 2023 campaign with 12.7 points, 9.8 rebounds and 8.1 assists per game, and she is shooting a career-best 52.8% from the field. The superstar has yet to log her second triple-double of the season, but she has recorded at least a double-double in six games.\n\nAgainst Seattle, Vegas looked more like itself in large part thanks to the return of point guard Chelsea Gray from an Achilles injury she suffered in Game 3 of the 2023 Finals. The five-time All-Star logged seven assists, four rebounds and two blocks in her 2024 debut playing just 16 minutes off the bench.\n\nDespite the Finals loss, Connecticut doesn't have the same burgeoning rivalry with the Aces as it does with the neighboring Liberty who eliminated them in the WNBA semifinals last year. The Sun went 1-2 against the eventual champions in 2023, earning a 94-77 win in their second meeting behind a career-high 41 points from DeWanna Bonner. But there's a new wrinkle of drama between the two teams entering the first matchup of 2024: Former UConn standout Tiffany Hayes.\n\nHayes, an 12th-year WNBA veteran, started all 40 games for the Sun in 2023 before announcing her retirement from the league in December on the Counted Me Out podcast. Less than six months later on May 31, Hayes abruptly reversed course and signed a rest-of-season contract with Vegas. The 5-foot-10 guard has made an immediate impact, averaging 8.9 points, 3.4 rebounds and 2.4 assists over her first seven appearances for the Aces.\n\n\"I'm excited for her to be back in the league. Disappointed for us, of course, but excited for her,\" White said after Hayes' signing was announced. \"I think, being somebody who's been a player in this league, understanding that you've got veteran players who want opportunities to continue to compete and want to benefit from some of the things that that teams are able to provide for them now, I certainly get that.\"", "source": {"uri":

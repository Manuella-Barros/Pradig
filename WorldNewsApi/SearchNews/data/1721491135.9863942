The Head, Downstream Africa, Sahara Group, Foluso Sobanjo, stated this recently at the International Air Transport Association\u2019s Aviation Energy Forum held in Vienna, Austria. In a statement made available to The PUNCH on Monday by the Sahara Group\u2019s Head of Corporate Communications, Bethel Obioma, Sobanjo while speaking on the growth factors for the Nigerian market, said the aviation fuel sector would benefit from adequate refining capacity, forex stability, cheaper sources of funds and infrastructure development. He noted, \u201cAchieving stability in the FX market would impact the Jet fuel market positively by reducing product cost, solving the liquidity issues facing the airlines and help with the repatriation of the investment made by foreign airlines which would spur further investments.\u201d According to him, suppliers need to be able to access credit at the right price as this would help to facilitate investments in essential infrastructure like tank farms, bowsers, and trucks. \u201cThis would enhance operational capabilities and logistical efficiency, thereby supporting long-term growth and healthy competitiveness in the sector,\u201d he stated. Sobanjo also called for investment in infrastructure through sundry Public-Private Partnerships and collaboration among all stakeholders, including IATA, airlines, the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria, and petroleum marketers to drive sustainable regulation, growth, and development of the sector. While attributing the sterling performance in the aviation fuel market to the Asharami\u2019s commitment to safety, technology-driven solutions and environmental sustainability, Sobanjo maintained that the firm had a pedigree of exceptional performance in the market that spans two decades in Nigeria. \u201cAsharami Synergy is the leading aviation fuel supplier in Nigeria with over 20 per cent of the market share. We have several certifications from the International Organisation for Standardisation in recognition of our commitment to excellence, quality, and safety. With current storage capacity of about 31 million litres owned and operated by Asharami across the nation, a fleet of 20 bowsers, and ongoing plans for capacity expansion, we keep innovating to deliver outstanding Jet A1 solutions,\u201d he disclosed. Sobanjo added that Asharami Synergy offers solutions that resonate with the operations of local and international airlines in Nigeria. \u201cOur distinctive mark of excellence and safety make Asharami the responsible provider of choice for aviation fuel in the Nigerian market,\u201d he said. Also speaking in Vienna, the Chief Executive Officer, Asharami Synergy, Nomnso Dike, said the company had been a strategic partner with IATA since 2009, adding that its diversified product supply chain facilitates availability and competitive pricing in the market. \u201cWe are constantly investing in technology to drive efficiency in our business hence the adoption of the solution that increases efficiency through digitalised tracking of our into-plane fueling operations, whilst also helping to reduce CO2 emissions. \u201cIn addition, our dashboard tracks and analyses our customers\u2019 consumption patterns, thereby enabling us to forecast demand accurately and ensure consistent product availability to meet all our supply obligations. This ensures our customers can rely on Asharami for responsible and seamless supply,\u201d he stated. The PUNCH reports that the high cost of Jet A1 is one of the factors responsible for the high cost of flight tickets in Nigeria. Our correspondent recalled that the aviation fuel rose from about N300 per litre in February 2022 to about N1,000 per litre. It has since caused a significant increase in the cost of tickets.", "summary": "<p>Asharami Synergy Limited, a Sahara Group downstream company in Nigeria has said that stability in the foreign exchange market would impact the aviation fuel market positively by reducing the cost of the product.

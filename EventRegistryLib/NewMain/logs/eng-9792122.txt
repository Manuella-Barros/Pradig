The right-hander has notched a career-high 164 strikeouts on the season.\n\nGlasnow retired the side in order four times, including getting Kyle Schwarber, Trea Turner and Bryce Harper on swinging strikeouts in the first.\n\nHarper struck out three times in all as the NL East-leading Phillies lost for the seventh time in eight games after taking a 2-0 lead with two outs in the second.\n\nFreddie Freeman returned to the Dodgers' lineup after missing eight games while tending to his ailing 3-year-old son. He was 1 for 4.\n\nThe NL West-leading Dodgers rallied with four runs in the third. Andy Pages hit an RBI double in the left field corner and Ohtani tied it 2-2 with a sacrifice fly to the warning track in right for his 80th RBI of the season. Hern\u00e1ndez followed with his 24th homer to left for a 4-2 lead off Aaron Nola (11-5).\n\nDaniel Hudson pitched a scoreless ninth to earn his eighth save.\n\nAfter Schwarber singled, Glasnow wasn't able to put Harper away with two strikes in the sixth, and he doubled down the left field line. Schwarber scored on Alec Bohm's RBI groundout, drawing the Phillies to 4-3.\n\nDodgers reliever Anthony Banda pitched a scoreless eighth, stranding Schwarber and Bohm.\n\nOhtani's 34th homer extended the Dodgers' lead to 5-3 leading off the bottom of the eighth. Center fielder Brandon Marsh made a futile leap at the wall as Ohtani circled back to first, apparently to make sure he had touched the base before completing his home run trot.\n\nThe Dodgers ended a four-game skid against the Phillies, which was their longest active such streak against any opponent. They were swept in three games in Philadelphia last month.\n\nWill Smith and Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez were the only Dodgers without a hit.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nPhillies: C Garrett Stubbs fouled a ball off his right shin in the fifth, but stayed in the game.\n\nDodgers: RHP Brusdar Graterol (right shoulder inflammation) was activated from the 60-day IL. ...

RHP Walker Buehler (hip) threw a bullpen session and will pitch for Triple-A Oklahoma City on Thursday before rejoining the team.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPhillies: LHP Cristopher S\u00e1nchez (7-7, 3.36 ERA) seeks his second career win against the Dodgers.\n\nDodgers: LHP Clayton Kershaw (0-1, 5.87) makes his third start of the season after lasting just 3 2/3 innings against San Diego last week.

The right-hander has notched a career-high 164 strikeouts on the season.\n\nGlasnow retired the side in order four times, including getting Kyle Schwarber, Trea Turner and Bryce Harper on swinging strikeouts in the first.\n\n\"I felt a little out of whack,\" Glasnow said. \"The positive today for me was just ignore how I feel and just go and try and attack the zone.\"\n\nHarper struck out three times in all as the NL East-leading Phillies lost for the seventh time in eight games after taking a 2-0 lead with two outs in the second. Bryson Stott had a RBI infield single and then scored on a wild pitch by Glasnow.\n\nFreddie Freeman returned to the Dodgers' lineup after missing eight games while tending to his ailing 3-year-old son. He was 1 for 4 and received a standing ovation before his first at-bat. Harper later greeted Freeman with a hug at first base.\n\n\"It was really cool to see people rally around Freddie and the Freeman family,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.\n\nOhtani added, \"It was very touching.\"\n\nThe NL West-leading Dodgers rallied with four runs in the third. Andy Pages hit an RBI double in the left field corner and Ohtani tied it 2-2 with a sacrifice fly to the warning track in right for his 80th RBI of the season. Hern\u00e1ndez followed with his 24th homer to left for a 4-2 lead off Aaron Nola (11-5).\n\nDaniel Hudson pitched a scoreless ninth to earn his eighth save.\n\nAfter Schwarber singled, Glasnow wasn't able to put Harper away with two strikes in the sixth, and he doubled down the left field line. Schwarber scored on Alec Bohm's RBI groundout, drawing the Phillies to 4-3.\n\nDodgers reliever Anthony Banda pitched a scoreless eighth, stranding Schwarber and Bohm.\n\nOhtani's 34th homer extended the Dodgers' lead to 5-3 leading off the bottom of the eighth. Center fielder Brandon Marsh made a futile leap at the wall as Ohtani circled back to first, apparently to make sure he had touched the base before completing his home run trot.\n\n\"Just be able to give breathing room at the end of the game is really key for winning,\" Ohtani said through an interpreter.\n\nThe Dodgers ended a four-game skid against the Phillies, which was their longest active such streak against any opponent. They were swept in three games in Philadelphia last month, with Nola winning one of the games.\n\n\"He just made more mistakes than he did in Philly,\" Roberts said.\n\nDodgers: RHP Brusdar Graterol (right shoulder inflammation) was activated from the 60-day IL. ... RHP Blake Treinen (left hip discomfort) went on the IL. ... RHP Walker Buehler (hip) threw a bullpen session and will pitch for Triple-A Oklahoma City on Thursday before rejoining the team.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPhillies: LHP Cristopher S\u00e1nchez (7-7, 3.36 ERA) seeks his second career win against the Dodgers.\n\nDodgers: LHP Clayton Kershaw (0-1, 5.87) makes his third start of the season after lasting just 3 2/3 innings against San Diego last week.

The right-hander has notched a career-high 164 strikeouts on the season.\n\nGlasnow retired the side in order four times, including getting Kyle Schwarber, Trea Turner and Bryce Harper on swinging strikeouts in the first.\n\nHarper struck out three times in all as the NL East-leading Phillies lost for the seventh time in eight games after taking a 2-0 lead with two outs in the second.\n\nFreddie Freeman returned to the Dodgers\u00b4 lineup after missing eight games while tending to his ailing 3-year-old son.

The sportsbook opinions on the Dodgers make it no surprise that the Phillies are a +125 series underdog in southern California this week.\n\nNow this isn't a typical Phillies/Dodgers series. Yes, the Dodgers still have Shohei Ohtani in the lineup, but Mookie Betts is working back from injury and Freddie Freeman is away from the team due to a personal matter.\n\nThe Dodgers added a bunch of role players to their lineup at the trade deadline, but no one other than pitcher Jack Flaherty potentially moved the needle.\n\nSo the Phillies enter Monday with the more powerful lineup on paper, and that matters, because the pitching matchups are pretty much even.\n\nMonday's game pits Aaron Nola against Tyler Glasnow in what has the potential to be one of the best pitching battles of the entire 2024 MLB season.\n\nNola held the Dodgers to one earned run and four hits in six innings on July 11th. Glasnow is a strikeout machine who has pitched six full innings in four of his last six starts.\n\nThe Under 7.5 is very much in play on Monday, but after that, it could be kind of a crapshoot when it comes to runs.\n\nCristopher Sanchez is going up against Clayton Kershaw on Tuesday, and while on paper it could be a great battle, Kershaw's allowed 12 hits and and nine runs in 7.2 innings and Sanchez allowed 22 hits in his last three starts.\n\nKershaw frankly doesn't care about an August game, even if it's against the Phillies, because he's gearing up to be ready for October.\n\nThe Dodgers have an edge with Gavin Stone going up against Tyler Phillips on Wednesday, but Stone is in a rough patch of form. He's allowed four or more earned runs in four of his last five appearances.\n\nSo save your over and player props and PA sports betting promo for Tuesday and Wednesday when the stars have a ton of potential to shine in a massive way, and in the Phillies' case, that may be the best thing possible to potentially shift the World Series and NL pennant odds in their favor.", "source": {"uri": "crossingbroad.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crossing Broad"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_tansey@crossingbroad.com", "name": "Joe Tansey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Glasnow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Glasnow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_Kershaw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clayton Kershaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennant_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennant (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.crossingbroad.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/USATSI_23810870-1200x628.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792122", "eventUri": "eng-9792122", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 1365, "textEnd": 1374}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The right-hander has notched a career-high 164 strikeouts on the season.\n\nGlasnow retired the side in order four times, including getting Kyle Schwarber, Trea Turner and Bryce Harper on swinging strikeouts in the first.\n\nHarper struck out three times in all as the NL East-leading Phillies lost for the seventh time in eight games after taking a 2-0 lead with two outs in the second.\n\nFreddie Freeman returned to the Dodgers' lineup after missing eight games while tending to his ailing 3-year-old son.

Bryce Harper is fired up.", "body": "The Phillies swept L.A. the last time they met. Much has changed since then and now the Dodgers are only 1\u00bd games behind in the National League race.\n\nBryce Harper made his major-league debut at Dodger Stadium. He once ran face-first into the right field wall there and took 11 stitches under the chin. And it was where he completed his swift comeback from Tommy John elbow surgery 15 months ago.\n\nIt doesn't take much to fire up Harper for a series in Los Angeles.\n\nThere's no sense hyping this week's clash of the National League titans. The Phillies are trying to steady themselves after staggering around for the past month. The Dodgers still have Mookie Betts and half of their starting rotation sidelined by injuries.\n\n\" READ MORE: Bryce Harper, Shohei Ohtani, Aaron Judge endorse MLB players in the 2028 Olympics, an idea that might be gaining steam\n\nBut the three games this week at Chavez Ravine aren't without intrigue. Maybe it's because the Phillies swept the Dodgers four weeks ago in South Philly, outscoring them by 19-5. After that series, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts didn't sugarcoat anything.\n\n\"They're clearly a better team than we are right now,\" he said.\n\nKey words: Right now.\n\nBecause the Phillies were at nearly full strength, sans J.T. Realmuto, and had three of their top starters (Zack Wheeler, Cristopher S\u00e1nchez, and Aaron Nola) on the mound. The Dodgers had Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman, Will Smith, and Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez, but also an All-Star team on the injured list.\n\nThe talent gap, like the 1\u00bd-game margin in the standings, will be closer for Phillies-Dodgers Round 2, even if Freeman isn't available for all three games. He hasn't played since July 25 because his 3-year-old son, Maximus, was hospitalized and being treated for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a nerve disorder that can cause paralysis. Maximus was released from the hospital Sunday, Freeman and his wife announced on social media.\n\nDodgers starters Tyler Glasnow and Clayton Kershaw are healthy now and scheduled to pitch Monday and Tuesday, respectively. And the Dodgers have improved with trades for righty Jack Flaherty, hard-throwing reliever Michael Kopech, infielder Amed Rosario, and veteran outfielder Kevin Kiermaier.\n\nIt's premature to label this week a preview of the NL Championship Series. But if the Phillies and Dodgers, both of whom are leading their divisions, are really on a collision course in October -- in the tradition of 1977, 1978, 1983, 2008, and 2009 -- this will more closely resemble the Dodgers' roster when they get there.\n\n\" READ MORE: About-face? Brandon Marsh has picked up a few hits for the Phillies against left-handers lately\n\n\"You definitely want to beat a team at their best and when they throw their [Nos.] 1, 2, 3 [starters],\" Brandon Marsh said. \"We're going to get that, and it's going to be a test for us on the road, in a tough ballpark, against a really good team. But we're built for it, and we're excited.\"\n\nIt helped that the Phillies went sweepless in Seattle (sorry, couldn't be helped) with a 6-0 victory Sunday. A mechanical issue with the team plane delayed their departure for Los Angeles, but they scarcely needed jet fuel after four feel-good homers and eight dominant innings from Wheeler, who played his ace role to perfection.\n\nAs wins in August go, it was a biggie.\n\nSo, the Phillies (66-45) arrived in L.A. with the league's best record, a prerequisite to securing home-field advantage throughout the NL playoffs. If they take even one of three games from the Dodgers (65-47), they will leave with the top spot still in their possession.\n\nBut the Phillies are 5-13 since sweeping the Dodgers, who are 10-8 over the same time frame. And the Dodgers' cavalry is nearing a return. Betts, Max Muncy, Chris Taylor, newly acquired utilityman Tommy Edman, and starters Walker Buehler and Yoshinobu Yamamoto are all expected back this season.\n\n\"Every time we play the Dodgers, they're a really good team no matter who's on the field or who's pitching,\" Harper said. \"They have so much depth in that organization. Obviously they made some acquisitions at the deadline. They're going to be the Dodgers.\n\n\"The Dodgers are always trying to get better and have that multimillion-dollar payroll, just like the best teams in baseball. It's going to be a good series. Going to L.A. is always fun. Just looking forward to it.\"\n\nHarper reached 3,000 career total bases with a single Sunday. He's the 42nd player to record that milestone before turning 32 and the third active player, joining Mike Trout and Manny Machado. ... Including Wheeler's gem Sunday, the Phillies have won 28 consecutive games in which their starter goes at least seven innings. It's the second-longest streak in baseball history after the 1942 Cardinals, who won 42 in a row. ... S\u00e1nchez (7-7. 3.36 ERA) will start Tuesday night against Kershaw (0-1, 5.87).", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_lauber@inquirer.com", "name": "Scott Lauber", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_reconstruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_behind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Games behind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Wheeler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zack Wheeler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Marsh_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Marsh (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Glasnow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Glasnow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._T._Realmuto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Let's take a look at everything you need to know to bet on tonight's opener.\n\nOdds via DraftKings Sportsbook.\n\nAlec Bohm: To get the Phillies offense going again after a slow few weeks, they need Alec Bohm to keep playing well. He leads the team in both batting average (.295) and RBIs (77) this season. He also has a WAR of +3.4, the second-highest in the lineup behind only Bryce Harper (+3.6).\n\nShohei Ohtani: Whenever the Dodgers play, Shohei Ohtani is the key player to watch. He leads the team in batting average (.306), home runs (33), RBIs (79), and hits (131) while also rocking a +5.9 WAR. The difference he makes cannot be understated.\n\nEveryone has been talking about how the Phillies have been stumbling lately, but the Dodgers have quietly not had their best stuff either. Dating back to July 22, the Dodgers are just 22nd in the Majors in OPS at .686. That's only slightly better than the Phillies who are 24th in that same time frame.\n\nNow, with Aaron Nola on the mound and after a bounceback performance against the Mariners on Sunday, the Phillies may be poised to turn things around. Nola had a start against the Dodgers back on July 11 and he gave up only one earned run across 6.0 innings which resulted in a 5-1 win for the Phillies.\n\nI expect a similar performance today and I'm going to take a shot on the Phillies as betting underdogs.\n\nPick: Phillies +114\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800-GAMBLER.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Bohm", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alec Bohm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wins Above Replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4612,h_2594,x_0,y_231/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j4hfvq3y1ds37q1vg5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792122", "eventUri": "eng-9792122", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 1182, "textEnd": 1189}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 1528, "textEnd": 1535}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

After all, these squads are ranked Nos. 1 and 2 on the Senior Circuit in winning percentage with just under two months to go. Regular-season success doesn't always transfer to the postseason -- just ask these Dodgers about that -- but it's fair to describe this as the likeliest outcome based on current information.\n\nWith that in mind, we here at CBS Sports wanted to set the table by providing some pertinent information about this series. Below, you can find the probable matchups, the start times, and what to know about these squads entering the series.\n\nFirst, let's provide some pertinent information about these games:\n\nMonday, 10:10 pm ET: RHP Aaron Nola (PHI, 11-4, 3.43 ERA) vs. RHP Tyler Glasnow (LAD, 8-6, 3.50 ERA)Tuesday, 10:10 pm ET : LHP Cristopher S\u00e1nchez (PHI, 7-7, 3.36 ERA) vs. LHP Clayton Kershaw (LAD, 0-1, 5.87 ERA)Wednesday, 10:10 pm ET: RHP Tyler Phillips (PHI, 3-1, 4.39 ERA) vs. RHP Gavin Stone (LAD, 9-5, 3.63 ERA)\n\nNow, onto three things worth knowing.\n\n1. Both teams are cold\n\nAlthough, again, these are the two winningest teams in the National League, they've each been mired in a slump as of late. The Phillies, whose struggles we wrote about on Saturday, enter Monday with a 13-17 record in their last 30 games, tying them for the second-worst record in Major League Baseball during that stretch. The Dodgers haven't been much better, coming into Monday with a 13-14 mark since the start of July.\n\nThose recent slides have cast some doubt on what appeared to be certain division titles. The Phillies are now just six games up on the Atlanta Braves after having a 9 1/2 game lead as recently as July 27. The Dodgers, meanwhile, are 4 1/2 games up on the San Diego Padres after leading by 8 1/2 games heading into July 24.\n\nThe winner of this series, then, could come to view it as the moment they got back on the right path ahead of their eventual postseason berth.\n\n2. Phillies dominated first meeting\n\nThis week's encounter will serve as the second and final of the regular season between the Dodgers and the Phillies. Philadelphia hosted the initial three-game set in early July. The Phillies dominated that entanglement, sweeping the Dodgers and outscoring them by a 19-5 margin. (That's more than four runs per game, for those keeping track.)\n\nTo be fair, most of that damage came in the form of a 10-1 series-opening win. The Phillies' subsequent victories, by 4-3 and 5-1 scores, were more modest in nature. It's perhaps worth noting that just one of the Dodgers' starting pitchers from that series, right-hander Gavin Stone, is expected to get the nod against the Phillies this week. (The others, Bobby Miller and Anthony Banda, are either in the minors or the bullpen.)\n\n3. Slew of new faces\n\nBeyond the small-sample size element, there's another obvious reason not to read too much into that July series between these teams: both were active at the deadline.\n\nThe Phillies added outfielder Austin Hays and relievers Carlos Est\u00e9vez and Tanner Banks. The Dodgers, for their part, netted starter Jack Flaherty, reliever Michael Kopech, infielders Tommy Edman and Amed Rosario, and outfielder Kevin Kiermaier.\n\nEdman, who has not yet played this season, is supposedly nearing his activation. Add in the Dodgers' Nick Ahmed and Brent Honeywell Jr., and it's at least possible that 10 or 11 of the 52 players in attendance for this week's series were not with their respective organizations when the first series was played.\n\nWhich team will benefit more from all that turnover? We'll find out soon enough.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_j_anderson@cbssports.com", "name": "R.J.

Phillies", "body": "The Los Angeles Dodgers hosted the Philadelphia Phillies in a battle between two teams that have been scuffling as of late, but also the top-two clubs in the National League.\n\nBoth teams had one of their aces on the mound, with the Dodgers starting Tyler Glasnow while Aaron Nola went for the Phillies. However, it was the home run ball that proved to be the difference in the 5-3 victory for the Dodgers.\n\nThings started out poorly for the Dodgers when the Phillies took the lead in the second inning. Nick Castellanos tripled when Andy Pages misplayed a ball in center field, and he ended up scoring when Bryson Stott hit an infield single back to Glasnow.\n\nAnother single put runners on second and third before Glasnow made a wild pitch to make it a 2-0 Phillies' lead before he struck out Garrett Stubbs to end the inning.\n\nFrom there, Glasnow went on to pitch three perfect innings, along with a perfect first inning, before he ran into some trouble in the sixth inning. Kyle Schwarber hit a leadoff single before Bryce Harper doubled to put two on base, and the Phillies added another run on a groundout from Alec Bohm.\n\nGlasnow stopped the damage there, finishing his night with six innings pitched, allowing three runs on five hits with nine strikeouts and no walks.\n\nFor the Dodgers, they got on the board in the third inning with back-to-back doubles from Jason Heyward and Andy Pages against Aaron Nola. Nick Ahmed then singled to put runners at the corners with no one out.\n\nShohei Ohtani tied the game with a sacrifice fly before Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez hit his 24th homer of the season to put the Dodgers ahead 4-2.\n\nOhtani also added a home run in the bottom of the eighth inning to give the Dodgers some insurance, extending their lead to 5-3.\n\nMichael Kopech worked a perfect seventh while Anthony Banda picked up a hold in the eighth, escaping a jam with two runners on. Daniel Hudson picked up the save in the ninth.\n\nFreddie Freeman returns to Dodgers\n\nPrior to the game, Freddie Freeman was activated off the restricted list. He has been out since July 26 due to his son, Maximus, being in the hospital with a severe case of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a rare neurological disorder.\n\nFreeman addressed the media before the game with an emotional press conference detailing everything that has gone on over the past week and why he felt it was the right time to return now.\n\nFreeman was greeted by fans in his first at-bat with a loud and prolonged standing ovation as he acknowledged them by raising his hand and tapping his heart. Battling the emotions of the moment and with tears in his eyes, Freeman took a deep breath and stepped into the batter's box for his first at-bat back.\n\nHe ended up striking out, which was unsurprising after missing so much time, but in his next at-bat, Freeman roped a single into left field.", "source": {"uri": "dodgerblue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodger Blue"}, "authors":

Schwarber scored on Alec Bohm's RBI groundout, drawing the Phillies to 4-3.\n\nDodgers reliever Anthony Banda pitched a scoreless eighth, stranding Schwarber and Bohm.\n\nOhtani's 34th homer extended the Dodgers' lead to 5-3 leading off the bottom of the eighth. Center fielder Brandon Marsh made a futile leap at the wall as Ohtani circled back to first, apparently to make sure he had touched the base before completing his home run trot.\n\nThe Dodgers ended a four-game skid against the Phillies, which was their longest active such streak against any opponent. They were swept in three games in Philadelphia last month.\n\nWill Smith and Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez were the only Dodgers without a hit.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nPhillies: C Garrett Stubbs fouled a ball off his right shin in the fifth, but stayed in the game.\n\nDodgers: RHP Brusdar Graterol (right shoulder inflammation) was activated from the 60-day IL. ... RHP Blake Treinen (left hip discomfort) went on the IL. ... RHP Walker Buehler (hip) threw a bullpen session and will pitch for Triple-A Oklahoma City on Thursday before rejoining the team.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPhillies: LHP Cristopher S\u00e1nchez (7-7, 3.36 ERA) seeks his second career win against the Dodgers.\n\nDodgers: LHP Clayton Kershaw (0-1, 5.87) makes his third start of the season after lasting just 3 2/3 innings against San Diego last week. He's 4-6 with a 2.76 ERA in 17 career starts against the Phillies.\n\nDdddd\n\nPhiladelphiaABRHBIBBSOAvg.Schwarber dh311012.251Turner ss400001.308Harper 1b401003.276Bohm 3b401100.295Marsh cf400003.249Castellanos rf412001.240Stott 2b411100.241Hays lf402000.242Stubbs c400002.188Totals35382112\n\nLos AngelesABRHBIBBSOAvg.Ohtani dh312200.309T.Hern\u00e1ndez lf411200.267Freeman 1b401002.287Smith c400001.249Lux 2b302000.245K.Hern\u00e1ndez 3b300000.211Heyward rf311000.209Pages cf311101.241Ahmed ss311001.235Totals3059505\n\nPhiladelphia020001000_380Los Angeles00400001x_590\n\nLOB_Philadelphia 6, Los Angeles 2. 2B_Harper (24), Heyward (9), Pages (18), Lux (14), Ohtani (29). 3B_Castellanos (3).

Jason Heyward and Andy Pages opened the frame with back-to-back doubles for a run. An Ohtani sacrifice fly made it 2-2 before Hernandez hit a two-run home run down the left field line, his 24th of the season.\n\nThe Phillies pulled to within a run in the sixth inning when Alec Bohm's groundout scored Kyle Schwarber. Ohtani's leadoff home run in the eighth, his NL-leading 34th on the season, built a two-run Los Angeles cushion.\n\nDodgers relievers Michael Kopech and Anthony Banda followed Glasnow with a scoreless inning each, and Daniel Hudson pitched a scoreless ninth for his eighth save.\n\nFreeman received a standing ovation in advance of his at-bat in the first inning, and he waved to the crowd while tapping his chest in appreciation. He even appeared to wipe away a tear before striking out.

They also won a third consecutive game following a 10-day stumble when they were just 2-6. That run included five losses in six games to open a three-city road trip.\n\nFreeman did not play in any of those road games as he stayed by the side of his 3-year-old son through a bout with an autoimmune disorder that caused temporary paralysis and required intubation in order to breathe.\n\nFreeman had an emotional 30-minute press conference before Monday's game and fought back tears amid the crowd's support during his first at-bat, eventually striking out in the first inning.\n\nFreeman later singled in the third, immediately following a two-run home run from Hernandez that gave the Dodgers a 4-2 lead.\n\nAs his son Maximus began to improve in recent days, Freeman worked out at El Modena High School and was pleasantly surprised with what he felt was a competitive swing.\n\n\"Saturday, I went to my high school and I threw with my dad, I ran the bases and I hit on the field,\" said Freeman, who had a third-inning single. \"And then (Sunday) I did the same thing. And my body responded. I was OK. So that's why we (are here) today.\"\n\nThe Dodgers also used the weekend to regroup, earning a 10-0 victory at Oakland on Saturday night before leaning into the bullpen for a 3-2 victory over the A's on Sunday afternoon.\n\nLike the Dodgers, the Phillies also have struggled of late. Philadelphia looked every bit the best team in the NL when it rolled to a three-game home sweep over the Dodgers just before the All-Star break.\n\nBut the Phillies lost six consecutive games before pulling off a 6-0 road victory over the Seattle Mariners on Sunday. The Phillies entered with a 4-11 record since the break as they are in the midst of a 22-game streak against teams currently .500 or better.\n\nThe Phillies' offense did not have enough answers for Dodgers right-hander Tyler Glasnow, who gave up three runs while striking out nine in six innings, including strikeouts of all three batters in the first inning.\n\nGlasnow (9-6) now has a career-best 164 strikeouts this season, while tying his career best with his 21st start. In his previous outing, last Tuesday at San Diego, Glasnow set a career high in innings for a season.\n\nThe bullpen did the rest, with new addition Michael Kopech pitching a scoreless seventh inning and Anthony Banda doing the same in the eighth, including strikeouts of Bryce Harper and Brandon Marsh. Harper went 1 for 4 and struck out three times.\n\nAfter Ohtani hit his NL-leading 34th home run of the season in the eighth for a two-run lead, right-hander Daniel Hudson pitched a scoreless ninth for his eighth save.", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Orange County Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "doug_padilla@ocregister.com", "name": "Doug Padilla", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Glasnow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Glasnow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Banda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Banda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Harper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Harper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kopech", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Kopech"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24219117496103.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792122", "eventUri": "eng-9792122", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Gambling is not offered on this website in any form.\n\nIt's time to continue our MLB odds series with a Phillies-Dodgers prediction and pick. Find out how to watch Phillies-Dodgers.\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies and Los Angeles Dodgers have wobbled in recent weeks. The month of July and the start of August have not been good for them. Yet, these are still the two teams with the two best records in the National League. These are still the two teams most likely to get a bye in the first round of the playoffs while four other National League teams slug it out in the wild card series. These are still the two teams which, all other things being equal, are most likely to meet in the National League Championship Series. Yes, we know the history. We know that wild card teams have done really well in recent years to break up an NLCS battle of heavyweights. In most years, the Phillies have been that team, taking out the higher-seeded Atlanta Braves. This year, however, with the Phillies being likely to be the top seed in the National League, we're not nearly as sure which wild card team might rise up and become the spoiler. You might say that one wild card team will emerge, and that's actually a good prediction, but it gets a lot harder if you identify one specific wild card team and put it against the rest of the field. That's where we're not sure what will happen in the NL, and that's why Phillies-Dodgers is still a good bet for the NLCS.\n\nBoth teams have struggled, but this series is going to get the blood pumping. It's a possible October preview in August. Ya gotta love it.\n\nAaron Nola (11-4) has a 3.43 ERA. He's a workhorse, and with the Phillies' offense being so good for most of the year, Nola has won a ton of games. He will have some clunkers here and there, but for the most part, he's a guy the Phillies can count on to take the ball, go six innings, and not give up a big inning. What he did last week against the Yankees was generally representative of his season, and if that's what the Phillies get, they'll be okay with that. They won't be elated, but they'll be okay. Nola does have to walk fewer hitters and reduce traffic on the bases for Philadelphia to feel a little more comfortable with what Nola is providing. There is clearly room for improvement.\n\nLast Start: Tuesday, July 30 versus the New York Yankees: 5 2/3 IP, 7 H, 2 R, 1 HR, 3 BB, 4 K\n\n2024 Road Splits: 10 starts, 62 1/3 IP, 55 H, 25 R, 7 HR, 16 BB, 56 K\n\nTyler Glasnow (8-6) has a 3.50 ERA. He hasn't been as good as the Dodgers would like, but the one really important positive contribution Glasnow has made to the 2024 Dodgers is that he eats up innings. Look at the 11 home starts. Glasnow averages over six full innings per start. That has been a godsend for a team battered by injuries to the other starting pitchers in its rotation. An already overworked bullpen would have been far more exposed if Glasnow wasn't there to gobble up six-plus innings on a regular basis.\n\nLast Start: Tuesday, July 30 versus the San Diego Padres: 7 IP, 6 H, 3 R, 1 HR, 1 BB, 8 K\n\nTV: NBC Sports Philadelphia (Phillies) / SportsNet LA (Dodgers) / MLB Network\n\nThis team got back on track with Sunday's win over the Mariners. The Dodgers still won't have Freddie Freeman for this game in addition to Mookie Betts and Max Muncy. The Phils have more healthy and available players.\n\nWhy The Dodgers Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nTyler Glasnow can outduel Aaron Nola, and Shohei Ohtani can step up in what might be the biggest series of his career to date.\n\nFinal Phillies-Dodgers Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Phillies are the better team with healthier players.

They sat at 26 games above .500 with an eight-game lead in the division. They proceeded to sweep Los Angeles at home, which felt like a statement win, given that both teams are World Series contenders.\n\nThings have changed. Since sweeping that Dodgers series, the Phillies have gone 5-13. They've lost their last six series. They arrived to Dodger Stadium as a team ready to build some positive momentum, but on Monday night, in a 5-3 loss, they weren't able to get it.\n\nThe Phillies got to an early 2-0 lead in the second, but the Dodgers responded almost immediately. Nick Castellanos hit a two-out triple and Bryson Stott followed that up with an RBI single. Dodgers starter Tyler Glasnow threw a wild pitch to allow Stott to score from third.\n\nAfter cruising through his first two innings, Aaron Nola struggled in the third. He hung a number of curveballs and left his fastball up, and the Dodgers pounced on his mistakes. The right-handed starter allowed four earned runs -- an RBI double, a sacrifice fly, and a two-run home run -- but settled in after that. Nola allowed just two hits over his next three innings.\n\nThe Phillies didn't have their best offensive day -- combining for three runs on eight hits with 12 strikeouts -- but they did some little things right on the other side of the ball. Stott made a number of savvy defensive plays, including a sliding grab in the sixth that robbed Will Smith of an extra base hit. He ended the inning by catching a lineout that came off of Kik\u00e9 Hernandez's bat at 102.2 mph and landed right in Stott's glove.\n\nIn the bottom of the seventh, Alec Bohm made a nice barehanded play to throw Nick Ahmed out at first base. It prevented the Dodgers from starting any late game rallies.\n\n\" READ MORE: Phillies' Nick Castellanos sees results after making a situational adjustment to his batting stance\n\nUnfortunately for the Phillies, it was all for naught. They added one run in the sixth -- with an RBI groundout from Bohm -- but were unable to add any more from there. They tried to tack on in the eighth. Kyle Schwarber walked -- the first walk of the game, for both clubs -- but Trea Turner lined out and Bryce Harper struck out in the next two at-bats.\n\nBohm singled to move Schwarber to second, but Brandon Marsh struck out against left-handed reliever Anthony Banda to end the inning. Marsh entered the at-bat with four hits in his last five at-bats against left-handed pitching, and worked Banda to a 3-1 count, which should have been a walk. The fifth pitch of the at-bat was called a strike by home plate umpire Marvin Hudson, but was well above the zone, according to GameDay.\n\nMarsh swung at the next pitch, a slider outside, to give Banda the strikeout he was looking for.\n\nShohei Ohtani hit a changeup out over the plate for a home run to center field to give the Dodgers a 5-3 lead in the eighth. Reliever Tanner Banks induced a flyout, a strikeout and a fly out to curb any further damage. Nick Castellanos singled in the ninth, but Stott, Austin Hays and Garrett Stubbs went down 1-2-3 to end the game.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia

He missed over the middle with his fastball, hung a couple of breaking balls and the Dodgers made loud contact. A two-run advantage became a two-run deficit and the Dodgers led the rest of the way, beating the Phillies, 5-3.\n\nThere are still 50 games to play but this is an important three-game set with potentially long-term ramifications. The Phils have held the National League's top record all summer but are now just a half-game ahead of the Dodgers for home-field advantage throughout the National League playoffs.\n\nThere was no \"just another series\" talk pregame.\n\n\"It's a big series. It's the best record, could be,\" manager Rob Thomson said. \"Also head-to-head could be in effect. Certainly want to win this series.\"\n\nThe Phillies, with three wins already over the Dodgers, cannot lose the head-to-head tiebreaker. They'd win it with just one victory in L.A. this week. If the Dodgers sweep, the teams will have split the six meetings and the second tiebreaker -- record against teams in your league outside your division -- could come into play.\n\n\u00b7 8-7 loss to the Pirates after holding two different three-run leads\n\n\u00b7 7-2 loss to the Twins after scoring the first two runs\n\n\u00b7 3-1 loss to the Guardians on a silent offensive night\n\n\u00b7 5-3 loss to the Dodgers after scoring the first two runs\n\nMonday was the fifth time in 16 games since the All-Star break that the Phillies scored first but lost. They went 45-15 in the first half when taking the game's first lead and are just 4-5 since the break.\n\nThey appeared to create their own momentum in the top of the second when Nick Castellanos tripled off the wall in straightaway center with two outs and Bryson Stott followed by creating two runs with his legs. Stott beat out a chopper back to the mound, then aggressively took third base on a single to left field by Austin Hays, enabling Hays to advance to second. Stott scored and Hays moved up a base two pitches later when the NL's leader in wild pitches, Tyler Glasnow, uncorked one.\n\nGlasnow was sharp outside of that minor stumble. He retired 10 in a row after Hays' single and struck out nine over six innings. The Phillies did not seem to be able to distinguish the difference between his fastball and slider much of the night.\n\nTrea Turner, who was locked in for a solid month from mid-June through mid-July, is really scuffling. He went 0-for-4 Monday, striking out in his first two at-bats then stranding a runner with nobody out in the sixth and eighth innings of a tight game. Turner is 9-for-60 over his last 14 games, falling from .347 to .308.\n\nThe Phillies still haven't won two straight games since July 10-11 (against the Dodgers) and will need to do so to avoid their seventh straight series loss. It took them 93 games to lose their seventh series of the season, but a loss Tuesday night would make it seven more in the span of just 20 games.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breaking ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_Stott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryson Stott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Glasnow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Glasnow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Hays", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin Hays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Castellanos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Castellanos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trea_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trea Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild pitch"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnphilly.com/f935628678c18c82b1d968726f52b707", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9792122", "eventUri": "eng-9792122", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "dateEnd": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 2993, "textEnd": 3003}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Marsh then swung through an 86-mph slider for an inning-ending strikeout.\n\nShohei Ohtani provided an insurance run for a 5-3 lead in the bottom of the eighth with his NL-leading 34th homer, a towering 384-foot shot to left-center field that didn't clear the glove of Marsh until Ohtani was halfway to second base.\n\nThinking he might have missed first base, Ohtani retreated to the bag and touched it before continuing his home-run trot.\n\nDaniel Hudson gave up a leadoff single in the ninth before retiring three straight batters for his eighth save, as the Dodgers extended their modest win streak to three and pushed their division lead over Arizona and San Diego to five games.\n\nGlasnow retired the side in order in four of the first five innings and was one out away from a one-two-three second when Nick Castellanos lofted a catchable two-out fly ball that center fielder Andy Pages missed with a lunge at the wall, the play ruled a triple.\n\nBryson Stott scored Castellanos with an infield single, took third on Austin Hays' single to left and scored on a Glasnow wild pitch for a 2-0 Phillies lead.\n\nBut the Dodgers answered with a four-run, five-hit rally off Philadelphia right-hander Austin Nola in the third, an inning that Jason Heyward and Andy Pages opened with back-to-back doubles for a run.\n\nNick Ahmed reached on an infield single to put runners on first and third for Ohtani, who drove a sacrifice fly to the wall in right for a 2-2 tie. Hern\u00e1ndez then jumped on a first-pitch curve, sending a 113-mph laser 390 feet over the left-field wall for his 24th homer of the season and a 4-2 lead.\n\nThe Phillies pulled to within 4-3 in the sixth when Schwarber led off with a single to right, took third on Harper's one-out opposite-field double to left and scored on Bohm's groundout to second. But Glasnow got Marsh to fly to left, ending the inning.\n\nIt was an emotional afternoon and evening for Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman, who returned to the team after an eight-game absence while his 3-year-old son, Maximus, fought a rare neurological disorder that temporarily paralyzed him and sent him to a pediatric intensive care unit for eight days.\n\nMax came home from Children's Hospital of Orange County on Saturday after responding favorably to treatments for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a rare condition in which the body's immune system attacks the nerves, and his prognosis for a full recovery appears good.\n\nFreeman fought back tears as he recounted Max's harrowing ordeal during a 30-minute pregame news conference, and before his first at-bat in the first inning, he received a rousing 45-second standing ovation, during which Freeman doffed his batting helmet and tapped his heart in appreciation.\n\n\"It's obviously great to have Freddie back,\" manager Dave Roberts said before the game. \"Judging by that press conference, he has a heavy heart. I think there's a lot of relief in the sense of where Max is at right now, being back home. He's back to being able to do what he loves to do, and that's play baseball.\"\n\nFreeman struck out in the first inning, singled in the third, grounded out in the fifth and struck out in the eighth.\n\nShort hops\n\nReliever Brusdar Graterol, a hard-throwing right-hander who has been out all season because of a shoulder injury, was activated from the 60-day injured list before Monday night's game, and right-hander Blake Treinen was placed on the IL because of left hip discomfort. ... Shortstop Miguel Rojas, out since July 22 because of right-forearm tightness, will be activated \"in the next couple of days,\" Roberts said. ... Walker Buehler, whose return from a second Tommy John surgery was interrupted by a right-hip injury, threw a bullpen session on Monday and is scheduled to resume his rehab assignment with triple-A Oklahoma City on Thursday. ... Utility man Cavan Biggio, who hit .192 with three homers and 10 RBIs in 30 games for the Dodgers, was designated for assignment to clear a roster spot for Freeman.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com",

It's the second game of a three-game set. Keep reading for our Phillies vs. Dodgers betting prediction.\n\nCan the Phillies win the game outright as money-line road underdogs?\n\nProjected starting pitchers: Cristopher Sanchez (PHI) vs. Clayton Kershaw (LAD)\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies are 66-46 straight up this year. Philadelphia is 2-8 straight up in their last 10 games. Phillies are 56-56 ATS this season.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are 66-47 straight up this year. Los Angeles is 4-6 straight up in their last 10 games. The Dodgers are 55-58 ATS this season.\n\n961 Philadelphia Phillies (-105) at 962 Los Angeles Dodgers (-113); o/u 8.5\n\nOur MLB Public Betting Information page indicates that 63% of public bettors are currently backing the Dodgers money line. Please note that these numbers are subject to change all the way up to game time, so be sure to check the link to ensure that you're receiving the most up-to-date public betting data.\n\nPhillies right fielder Nick Castellanos had 25% of his team's hits in their 5-3 loss to the Dodgers on Monday night. In that contest, the former Tiger went 2 for 4 with a run scored. For the season, Castellanos is batting .237 with 15 homers, 57 RBIs, and a .691 OPS across 460 plate appearances. Against current active Dodgers pitchers, the 6'4\" right-handed hitter is batting .333 with a .914 OPS across 48 at-bats. That fact could make Nick Castellanos worthy of DFS consideration on Tuesday.\n\nDodgers designated hitter Shohei Ohtani had a big day at the dish in his club's 5-3 win over the Phillies on Monday. In that contest, Ohtani hit leadoff and went 2 for 3 with a double, a homer, 2 RBIs, a stolen base, and a run scored. For the season, the two-time AL MVP is slashing a ridiculous .309/.397/.631 with 34 homers, 81 RBIs, and 32 stolen bases on the campaign. Ohtani is hitting .316 with an OPS of 1.087 at home this season, making him potentially worth the high price tag in DFS on Tuesday.\n\nPhiladelphia is an MLB-best 29-16 straight up after a loss this season.\n\nPhiladelphia is 56-41 straight up when playing on no rest this season.\n\nLos Angeles is 2-5 straight up in their last 7 games against Philadelphia.\n\nLos Angeles is 4-5 straight up in their last 9 games overall.\n\nDodgers starter Clayton Kershaw is in a tough spot here. The veteran lefty missed most of this season after having left shoulder surgery in the offseason in November. He's only made 2 starts in 2024 and the results have been suboptimal, to say the least. In those 2 starts, Clayton Kershaw is 0-2 with a 5.87 ERA, a 1.96 WHIP, a K/9 of 7.0 (which would be a career-low), and an opponent batting average of .324.\n\nThe future Hall-of-Famer is 36 years old and had to pause his rehab due to shoulder soreness that re-emerged before he ultimately took the mound on July 25th for his first start of 2024. On top of all that, active Phillies hitters are batting .292 with a .789 OPS in 96 career at-bats against the big Texan. I think the Phillies get to Clayton Kershaw and bounce back here. I'm taking Philly on the money line on the road in L.A. on Tuesday night.", "source": {"uri": "thespread.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheSpread.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Dodgers had other plans, taking it to the Phillies 5-3.\n\nNola's Night to Forget\n\nDespite August statistically being the best month for Aaron Nola (11-5, 3.54 ERA) throughout his career, his first start of August this season was one to forget.\n\nNola did not have the stuff that the Phillies have come to expect from Nola in Monday's game, allowing four runs on eight hits and no walks while only striking out four in six innings.\n\nAll of the damage to Nola would come in the third, which started with a double, a double, a single, a sacrifice fly, and a home run, accounting for all four of the runs Nola allowed.\n\nWhile the third inning was his worst, he allowed hard contact throughout the night, with an average exit velocity of 97.2. The defense behind Nola stepped up in a huge way and helped keep the game in reach.\n\nWPA Leader of the Night\n\nMonday's WPA leader of the night is Dodgers' left fielder Teoscar Hernandez. After the Phillies jumped out to an early 2-0 lead in the second, Teoscar's home run in the third would give the Dodgers a lead they would not relinquish.\n\nHis only hit of the night, Teoscar would get every bit of a first pitch knuckle curve from Nola, pulling it into left field at 112.9 MPH, and putting the Dodgers up 4-2. It was the 24th home run of the season for Teoscar, who would finish the night going 1-for-4 with two RBI, the home run, and a 13.8 WPA.\n\nNext Up\n\nNext up for the Phillies is game two of this three game mid-week set on Tuesday. The first pitch for Tuesday's game is scheduled for 10:10 PM EST. The game will be broadcast nationally on MLB Network (out-of-market only) as well as NBC Sports Philadelphia and SportsNet LA.

Los Angeles matched that total on Monday night and held on to beat the Phillies 5-3 in the battle of National League division leaders at Dodger Stadium.\n\nAaron Nola handcuffed the Dodgers back in Philadelphia, striking out nine in six innings of one-run ball on July 11. But they got to him with four runs in the second inning on Monday, thanks to back-to-back doubles by Jason Heyward and Andy Pages plus an infield single by Nick Ahmed before Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez gave the Dodgers the lead with a two-run home run to left field.\n\nTyler Glasnow struck out nine of his first 15 batters faced, which was needed because some of the balls in play were an adventure.\n\nPages misread a drive to center that fell for a Nick Castellanos triple with two outs in the second. Bryson Stott beat out a ball that bounced high off the plate on a play that was simultaneously a great ready by Castellanos to dash home on the throw and also Glasnow not seeing how far Castellanos was off third base. That brought home the first run, then Hern\u00e1ndez took a long time getting the ball in on a single to left, allowing Austin Hays and Stott second and third base. A wild pitch scored Stott for the second run of the inning.\n\nAfter the Dodgers took the lead, Glasnow allowed one more run, thanks in part to a fisted double the other way by Bryce Harper by a shifted infield.\n\nGlasnow didn't add any strikeouts after the fourth inning, but he got through six innings with those nine strikeouts, setting a career high for a season in the process with 164, two more than last season with Tampa Bay. Glasnow pitched his second quality start in a row, giving the Dodgers three in their last six games, a good step on a path back to normalcy for a rotation that desperately needed it.\n\nMichael Kopech got the seventh and pitched his third scoreless inning in three tries since joining his new team.\n\nAnthony Banda, who saved Sunday's game in Oakland, got the ball with a one-run lead in the eighth on Monday, a frame interspersed with left-handed batters atop the Phillies lineup. Banda allowed a walk and a single in the inning, but navigated the tightrope successfully, striking out lefties Bryce Harper and Brandon Marsh for his final two outs of the frame.\n\nShohei Ohtani provided some insurance in the bottom of the eighth with his 34th home run of the season, giving Daniel Hudson more wiggle room in the ninth. He didn't need it, stranding a leadoff single to close out the win, the third straight for the Dodgers.\n\nFreddie Freeman singled once in his four at-bats in his first game back since his son was released from the hospital. Freeman got a nice, long standing ovation before his first at-bat.\n\nClayton Kershaw takes the ball on Tuesday night (7:10 p.m.; SportsNet LA, MLB Network), following up the first zero-strikeout regular season start of his career.

It's easy to miss. The Phillies, 112 games into this season, are not discussing the standings. They don't need to know the exact numbers to understand this week in Southern California is another barometer.\n\nBut the manager is aware of the significance.\n\n\"It's a big series,\" Rob Thomson said. \"It's best record -- could be. Also, head-to-head could be in effect. So, certainly want to win this series.\"\n\nWinning the series would be great for a Phillies team that needs something to go right. Just winning one game against the Dodgers this week is paramount; that would hand the Phillies the tiebreaker for home-field advantage if the two teams are tied at the end of the season and somehow meet in the National League Championship Series.\n\nRight now, after a 5-3 Phillies loss for their 14th defeat in 19 games, that feels light-years away.\n\n\"We got two months left in the season,\" Aaron Nola said. \"We're honestly just focusing on winning. We're not really looking at the standings. If you look at the standings, you get caught up in that instead of winning baseball games.\"\n\nThe Phillies were 6 1/2 games ahead of Los Angeles after last month's sweep at Citizens Bank Park. Now, they are a mere half-game in front.\n\nThis is the current state of things: Brandon Marsh takes a pitch that should have been ball four to load the bases in the eighth. Instead, it's called a strike. He whiffs at the next pitch for strike three. Then, in the bottom half of the inning, Shohei Ohtani launches a solo homer to center. Nick Castellanos begins the ninth with an eight-pitch at-bat that results in a single to right. The tying run comes to the plate ... and the next three Phillies hitters are retired on three pitches. Three popouts.\n\nThe end.\n\n\"I think we're grinding right now,\" Castellanos said. \"We're just in a funk. But I will say our dugout was very good today. All our attention, I think, was more on the field than it was on our iPads. We were more in the competition. It was a good baseball game, right? Couple things here, a couple things there, and it changes. But I feel like they beat us today. We didn't beat ourselves.\"\n\nThat platitude won't make any motivational posters, but the point is fair. Except for Tyler Phillips' implosion over the weekend in Seattle, the Phillies have been competitive in five of the last six games. They have won only once. Thomson has refused to deviate from how he's handled things, including letting backup catcher Garrett Stubbs hit Monday night with two outs in the ninth. He could have used J.T. Realmuto there. Maybe it would not have mattered.\n\n\"You think about it,\" Thomson said. \"Sure. But I still want to keep him healthy and give him a day.\"\n\nThe Phillies have always prioritized the bigger picture, and those decisions were easier to make (and justify) when the club soared. There will be harder choices to make if the losing continues.\n\nA lot begins and ends with the rotation. The Phillies have won 28 straight games in which their starter has logged seven innings. Nola fell short of that Monday; he was decent in his six innings except for one. He hung too many curveballs in the third inning. The Dodgers scored four runs.\n\nThe inning began with three consecutive hits from the bottom three hitters in Los Angeles' lineup. That continued a confounding trend for Nola. The No. 7-9 hitters in opposing lineups have hit .323 with an .889 OPS against Nola in 2024. Only Cleveland's Carlos Carrasco has permitted a higher OPS to the bottom three hitters he's faced.\n\nThe bottom of the order hurt Nola last season to a .273 average and .786 OPS. It's even worse in 2024.\n\nHe has a 3.54 ERA in 142 1/3 innings.\n\n\"I missed spots,\" Nola said. \"The doubles hurt me. They've hurt me the past few games. Especially leadoff doubles. I haven't had too many 1-2-3 innings. And that's hurt. I feel like fastball command was off tonight. Curveball, I threw some hanging ones in the third inning and they capitalized on it.\"\n\nThe Phillies are exploring ways to keep the rotation fresh and effective. Ranger Su\u00e1rez threw a bullpen session Monday and it went fine. He'll probably throw another bullpen session Thursday in Arizona, then face hitters in a simulated situation when the team returns home. That could put him back in the Phillies' rotation two weekends from now. Su\u00e1rez has not reported any lingering back pain; the Phillies have applied caution to his situation. They are, in essence, managing his innings with this break.\n\nThe Phillies would like Taijuan Walker to pitch the final game of this trip on Sunday in Arizona, and that will depend on how he feels after a minor-league rehab start Tuesday for Triple-A Lehigh Valley. They are not expecting miracles from the veteran righty. But he could provide a more stable presence at the back of the rotation. His return, coupled with Su\u00e1rez's reemergence, would open the door to a six-man rotation.\n\nIn the immediate scenario, Walker pitching Sunday can pad Cristopher S\u00e1nchez, who pitches Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium, with two extra days before his next outing. The Phillies are going to monitor S\u00e1nchez's workload. That doesn't mean shutting him down.\n\nIf Walker returns Sunday, the Phillies can rearrange the rotation. They might want to split Zack Wheeler and Nola -- at least for a few weeks. They tend to pitch deep into games and it might be better to more evenly spread the bullpen innings.\n\nThese are secondary concerns if the Phillies keep losing. The standings are right there for everyone in the clubhouse to see.\n\n\"No, I'm not aware of the standings,\" Castellanos said. \"I can't speak on behalf of the team. The way I go about it is that tomorrow we have a baseball game. And, if we do the best we can to prepare, that puts us in the best position to win. If we win tomorrow, that's a good thing.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_gelb@nytimes.com", "name": "Matt Gelb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Nola", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Nola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Thomson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rob Thomson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Marsh_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Marsh (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Castellanos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Castellanos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_Bank_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizens Bank Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garrett_Stubbs", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Garrett Stubbs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._T._Realmuto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

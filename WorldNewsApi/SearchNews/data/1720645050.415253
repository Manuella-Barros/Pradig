The panel referred to the facts and law on the matter and found no merit in the writ petition. The panel, speaking through the Chief Justice, pointed out that even according to the petitioner, the land was not in the FTL, and signatures and undertakings of the petitioner may reveal that fraud was an afterthought, and the petitioner did not warrant interference.

Tukaramji of the Telangana High Court permitted withdrawal of a criminal petition filed by a SI from Bhadrachalam town police station, who is accused of demanding and accepting a bribe of `20,000.

With the All India Congress Committee (AICC) leadership cosying up to the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in a bid to unite the Opposition against the BJP in Parliament and outside, state Congress leaders have been left with little elbow room after having allied with the CPI(M)-led Left Front for several years. The CPI(M), in particular, has maintained its staunch opposition to the TMC. On Thursday, senior Congress leader and ex-Union minister P Chidambaram came to Kolkata to meet TMC supremo and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at the state secretariat, Nabanna. TMC sources said the two leaders discussed how the Congress and the TMC\u2014 two of the largest Opposition parties \u2014 can coordinate their moves and strategies to take on the ruling BJP-led NDA government during the upcoming Parliament session. The first session of the 18th Lok Sabha is set to get underway on June 24. Apart from the Congress, the TMC and the CPI(M) are major constituents of the Opposition INDIA alliance at the national level. On Friday, at a closed-door meeting the extended state committee of the Bengal Congress reviewed the party's debacle in the state in the recent Lok Sabha polls, in which it fought against both the TMC and the BJP, while striking an alliance with the Left Front. While the Congress managed to increase its vote share marginally, as compared to the 2021 Assembly elections and the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, the number of its seats dipped to one from two in 2019. A majority of the leaders who were present at the meeting said that the party should go alone in the polls in the state, fighting not only the BJP but also the TMC, sources said. They even said that while the alliance with the Left could increase the party's vote share, this would not benefit it in the long run. A senior Congress leader said, \u201cWe are not saying that we need to fight against the CPI(M) too, but at least we shouldn\u2019t form an alliance with the CPI(M) or the LF. That won\u2019t benefit the Congress in the long run. We have to understand that a substantial number of people in the state can\u2019t accept the Left Front till date because of its 34-year-rule here. Why should we bear their burden of 34 years?\u201d However, all the state Congress leaders, including \u201cinterim\u201d West Bengal Pradesh Congress Committee (WBPCC) president Adhir Chowdhury, who was the party\u2019s leader in the previous Lok Sabha, chose to remain silent on the issue in public. Chowdhury, whose position within the party has weakened considerably after he lost his pocket borough of Berhampore to the TMC\u2019s Yusuf Pathan in the Lok Sabha polls, however sought to explain why he opposed the TMC in the state. TMC leader and state minister Firhad Hakim said, \u201cWe too were once in the Congress, and had fought the CPI(M) together. Mamata Banerjee left the Congress and formed the TMC to fight them alone. The Congress lost its credentials in the state because in those days, people had more faith in Mamata Banerjee to lead the movement against the CPI(M) than in the Congress. Now, after they made an alliance with the CPI(M), Bengal has lost its faith in the Congress. To revive that faith, they should unconditionally align with Mamata Banerjee. That\u2019s the only way the Congress can be revived in this state.\u201d Responding to these developments, CPI(M) leader Sujan Chakraborty said, \u201cWhat the Congress does will be decided by its leaders in the state and at the Centre. We have nothing to say.\u201d BJP leader Samik Bhattacharya said, \u201cThe Congress has become a \u2018signboard party\u2019 in the state. It has no prospects here.\u201d", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/congress-left-ties-on-the-line-as-aicc-plays-ball-with-tmc-to-corner-bjp-9409392/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/mamata-chidambaram.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:57:39", "author": "Atri Mitra", "authors": ["Atri Mitra"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.282}

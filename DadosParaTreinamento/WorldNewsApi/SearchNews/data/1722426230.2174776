He struggled to explain what he would accomplish in a second term. He struggled to respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s provocations. He struggled to hold Mr. Trump accountable for his lies, his failures and his chilling plans. More than once, he struggled to make it to the end of a sentence,\u201d the board wrote in an opinion piece published yesterday. According to the Board, \u201cThe greatest public service Mr. Biden can now perform is to announce that he will not continue to run for re-election. As it stands, the president is engaged in a reckless gamble. There are Democratic leaders better equipped to present clear, compelling and energetic alternatives to a second Trump presidency. \u201cThere is no reason for the party to risk the stability and security of the country by forcing voters to choose between Mr. Trump\u2019s deficiencies and those of Mr. Biden. It\u2019s too big a bet to simply hope Americans will overlook or discount Mr. Biden\u2019s age and infirmity that they see with their own eyes.\u201dThe board went on to say it would still support Biden as its \u201cunequivocal pick\u201d if the choice remains between him and former President Donald Trump.The Biden campaign however, hit back at the editorial board\u2019s critique.\u201cThe last time Joe Biden lost the New York Times editorial board\u2019s endorsement, it turned out pretty well for him,\u201d Biden campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond told CNN. The Times endorsed two Democratic presidential candidates in 2020: Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren.The New York Times was the latest to critique Biden\u2019s debate performance, which has set off alarm bells among top Democrats \u2014 leaving some to openly question whether Biden can stay atop of the Democratic ticket.\u201cHe seemed a little disoriented. He did get stronger as the debate went on. But by that time, I think the panic had set in,\u201d longtime Democratic operative and CNN senior political commentator David Axelrod said.Axelrod also gave voice to a conversation happening among many Democrats on Thursday night: \u201cThere are going to be discussions about whether he should continue.\u201d On MSNBC, the cable news channel that\u2019s seen as the home to the country\u2019s progressive political wing, anchor Alex Wagner said Thursday immediately following the debate that there had \u201cbeen a uniformly negative reaction to Biden\u2019s performance tonight.\u201d\u201cThis was about revealing who Donald Trump was, but it was also Joe Biden battling a caricature of himself as an enfeebled person,\u201d Wagner said of the debate. \u201cAnd he did nothing to disabuse, I think, the country of the notion that he is very old and was lost frequently in that debate.\u201d A raspy and sometimes halting Biden tried repeatedly to confront Trump, as his Republican rival countered the president\u2019s criticism by leaning into falsehoods about the economy, illegal immigration and his role in the January 6 2021 Capitol insurrection.Biden\u2019s uneven performance, particularly early in the debate, crystallised the concerns of many Americans that, at 81, he was too old to serve as president, according to the Associated Press. Biden\u2019s delivery from the beginning of the debate drew the most attention afterwards. Trump\u2019s allies immediately declared victory, while prominent Democrats publicly questioned whether Biden could move forward.Vice President Kamala Harris, speaking on CNN afterwards, sought to defend the president\u2019s performance while acknowledging the criticism.\u201cThere was a slow start, but there was a strong finish,\u201d she said. Asked about his performance in the debate, Biden told reporters early yesterday, that \u201cI think we did well\u201d, but said he had a \u201csore throat.\u201dPressed about Democratic concerns with his showing that he should consider stepping aside, Biden said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s hard to debate a liar.\u201dFormer President Barack Obama, yesterday, weighed in on Biden\u2018s dismal debate performance, in a post on his official X (formerly Twitter) handle.\u201cBad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know. But this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself. Between someone who tells the truth; who knows right from wrong and will give it to the American people straight \u2014 and someone who lies through his teeth for his own benefit. Last night didn\u2019t change that, and it\u2019s why so much is at stake in November,\u201d he wrote. Meanwhile, at a campaign rally at Raleigh, North Carolina, yesterday, Biden forcefully tried to quell Democratic anxieties over his unsteady showing at the debate.Acknowledging the criticism, the US president said, \u201dI don\u2019t debate as well as I used to,\u201d adding, \u201cI know how to do this job. I know how to get things done.\u201dSpeaking for 18 minutes, Biden appeared far more animated than his showing the night before, and he excoriated Trump for his \u201clies\u201d and campaign aimed at \u201crevenge and retribution.\u201d \u201cI know I\u2019m not a young man, to state the obvious,\u201d Mr. Biden told the enthusiastic crowd. \u201cI don\u2019t speak as smoothly as I used to. I don\u2019t debate as well as I used to. But I know what I know. I know how to tell the truth. I know how to do this job,\u201d he added.Even as Democratic leaders pledged confidence in Biden yesterday, pundits and political strategists openly expressed doubt in his ability to see the election through, in some cases calling for him to make way for a new nominee, the New York Times reported. Indeed, the only way for Democrats to replace Biden is for him to step aside and surrender the delegates pledged to him. At this point in the race, his replacement would be decided on the floor of the Democratic National Convention in August.The debate buoyed the spirits of Trump and his allies, as did the Supreme Court ruling yesterday, that prosecutors had overstepped in their use of an obstruction charge against a member of mob that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump, whose own case could be affected by the ruling, called it \u201ca big win\u201d in a post online.During the Thursday night debate, Trump argued that the president\u2019s policies had left the U.S.-Mexico border wide open, allowing crime and drugs to flow into cities and converting every state into a border state. \u201cWe are living right now in a rat\u2019s nest,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re killing our people in New York, in California, in every state in the union because we don\u2019t have borders anymore.\u201d It was one of many statements by Mr. Trump that were either false, lacked context or were vague enough to be misleading. Biden, meanwhile, did not define any broader strategy on an issue that has become one of his party\u2019s most nagging political vulnerabilities. He also did not counter what many historians see as rhetoric about immigrants that could fuel violence. The president\u2019s most forceful defense of undocumented immigrants came more than an hour into the debate, when he suggested that they were a \u201creason why we had the most successful economy in the world.\u201d Ten minutes into the first topic of discussion \u2014 the economy \u2014 Trump argued that the only jobs Biden had \u201ccreated are for illegal immigrants.\u201d A few minutes later, on the issue of abortion, Biden appeared to try to make a point about how Trump pays attention to the murders of young women by immigrants, but not women killed by stringent abortion restrictions. But he mangled his delivery. Mr. Trump, in response, decried the \u201cmany young women murdered by the same people he allows to come across our border.\u201d", "summary": "*New York Times editorial board advises US president to step aside\u00a0 *Bad debate nights happen, says Obama Sunday Ehigiator with agency report The New York Times Editorial Board has called", "url": "https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2024/06/29/calls-mount-for-joe-biden-to-quit-presidential-race-after-debate-fumble/", "image": "https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/2022/02/f15e7f8e-this-day-live-logo.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:33:29", "author": "Andrew Caballero,Ayo Yusuf", "authors": ["Andrew Caballero", "Ayo Yusuf"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ng", "sentiment": -0.019}

I was able to attack some pins that maybe if I wasn't in such a good spot, I wouldn't have been able to. \"\n\nRobert MacIntyre of Scotland had a 64 in the afternoon. Ryan Palmer opened with a 65, and two-time Canadian Open champion Rory McIlroy was another shot back with Ryan Fox, Andrew Novak, Erik van Rooyen, Nick Hardy and Trace Crowe.\n\nAlso Read | French Open 2024: Alexander Zverev Fends Off David Goffin To Seal Spot in Third Round of Roland Garros.\n\nDefending champion Nick Taylor shot a 72, playing alongside fellow Canadian Taylor Pendrith and McIlroy. Last year at Oakdale in Toronto, Taylor made an 80-foot eagle putt in a playoff to become the first Canadian to win the event since 1954.\n\n\"Usually the morning round for me on a Thursday there's not that many people there,\" Taylor said. \"The energy was high, which was great, gets the adrenaline going, which is fun that early in the morning, gets you focused on what you need to do. Unfortunately, it didn't go my way, but the crowds have been amazing.\"\n\nMcIlroy won the Canadian Open in 2019 the last time it was in Hamilton and again in 2022 at St. George's in Toronto.\n\n\"One of the main reasons I love coming back here is because of that atmosphere,\" McIlroy said. \"Playing with two Canadians today, it was exactly what I expected.\"\n\nPendrith opened with a 72.\n\n\"We had fun,\" Pendrith said. \"Rory played, scored, really nicely. It was fun to play with Nick.\"\n\nSkinns is a former Canadian tour player.\n\n\"I had a couple of great years up here.\" Skinns said. \"It's one of my favorite countries to come visit. I've seen it from West Coast to East Coast and kind of loved every part of it.\"\n\nSkinns birdied the par-4 12th -- hitting a wedge from 104 yards to 4 feet -- and began his big run on the par-5 17th. He followed with a 189-yard shot to 2 1/2 feet on the par-4 18th and made a 14-footer on the par-4 first. He holed a 35-footer on the par-4 third and added birdies on the par-5 fourth and and par-4 sixth.\n\n\"The golf up here is pretty cool,\" Skinns said. \"The bentgrass and the way this golf course looks, it's one of the best looking courses I've seen. Definitely, a joy to be back.\"\n\nBurns eagled the par-5 17th and fourth.\n\n\"I think with all the rain we had early in the week the greens are still pretty receptive,\" Burns said. \"It makes a big difference on par-5s when you have a long iron or a wood coming in there to be able to stop the ball pretty quick.\"\n\nDavid Hearn was the low Canadian after a 67.\n\n\"Hey, how about that?\" the 44-year-old Hearn said. \"Maybe experience still has something.\"\n\nFifty-four-year-old Mike Weir shot 68.

MacIntyre shot a 6-under 64 to take sole possession of fourth after 18 holes.\n\nEven as Skinns and MacIntyre fired bogey-free rounds, the gallery following them was relatively small as many fans had left following the morning start of Taylor, Pendrith and McIlroy.\n\nSam Burns tees off on the seventh hole during the Canadian Open in Hamilton, Ont., May 30, 2024. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Nathan Denette\n\nTaylor and Pendrith, from Richmond Hill, Ont., are the top two Canadians on the PGA Tour, ranked 32 and 33 on the FedEx Cup standings respectively. Taylor is also very much the face of the event after he became the first Canadian to win the men's national golf championship in nearly seven decades at last year's tournament.\n\n\"There was definitely more people watching us than the last time I played the Canadian Open,\" said Pendrith. \"We had fun. Rory played, scored, really nicely. It was fun to play with Nick.\n\n\"It was a comfortable pairing and it was fun to have the support of the home crowd and should be good tomorrow.\"\n\nCanadian golfer Nick Taylor hits his approach on the ninth hole during the Canadian Open pro-am in Hamilton, Ont., May 29, 2024. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Nathan Denette\n\nMcIlroy, who won the Canadian Open in 2019 the last time it was in Hamilton and again in Toronto in 2022, did the best of the marquee trio. He finished the day tied for fourth at 4-under 66.\n\nThe Northern Irishman, fourth on the FedEx Cup rankings, said he was impressed with all the spectators who were at the 10th tee when his group teed off at 7:40 a.m.\n\n\"The Canadian fans came out to support them,\" said McIlroy of Taylor and Pendrith. \"One of the main reasons I love coming back here is because of that atmosphere that's created when we're out there to play, and playing with two Canadians today was, it was exactly what I expected.\"\n\nPendrith had a 1-under 69 round to finish the day tied for 33rd.\n\nTaylor finished his day at 2-over 72, good for 96th. He took heart from the fact that he opened last year's Canadian Open at Toronto's Oakdale Golf and Country Club with a 3-over 75 round, made the cut, and went on to win in a thrilling four-hole playoff.\n\n\"I guess I beat last year by three, so I got that going for me,\" said Taylor. \"Obviously not out of it. I know that but personally, I would have liked to have got off to a better start.\n\n\"Again, the score is out there, the greens are soft, they're receptive, just need to be a little sharper.\"\n\nO'Hair played bogey-free golf with five birdies and an eagle and Burns had a bogey, four birdies, and two eagles as they built a three-shot lead in the morning.\n\n\"I think with all the rain we had early in the week the greens are still pretty receptive,\" said Burns after coming off the course at Hamilton Golf and Country Club. \"It makes a big difference on par-5s when you have a long iron or a wood coming in there to be able to stop the ball pretty quick.\"\n\nDespite drawing the big crowds, Taylor and Pendrith weren't even the low Canadians.\n\nForty-four-year-old David Hearn from nearby Brantford, Ont., was the low Canadian. He was tied for 11th at 3-under 67. Fifty-four-year-old Mike Weir of Brights Grove, Ont., was a shot behind Hearn to sit in a group tied for 20th.\n\n\"Hey, how about that?

The 41-year-old Englishman was a stroke ahead of morning starters Sam Burns and Sean O'Hair.\n\n\"Drove it pretty well.

Ryan Palmer opened with a 65, and two-time Canadian Open champion Rory McIlroy was another shot back with Ryan Fox, Andrew Novak, Erik van Rooyen, Nick Hardy and Trace Crowe.\n\nDefending champion Nick Taylor shot a 72, playing alongside fellow Canadian Taylor Pendrith and McIlroy. Last year at Oakdale in Toronto, Taylor made an 80-foot eagle putt in a playoff to become the first Canadian to win the event since 1954.\n\n\"Usually the morning round for me on a Thursday there's not that many people there,\" Taylor said. \"The energy was high, which was great, gets the adrenaline going, which is fun that early in the morning, gets you focused on what you need to do.

It was fun to play with Nick.\"\n\nSkinns is a former Canadian tour player.\n\n\"I had a couple of great years up here.\" Skinns said. \"It's one of my favorite countries to come visit. I've seen it from West Coast to East Coast and kind of loved every part of it.\"\n\nSkinns birdied the par-4 12th -- hitting a wedge from 104 yards to 4 feet -- and began his big run on the par-5 17th. He followed with a 189-yard shot to 2 1/2 feet on the par-4 18th and made a 14-footer on the par-4 first. He holed a 35-footer on the par-4 third and added birdies on the par-5 fourth and and par-4 sixth.\n\n\"The golf up here is pretty cool,\" Skinns said. \"The bentgrass and the way this golf course looks, it's one of the best looking courses I've seen. Definitely, a joy to be back.\"\n\nBurns eagled the par-5 17th and fourth.\n\n\"I think with all the rain we had early in the week the greens are still pretty receptive,\" Burns said. \"It makes a big difference on par-5s when you have a long iron or a wood coming in there to be able to stop the ball pretty quick.\"\n\nDavid Hearn was the low Canadian after a 67.\n\n\"Hey, how about that?\" the 44-year-old Hearn said. \"Maybe experience still has something.\"\n\nFifty-four-year-old Mike Weir shot 68.\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com",

MacIntyre shot a 6-under 64 to take sole possession of fourth after 18 holes.\n\nEven as Skinns and MacIntyre fired bogey-free rounds, the gallery following them was relatively small as many fans had left following the morning start of Taylor, Pendrith and McIlroy.\n\nTaylor and Pendrith, from Richmond Hill, Ont., are the top two Canadians on the PGA Tour, ranked 32 and 33 on the FedEx Cup standings respectively. Taylor is also very much the face of the event after he became the first Canadian to win the men's national golf championship in nearly seven decades at last year's tournament.\n\n\"There was definitely more people watching us than the last time I played the Canadian Open,\" said Pendrith. \"We had fun. Rory played, scored, really nicely. It was fun to play with Nick.\n\n\"It was a comfortable pairing and it was fun to have the support of the home crowd and should be good tomorrow.\"\n\nMcIlroy, who won the Canadian Open in 2019 the last time it was in Hamilton and again in Toronto in 2022, did the best of the marquee trio. He finished the day tied for fourth at 4-under 66.\n\nThe Northern Irishman, fourth on the FedEx Cup rankings, said he was impressed with all the spectators who were at the 10th tee when his group teed off at 7:40 a.m.\n\n\"The Canadian fans came out to support them,\" said McIlroy of Taylor and Pendrith. \"One of the main reasons I love coming back here is because of that atmosphere that's created when we're out there to play, and playing with two Canadians today was, it was exactly what I expected.\"\n\nPendrith had a 1-under 69 round to finish the day tied for 33rd.\n\nTaylor finished his day at 2-over 72, good for 96th. He took heart from the fact that he opened last year's Canadian Open at Toronto's Oakdale Golf and Country Club with a 3-over 75 round, made the cut, and went on to win in a thrilling four-hole playoff.\n\n\"I guess I beat last year by three, so I got that going for me,\" said Taylor. \"Obviously not out of it. I know that but personally, I would have liked to have got off to a better start.\n\n\"Again, the score is out there, the greens are soft, they're receptive, just need to be a little sharper.\"\n\nO'Hair played bogey-free golf with five birdies and an eagle and Burns had a bogey, four birdies, and two eagles as they built a three-shot lead in the morning.\n\n\"I think with all the rain we had early in the week the greens are still pretty receptive,\" said Burns after coming off the course at Hamilton Golf and Country Club. \"It makes a big difference on par-5s when you have a long iron or a wood coming in there to be able to stop the ball pretty quick.\"\n\nDespite drawing the big crowds, Taylor and Pendrith weren't even the low Canadians.\n\nForty-four-year-old David Hearn from nearby Brantford, Ont., was the low Canadian. He was tied for 11th at 3-under 67. Fifty-four-year-old Mike Weir of Brights Grove, Ont., was a shot behind Hearn to sit in a group tied for 20th.\n\n\"Hey, how about that? Maybe experience still has something,\" said Hearn. \"That's great. I didn't know that was the case. I saw Weirsy was off to a great start today, so that was good to see.\n\n\"Obviously Weirsy and I, that's a great start.

The 41-year-old Englishman was a stroke ahead of morning starters Sam Burns and Sean O'Hair.\n\n\"Drove it pretty well. I left myself in a lot of good spots,\" said Skinns, winless on the PGA Tour. \"Around here, it seems like that's half the battle, to give yourself birdie looks.

Taylor begins the defence of his RBC Canadian Open title this morning. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Nathan DenetteHAMILTON - If golf was a game of who has the biggest gallery, Nick Taylor, Taylor Pendrith, and Rory McIlroy would be the runaway leaders at the RBC Canadian Open. England's David Skinns had a one-shot lead after the first round of the national men's golf championship on Thursday thanks to an 8-under 62 round in the afternoon. His final few holes were witnessed by a fraction of the number of fans who had shown up early in the day to follow the marquee grouping of Taylor, Pendrith, and McIlroy, even as they shot higher scores at Hamilton Golf and Country Club than Skinns or early leaders Sam Burns and Sean O'Hair, who were second after the first round at 7 under. \"Usually the morning round for me on a Thursday there's not that many people there,\" said Taylor, who is from Abbotsford, B.C. \"The energy was high, which was great, gets the adrenalin going, which is fun that early in the morning, gets you focused on what you need to do. \"Unfortunately, it didn't go my way, but the crowds have been amazing.\" Skinns and Scotland's Robert MacIntyre climbed the leaderboard in the afternoon to reel in Burns and O'Hair, who had a three-stroke lead after the round's first wave. MacIntyre shot a 6-under 64 to take sole possession of fourth after 18 holes. Even as Skinns and MacIntyre fired bogey-free rounds, the gallery following them was relatively small as many fans had left following the morning start of Taylor, Pendrith and McIlroy. Taylor and Pendrith, from Richmond Hill, Ont., are the top two Canadians on the PGA Tour, ranked 32 and 33 on the FedEx Cup standings respectively. Taylor is also very much the face of the event after he became the first Canadian to win the men's national golf championship in nearly seven decades at last year's tournament. \"There was definitely more people watching us than last time I played (in Hamilton) or last time I played the Canadian Open,\" said Pendrith. \"We had fun. Rory played, scored, really nicely. It was fun to play with Nick. \"It was a comfortable pairing and it was fun to have the support of the home crowd and should be good tomorrow.\" McIlroy, who won the Canadian Open in 2019 the last time it was in Hamilton and again in Toronto in 2022, did the best of the marquee trio. He finished the day tied for fourth at 4-under 66. The Northern Irishman, fourth on the FedEx Cup rankings, said he was impressed with all the spectators who were at the 10th tee when his group teed off at 7:40 a.m. \"The Canadian fans came out to support them,\" said McIlroy of Taylor and Pendrith. \"One of the main reasons I love coming back here is because of that atmosphere that's created when we're out there to play, and playing with two Canadians today was, it was exactly what I expected.\" Pendrith had a 1-under 69 round to finish the day tied for 33rd. Taylor finished his day at 2-over 72, good for 96th. He took heart from the fact that he opened last year's Canadian Open at Toronto's Oakdale Golf and Country Club with a 3-over 75 round, made the cut, and went on to win in a thrilling four-hole playoff. \"I guess I beat last year by three, so I got that going for me,\" said Taylor. \"Obviously not out of it. I know that but personally, I would have liked to have got off to a better start. \"Again, the score is out there, the greens are soft, they're receptive, just need to be a little sharper.\" O'Hair played bogey-free golf with five birdies and an eagle and Burns had a bogey, four birdies, and two eagles as they built a three-shot lead in the morning. \"I think with all the rain we had early in the week the greens are still pretty receptive,\" said Burns after coming off the course at Hamilton Golf and Country Club. \"It makes a big difference on par-5s when you have a long iron or a wood coming in there to be able to stop the ball pretty quick.\" Despite drawing the big crowds, Taylor and Pendrith weren't even the low Canadians. Forty-four-year-old David Hearn from nearby Brantford, Ont., was the low Canadian. He was tied for 11th at 3-under 67. Fifty-four-year-old Mike Weir of Brights Grove, Ont., was a shot behind Hearn to sit in a group tied for 20th. \"Hey, how about that? Maybe experience still has something,\" said Hearn. \"That's great. I didn't know that was the case. I saw Weirsy was off to a great start today, so that was good to see. \"Obviously Weirsy and I, that's a great start. We've got three more rounds to follow it up with, so we'll see what we can do.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 30, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com",

Definitely, a joy to be back.\"\n\nBurns eagled the par-5 17th and fourth.\n\n\"I think with all the rain we had early in the week the greens are still pretty receptive,\" Burns said. \"It makes a big difference on par-5s when you have a long iron or a wood coming in there to be able to stop the ball pretty quick.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlano natives, former Longhorns, and twins Pierceson and Parker Coody are both in the field as well.

Following that stunning make, Taylor tossed his putter to the side in celebration before hugging caddie Dave Markle.\n\nLittle did Taylor know, that flip of the putter would end up being a symbol of the RBC Canadian Open for years to come.\n\nBack in December, the tournament logo was updated, and it now features a silhouette of Taylor throwing his putter aside serving as the letter \"I\" -- something Taylor has seen plenty of as he's made his way around Hamilton Golf &amp; Country Club this week.\n\n\"To be on-site, seeing it on flags and posters and stuff, it's one of those things I don't know if I'll ever fully grasp probably the magnitude of that,\" Taylor said. \"It's so neat to have the idea, but to come to fruition is very cool. It's been really fun to see that, to see the big mural of Dave and I and our celebration.\"\n\nBut the reminders of his unforgettable victory don't stop there.\n\nFans of Taylor and Canadians in general vividly remember where they were and what they were doing when Taylor made history, and they haven't been shy when it comes to sharing their stories with the 36-year-old.\n\n\"I've said it recently, that's probably one of the coolest things probably in the past year of people just coming up and telling their story and the emotions that have been tied to it. They came out with a story (Tuesday) that we had been working, but his name's Brian, he's a farmer from Saskatoon, and kind of told his story, and took two, three months to track him down,\" Taylor said. \"Just stuff like that where people really remember and remember that moment.\n\n\"I think, like I said, the logo stuff, that as well as stuff where I don't think I've probably fully grasped yet. ... I appreciate all the people that come up and tell those stories because it is a lot of fun to hear.\"\n\nWhile Taylor has enjoyed reminiscing about the past, he's been more focused on successfully defending his title.\n\n\"Trying to manage time, which there's obviously more obligations this week being in Canada on top of that, but being defending,\" Taylor said. \"So really trying to manage that, trying to manage rest. ... The game feels pretty good, had a week off last week to kind of recharge.\"\n\nRegardless of the outcome, Taylor is excited for another chance to entertain the home crowd as goes for his second victory of the season. He won the WM Phoenix Open back on Feb. 11.\n\n\"I wish I could be defending probably a little bit longer, but this tournament always means a lot to me and every Canadian in the field,\" Taylor said. \"The fans are so passionate. It's been a lot of fun.\n\n\"Just walking around obviously practicing, but playing, there's a lot of people out already and it's been fun to engage with 'em. Hopefully we can put on a show again.\"\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Taylor_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Taylor (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eagle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatoon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saskatoon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saskatoon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Writing_and_Literature", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Writing and Literature", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9610439", "eventUri": "eng-9610439", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-11", "textStart": 2628, "textEnd": 2635}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Last year at Oakdale in Toronto, Taylor made an 80-foot eagle putt in a playoff to become the first Canadian to win the event since 1954.\n\n\"Usually the morning round for me on a Thursday there's not that many people there,\" Taylor said. \"The energy was high, which was great, gets the adrenaline going, which is fun that early in the morning, gets you focused on what you need to do.

It was fun to play with Nick.\"\n\nSkinns is a former Canadian tour player.\n\n\"I had a couple of great years up here.\" Skinns said. \"It's one of my favorite countries to come visit. I've seen it from West Coast to East Coast and kind of loved every part of it.\"\n\nSkinns birdied the par-4 12th -- hitting a wedge from 104 yards to 4 feet -- and began his big run on the par-5 17th. He followed with a 189-yard shot to 2 1/2 feet on the par-4 18th and made a 14-footer on the par-4 first. He holed a 35-footer on the par-4 third and added birdies on the par-5 fourth and and par-4 sixth.\n\n\"The golf up here is pretty cool,\" Skinns said. \"The bentgrass and the way this golf course looks, it's one of the best looking courses I've seen. Definitely, a joy to be back.\"\n\nBurns eagled the par-5 17th and fourth.\n\n\"I think with all the rain we had early in the week the greens are still pretty receptive,\" Burns said. \"It makes a big difference on par-5s when you have a long iron or a wood coming in there to be able to stop the ball pretty quick.\"\n\nDavid Hearn was the low Canadian after a 67.\n\n\"Hey, how about that?\" the 44-year-old Hearn said. \"Maybe experience still has something.\"\n\nFifty-four-year-old Mike Weir shot 68.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

It's been really fun to see that, to see the big mural of Dave and I and our celebration, a lot of the stuff is kind of 'pinch me' stuff.\"\n\nTaylor, from Abbotsford, B.C., won a historic four-hole playoff against England's Tommy Fleetwood last year at Oakdale Golf and Country Club in Toronto. That victory ended a 69-year drought for Canadians at their own national championship.\n\nAs long a wait as it was for a Canadian to win the national title -- Pat Fletcher was the last to do it in 1954 -- it has been even longer since Canadians won it in consecutive years. Albert Murray (1913) and Karl Keffer (1914) were the last homegrown back-to-back champs.\n\nTaylor's title defence will begin Thursday morning when he tees off in a group with Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy and Taylor Pendrith of Richmond Hill, Ont.\n\nMcIlroy won consecutive Canadian Opens in 2019 and 2022 -- the event was cancelled for two years because of the COVID-19 pandemic -- and Pendrith won the CJ Cup Byron Nelson on May 4, making the trio a premium group at the tournament.\n\n\"I feel like the whole year's been a build up for this, potentially,\" said Taylor, who also won the WM Phoenix Open on Feb. 11. \"There's going to be a lot of energy out there which will be great, looking forward to that.\"\n\nMcIlroy made his first Canadian Open appearance in 2019 and won the event that year at Hamilton Golf and Country Club. The course has undergone significant changes in the past five years, however, with US$8.5 million being put into reconstructing tees, bunkers and greens on all 27 holes.\n\nThe No. 4 golfer in the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup standings had fond memories of his 2019 triumph.\n\n\"The place was buzzing. The Raptors were about to win an NBA championship,\" McIlroy, who won again at Toronto's St. George's Golf and Country Club, said Wednesday. \"I was blown away by just the enthusiasm that the fans have, and it was such a great atmosphere to play in.\"\n\nA modern-era record of 28 Canadians will be in the 156-player field at the only PGA Tour event north of the border. Taylor is the highest ranked on both the PGA Tour and world rankings, but Pendrith is just one spot below him in the FedEx Cup rankings.\n\n\"I think it's a big deal for all the Canadians playing in this tournament. It's a major for us,\" he said. \"It's the one time we get to be here in our home country and play in front of the home fans, so it's a big deal for the players and the spectators and the whole country.\n\n\"It's a huge event, and to see Nick do it last year was unbelievable, it was super inspiring.\"\n\nMackenzie Hughes of nearby Dundas, Ont., is No. 46 in the FedEx Cup standings. He acknowledged that Taylor's win last year eased the pressure on Canadian players to win the national championship, but didn't eliminate it.\n\n\"I show up here with my own personal expectations and desires to do well, so I don't think that like I'm going to be out there thinking about because Nick won there's no pressure on me anymore,\" he said. \"I put a lot of pressure on myself to do well every single week.\n\n\"So while we're not answering the question of who will be the first to break the Pat Fletcher curse or be the next Canadian to win since Pat Fletcher, I still think that when we come here we're all pretty eager to do well close to home.\"", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The 41-year-old Englishman was a stroke ahead of morning starters Sam Burns and Sean O'Hair.\n\n\"Drove it pretty well. I left myself in a lot of good spots,\" said Skinns, winless on the PGA Tour. \"Around here, it seems like that's half the battle, to give yourself birdie looks. I was able to attack some pins that maybe if I wasn't in such a good spot, I wouldn't have been able to. \"\n\nRobert MacIntyre of Scotland had a 64 in the afternoon. Ryan Palmer opened with a 65, and two-time Canadian Open champion Rory McIlroy was another shot back with Ryan Fox, Andrew Novak, Erik van Rooyen, Nick Hardy and Trace Crowe.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Last year at Oakdale in Toronto, Taylor made an 80-foot eagle putt in a playoff to become the first Canadian to win the event since 1954.\n\n\"Usually the morning round for me on a Thursday there's not that many people there,\" Taylor said. \"The energy was high, which was great, gets the adrenaline going, which is fun that early in the morning, gets you focused on what you need to do. Unfortunately, it didn't go my way, but the crowds have been amazing.\"\n\nMcIlroy won the Canadian Open in 2019 the last time it was in Hamilton and again in 2022 at St. George's in Toronto.\n\n\"One of the main reasons I love coming back here is because of that atmosphere,\" McIlroy said. \"Playing with two Canadians today, it was exactly what I expected.\"\n\nPendrith opened with a 72.\n\n\"We had fun,\" Pendrith said. \"Rory played, scored, really nicely.

He's still a little fuzzy on the details", "body": "ANCASTER, Ont. -- Twenty-one years ago, on the first week of September, Mike Weir walked onto the driving range at Hamilton Golf and Country Club to an almost eerie silence.\n\nThe club was hosting the Canadian Open for the first time in 73 years, and Weir was making his first competitive appearance on home soil since he had won the Masters that April.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nAs word spread that Weir had arrived to the practice area, the crowds behind the roped-off range grew rapidly. Then, as Weir walked toward his spot, a hush ensued. All that broke the calm was the sound of club faces connecting with golf balls. Players, even tour veterans, turned and watched as Weir walked by. The late Dan Halldorson, making the last of his 25 Canadian Open starts, stopped Weir for a chat. Anyone nearby could eavesdrop on their conversation.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe scene's quiet was owed to Weir's aura. For many Canadians, it was their first time seeing the diminutive golfer in person. Here was the left-hander who conquered giants like Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Ernie Els and Vijay Singh in golf's most famous tournament at its most famous course. Though the support for Weir grew louder and louder as the week progressed, that first sighting left many awestruck.\n\n\"I remember feeling that and it was incredible,\" Weir said, standing on that same range Tuesday. \"I think I teed off on 10 on Thursday and the crowds were quite deep and lining the fairways and I remember saying to Brennan (Little), my caddy, that this was quite cool. And another memory I have is that was the last tournament my grandfather came to watch. And coming up 18, out of all the people, I could see him on the balcony.\"\n\nThis week Hamilton is the venue for another hero's return. Nick Taylor, of Abbotsford, B.C., is here to defend the RBC Canadian Open title he won last year at Toronto's Oakdale. The thrilling victory, which vanquished a 69-year drought, produced a celebration so iconic it has been baked into this year's tournament logo. A 72-foot eagle putt, a flatstick flip and a champagne-spraying pal tackled amid the celebration. \"Glorious and free,\" Jim Nantz described on the CBS broadcast. Glorious indeed.\n\nIn the 12 months since, Taylor has rarely gone a week without someone telling him a where-they-were story. People on planes, people in pubs, people in tears. A Saskatchewan farmer tending to his fields and watching on his iPad.\n\nYou win a PGA Tour tournament and you're its champion for a year. Your name's on the trophy forever but your story eventually fades. Taylor, on the other hand, will be the man who made history evermore. When he arrived on site Monday afternoon, one of the first things he saw was a giant photo of him and his caddy Dave Markle embracing after that magical putt dropped.\n\n\"We still can't believe it's been a year,\" Taylor said. \"It's been a fun ride.\"\n\nThere has been more support, more recognition and more requests for photos this week, he said. In many ways, though, it has been a continuation of the last 12 months. And as was the case with Weir more than two decades ago, Taylor is anticipating more once the tournament begins.\n\nHe's off Thursday morning and Friday afternoon with Rory McIlroy, victorious here in 2019, and Taylor Pendrith, who won earlier this month at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson.\n\n\"I didn't assume I was going to play with Rory, but I kind of had an inkling that they would probably put us together with another Canadian,\" Taylor said.\n\n\"Being able to play with Pendy is going to be a lot of fun. There's going to be a lot of energy out there, which will be great. I think Friday will probably be pretty crazy. Tomorrow, I'm sure people will show up in the morning, but looking forward to the next four days obviously, but the next couple for sure.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe never forgets what he did at Oakdale, Taylor said, but sometimes he and his wife Andie will be sitting at home watching TV and a reminder will pop up and she'll say, \"That happened, right?\" And they'll get those warm and fuzzy feelings all over again. Or Markle will joke, \"You played the Canadian Open last year, right?\"\n\nAs for the actual moment, things remain fairly fuzzy. His most distinct memory is Markle charging at him and then their hug. From watching the reply so many times, that visual has essentially replaced his own perception of what took place in the aftermath of the putt. But the most joy he and Andie get when reliving the scene is finding a different person in the video to focus on each time and watching their reaction. Their joy was a country's joy.\n\nThat said, there's a task at hand this week. Taylor has a tournament to play. He won in Phoenix in February but hasn't had much success since. He missed the cut in the Masters and the PGA Championship, but he said his game feels good after a week off to rest and recoup.\n\n\"Hopefully,\" he said, \"we can put on a show again.\"", "source":

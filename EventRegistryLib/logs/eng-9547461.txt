This is a signature event on the PGA Tour, as just Scottie Scheffler and Ludvig Aberg are top-10 players not competing. Rory McIlroy (three wins) and Max Homa (two) are the only multi-time champions of this tournament, which takes place at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, N.C. Wyndham Clark picked up his first tour victory at this event last year and is one of seven past winners in the Wells Fargo Championship 2024 field.\n\nComing off a victory in his last start, McIlroy is the 13-2 favorite to win for the fourth time at this event. No. 4 player in the world, Xander Schauffele, follows at 9-1 in the latest 2024 Wells Fargo Championship odds, with Clark at 14-1. Homa is one of three golfers listed at 22-1, alongside Justin Thomas and Collin Morikawa. Before locking in your 2024 Wells Fargo Championship picks, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.\n\nSportsLine's proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June of 2020. In fact, the model is up more than $9,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.\n\nMcClure's model correctly predicted Scottie Scheffler would finish on top of the leaderboard at the 2024 Masters, the Arnold Palmer Invitational, the Players Championship, and the RBC Heritage this season. McClure also included Hideki Matsuyama in his best bets to win the 2024 Genesis Invitational. That bet hit at +9000, and for the entire tournament, McClure's best bets returned nearly $1,000.\n\nThe model also predicted Jon Rahm would be victorious at the 2023 Sentry Tournament of Champions and The American Express. At the 2023 Masters, the model was all over Rahm's second career major victory heading into the weekend. Rahm was two strokes off the lead heading into the third round, but the model still projected him as the winner. It was the second straight Masters win for the model, which also nailed Scheffler winning in 2022.\n\nIn addition, McClure's best bets included Nick Taylor (70-1) winning the 2023 RBC Canadian Open, Jason Day (17-1) winning outright at the 2023 AT&T Byron Nelson, and Rickie Fowler (14-1) finishing on top of the leaderboard at the 2023 Rocket Mortgage Classic.\n\nThis same model has also nailed a whopping 11 majors entering the weekend and hit the Masters three straight years. Anyone who has followed it has seen massive returns.\n\nNow that the Wells Fargo Championship 2024 field is finalized, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.\n\nTop 2024 Wells Fargo Championship predictions\n\nOne major surprise the model is calling for at the Wells Fargo Championship 2024: Clark, the defending champion and one of the top favorites, stumbles this week and barely cracks the top 10. Clark has been playing extremely well in 2024, securing one win and two runner-up finishes.\n\nHowever, Clark has finished T-31 or worse in two of his last three starts on the PGA Tour, which includes a missed cut at the Masters. He's also struggled with accuracy off the tee this season. The 30-year-old enters this week's event ranked 111th in driving accuracy (60.10%). Quail Hollow puts a premium on positioning off the tee, which doesn't bode well for Clark's chances to repeat as champion.\n\nAnother surprise: Tommy Fleetwood, a 25-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. The Englishman finished fifth at this tournament last year and was 14th in his previous start, making him just one of eight players in the field with multiple top-16 finishes over the last four years at Quail Hollow. He's been just as impressive on the PGA Tour this season as last month he notched his best-ever Masters finish (third place) and also was seventh at the Texas Open.\n\nFleetwood combines precision off the tee, ranking third on tour in driving accuracy percentage, with a pristine short game, ranking 15th in strokes gained: around-the-green. Nearly half of the holes at Quail Hollow measure in between 450 and 510 yards, and Fleetwood excels on par-4s of this distance, ranking in the top 10 on the PGA Tour in scoring on them. He's shot par or better in each of his last six rounds at this course, and given both his results and metrics from this year's PGA Tour season, Fleetwood is being vastly underrated with his long odds. See who else to pick here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Wells Fargo Championship picks\n\nThe model is also targeting five other golfers with odds of 22-1 or longer to make a strong run at the title. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big. You can only see the model's picks here.\n\nWho will win the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

Players will compete in the PGA Tour Signature Event for a purse of $20 million and 500 FedEx Cup Points.\n\nHere are the top five picks for the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship.\n\n#1 Rory McIlroy (+750)\n\nAccording to BetMGM, Rory McIlroy is favored to win with +750 odds. McIlroy has the best odds to win with World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler sitting out of the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship as he expects the birth of his first child with his wife Meredith Scheffler.\n\nFresh off the 2024 Zurich Classic of New Orleans victory with teammate Shane Lowry and a dozen tournament starts at Quail Hollow Golf and Country Club, McIlroy certainly knows the course as he has three victories and nine top 10 finishes at the course throughout his PGA Tour career.\n\n#2 Xander Schauffele (+1000)\n\nXander Schauffele finished as the solo runner-up at Quail Hollow Golf and Country Club at the 2023 Wells Fargo Championship.\n\nWith seven top 10 finishes so far into the 2024 season, 10 top 25 finishes, and one runner-up finish at the 2024 Players Championship, Schauffele has what it takes to put up a good show with +1000 odds to win.\n\n#3 Wyndham Clark (+1400)\n\nThe 2023 Wells Fargo Championship winner Wyndham Clark has +1400 odds to defend his title at Quail Hollow Golf and Country Club. Clark won the title in 2023 by a four-stroke margin ahead of Schauffele, earning his first PGA Tour title.\n\nThe 2024 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am winner is currently ranked second in the FedEx Cup Rankings and third in the Official World Golf Rankings. With four top five finishes this season, Clark could win the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship after a tied for third finish at his last PGA Tour event in April at the 2024 RBC Heritage.\n\n#4 Patrick Cantlay (+1600)\n\nWith +1600 odds to win, Patrick Cantlay ranks 10th on the FedEx Cup Rankings and 8th on the Official World Golf Rankings. Cantlay has played ten PGA Tour events this season and has made the cut in all ten events with two top ten finishes and six top 25 finishes.\n\n#5 Collin Morikawa (+2200)\n\nCollin Morikawa missed the cut at the 2023 Wells Fargo Championship after a score of four over par. With +2200 odds to win this year, Morikawa finished in the top 10 of the field twice in his last five PGA Tour starts.\n\nWith a scoring average of four under over the last five starts, he ranks 11th in the FedEx Cup Rankings after a ninth-place finish at the RBC Heritage followed by his third-place finish at the 2024 Masters.\n\n2024 Wells Fargo Championship Rory McIlroy Round 1 Odds\n\nWith the best odds to win the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship at +750, Rory McIlroy has +1200 odds to card in a bogey free scorecard for the first round of the PGA Tour Signature event with -110 odds to shoot a first round of 69 or lower. All odds mentioned below are for Rory McIlroy's first round.\n\nMcIlroy has +350 odds to make a birdie or better on all par five holes and +700 to birdie the first hole of Quail Hollow Golf and Country Club.\n\nHe has +110 odds to shoot 5 or more birdies or eagles with +700 to make an eagle on any hole during his first round.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lathika_krishna@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Lathika Krishna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T_Pebble_Beach_Pro-Am", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Players_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Players Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBC_Heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RBC Heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/6dec5-17151886040405-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547461", "eventUri": "eng-9547461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "dateEnd": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 93, "textEnd": 104}], "sentiment": 0.607843137254902, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

The World No. 3 golfer is the second-highest-ranked player on the event's field after No. 2 McIlroy. The ace golfer is one of 44 top 50 OWGR-ranked players on the Wells Fargo Championship's 68-player field.\n\nDespite the stacked field, the 30-year-old has high odds to defend his title at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte. According to SportsLine, Clark enters the tournament with 14-1 odds. He sits third on the odds list behind event favorite Rory McIlroy (13-2) and last year's runner-up Xander Schauffele (9-1).\n\nIt is pertinent to note that Wyndham Clark won the 2023 Wells Fargo Championship by beating Schauffele and Tyrrell Hatton, among others. This was Clark's first victory on the PGA Tour. The golfer has since won two titles, including the U.S. Open last year.\n\nClark has had a mixed start to the 2024 PGA Tour schedule. The golfer started the year with a T29 finish at The Sentry. He followed it up with a T39 finish at The American Express, before winning the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. He's since finished second at the Arnold Palmer Invitational and The Players Championship.\n\nHowever, he failed to make the cuts at the Genesis Open and The Masters. Now, coming off the back of a T3 finish at the RBC Heritage, the World No. 3 golfer is a popular pick for the weekend. It'll be interesting to see how the Colorado native finish the $20,000,000 prized signature event.\n\nWyndham Clark will tee off the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship on Thursday at 11:22 am ET alongside Schauffele and Shane Lowry.\n\n2024 Wells Fargo Championship odds\n\nRory McIlroy is the outright favorite to win the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship with 13-2 odds. Patrick Cantlay (16-1), Collin Morikawa (22-1), Justin Thomas (22-1) and Viktor Hovland (25-1) are some other names Wyndham Clark needs to watch at the Quail Hollow Club event.\n\nListed below are the top odds for the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship (As per SportsLine):\n\nMore details on the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship will be updated as the event progresses.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vishnu_mohan@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Vishnu Mohan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desert Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T_Pebble_Beach_Pro-Am", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrrell_Hatton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrrell Hatton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBC_Heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RBC Heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer_Invitational", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Palmer Invitational"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Players_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Players Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Military_Pentathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Military Pentathlon", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Players", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Guts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Guts", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 65}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Aquathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Aquathlon", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/6c734-17151735297762-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547461", "eventUri": "eng-9547461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 65, "textEnd": 70}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Aberg pulled out of the field Tuesday, citing a knee injury.\n\nPicking a winner from the field of 69 pros is a daunting task, but the tournament's history and the makeup of the Quail Hollow Club provide some clues.\n\nRory McIlroy has won the event three times. Max Homa has won twice. And a handful of players regularly finish among the leaders.\n\n\"This course suits longer hitters,\" said Shane Lowry, who teamed with McIlroy to win the Zurich New Orleans Open last month.\n\nThat points to players like McIlroy, defending Wells Fargo champion Wyndham Clark, Justin Thomas, Tony Finau and Gary Woodland.\n\nA winner at Quail Hollow also must be good with long approach shots, since eight of the par-4 holes are 450 yards or longer.\n\nOf course, it always helps to be good around the green.\n\nSo, here are six players to watch at this week's Wells Fargo Championship:\n\nRory McIlroy\n\nOK, this one is obvious. McIlroy won in 2010, 2015 and 2021 and played well last month in New Orleans. He's ranked No. 2 in the world and is the betting favorite this week.\n\nHe ranks third in driving distance and is first overall in driving, who you factor in accuracy. Quail Hollow Club is a course that rewards distance and accuracy.\n\nMcIlroy also has finished in the top 10 seven of his past nine tournaments.\n\nWyndham Clark\n\nWe already have McIlroy and Homa as repeat winners of the event. Why not Clark, who blistered Quail Hollow a year ago with a tournament-record 265 and a four-shot victory.\n\nClark went on to win the U.S. Open a few weeks later and is ranked No. 3 in the world. He is second in the FedEx Cup standings and in 10 tournaments this year, he has one victory, two second's, and four top-10 finishes.\n\nHe is a long-hitter, is fifth in scoring average, and obviously likes the course in Charlotte. Clark has not played since the RBC Heritage Classic three weeks ago.\n\nXander Schauffele\n\nSchauffele shot an outstanding 269 in last year's tournament, which would have won the event in all but two previous years. But his score was four strokes behind Wyndham Clark.\n\nSchauffele, ranked fourth in the world, has finished in the top 10 seven times this season and tied for second in the Players Championship. He ranks fourth in scoring average, is a long-hitter, and plays well around the greens.\n\nHe also compiled a 3-1 record for the U.S. team in the 2022 President's Cup, played at Quail Hollow.\n\nCollin Morikawa\n\nMorikawa would like to make amends for 2023, when he missed the cut at the Wells Fargo Championship. His game has been much stronger this spring, including a tied for third in the Masters and a ninth-place finish in the RBC Heritage Classic.\n\nWinner of the 2020 PGA Championship and the 2021 U.S. Open, Morikawa would like a strong performance this week, to carry him into next week's PGA Championship.\n\nMorikawa ranks among the PGA's best in approach shots of 150 to 200 yards. With those eight long par-4 holes (and the par-5's), doing well with the mid and long irons is a valuable asset when playing at Quail Hollow.\n\nMax Homa\n\nAny list of potential winners must include Homa. One of his two Wells Fargo championships came in 2022, when the tournament was moved to TPC Potomac while Quail Hollow was being readied for the President's Cup.\n\nBut Homa won the event in 2019 when it was in Charlotte. He went 4-0 for the U.S. team at Quail Hollow in the President's Cup. And he tied for eighth place a year ago.\n\nThis season, he tied for third in the Masters and is ranked 10th in the world.\n\nHideki Matsuyama\n\nMatsuyama has skipped the Wells Fargo Championship a few times in recent years but has a strong record in Charlotte. He is 6-for-6 in making the cut, and he finished fifth in the 2017 PGA Chanmpionship, played at Quail Hollow.\n\nRanked 15th in the world, Matsuyama is playing for the first time since the Masters. According to several reports, he took some time off to work on his iron game.\n\nWhile not one of the tour's leading hitters, Matsuyama makes his mark around the greens. He is ranked No. 1 on the PGA in the \"Around the Green\" category.", "source": {"uri": "islandpacket.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Island Packet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Odds explored", "body": "The 2024 Wells Fargo Championship is set to tee off on Thursday, May 9, at the Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte. The signature event will have a 68-player field, including 44 of the top 50 OWGR-ranked players, competing for the $20,000,000 prize purse. Despite the stacked field, Rory McIlroy remains the outright favorite to win this weekend.\n\nThe World No. 2 is the top-ranked player on the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship field. Interestingly, Scottie Scheffler chose to skip the competition despite being eligible as he awaits the birth of his first child. This made McIlroy the default popular pick.\n\nAccording to SportsLine, the Northern Irishman comes into the Charlotte event with 13-2 odds.\n\nFor the unversed, Rory McIlroy arrives at the Wells Fargo Championship on the back of a win. The 35-year-old golfer won the Zurich Classic in New Orleans two weeks ago, along with Shane Lowry. This was his 25th win on the PGA Tour. Having sat out last week's CJ Cup Byron Nelson, he will be looking to carry forward his form from the team event this weekend.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that McIlroy has won the Wells Fargo Championship thrice. Victories in 2010, 2015 and 2021 make him the only three-time winner in the 20-year event's history. Notably, he has also registered five top-10 finishes in the competition.\n\nRory McIlroy will tee off on Thursday at 12:39 pm alongside Tom Kim and Max Homa.\n\n2024 Wells Fargo Championship odds\n\nRory McIlroy is the favorite to win the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship this weekend. According to SportsLine, he is closely followed by Xander Schauffele, who comes in with 9-1 odds. Meanwhile, defending champion Wyndham Clark sits third on the odds list at 14-1.\n\nPatrick Cantlay (16-1), Collin Morikawa (22-1), Justin Thomas (22-1) and Viktor Hovland (25-1) are some other big names to watch this weekend at the Quail Hollow Club.\n\nListed below are the top odds for the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship (As per SportsLine):", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vishnu_mohan@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Vishnu Mohan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Kim", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Kim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Homa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Homa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Contests", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Contests", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Military_Pentathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Military Pentathlon", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Players", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Guts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Guts", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/8b0aa-17151637164061-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547461", "eventUri": "eng-9547461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 65, "textEnd": 70}], "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The news and editorial departments had no role in the creation or display of this content.\n\nThe 2024 Wells Fargo Championship gets underway this Thursday in Charlotte, North Carolina at Quail Hollow Golf Club. It's the PGA's sixth signature event of the season and comes with a $20 million purse -- $3.6 to the winner.\n\nRead below for Wells Fargo Championship props and betting promos where you can claim thousands in bonus bets for this week and beyond.\n\nBest golf betting sites\n\nBest Wells Fargo Championship prop bets: Rory McIlroy props, Wyndham Clark picks and more\n\nScottie Scheffler is taking a breather this week, which means that someone else finally has a chance to win. Quail Hollow is a notoriously difficult track, highlighted by the final three-hole gauntlet dubbed the Green Mile.\n\nLast year's champion, Wyndham Clark, enters the tournament with the third-shortest odds at +1600. He'll be amongst a star-studded field including three-time champion (and favorite) Rory McIlroy, as well as two-time winner Max Homa.\n\nSee below for our favorite 2024 Wells Fargo Championship props:\n\nWells Fargo props: Rory McIlroy Top 10 finishing position (-120 or better)\n\nRory McIlroy finally notched a win this season at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans. It can be taken with a grain of salt however, considering it was a team event with rules well out of the regular PGA parameters. Still, the 35-year-old could use the winning feeling to turn around his sputtering start this year.\n\nOutside of New Orleans, Rory has finished better than T19 just once this season (3, Valero Open). But history is on his side at Quail Hollow, and that's why we like his chances for at least a top-10 finish. The Northern Irishman has won here three times since 2010 by a combined 12 strokes. His last win came in 2021.\n\n2024 Wells Fargo Championship props: Wyndham Clark Top American (+1000 or better)\n\nWyndham Clark is the reigning champion at Quail Hollow, coming off a staggering -19, four-stroke victory in 2023. On top of that, his current form is in excellent shape, and he has as good of a chance as any American in this tournament.\n\nClark has three top-three finishes in his last five events, most recently a T3 at the RBC Heritage. He's second in SG: Total and ninth in SG: Putting, both significant metrics at this course. Four of the past five winners here (including Clark) have finished the week top-three in SG: Putting.\n\nWells Fargo prop bets: Max Homa, Xander Schauffele, Wyndham Clark Top 20 parlay (+360 or better)\n\nThere's a lot of pedigree in this trio, particularly at this course. In the last four tournaments here, these three golfers have produced three wins and a second-place finish.\n\nXander Schauffele finished runner-up here last year and is a virtual top-20 machine. He had four in a row before the New Orleans team event (which doesn't really count).\n\nClark's recent hot streak was noted above, and Max Homa has won this thing twice in the last four times it's been played. You could find a much worse way to take a shot at some plump +360 odds.\n\n2024 Wells Fargo Championship matchup prop bets: Matt Fitzpatrick over Viktor Hovland (-110 or better)\n\nIt's been tough sledding for Viktor Hovland this season coming off a historic year in which he won the Tour Championship. The Norwegian has failed to post a top-10 and has cracked the top-20 just once in six events. His last tournament was the Masters, where he missed the cut after shooting in the 80s in the second round.\n\nMatt Fitzpatrick hasn't been setting the world on fire but is in better form than Hovland lately. Fitz has an average finishing position of 15.2 in his last five events, including a strong fifth-place result at the Players Championship. The Englishman also finished T2 at Quail Hollow in 2022.\n\nUnderdog Fantasy PGA Player Props: Higher/Lower props for Wells Fargo\n\nUnderdog Fantasy allows customers to pick Higher or Lower (similar to an over/under) and string together multiple selections into one entry, similar to a parlay at a sportsbook.\n\nRegister with Underdog Fantasy promo code BETFPB to claim a $100 deposit match bonus, then immediately start making your picks.

It's the PGA's sixth signature event of the season and comes with a $20 million purse -- $3.6 to the winner.\n\nRead below for Wells Fargo Championship props and betting promos where you can claim thousands in bonus bets for this week and beyond.\n\nBest golf betting sitesBest Wells Fargo Championship prop bets: Rory McIlroy props, Wyndham Clark picks and more\n\nScottie Scheffler is taking a breather this week, which means that someone else finally has a chance to win. Quail Hollow is a notoriously difficult track, highlighted by the final three-hole gauntlet dubbed the Green Mile.\n\nLast year's champion, Wyndham Clark, enters the tournament with the third-shortest odds at +1600. He'll be amongst a star-studded field including three-time champion (and favorite) Rory McIlroy, as well as two-time winner Max Homa.\n\nSee below for our favorite 2024 Wells Fargo Championship props:\n\nWells Fargo props: Rory McIlroy Top 10 finishing position (-120 or better)\n\nRory McIlroy finally notched a win this season at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans. It can be taken with a grain of salt however, considering it was a team event with rules well out of the regular PGA parameters. Still, the 35-year-old could use the winning feeling to turn around his sputtering start this year.\n\nOutside of New Orleans, Rory has finished better than T19 just once this season (3, Valero Open). But history is on his side at Quail Hollow, and that's why we like his chances for at least a top-10 finish. The Northern Irishman has won here three times since 2010 by a combined 12 strokes. His last win came in 2021.\n\n2024 Wells Fargo Championship props: Wyndham Clark Top American (+1000 or better)\n\nWyndham Clark is the reigning champion at Quail Hollow, coming off a staggering -19, four-stroke victory in 2023. On top of that, his current form is in excellent shape, and he has as good of a chance as any American in this tournament.\n\nClark has three top-three finishes in his last five events, most recently a T3 at the RBC Heritage. He's second in SG: Total and ninth in SG: Putting, both significant metrics at this course. Four of the past five winners here (including Clark) have finished the week top-three in SG: Putting.\n\nWells Fargo prop bets: Max Homa, Xander Schauffele, Wyndham Clark Top 20 parlay (+360 or better)\n\nThere's a lot of pedigree in this trio, particularly at this course. In the last four tournaments here, these three golfers have produced three wins and a second-place finish.\n\nXander Schauffele finished runner-up here last year and is a virtual top-20 machine. He had four in a row before the New Orleans team event (which doesn't really count).\n\nClark's recent hot streak was noted above, and Max Homa has won this thing twice in the last four times it's been played. You could find a much worse way to take a shot at some plump +360 odds.\n\n2024 Wells Fargo Championship matchup prop bets: Matt Fitzpatrick over Viktor Hovland (-110 or better)\n\nIt's been tough sledding for Viktor Hovland this season coming off a historic year in which he won the Tour Championship. The Norwegian has failed to post a top-10 and has cracked the top-20 just once in six events. His last tournament was the Masters, where he missed the cut after shooting in the 80s in the second round.\n\nMatt Fitzpatrick hasn't been setting the world on fire but is in better form than Hovland lately. Fitz has an average finishing position of 15.2 in his last five events, including a strong fifth-place result at the Players Championship. The Englishman also finished T2 at Quail Hollow in 2022.\n\nUnderdog Fantasy PGA Player Props: Higher/Lower props for Wells Fargo\n\nUnderdog Fantasy allows customers to pick Higher or Lower (similar to an over/under) and string together multiple selections into one entry, similar to a parlay at a sportsbook.\n\nRegister with Underdog Fantasy promo code BETFPB to claim a $100 deposit match bonus, then immediately start making your picks.

As a signature event, the Wells Fargo Championship 2024 will feature a limited, 69-player field with top players and increased prize money. The tournament will not have a cut, and the winner will earn $3.6 million.\n\nFresh off his victory with teammate Shane Lowry in the Zurich Classic of New Orleans two weeks ago, Rory McIlroy is the favorite in the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship odds at +650. Xander Schauffele is the +900 second choice. Defending Wells Fargo champion Wyndham Clark (+1600), Patrick Cantlay (+1800) and Max Homa (+2200) round out the top five choices in the Wells Fargo Championship 2024 field. Before locking in any 2024 Wells Fargo Championship picks, make sure you see the PGA Tour predictions and best bets from golf betting and fantasy expert Sia Nejad, considering the success he had picking the tournament last year.\n\nNejad specializes in betting and DFS in golf, among other sports. He's had incredible success in the outright and first-round leader markets and in betting head-to-head matchups. He also has been solid with his head-to-head matchups since last year's Charles Schwab Challenge, going 41-27-3 and returning 10.64 units over that span. That's a $1,064 profit for $100 bettors since May 2023.\n\nNejad also nailed Clark, a 75-1 longshot, as the outright winner at the Wells Fargo Championship. In 2023, SportsLine debuted \"The Early Wedge,\" and in the first three months of the show, he hit two first-round leaders and three outright winners.\n\nNow, Nejad has turned his attention to the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship field and locked in his best bets, top sleepers and favorites to avoid. See who they are at SportsLine.\n\nTop 2024 Wells Fargo Championship expert picks\n\nOne surprise: Nejad is completely fading Tommy Fleetwood, even though he is one of the favorites at +2200. Ranked No. 11 in the world, Fleetwood has three top-10 and three top-25 finishes in eight PGA Tour events this year. He is coming off a 49th-place finish in the RBC Heritage three weeks ago.\n\nHowever, across 134 career PGA Tour events, Fleetwood has never won. His best finish is second, which he has done five times. \"He's shown no ability to close on the PGA Tour over his career and this is not the field for him to finally pull it off,\" Nejad told SportsLine.\n\nHowever, Nejad is high on the chances of Wyndham Clark, who is +1600 in the odds. Ranked No. 3 in the world, Clark has one win, two seconds and four top-10 finishes in 10 events this season. He hasn't played since finishing third in the RBC Heritage three weeks ago.\n\nLast year, Clark set the tournament scoring record (265) and earned his first career PGA Tour victory. He is looking to become the first player in the history of the tournament to successfully defend his title. \"He is an excellent course fit as he's got the off-the-tee game and putting to contend,\" Nejad said. See which other golfers to back at SportsLine.\n\nHow to make 2024 Wells Fargo Championship picks\n\nNejad has locked in his best bets for the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship and is backing several longshots, including one that is priced at more than +4000. This player \"has spiked enough lately\" and is a longshot who could surprise.

The news and editorial departments had no role in the creation or display of this content.\n\nThe 2024 Wells Fargo Championship gets underway this Thursday in Charlotte, North Carolina at Quail Hollow Golf Club. It's the PGA's sixth signature event of the season and comes with a $20 million purse -- $3.6 to the winner.\n\nRead below for Wells Fargo Championship props and betting promos where you can claim thousands in bonus bets for this week and beyond.\n\nBest golf betting sites Best Wells Fargo Championship prop bets: Rory McIlroy props, Wyndham Clark picks and more\n\nScottie Scheffler is taking a breather this week, which means that someone else finally has a chance to win. Quail Hollow is a notoriously difficult track, highlighted by the final three-hole gauntlet dubbed the Green Mile.\n\nLast year's champion, Wyndham Clark, enters the tournament with the third-shortest odds at +1600. He'll be amongst a star-studded field including three-time champion (and favorite) Rory McIlroy, as well as two-time winner Max Homa.\n\nSee below for our favorite 2024 Wells Fargo Championship props:\n\nWells Fargo props: Rory McIlroy Top 10 finishing position (-120 or better)\n\nRory McIlroy finally notched a win this season at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans. It can be taken with a grain of salt however, considering it was a team event with rules well out of the regular PGA parameters. Still, the 35-year-old could use the winning feeling to turn around his sputtering start this year.\n\nOutside of New Orleans, Rory has finished better than T19 just once this season (3, Valero Open). But history is on his side at Quail Hollow, and that's why we like his chances for at least a top-10 finish. The Northern Irishman has won here three times since 2010 by a combined 12 strokes. His last win came in 2021.\n\n2024 Wells Fargo Championship props: Wyndham Clark Top American (+1000 or better)\n\nWyndham Clark is the reigning champion at Quail Hollow, coming off a staggering -19, four-stroke victory in 2023. On top of that, his current form is in excellent shape, and he has as good of a chance as any American in this tournament.\n\nClark has three top-three finishes in his last five events, most recently a T3 at the RBC Heritage. He's second in SG: Total and ninth in SG: Putting, both significant metrics at this course. Four of the past five winners here (including Clark) have finished the week top-three in SG: Putting.\n\nWells Fargo prop bets: Max Homa, Xander Schauffele, Wyndham Clark Top 20 parlay (+360 or better)\n\nThere's a lot of pedigree in this trio, particularly at this course. In the last four tournaments here, these three golfers have produced three wins and a second-place finish.\n\nXander Schauffele finished runner-up here last year and is a virtual top-20 machine. He had four in a row before the New Orleans team event (which doesn't really count).\n\nClark's recent hot streak was noted above, and Max Homa has won this thing twice in the last four times it's been played. You could find a much worse way to take a shot at some plump +360 odds.\n\n2024 Wells Fargo Championship matchup prop bets: Matt Fitzpatrick over Viktor Hovland (-110 or better)\n\nIt's been tough sledding for Viktor Hovland this season coming off a historic year in which he won the Tour Championship. The Norwegian has failed to post a top-10 and has cracked the top-20 just once in six events. His last tournament was the Masters, where he missed the cut after shooting in the 80s in the second round.\n\nMatt Fitzpatrick hasn't been setting the world on fire but is in better form than Hovland lately. Fitz has an average finishing position of 15.2 in his last five events, including a strong fifth-place result at the Players Championship. The Englishman also finished T2 at Quail Hollow in 2022.\n\nUnderdog Fantasy PGA Player Props: Higher/Lower props for Wells Fargo\n\nUnderdog Fantasy allows customers to pick Higher or Lower (similar to an over/under) and string together multiple selections into one entry, similar to a parlay at a sportsbook.\n\nRegister with Underdog Fantasy promo code BETFPB to claim a $100 deposit match bonus, then immediately start making your picks.

The four-time major winner won the Zurich Classic of New Orleans two weeks ago with teammate Shane Lowry, earning his first PGA Tour victory since last year's Genesis Scottish Open. This week, he will attempt to win the Wells Fargo Championship for the fourth time.\n\nMcIlroy is the favorite in the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship odds at +650. Xander Schauffele is the +900 second choice in the 69-player field. Defending champion Wyndham Clark (+1600), Patrick Cantlay (+1800) and Max Homa (+2200) round out the top five choices on the PGA odds board. Before locking in any 2024 Wells Fargo Championship picks, make sure you see the PGA Tour predictions and best bets from golf betting and fantasy expert Sia Nejad, considering the success he had picking the tournament last year.\n\nNejad specializes in betting and DFS in golf, among other sports. He's had incredible success in the outright and first-round leader markets and in betting head-to-head matchups. He also has been solid with his head-to-head matchups since last year's Charles Schwab Challenge, going 41-27-3 and returning 10.64 units over that span. That's a $1,064 profit for $100 bettors since May 2023.\n\nNejad also nailed Clark, a 75-1 longshot, as the outright winner at the Wells Fargo Championship. In 2023, SportsLine debuted \"The Early Wedge,\" and in the first three months of the show, he hit two first-round leaders and three outright winners.\n\nNow, Nejad has turned his attention to the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship field and locked in his best bets, top sleepers and favorites to avoid. See who they are at SportsLine.\n\nTop 2024 Wells Fargo Championship expert picks\n\nOne surprise: Nejad is completely fading Tommy Fleetwood, even though he is one of the favorites at +2200. The winner of more than $22.4 million in his career, Fleetwood is coming off his worst finish on the PGA Tour this season: a 49th-place showing at the RBC Heritage three weeks ago. That was a signature event that featured just 69 players and did not have a cut.\n\nIn addition, Fleetwood is still looking for his first career PGA Tour victory. Fleetwood, who played his first tour event in 2013, is winless in 134 PGA Tour starts. \"He's shown no ability to close on the PGA Tour over his career and this is not the field for him to finally pull it off,\" Nejad told SportsLine.\n\nHowever, Nejad is high on the chances of Wyndham Clark, who is +1600 in the Wells Fargo Championship odds. Ranked No. 3 in the world, Clark has one win, two seconds and four top-10 finishes in 10 events this season. He hasn't played since finishing third in the RBC Heritage three weeks ago.\n\nLast year, Clark set the tournament scoring record (265) and earned his first career PGA Tour victory. He is looking to become the first player in the history of the tournament to successfully defend his title. \"He is an excellent course fit as he's got the off-the-tee game and putting to contend,\" Nejad said. See which other golfers to back at SportsLine.\n\nHow to make 2024 Wells Fargo Championship picks\n\nNejad has locked in his best bets for the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship and is backing several longshots, including one that is priced at more than +4000.

In addition, a $20 million prize purse will be offered, with the winner receiving a $3.6 million reward payment.\n\nThe 21st event in the 2024 schedule will have Rory McIlroy as the top-ranked OWGR golfer, along with defending champion Wyndham Clark, who will also be markng his presence at Quail Hollow this week.

He'll be back in the hunt for the major title win at the PGA Championship next week. Here is the prize money distribution for the event:\n\nOriginally held in 2003 under the name Wachovia Championship, the tournament is primarily played at the Quail Hollow Club. Only two editions of the tournament were hosted at different golf courses. In 2017, the Eagle Point Golf Club hosted the event after Quail Hollow organized the PGA Championship. Then, in 2022, due to the Presidents Cup being held at the venue, the TPC Potomac hosted the Wells Fargo Championship.\n\nThe Quail Hollow Club is a par 71 course that spans 7,538 yards. It puts the players' skills to the test to the fullest because it's one of the hardest courses on the Tour. The 16th, 17th, and 18th are referred to as the \"Green Mile\" because of how they usually play.\n\nIn 2003, David Toms emerged victorious in the inaugural competition, defeating Robert Gamez. However, Rory McIlroy stands as the most successful player in the tournament's history having won the title in 2010, 2015, and 2021. The only other winner who has won more than once is Max Homa. He grabbed a win in 2019 and 2022.\n\nThe defending champion Wyndham Clark will have the chance to become the third multiple-time winner at Quail Hollow this week.

Positioned just before the PGA Championship, it's no coincidence that many top players participate, aiming to succeed Wyndham Clark, the 2023 winner.\n\nRory McIlroy is a prime candidate for victory here, having consistently performed well at this venue. Notably, he is the only player to have won three times -- in 2010, 2015, and 2021.\n\nWhile he cannot realistically chase the number 1 spot (Scottie Scheffler is currently too far ahead), most experts agree that the main contenders are McIlroy and Clark. Identifying underdogs in such a competitive field is challenging.\n\nMax Homa, a two-time winner, could be considered one, but with the highly qualified field, the event promises to be entertaining regardless. Players like Justin Thomas, Collin Morikawa, and Xander Schauffele are all set to compete, aiming to make the most of the 7,547-yard, par 71 course.\n\nQuail Hollow Club has its own share of history too. It hosted the Kemper Open from 1969 to 1979. In a twist of events, the 2022 Presidents Cup was held here, necessitating the relocation of the Wells Fargo Championship to Potomac, Maryland.\n\nThe course is famous for its challenging final stretch known as the \"Green Mile.\" Organized by Champions for Education, the tournament also serves a charitable purpose through its support of Teach for America. Born on May 4, 1989, in Holywood, Northern Ireland, Rory McIlroy is a professional golfer who quickly made a name for himself in the world of golf.\n\nAs a youth, he demonstrated considerable talent, first in amateur competitions where he won the Junior Ryder Cup in 2004, competed in the Walker Cup in 2007, represented Ireland at the Eisenhower Trophy in 2006, and secured five tournament victories including the European Amateur Championship in 2006 and the European Amateur Team Championship in 2007.\n\nMcIlroy turned professional at the age of 18 in September 2007. He achieved his first victory on the European PGA Tour at the Dubai Desert Classic in February 2009, followed by his first win on the American circuit at the Quail Hollow Championship in 2010.\n\nAfter securing third places in major tournaments at the 2009 PGA Championship and the 2010 Masters, McIlroy clinched his first Grand Slam title at the 2011 U.S. Open. McIlroy first reached the top of the world rankings on March 4, 2012, at just 22 years and 43 days old, shortly after winning the PGA Tour's Honda Classic in Palm Beach Gardens.\n\nOn August 12, 2012, he became the first Northern Irishman in history to win the PGA Championship, and the first Briton to do so since Tommy Armour in 1930. In 2014, McIlroy won his third major by claiming the British Open, followed by a fourth major win at the PGA Championship later that year.\n\nAdditionally, in the same year, he contributed to Europe's Ryder Cup victory over the United States, marking his second consecutive win in this prestigious team competition.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World

As a signature event, the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship field will be competing for a total purse of $20 million and a winner's share of $3.6 million. World No. 2 Rory McIlroy enters the tournament as the 13-2 betting favorite in the latest 2024 Wells Fargo Championship odds. Other top contenders in the field include Xander Schauffele (9-1), Wyndham Clark (14-1), Max Homa (22-1), Collin Morikawa (22-1) and Justin Thomas (22-1). The first tee times come at 11 a.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nClark enters as the defending tournament champion after winning the event by four strokes in 2023. Should you back Clark again this week, or would it make more sense to target a longshot like Tony Finau (35-1) or Will Zalatoris (50-1)? Before locking in your 2024 Wells Fargo Championship one and done picks, you need to see what SportsLine DFS pro and PGA expert Mike McClure has to say.\n\nThe One and Done format is growing in popularity. It has several noticeable similarities to NFL Survivor pools, with the main difference being entries are not eliminated with a bad week. Players pick one golfer per week and earn points based on their selected golfer's prize money for that tournament. Golfers can only be used once per season, and the point format makes nailing majors, signature events, and big money tournaments critical.\n\nMcClure is a DFS legend with over $2 million in career winnings, and he's been red-hot on his PGA picks dating back to the PGA Tour restart in June of 2020. McClure uses his proprietary simulation model to analyze the field and crush his golf picks.\n\nMcClure has been on fire with his One and Done picks in 2024. At The American Express he backed Justin Thomas, who finished in third place and took home $635,600. At the Genesis Invitational, McClure tabbed Patrick Cantlay, who finished in fourth place at the signature event, as his top OAD pick. At the Cognizant Classic, McClure's top one and done pick, Min Woo Lee, finished in a tie for second place. Finally, at the Arnold Palmer Invitation, another signature event, McClure recommended using Scottie Scheffler and Will Zalatoris. The Result: Scheffler won the event by five strokes, and Zalatoris finished in fourth place.\n\nHis hot steak continued at the Players Championship, where McClure again recommended using Scheffler (if was still available) and Xander Schauffele. Both players were in contention until the end, with Scheffler coming out with the win and Schauffele finishing in second place! Then, at the Valspar Championship, McClure recommended using Cameron Young, who finished in second place, in OAD pools.\n\nAt last week's CJ Cup Byron Nelson, McClure recommended using 50-1 longshot Alex Noren in One and Done pools. Noren would go on to be in contention until the end, before finishing in third place, two strokes off the lead.\n\nNow, McClure has dialed in on the Wells Fargo Championship golf tournament and just locked in his one and done picks and PGA predictions. They are a must-see for any player looking for an edge in their One and Done pool. You can only see McClure's Wells Fargo Championship 2024 one and done picks at SportsLine.\n\nTop 2024 Wells Fargo Championship One and Done picks\n\nOne of McClure's top OAD picks this week is PGA Tour veteran Justin Thomas. The former Alabama standout has 15 career PGA Tour victories and two major championships on his resume. Thomas won his first career major championship at Quail Hollow Golf & Country Club, when he captured the 2017 PGA Championship title, and he has had plenty of success at the Wells Fargo Championship through the years as well.\n\nThe 31-year-old is coming off the worst year of his professional career in 2023, but he has seemingly returned to form in 2024. Thomas has finished T12 or better five times this year, and is coming off a T5 at the RBC Heritage in his last outing. McClure is expecting Thomas to be in contention until the end at the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship. You can see who else to back at SportsLine.\n\nHow to make Wells Fargo Championship 2024 One and Done picks\n\nMcClure is also targeting another golfer for his 2024 Wells Fargo Championship one and done picks who has a long track record of success against elite competition. This multiple time PGA Tour winner has the ability to win any tournament he enters, and is one of the most talented golfers in this field. You can find out who it is, and check out all of McClure's Wells Fargo Championship one and done picks at SportsLine.\n\nWho wins the the Wells Fargo Championship 2024, and which golfers should you target for your PGA one and done picks this week at Quail Hollow Golf & Country Club? Visit SportsLine now to get Mike McClure's Wells Fargo Championship 2024 one and done picks, all from the DFS pro who called Nick Taylor's epic win at the RBC Canadian Open and Rickie Fowler's win at

That means the likes of Rory McIlroy, Xander Schauffele, Wyndham Clark and Max Homa are all available for PGA fantasy lineups and Wells Fargo Championship fantasy picks. Players of that caliber are always at the forefront of any fantasy golf strategy, but there are under-the-radar options as well as the Wells Fargo Championship 2024 tees off from Quail Hollow Club on Thursday.\n\nOne of those could be Tommy Fleetwood, who has two top 15s in his last pair of starts at Quail Hollow, in addition to a couple of top 10s over his last three starts this season on tour. The Englishman led this tournament after Round 1 last year before ultimately finishing fifth. He knows his way around Quail Hollow, but what other overlooked players could reward your fantasy golf lineups? Before making any 2024 Wells Fargo Championship fantasy golf picks, you have to see the Wells Fargo Championship fantasy golf rankings from SportsLine handicapper Eric Cohen.\n\nCohen is an avid golf bettor who correctly predicted the pre-tournament outright winner of the 2024 Masters (Scottie Scheffler, +350), Players Championship (Scheffler +550), 2023 Rocket Mortgage Classic (Rickie Fowler +1400), 2023 PGA Championship (Brooks Koepka +2000), 2023 Honda Classic (Chris Kirk +3500), 2022 Open Championship (Cameron Smith +2200), 2022 U.S. Open (Matt Fitzpatrick +2500), and 2022 Phoenix Open (Scheffler's first career victory at +2800).\n\nCohen is a contributor to SportsLine's YouTube shows including \"Early Edge\" and is the host of \"The Early Wedge\" golf show. Anyone who has followed Cohen's predictions has made positive gains on their golf picks.\n\nNow, Cohen has ranked his top golfers for the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship. Cohen's picks are only available at SportsLine.\n\n2024 Wells Fargo Championship expert picks\n\nWe can tell you that Cohen is backing the 2017 PGA Championship winner at Quail Hollow, Thomas. The two-time major winner clearly knows this course well, as he also went 4-1 at Quail Hollow when the course hosted the 2022 Presidents Cup. His four total points in that event were the second-most amongst the 24 American and international golfers competing. Additionally, Thomas finished in seventh place in his first Wells Fargo start and has two other top-25s at the event.\n\nThomas had a rough go of things at the Masters but followed that up with a fifth-place finish in his last start at the RBC Heritage at Harbour Town, which is also a signature tournament. Maybe even more importantly, he made great strides with his putter, which is the only real weakness in his game as he ranks in the top 25 in the strokes gained categories of tee-to-green, approach the green and around-the green. Cohen cites that improvement on the greens in liking Thomas at his long +3000 odds.\n\n\"Gaining nearly 2.7 strokes with the putter at Harbour Town marked his best putting tournament of the season and could a sign of things to come,\" Cohen told SportsLine. \"Even in the midst of a poor 2023, JT gained more than seven strokes ball striking here en route to a T14, so if he can putt even slightly above average, watch out.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Cohen is fading Patrick Cantlay at +1600. The 2021 FedEx Cup champion has contested three stroke play tournaments at this course with tying for 21st at last year's Wells Fargo being his best showing. He'd likely be happy with a 21st place finish this week as he's finished 22nd or worse in four of his last five starts this season.\n\nCantlay's iron play has been his weak link as he ranks outside the top 100 on tour in both strokes gained: approach the green and greens in regulation percentage. Even when managing to find the green, his putter is letting him down as he ranks 80th in putting average after ranking 16th last year. The small greens at Quail Hollow don't foreshadow much success for someone struggling to land on them, so Cohen is avoiding Cantlay for fantasy golf picks for this week, saying, \"The irons and putter simply haven't been consistent in 2024. He finished T23 here last year despite losing more than two strokes on approach, so tread carefully again this week.\" See all of Cohen's Wells Fargo Championship picks at SportsLine.\n\nHow to set 2024 Wells Fargo Championship Fantasy golf lineups\n\nFor this week, Cohen is backing several underdogs in his 2024 Wells Fargo Championship fantasy golf picks, including a triple-digit longshot who \"performed above average in all statistical categories\" at this event last year and could help spice up your Fantasy golf lineups. See who it is, and get all of Cohen's fantasy golf picks, at SportsLine.\n\nWho wins Wells Fargo Championship 2024, and who are the top players to target for your PGA fantasy golf picks?

Last year's winner and final leaderboard explored", "body": "The upcoming 2024 Wells Fargo Championship is the next tournament on the PGA Tour after the conclusion of The CJ Cup Byron Nelson 2024. Set to begin on May 9 at the Quail Hollow Club, the event will feature some of the biggest names in the world of golf.\n\nHence, there is plenty of anticipation around the event. However, before the 2024 edition of the tournament begins, it's important to know who won the 2023 edition of it. Last year's edition was won by American professional golfer Wyndham Clark.\n\nAt last year's event, Clark registered a 4-stroke victory over Xander Schauffele who finished in second place. Due to his victory at the event, Clark took home a staggering sum of $3,600,000, whereas Schauffele and third-place winners Harris English and Tyrrell Hatton took home $2,180,000 and $1,180,000, respectively.\n\nWhile Wyndham Clark enjoyed his win last year, in 2024 he is set to return and defend his title. It will be interesting to see if Clark can retain his title given the amount of talent he is going to go up against at the event.\n\nWells Fargo to reportedly discontinue their golf tournament sponsorship after the 2024 event\n\nSince 2011, the Wells Fargo Championship has been one of the most prestigious events on the PGA Tour. Before the San Fransisco-based company sponsored the tournament, it was known as the Wachovia Championship in 2003 and the Quail Hollow Championship in 2009 and 2010.\n\nHowever, the tournament became most popular by the name Wells Fargo Championship when the company decided to come on board as a sponsor. While the company has enjoyed a successful relationship with the tournament since 2011, reports suggest they are set to discontinue their sponsorship.\n\nErik Spanberg from the Charlotte Business Journal reported the news. On his social media handle (X), Spanberg wrote:\n\n\"Breaking: @WellsFargo ending @WellsFargoGolf sponsorship with 2024 tournament in May.\"\n\nAn official statement from the company via the Charlotte Business Journal further expanded on their decision to not continue their sponsorship. The statement read:\n\n\"Wells Fargo is not renewing the Wells Fargo Championship as a Signature Event in 2025 and beyond. To drive efficiency and support our business long term, we regularly review and adjust our overall sponsorship strategy. We are incredibly proud of the 20-plus year history of the championship.\"\n\nIt further read:\n\n\"The tournament has generated significant local impact and delighted golf fans in Charlotte and across the country. Since 2003, the Wells Fargo Championship has generated more than $30 million in support of numerous charitable foundations.\"\n\nWhile the sponsorship will come to an end after the 2024 edition, the Quail Hollow Club does not intend to shut down the tournament. They are keen on finding new sponsors. Once the 2024 edition of this tournament ends, it will be interesting to see who will be the new sponsors.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "varun_anand_bhat@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Varun Anand Bhat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_golfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional golfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrrell_Hatton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrrell Hatton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_English", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harris English"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_City_Business_Journals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American City Business Journals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/93484-17150880581622-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547461", "eventUri": "eng-9547461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 152, "textEnd": 157}], "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The former Wake Forest golfer has seven runner-up finishes in his young career. That includes a second-place finish in the 2022 Wells Fargo Championship.\n\nYoung is also no stranger to success in golf's biggest events with two top-fives in majors including a runner-up finish in the 2022 Open Championship. Quail Hollow, a major-caliber course that hosted the 2017 PGA Championship, suits his game.\n\nSimply put, Theegala has been a stud in PGA Tour signature events this season. In five tournaments, he's posted three top-10s including a pair of runner-up finishes.\n\nLong off the tee, Theegala is statistically the best putter on the PGA Tour over the last 36 rounds. Those are two major ingredients for success at Quail Hollow.\n\nOur fondness for Bahtia grew a few weeks back when he won the Texas Valero Open at +6500. That's the type of winning ticket we're looking for again in the Wells Fargo.\n\nBahtia, a smooth-swinging lefty, outlasted Denny McCarthy in a playoff to score his first win on the PGA Tour. He appears to be the next coming of Theegala given his style of play.\n\nMcCarthy is knocking on the door of his first win. The loss to Theegala in Texas marked his latest disappointment, but last year's runner-up finish in the highly regarded Memorial Tournament might have stung more.\n\nMcCarthy led the way for most of the final round until a bogey on No. 18 left him in a playoff with Viktor Hovland, last year's FedEx Cup Series champion. Another bogey on No. 18 in the playoff sealed his fate.\n\nMcCarthy is widely considered the best putter on tour, and he showed out with a T-8 finish in last year's Wells Fargo Championship. He could be this year's Wyndham Clark at very similar odds.\n\nFull disclosure: Recency bias is influencing this longshot selection. Knapp held the lead at the midway point of last weekend's CJ Cup Byron Nelson in Texas. The mullet-sporting Californian couldn't close the deal, and we cashed a live bet on Taylor Pendrith to win heading into the third round.\n\nBut Knapp left a lasting impression with his length off the tee and precise iron play. He scored his maiden victory in this year's Mexico Open, and his T-8 finish last weekend gives us good form heading into the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship.\n\nOur favorite sportsbooks for betting on golf all summer long can be found below.

Below we will continue our PGA Tour odds series with a Wells Fargo prediction and pick. We will also let you know how to watch the event.\n\nThis is a signature event, so there is a limited field. Last season, Wyndham Clark beat the field by four strokes at 19-under par. Clark shot eight-under in the third round of the event to take a commanding lead. He was able to take home the gold because of it.\n\nThis year, players do not have to try to be Scottie Scheffler as he is not taking part in the event because of the birth of his first child. There are still great players participating, though. The course is Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, North Carolina. It should play a little easier than some of the other courses on tour, but golfers still need to be at their best.\n\nHere are the Wells Fargo Championship odds, courtesy of FanDuel\n\nFavorite Picks for the Wells Fargo Championship\n\nRory McIlroy: McIlroy is coming off a win at the team play Zurich Classic. He needed it, too. McIlroy has made every cut this season, but that was his first win. Along with that, McIlroy seven top-25 finishes, and two top-10 finishes. He is the favorite to win this event, and it would not be a surprise to see it happen.\n\nWyndham Clark: Clark is the defending champion of this event, and he is playing very well this season. He is coming off a third-place finish at the RBC Heritage, and he has two other second-place finishes. Clark is second in total strokes gained on tour this season, and he is great on the greens. If Clark is striking the ball well, he is a threat to win any event he participates in.\n\nMax Homa: Homa has made nine of 10 cuts this season, and he has a third-place finish at the Masters under his belt. He followed that up with a not-so-great finish at the RBC Heritage, but he should be able to play well this weekend. Homa needs to be better off the tee, but if he striking his driver well, he will shoot low in this event.\n\nSleeper Picks for the Wells Fargo Championship\n\nJustin Thomas: Thomas has only made six of his nine cuts this season, but when he makes the cut, he finishes well. He has three top-10 finishes in those made cuts. That includes a fifth-place finish at the RBC Heritage in his last played event. Thomas has a great approach shot, and his putter has been good all season. He does have a tendency to struggle at times, but if he is on, he is going to finish at the top of this leaderboard.\n\nViktor Hovland: Hovland's odds seem high for this event considering he is a top-10 golfer in the entire world. He is not having a great season in 2024, but he is still seventh in the OWGR. However, his best finish this season is a T19. He struggled at the Masters as he did not make the cut, and Hovland has not teed off since then. Hovland has the ability to win any event he plays in, though. He has taken some time off, so there was plenty of time to work on his game. I expect Hovland to turn his season around in this event.\n\nFinal Wells Fargo Championship prediction and pick\n\nThis is going to be a fun event to watch. The Wells Fargo Championship seems even more wide open with Scottie Scheffler being out. Because of this, I think there is going to be a little bit of a surprise winner. I say surprise, but this is actually a good golfer. I am going to take Justin Thomas to win the Wells Fargo Championship. When he makes the cut, he finishes high on the leaderboard.

McIlroy, the Wells Fargo champion in 2010, 2015 and 2021, is the highest-ranked player in the field (No. 2) and the tournament favorite after he teamed up with Shane Lowry to win the Zurich Classic of New Orleans two weeks ago.\n\nWhile McIlroy is entangled with the latest off-the-course news -- a plan for him to take over Webb Simpson's seat on the PGA Tour policy board garnered resistance from some of his peers -- he feels winning the team event in New Orleans \"freed\" him up a bit.\n\n\"I think it did a world of good for both of us, for Shane and I, just in terms of setting us up for the rest of the season, giving us some confidence knowing that we could get the job done whenever we needed to,\" the Northern Irishman said.\n\nThe only player ranked higher in the Official World Golf Ranking, Scottie Scheffler, is taking another week off as he and his wife Meredith Scheffler await the birth of their first child. Sweden's Ludvig Aberg (the World No. 6) also backed out to tend to a knee issue, but seven of the world's top 10 are in Charlotte to prepare for the next major championship while also chasing a major payday.\n\n\"This is one of my favorite tour events, one of my favorite golf courses,\" defending champion Wyndham Clark said. \"If there's anything that I before the year get excited about, it's this event. So I'm really focused on this week. It's fun, it's my first chance to defend. I don't know what that's like, so it's been exciting.\"\n\nClark shot a course-record 265 last year en route to beating Xander Schauffele by four strokes. Six weeks later, the previously anonymous Clark broke through and won his first major at the U.S. Open.\n\nA lot has changed for the 30-year-old, who entered last year's Wells Fargo ranked No. 163 in the world. He's now No. 3.\n\n\"It's honestly really humbling and fun to be in this position,\" Clark said. \"I'm just really looking to continue to grow and get better. I like to think this is just the beginning, and hopefully it's the start of a lot of really good golf in the future years.\"\n\nClark, Schauffele and Lowry make up one threesome that will tee off on the back nine of Quail Hollow on Thursday. The tournament moved first-round tee times back three hours in reaction to thunderstorms in the weather forecast. The first groups will go off at 11 a.m.\n\nThat won't be a problem for such a small field, a distillation of the best players on the PGA Tour and the players who've earned their way into signature events via the Aon Swing 5. Last week's winner of the CJ Cup Byron Nelson, Taylor Pendrith of Canada, and last week's runner-up Ben Kohles are in the field via that pathway.\n\nAnother player to watch is Max Homa, who not only won the event in 2019 and 2022 but also went a perfect 4-0-0 at the 2022 Presidents Cup held at Quail Hollow.\n\n\"Yeah, always one of my favorite cities that we go to,\" Homa said. \"I love this place, love the food, got family, friends here, love the golf course, have some cool memories that I always get to kind of reminisce on. ... Unfortunately might not get the best weather, so I'm soaking in what we've got today.\"", "source": {"uri": "deadspin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadspin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Pendrith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Pendrith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Kohles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Kohles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Homa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Homa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidents Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/311007f3ce1e02b8283ae527df54ea5f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547461", "eventUri": "eng-9547461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5686274509803921, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

After taking the Wells Fargo title in 2023, he added two more victories to his ledger, prevailing at the U.S. Open last June before winning the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am just three months ago.\n\nIn seven events since Pebble Beach, Clark has missed the cut twice, but he has also come away with three top-five finishes. He landed in second at the Arnold Palmer Invitational on March 10, then tied for second at The Players Championship a week later.\n\nClark most recently finished T3 at the RBC Heritage, and he's been able to find the silver lining when it comes to finishing just behind the leader.\n\n\"I just think the more times I put myself in contention, the better I get even if I don't win. So recently coming up short in Bay Hill and at The Players, I learned a lot,\" Clark said. \"I mean, even though I had won three times prior to those two second-place finishes, I still was learning. I just think the more I put myself in that situation, the better I'm going to get and learn.\n\n\"And as you put yourself in those positions, you want to be in those positions more. So that's really what I look forward to every week when we tee it up on Thursday.\"\n\nEven though another one of his titles will be on the line in just over a month at the U.S. Open, Clark insists that he isn't overlooking the Wells Fargo Championship by any means.\n\n\"This is one of my favorite Tour events, one of my favorite golf courses,\" Clark said of the Wells Fargo, which is held at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, N.C. \"If there's anything that I before the year get excited about, it's this event.

He has yet to record a hole-in-one, but he did secure an M.A. in Sports Journalism from St. Bonaventure University.\n\nQuail Hollow Club, the host of this week's Wells Fargo Championship, is one of the more challenging courses the PGA Tour visits each year. It requires precision from tee to green.\n\nFunny enough, this venue will host the PGA Championship again next year, eight years after Justin Thomas won his first major championship at Quail Hollow in 2017. The course also hosted the 2022 Presidents Cup, in which the Americans defeated the Internationals, 17.5 to 12.5.\n\nBig hitters, who can also find plenty of greens, tend to do well on this golf course, but accuracy is also a must, as Shane Lowry explained in his pre-tournament press conference.\n\nWith this intel in mind, SB Nation's Playing Through staff has submitted their picks for the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship:\n\nEarlier this year, we saw Scottie Scheffler become the first back-to-back winner at The Players.\n\nWe will see more history this weekend as Wyndham Clark will become the first player to win the Wells Fargo in consecutive years.\n\nHe set the course record last year, and it is no wonder why. Clark's game fits this course beautifully. The reigning U.S. Open champion is one of the longest hitters on tour, and with Quail Hollow listed beyond 7,500 yards, that is essential.\n\nBut even more importantly, you need to be precise both off the tee and on approach. Clark ranks in the top 15 on tour in strokes gained: off the tee, on approach, and even putting. We have all seen Clark catch fire with the flat stick numerous times this year, with no better example than what he did at Pebble Beach.\n\nOne year ago, Clark made a name for himself. He has since proven that he is no one-hit-wonder and will cap off one of the most underrated 12 months of golf in recent memory this week.\n\nOf those players without a PGA Tour victory in 2024, nobody has played better than Xander Schauffele, who ranks third in total strokes gained this season.\n\nI believe he finally breaks into the winner's circle this week at Quail Hollow, where he finished in solo second -- four strokes behind Wyndham Clark -- at this event a year ago. Schauffele also tied for 14th in 2021.\n\nThe former San Diego State Aztec ranks 10th in strokes gained off the tee and is 27th in strokes gained approaching the green -- both solid attributes on this challenging golf course.\n\nThe question is whether he can make some putts, as he routinely puts himself in the best positions. He tied for second at The Players and finished solo eighth at The Masters, but if he could have holed a few more on the greens, those solid performances may have turned into memorable wins.\n\nAlas, I am confident Schauffele will do just that this week on these re-surfaced and smoothened putting surfaces. He will gallop into Kentucky full of confidence for next week's PGA Championship, fresh off his eighth career PGA Tour victory.\n\nEarly Wednesday, Rory McIlroy discussed how this tournament is one of his favorite stops on the PGA Tour, and rightfully so. The Northern Irishman has triumphed at Quail Hollow three times before, with his most recent victory coming in 2021.\n\nKnowing how much he loves this golf course and how big hitters tend to play well here, I believe McIlroy will win the Wells Fargo Championship for a fourth time.\n\nHis game is rounding into form, as evidenced by his dramatic victory at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans alongside Shane Lowry.\n\nMcIlroy has demonstrated accuracy off the tee this season, too, finding the short grass 71.16% of the time -- good for 17th on the PGA Tour. That will surely help him at this Signature Event, which puts a premium on precision.\n\nFor all other sports betting content, check out SB Nation's DraftKings site.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_milko@sbnation.com", "name": "Jack Milko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bonaventure_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Bonaventure University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Players_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Players Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidents Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_in_one", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hole in one"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Lowry_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shane Lowry (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach_Golf_Links", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach Golf Links"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SB Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_State_University", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego State University"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IwxkHxIAcKWYEx9lXRLTlBx_QEc=/0x326:5000x2826/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25437864/1488277622.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547461", "eventUri": "eng-9547461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The event takes place over four days, and will pit some of the very best golfers in the world against one another.\n\nThe first tee-times kick off today, and will continue through to Sunday, May 12, with several different groups set to face off. The Advanced Main Feed includes former winners of the tournament such as Rory McIlory, while the Expanded Marquee and Featured groups include five of the world's top 10 players.\n\nIt's one of the newer events on the PGA Tour, and even more so as one of the eight Signature Events on this year's calendar. Former names for this competition include the Quail Hollow Championship and the Wachovia Championship, with the latter being its inaugural title for the 2003 edition, won by David Toms.\n\nThere's plenty of world-class golf to keep up with over the next four days, and your best place to do so for this year's Wells Fargo Championship is right here with The Sporting News.\n\nAs one of the key events on the PGA Tour, and one that lines up perfectly with local time (ET) on the US's Eastern Seaboard, terrestrial TV coverage of this year's Wells Fargo Championship comes via both NBC and CBS, as well as on the Golf Channel, the home of the sport in the States.\n\nThe action begins on each day live at 11:00 a.m ET, but both the Golf Channel and ESPN+ are showing replays of the action throughout the weekend.\n\nIf the Wells Fargo Championship is not available to watch live in your location or if you're traveling abroad, you can use a Virtual Private Network (VPN). VPNs provide a secure and private online connection, allowing you to bypass geographical restrictions to access your favorite streaming services from any device anywhere in the world.\n\nThe best place to make sure you catch every single bit of the action is with ESPN+, who will provide subscribers with access to more than 4,300 live and exclusive hours covering 35 tournaments across the 2024 calendar.\n\nAll four feeds from this year's Wells Fargo Open - Main Feed, Marquee Group, Featured Holes and Featured Groups - are available to watch both live and on catch-up with ESPN+. Peacock is also steaming the action across the four days.\n\nParamount+ and Fubo, both of which are offering FREE trials to new users, will also be live streaming the action in the latter stages of the tournament.\n\nAfter two one-year spells away in Wilmington NC and as far away as Potomac in 2017 and 2022, the Wells Fargo Championship continues at the Quail Hollow Club just south of Charlotte, NC.\n\nThe course is somewhat unique in that the majority of matches are played on the 16th, 17th and 18th holes, and as such the difficult, lengthy course is known as the 'Green Mile'.\n\nLimited ticket packages for this year's Wells Fargo Championship can still be purchased via StubHub, which has everything to know regarding ticket prices, discounts and much more.\n\nHurry though, as multi-day passes are already sold out, and Saturday, May 11 is currently shaping up to follow suit as the field narrows on day three of the tournament.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_Channel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Toms", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Toms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrestrial television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuboTV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FuboTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Guts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Guts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-05/Wells%20Fargo%20Championship%20sleeper%20picks%20%26%20longshots.jpg?itok=Amurh7HQ", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547461", "eventUri": "eng-9547461", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 386, "textEnd": 392}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 3118, "textEnd": 3124}], "sentiment": 0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

This is the sixth Signature Event played on the PGA Tour this season and it'll be without World No. 1, Scottie Scheffler, as he's expecting his first child to be born any day now.\n\n69 golfers who managed to qualify with top finishes or outright wins are set to tee it off at this cut-free Signature Event. Precision off-the-tee and on approach are key, as there are plenty of water hazards and narrow fairways to conquer. In this article, we'll label and analyze several golfers who deserve consideration in one-and-done leagues and survivor contests.\n\nMake sure to follow me on X @Matt_MacKay_ for more free betting insights and advice throughout the week!\n\nCheck out PoolGenius One-and-Done Golf Pool Tools \"\n\nRory McIlroy\n\nA three-time winner at the Wells Fargo Championship, Rory McIlroy is riding high off of his team win with Shane Lowry at the Zurich Classic. McIlroy hasn't been stellar playing in the traditional solo format this season though, so despite his previous accomplishments at Quail Hollow Club, use caution before deploying him as your one-and-done pick this week.\n\nWyndham Clark\n\nThe defending champion, Wyndham Clark, broke through with his first career PGA Tour win at Quail Hollow in 2023. Since then, Clark has gone on to add two more wins, including an outright victory at Pebble Beach earlier this year. He's also had several runner-up finishes, including a brutal in-and-out birdie putt on the 72nd hole during The PLAYERS Championship, which was also a Signature Event.\n\nSecondary Options\n\nMax Homa\n\nMax Homa has won the Wells Fargo Championship twice since 2019, so he's one of the betting favorites this week at Quail Hollow. Homa's best outing came at Augusta National, contending late into Sunday before a bad tee shot on a par 3 derailed his momentum. He's clearly comfortable playing at this course, so if you still have Homa available, he's a strong prospect to use this week.\n\nTommy Fleetwood\n\nStill searching for his first outright win on the PGA Tour, Englishman Tommy Fleetwood is one of the best players when it comes to the driver. He's accurate and can stripe the ball far, creating good lies to give himself numerous birdie and eagle opportunities. Fleetwood recorded a T5 finish at this event in 2023, so he's certainly another strong candidate to consider using in survivor leagues.\n\nSneaky Plays\n\nSahith Theegala\n\nSahith Theegala had a forgettable debut at Quail Hollow in 2023, winding up T56, going over par in two of four rounds. In 2023, he's ranked 21st strokes gained: off-the-tee, 38th strokes gained: approaching the green, and eighth strokes gained: putting. This qualifies him as a great sneaky play to deploy in one-and-done formats at the Wells Fargo Championship.\n\nMatt Fitzpatrick\n\nT35 and T2 finishes have been the final results for Englishman Matt Fitzpatrick at Quail Hollow in 2023 and 2022. He's had a bit of a down year, but Fitzpatrick does rank 28th strokes gained: putting and can hunt flagsticks with his irons when he's dialed in. Ranking 12th total driving and 31st going for the green, Fitzpatrick is another sneaky play this week.\n\nFavorite One-And-Done: Brendon Todd\n\nBelieve it or not, Brendon Todd, who oddsmakers value at 170-1 in the outright winner betting market, is my favorite one-and-done golfer to use at the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship. Todd ranks inside the top-40 for strokes gained: around-the-green and top-20 strokes gained: putting.

It was Clark's 1st career PGA TOUR win, then he went on to win the 2023 U.S. Open a month later. Now, Clark is one of the best players on TOUR entering the 2024 Wells Fargo at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Wells Fargo is one of the TOUR's five \"signature events\" with no cut.\n\nThere is a $20 million prize pool and the winner walks away with $3.6 million. Quail Hollow is the perfect tune-up for next week's PGA Championship. It was the course used for the 2017 PGA Championship and will be the site for next year's PGA Championship. Mercifully, World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler is taking this week off, like my original pick to win the 2024 Wells Fargo, Ludvig \u00c5berg.\n\nHopefully, Scheffler's absence helps me pick up a much-needed win this week. I bonked off 3.19 units (u) at THE CJ CUP Byron Nelson last week, bringing my PGA TOUR 2024 bankroll down to -40.81u. I don't know if I'm brave, stupid or both. But, let's dive into my betting card for the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship. (Only make \"finishing position\" bets at BetMGM since it doesn't apply \"dead heat\" rules).\n\nStats courtesy of Bet The Number from the Tour Junkies and the PGA Tour.\n\nThe odds chosen are the best available at legal U.S. sportsbooks as of 12:30 p.m. ET Tuesday, May 7th.\n\nSahith is due for a win in a \"big-boy\" event. Theegala won the 2023 Fortinet Championship in the FedExCup Fall season and has five top 10s this year. Those include second at The Sentry, fifth at the WM Phoenix Open, T6 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, T9 at THE PLAYERS Championship, and second at the RBC Heritage. Four were \"signature events\" on the TOUR this season and the Phoenix Open was an \"elevated event\" last year.\n\nTheegala performs well in \"signature events\" because he is good throughout the bag. His chipping stats are subpar this year, but Theegala is 9th on TOUR in Strokes Gained (SG): Putting. He ranked 22nd on TOUR in SG: Around-the-Green (ARG) in 2022-23 and I expect Sahith to improve ARG eventually this year.\n\nRegardless, he is 10th in Ball Striking this season, so Theegala might be putting instead of chipping at Quail Hollow. The TOUR blends greens-in-regulation rate with Total Driving to produce its ball-striking stats. Over the last 40 rounds, Sahith is 9th in this field for SG: Off-the-Tee (OTT) and 16th in SG: Approach (APP), according to Bet The Number.\n\nThere is value on Theegala here because he has no marquee wins on his resume and finished T56 last year in the Wells Fargo. But, Sahith is only 26-years-old and Quail Hollow is one of the toughest courses on TOUR, so the experience will help him. My \"buy price\" for Theegala to break through at the Wells Fargo is +2500. I'll happily bet him at +3000.\n\n_____________________________\n\nThis is a value/nostalgia play. Last season, I was getting waxed almost as badly as this year. But, I hammered Hovland for his 2023 BMW and TOUR Championship wins to nearly break even betting on the 2022-23 PGA TOUR season. And I'm even more desperate now than at the start of last year's FedExCup Playoffs.\n\nHovland made my betting card for the 2023 Wells Fargo and played well for the first three rounds. Heading into the final round last year, Viktor was 7-seven under par and shot a 77 to eject out of the tournament. Granted, he wasn't going to win the Wells Fargo anyway, but his T43 finish is misleading.\n\nThe Norwegian was T3 in his only other start at Quail Hollow in 2021. Moreover, we are getting a great price on Hovland because his season is off to a terrible start. The 26-year-old has zero top-10s this year with his best finish being a T19 at the Genesis. Buyer beware because Viktor could just be broken this year.\n\nThat said, if anyone has the game to turn it around, it's Hovland. Quail Hollow is one of the longest courses on the TOUR's circuit. Over the last 30 rounds, Hovland leads the field in APP shots from 175+ yards out and ranks fourth in SG: OTT. His ARG-play is back to being awful, nonetheless, Viktor has the ball striking to stick if near the pin for four consecutive days.\n\nThen there are a few guys who \"probably\" shouldn't have better odds, but I can understand why they do. These guys include Hovland, Justin Thomas (+2200), and Theegala (+2500). JT hasn't won since the 2022 PGA Championship. Theegala's only win came at the 2023 Fortinet Championship in November with a weak during the FedExCup Fall schedule.\n\nAs the president of Matsuyama's fan club, I'm insulted by him having the same odds as Byeong Hun An. Fleetwood, Young, and An have never won on the PGA TOUR. Hideki won The Genesis Invitational in February, a \"signature event\" with Scheffler in the field. Either way, Matsuyama is criminally underrated and I don't get it.\n\nMy only explanation for getting +3500 odds on the 2021 Masters champion is he hasn't played at Quail Hollow since 2019 and Hideki's best finish in the Wells Fargo is a T11 in 2016. However, Matsuyama tied for fifth in the 2017 PGA Championship held at Quail Hollow and played in the second-to-last group in the final round with the eventual winner, JT.\n\nHideki leads this Scheffler-less field in SG: Tee-to-Green (T2G) over the last 20 rounds, per Bet The Number, and No. 1 on my Wells Fargo power rankings. Before his disappointing T38 at The Masters, Matsuyama was on a heater. After the Genesis win, Hideki finished T12 at the Arnold Palmer (\"signature event\"), T6 at THE PLAYERS (\"signature event\"), and T7 at the Valero Texas Open.\n\nUltimately, these odds are disrespectful because Matsuyama has true \"win equity\" in this limited field whereas most of these other golfers don't. Since this is a no-cut event and Hideki can shoot a 7-under round at any course in the world, I'm placing a bet for him to finish top-10 too.\n\n_____________________________\n\nWilly Z is a big-game hunter who performs well on tough courses. Zalatoris has seven top-10 finishes in 11 career majors. This season, Will tied for second at The Genesis, T4 at the Arnold Palmer, and T9 at The Masters. All are \"big-boy\" events. His short-game is a concern, but Zalatoris is still dialed in with the irons. The Wake Forest alum is sixth in this field for SG: APP and 12th in APP shots from 175+ yards.\n\nLike Matsuyama, Zalatoris has worse odds than a bunch of golfers he is better than. He withdrew from THE CJ CUP Byron Nelson to give his surgically repaired back some rest. He missed most of last season with a back injury. Because of this, golf bettors are hesitant to back him. Nevertheless, Zalatoris will pop at one of these tournaments, most likely at one of these \"signature events\".\n\n_____________________________\n\nMake all placement bets at BetMGM since it doesn't apply \"dead heat\" rules.\n\nBesides betting Scheffler to win, taking Xander to finish in the top 10 is the most profitable bet you can make on TOUR in 2024. He has seven top-10s this year: T10 at The Sentry, T3 at The American Express, T9 at the Farmers, T4 at The Genesis, T2 at THE PLAYERS, T5 at the Valspar Championship, and 8th at The Masters.\n\nWith Scheffler not playing this week, Schauffele is No. 2 in my 2024 Wells Fargo power rankings. He finished second here last season and doesn't have a weakness in his game. Aside from actually winning a tournament, which Xander hasn't done since going back-to-back at the Genesis Scottish Open and Travelers Championship in 2022.\n\nFurthermore, the San Diego State graduate finished solo second behind Clark at the 2023 Wells Fargo while gaining strokes in all the major golf stats. Last year, Schauffele was +10.7 SG: T2G, +4.5 SG: OTT, +3.7 SG: APP, and +4.8 SG: Putting at Quail Hollow.\n\nI'm okay with missing out on Schauffele's next win because I'm not betting him at less than +1400 odds. I've been burned too many times by him. However, Xander will find a way to cash a top-10 in the Wells Fargo. Whether it be choking away or \"sneaking in the backdoor\" in the final round.\n\nI'm still mad at Knapp for squandering away a sick payday for me by puking all over himself in the final round at last week's Byron Nelson. He was one stroke behind the eventual winner, Taylor Pendrith, entering Sunday and carded a disappointing 1-under to finish solo eighth. I'm going to forgive Knapp because his game fits this course nicely.\n\nPlus-power OTT and precision with your long irons are a good prerequisite for Quail Hollow. Well, Knapp is fourth in this field for Ball Speed over the last 30 rounds, according to Bet The Number. He can be inaccurate OTT, but Clark won the 2023 Wells Fargo despite his driving accuracy being 12.0% worse than the field, per DataGolf.com.\n\nLastly, Knapp is fifth in this field for SG: APP, 15th in APP shots from 175+ yards, and 19th in SG: Putting on Overseed, the grass used for Quail Hollow's greens. Even if Jake struggles in the first two rounds, he can backdoor a top-20 by firing at pins and rolling the rock.\n\nThe Frenchman is ninth in the FedExCup standings in his first season as a PGA TOUR pro. Pavon finished T7 at the Sony Open in his first start on TOUR, won the Farmers, followed it up with a solo third at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am the week after, and tied for 12th as a debutante at The Masters.\n\nPavon's biggest weakness is chipping. However, I'll overlook that given the price. He is 14th on TOUR this season in SG: APP, 15th in Total Driving, which blends distance with accuracy, and 19th in SG: Putting. His impressive performances at Pebble Beach and Augusta give me confidence he over-performs his odds again at this \"signature event\".\n\n_____________________________\n\nMy One-And-Done league used the Zurich Classic as a bye week. After the 16 events of the 2024 Mayo Cup. I'm tied for 1,511th out of 4,400 entries with $$6,500,122 collected and I'm out of the money if the Mayo Cup ends today.\n\nUsually, I use someone from my betting card for my one-and-done league. If his odds weren't trampled by Scheffler skipping this event, I'd have an outright on McIlroy But, I'm switching it up for the Wells Fargo because Rory is a three-time winner of this event and I'm hoping the other players in my league save him for a major. Also, I'm sinking in the standings and need a massive payday.\n\n_____________________________\n\nFollow me on X (or Twitter, whatever) @Geoffery-Clark and check out my OutKick Bets Podcast for more betting content and random rants.

Sahith Theegala", "body": "The 2024 Wells Fargo Championship tees off in less than 24 hours. The tournament will be held from May 9 to 12 at Quail Hollow Golf and Country Club.\n\nLast year, Wyndham Clark emerged victorious at the Quail Hollow Golf Club and will look to mirror the performance this year too. As per BetMGM Sportsbook, he has +1400 odds to win this year.\n\nRory McIlroy, World No. 2, in the absence of Scottie Scheffler, is the favorite to win the Wells Fargo Championship with odds of +750. Xander Schauffele, the world number three, has odds of +900. He is followed by Patrick Cantlay (+1600), Collin Morikawa (+2200) and Max Homa (+2200).\n\nHowever, several players would look to steal the spotlight at the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship. Let's take a look at the top 5 sleeper picks for the tournament.\n\nTop 5 sleeper picks for the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship\n\n#1 Harris English\n\nHarris English has had seven top-25 finishes in the 2024 season so far. His best finish came at the Genesis Invitational where he finished a solo seventh. He has been performing consistently after undergoing surgery for a torn labrum in his right hip. English's odds of +5000 confirm his underdog status at the tournament.\n\nThe 34-year-old is ranked 47 in the Official World Golf Rankings. Last year, English had a podium finish at the 2023 Wells Fargo Championship. He finished T3 with seven strokes behind the defending champion Wyndham Clark. English last won in 2021 Travelers Championship and would look to end his drought.\n\n#2 Sahith Theegala\n\nSahith Theegala has performed consistently throughout the year. He has had five top-10 finishes in the 2024 season. He comes from a solo second finish at the RBC Heritage.\n\nTheegala has +450 odds to finish in the top 5 at the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship. The 26-year-old is currently ranked 12th in the OWGR rankings.\n\n#3 Brendon Todd\n\nBrendon Todd has +600 odds to finish in the top 10 at the Quail Golf Club. Todd has a great record at the tournament. Last year, Todd finished T8 and in 2019, he finished T18.\n\nThis year, Todd's best finish of T6 came at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in March. He ranks 20th among PGA Tour players in fairways hit. He is also positioned 18th in the classic metric of Strokes Gained: Putting. Todd is currently ranked 64th in the OWGR rankings.\n\n#4 Kevin Tway\n\nKevin Tway of the United States is another sleeper pick with odds of +500 to finish in the top 20 at the Wells Fargo Championship. Tway is ranked 221st in the OWGR rankings.\n\nThe Oklahoma native's best finish, a solo third, in the 2024 season came at the Corales Puntacana Championship on the PGA Tour. He comes from a strong T9 finish at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson. He also finished T11 with Kelly Kraft at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans.\n\n#5 Emiliano Grillo\n\nEmiliano Grillo has odds of +215 to finish in the top 30 at the Quail Hollow Golf Club. Grillo, the World No. 46, has performed consistently at the venue with three top-25 finishes since 2018.\n\nIn the 2024 season, he has had a T7 and T8 finish in the Sony Open and Arnold Palmer Invitational, respectively, and would look to prove his mettle in the tournament.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It also provides the 69-player field an opportunity to compete without red-hot Scottie Scheffler to contend with ahead of next week's PGA Championship.\n\nOur golf experts preview the tournament and provide their favorite prop picks along with best bets to win this week.\n\nWELLS FARGO CHAMPIONSHIP\n\nLocation: Wells Fargo Championship, Charlotte, N.C., May 9-12\n\nCourse: Quail Hollow Club (Par 71, 7,558 Yards)\n\nPurse: $20M (Winners: $3.6M)\n\nDefending Champion: Wyndham Clark\n\nFedEx Cup Leader: Scottie Scheffler\n\nHOW TO FOLLOW\n\nTV: Thursday-Friday: 2-6 p.m. (Golf Channel); Saturday-Sunday: 1-3 p.m. (GC), 3-6 p.m. (CBS)\n\nStreaming (ESPN+): Thursday-Friday, 11 a.m.-6 p.m. ET; Saturday-Sunday, 7:15 a.m.-6 p.m.\n\nX: @WellsFargoGolf\n\nPROP PICKS\n\n--Xander Schauffele to Beat Rory McIlroy (+105 at DraftKings): Yes, McIlroy is coming off a win in his last start and yes, he has an excellent track record at Quail Hollow. But the win came in a team event against a modest field and his results to date in 2024 have been mediocre by his standards. While Schauffele doesn't hoist a lot of trophies, he does rack up top-10s -- including seven through his first 10 starts this season.\n\n--Hideki Matsuyama Top 20 (+100 at BetMGM): Matsuyama tees it up for the first time since the Masters, where he tied for 38th. Previous to that, he had a win and was no worse than T12 in four starts. The Japanese star is well rested and only needs to beat 49 players for this prop to pay.\n\n--Tommy Fleetwood Top Englishman (+100 at DraftKings): Fleetwood tied for fifth here last year and had a pair of top-10s before tying for 49th in his most recent start at the RBC Heritage. The other two players in this prop are Matt Fitzpatrick (+150) and Justin Rose (+450). Fitzpatrick tied for 35th at Quail Hollow last year while Rose was not in the field.\n\n2024 Prop Picks Record: 25-27-1\n\nBEST BETS\n\n--Rory McIlroy (+750 at BetMGM) is coming off a victory at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans with Shane Lowry and has three career victories at Quail Hollow. He is the book's biggest liability this week as McIlroy leads the field with 22.2 percent of the money backing him to win since opening at +900.\n\n--Xander Schauffele (+1000) has four consecutive top-20s, including a T2 at The Players. He finished second here last year. Schauffele is seeking his first stroke-play victory since the 2022 Scottish Open.\n\n--Clark (+1400) is seeking to become the first player to successfully defend at the Wells Fargo. He set the tournament scoring record of 265 last year. Clark is BetMGM's second-biggest liability, drawing 9.6 percent of the money as his odds have shortened from +1900. He also leads the field at DraftKings with 18 percent of the money backing him at the same odds.\n\n--Max Homa (+2200) has won two of the previous four editions of the event and finished T8 last year. He also went 4-0-0 at Quail Hollow in the 2022 Presidents Cup. Homa is BetMGM's third-biggest liability this week, drawing 8.4 percent of the money since opening at +2500.\n\n--Tommy Fleetwood (+2500) had a T7 at the Valero Texas Open and T3 at the Masters before settling for a T49 at the RBC Heritage in his past three starts.\n\n--Cameron Young is still seeking his maiden PGA Tour victory, but is second in the field at DraftKings with 7 percent of the money backing him at +2500.\n\nNOTES\n\n--Scheffler is not in the field as he and wife Meredith await the birth of their first child. The 69-player field does include seven of the top 10 players in the world rankings and eight of the top 10 in the FedEx Cup rankings.\n\n--Quail Hollow resident Webb Simpson is in the field on a sponsor's exemption along with Gary Woodland, Adam Scott and Matt Kuchar.\n\n--Quail Hollow, known as the \"Green Mile,\" underwent a renovation after last year's tournament that included redoing all of the tees and greens and installing a new drainage system.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I don't know what that's like, so it has been exciting,\" Clark said Wednesday as he prepared to tee off Thursday in the Wells Fargo Championship, the sixth of the US PGA Tour's eight $20 million Signature events, which feature smaller fields and no halfway cut.\n\nNow ranked third in the world, Clark was ranked 163rd when he arrived last year at Quail Hollow in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he out-dueled Olympic champion Xander Schauffele in a back-nine battle on Sunday to win his first career title by four strokes.\n\nHe would go on to win his first major title at the US Open and he set a Pebble Beach course record 60 on the way to victory in a weather-shortened Pebble Beach Pro-Am triumph in February.\n\nClark said his rise over the past year has been \"humbling and fun.\"\n\n\"In 12 months, yeah, it's crazy to think I jumped that many spots and have a few wins under my belt now,\" Clark said. \"I'm just really looking to continue to grow and get better. I like to think this is just the beginning, and hopefully it's the start of a lot of really good golf in the future years.\"\n\nThe 30-year-old from Colorado will be up against an elite field led by world number two Rory McIlroy, who won the title in 2010, 2015 and 2021.\n\nMcIlroy is coming off a victory alongside Ireland's Shane Lowry in the Zurich Classic of New Orleans PGA Tour team event.\n\n\"I think it freed me up a little bit,\" McIlroy said of playing in the unusual format, with a partner to take on some of the Sunday pressure.\n\n\"I've had a pretty slow start to the season, especially over here in the States,\" he added. \"I felt like I needed something like that to get me going and hopefully that's the case.\"\n\nSeven of the world's top 10 and seven past champions are in the field, including two-time winner Max Homa.\n\nThe most notable absentee is world number one Scottie Scheffler, who won a second Masters title and followed up with a win at the RBC Heritage last month.\n\nScheffler, winner of four of his last five starts, opted out of this final tuneup for next week's PGA Championship as he and his wife, Meredith, await the birth of their first child.\n\nWorld number six Ludvig Aberg withdrew with a knee injury.\n\nFourth-ranked Schauffele, who played on the victorious US Presidents Cup team at Quail Hollow in 2022, is hoping to break through for a win after seven top-10 finishes this season.\n\n\"I'd say I haven't really been able to get everything together at once, which is sort of the story for every tour pro, so still working on that bit,\" Schauffele said.\n\nOfficials and the 69-player field were bracing for severe weather, with thunderstorms expected to move in on Wednesday night and perhaps linger through the first and second rounds on Thursday and Friday.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It also provides the 69-player field an opportunity to compete without red-hot Scottie Scheffler to contend with ahead of next week's PGA Championship.\n\nOur golf experts preview the tournament and provide their favorite prop picks along with best bets to win this week.\n\nWELLS FARGO CHAMPIONSHIP\n\nLocation: Wells Fargo Championship, Charlotte, N.C., May 9-12\n\nTV: Thursday-Friday: 2-6 p.m. (Golf Channel); Saturday-Sunday: 1-3 p.m. (GC), 3-6 p.m. (CBS)\n\nStreaming (ESPN+): Thursday-Friday, 11 a.m.-6 p.m. ET; Saturday-Sunday, 7:15 a.m.-6 p.m.\n\n--Xander Schauffele to Beat Rory McIlroy (+105 at DraftKings): Yes, McIlroy is coming off a win in his last start and yes, he has an excellent track record at Quail Hollow. But the win came in a team event against a modest field and his results to date in 2024 have been mediocre by his standards. While Schauffele doesn't hoist a lot of trophies, he does rack up top-10s -- including seven through his first 10 starts this season.\n\n--Hideki Matsuyama Top 20 (+100 at BetMGM): Matsuyama tees it up for the first time since the Masters, where he tied for 38th. Previous to that, he had a win and was no worse than T12 in four starts. The Japanese star is well rested and only needs to beat 49 players for this prop to pay.\n\n--Tommy Fleetwood Top Englishman (+100 at DraftKings): Fleetwood tied for fifth here last year and had a pair of top-10s before tying for 49th in his most recent start at the RBC Heritage. The other two players in this prop are Matt Fitzpatrick (+150) and Justin Rose (+450). Fitzpatrick tied for 35th at Quail Hollow last year while Rose was not in the field.\n\n--Rory McIlroy (+750 at BetMGM) is coming off a victory at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans with Shane Lowry and has three career victories at Quail Hollow. He is the book's biggest liability this week as McIlroy leads the field with 22.2 percent of the money backing him to win since opening at +900.\n\n--Xander Schauffele (+1000) has four consecutive top-20s, including a T2 at The Players. He finished second here last year. Schauffele is seeking his first stroke-play victory since the 2022 Scottish Open.\n\n--Clark (+1400) is seeking to become the first player to successfully defend at the Wells Fargo. He set the tournament scoring record of 265 last year. Clark is BetMGM's second-biggest liability, drawing 9.6 percent of the money as his odds have shortened from +1900. He also leads the field at DraftKings with 18 percent of the money backing him at the same odds.\n\n--Max Homa (+2200) has won two of the previous four editions of the event and finished T8 last year. He also went 4-0-0 at Quail Hollow in the 2022 Presidents Cup. Homa is BetMGM's third-biggest liability this week, drawing 8.4 percent of the money since opening at +2500.\n\n--Tommy Fleetwood (+2500) had a T7 at the Valero Texas Open and T3 at the Masters before settling for a T49 at the RBC Heritage in his past three starts.\n\n--Cameron Young is still seeking his maiden PGA Tour victory, but is second in the field at DraftKings with 7 percent of the money backing him at +2500.\n\nNOTES\n\n--Scheffler is not in the field as he and wife Meredith await the birth of their first child. The 69-player field does include seven of the top 10 players in the world rankings and eight of the top 10 in the FedEx Cup rankings.\n\n--Quail Hollow resident Webb Simpson is in the field on a sponsor's exemption along with Gary Woodland, Adam Scott and Matt Kuchar.\n\n--Quail Hollow, known as the \"Green Mile,\" underwent a renovation after last year's tournament that included redoing all of the tees and greens and installing a new drainage system.", "source": {"uri": "idahostatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Idaho Statesman"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In fact, it has previously hosted the 2017 PGA Championship and the 2022 Presidents Cup, and will play host to the 2025 PGA Championship.\n\nA par-71 course that measures 7,558 yards, Quail Hollow is one of the longest and most difficult courses on the regular PGA Tour schedule. It has classical features with tree-lined fairways and thick rough, and there are water hazards in play on seven of the 18 holes.\n\nWith the long length and the fact that there aren't many forced layups, this is a driver-heavy course. The averaging driving distance at Quail Hollow in 2023 was 304 yards -- one of the highest marks of the entire season. This is one of a handful of events on the tour where driving distance is a big advantage.\n\nThe greens are average in size (6,600 square feet) and feature bermudagrass with poa trivialis overseed. They are difficult to hit on average, which makes iron play and scrambling important.\n\nEssentially, we are looking for golfers this week to bet on who don't have a major weakness and who are long off the tee.\n\nIt also doesn't hurt to have good course history here, as this is one of the most predictive events on the PGA Tour. In other words, golfers who have played well at Quail Hollow tend to continue to play well there.\n\nLet's get into this week's picks.\n\nWe don't see golfers win the same PGA Tour event in back-to-back years very often, but it's certainly not unprecedented.\n\nClark, who won at Quail Hollow in 2023 as a massive underdog, has been dominant in Signature Events this season. He won the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, was runner-up at the Arnold Palmer Invitational and the Players Championship, and finished third at the RBC Heritage.\n\nHe's one of the longest hitters in the field and doesn't have a weakness in his game. He has as much win equity as Rory McIlroy or Xander Schauffele, and we are getting much better odds on Clark.\n\nYoung is going to pick up his first win on the PGA Tour sooner rather than later, and I've maintained that it will come on a championship-level golf course.\n\nHe has contended in several majors in his career and now has a total of seven runner-up finishes. It's not like he doesn't know how to win, as he had two victories on the Korn Ferry Tour before earning his PGA Tour card.\n\nHe's one of the best drivers in the world and is elite with his mid and long irons. If he can have a decent week with his putter, I like his chances to contend.\n\nThis is the safest bet of the week with positive odds because Schaufefle has finished in the top 10 in six of his last nine starts.\n\nHe has finished T2 and T14 in his last two stroke-play events at Quail Hollow, a course where he was dominant at the Presidents Cup in 2022.\n\nHe's one of the few golfers on tour that is elite in all aspects of his game. He's an excellent driver, he's elite on approach, he's terrific around the greens, and he's a good putter.\n\nI see no reason why he can't post another top-10 finish this week.\n\nScott's T30 finish last week doesn't jump off the page, but he gained 6.3 strokes ball striking.\n\nThis season he has consistent results but inconsistent strokes-gained numbers. He'll have a good week ball-striking, then he'll have a good week with the short game, and then he'll have a good week with some other combination of those categories.\n\nThe way I see it, he has the potential to gain in all four aspects and put it all together.\n\nHe finished T5 at Quail Hollow last year and tends to play his best on classical golf courses like this one.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidents Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer_Invitational", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Palmer Invitational"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Players_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Players Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach_Golf_Links", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach Golf Links"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBC_Heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RBC Heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynodon_dactylon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cynodon dactylon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korn_Ferry_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Korn Ferry Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_of_Champions_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tournament of Champions (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iron (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/wyndham-clark-pga-wells-fargo-e1715187751838.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547461", "eventUri": "eng-9547461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

One of the most popular wins in Read the Line history came last year when Wyndham Clark won by three strokes over Xander Schauffele for a +7500 return. Considering we have compiled four wins in a three-week span (Nelly, Nelly + Scottie parlay, Hannah Green, and Taylor Pendrith), the vibes are very strong while we walk around Quail Hollow. And what a place to celebrate, as this is a venue worthy of a major championship!\n\nThe sixth signature event of the 2024 PGA TOUR schedule is the Wells Fargo. Sixty-nine players (Ludvig \u00c3berg WD) will compete for $20 million and $3.6 million for first place. No stranger to big events, I have been to Quail Hollow a couple times to cover the Wells Fargo and the 2022 Presidents' Cup. If Augusta National Golf Club sets the global tournament standard, the membership of Quail Hollow does their very best to impress. It's no wonder we will be back next year for another PGA Championship.\n\nIt pays to Read The Line! For the third week in a row, we won! Taylor Pendrith was one of our member newsletter picks. He was a +10000 (100-1) winner and our fourth win of the season. This preview is just that, a preview. For a complete list of my betting predictions covering the Wells Fargo Championship winners, placements, and H2H matchups, please go to Read The Line and subscribe.\n\nThe only guy who continues to beat Clark is Scottie Scheffler, and he's not in the field! Across five signature events this season, Clark has racked up a first, a second, and a third. He also finished runner-up at THE PLAYERS.\n\nThe defending champion wrapped at 19 under par last year and three clear of the field. The sacariest part: Wyndham is a much more complete player now. Ranked 80th when he won at Wells a year ago, he is now ranked third in the world. The skill set fits, and so will another signature style win.\n\nSpeaking of signature events, in those same five events Theegala has two second-place finishes and a sixth. Ninth at THE PLAYERS, the Pepperdine product has always putted well.\n\nTheegala's season's climb up the world rankings is the result of great ball-striking. Over his past five events, Theegala has gained an average of three shots T2G and another three with the flat-stick. Take that complement of skills and cash a ticket on Sunday.\n\nSpieth just missed the cut in his hometown of Dallas. That's four missed cuts in six events, including the Masters. The reason for his struggles can be traced back to inconsistent play in all aspects of his game.\n\nNoren is a hot DFS and outright name this week. He finished third at the CJ CUP and had four rounds of 68 or better. On Sunday he closed with a 65. Follow the momentum and clean up H2H at Quail Hollow.\n\nWinning at QHC is a very simple formula. Wyndham Clark showed us perfectly last year, and the analytics of the last 10 Wells winners at QHC back up his impressive victory. This is the fifth-longest course on TOUR. The average driving distance is 301 yards. That's 17 more yards than the PGA TOUR average! Need more ball-speed validation? The best driver of this generation, Rory McIlroy, has won here three times. Two healthy inches of over-seeded rough also dictate success.\n\nThe most interesting analytic clue comes on the putting greens. The last 10 winners have gained over six strokes on average versus the field with their flat-stick. I picked Wyndham last year because he's a great putter. These greens are amazing. They are the closest putting surfaces you will see on TOUR to what tests the players at Augusta National. They really are cool, and these subtle new changes will only emphasize good putting even more. The field is finding out very quickly that they can make putts. Our outrights can all roll the rock. Over the last decade, the winner has gained over five strokes eight times.\n\nOver 50 percent of the incoming approach shots are played from over 175 yards, and thirty percent from over 200 yards. Tiger taught us for 20 years that long-iron play is the quickest way to differentiate from the pack. Scheffler separates the same way with his long game. When Clark won last year, he gained nine strokes on the field with his approach play. Considering the landscape of these green complexes, proximity to the hole becomes very important. This is not TPC Craig Ranch, Wyndham made 23 sub-par scores last year because his iron game was locked in.\n\nThis par-71 scorecard boasts 11 par-4s with an average length of 456 yards! Nine of them measure over 450 yards. Par-4 scoring always indicates success on difficult courses. Survive the par-3s at QHC, score on the 5s, and win on the par-4s. The last 10 winners have gained an average of 10 strokes on the field with their par-4 play. From the drivable 14th to the now 529-yard peninsula green 16th, these 11 holes are varied and tough. Get it done here and you'll be a major part of the conversation come Sunday afternoon.\n\nThirteen holes at QHC have a bogey rate of over 15 percent. In comparison, just five holes have a birdie rate over that value. Three of those holes are par-5s. You'll hear endless amounts of talk about the finish (Green Mile) this week but pay attention to the start. Quail Hollow also has one of the toughest starts on the PGA TOUR. Holes one, two, and three play a half stroke over par. Avoiding bogeys early, late, and throughout the rest of your round is another key to success. Saving par around these immense green complexes takes short-game savvy.\n\nI'm taking a collection of athletes this week, players who impress us with their physical skill and talent between the trees. Much like Augusta National, television cannot capture the terrain at Quail Hollow. Walking this course for a guaranteed four days is as much a mental test as it is a physical grind.\n\nFor full coverage of the Wells Fargo Championship, subscribe to our Read The Line newsletter (it's free!) and follow us on Twitter!\n\nThe par-71 layout covers an enormous number of acres. Set just southeast of downtown Charlotte, this is probably one of my favorite Tom Fazio designs. The course has character. There are numerous elevation changes, an awesome variety of holes, and a finish that any championship course would envy. There are 61 carefully-placed bunkers and seven holes where water comes into play, elements that build an amphitheater of excitement.\n\nSince Wyndham's win, the course has seen some changes. Twenty-five yards were added to the 16th hole. I guess they needed to make one of the hardest holes on property even tougher. A couple of new tee boxes were added, and most intriguing was the description of \"softening\" 12 of the greens. As green textures and speeds continue to become more difficult, classic courses like Quail Hollow can get a little scary on those surfaces. You'll lose hole locations and stand a very good chance of things getting out of hand for an important championship.\n\nWe skipped 2017 and 2022 at QHC. The last 10 Wells Fargo editions take us back 12 winners. In those 10 tournaments, the average details are:\n\nThat last stat really stands out. Even when we hosted an elevated full field event last year (remember those?), the winner was longshot Wyndham Clark! Quail Hollow has provided us with seven winners with +4000 odds or longer in the last 10 years. Rory McIlroy, Rickie Fowler, Max Homa, and Clark all broke through at Wells Fargo. It's a very interesting note, and one that factored into our outright portfolio.\n\nTwenty-two of the top 25 in the OWGR are competing. The only non-LIV golfer absent is one Mr. Scottie Scheffler. The most notable of competitors has now skipped the Wells Fargo two years in a row. It is also worth noting that in eight days the PGA Championship begins, and Meredith Scheffler is still pregnant. Timing is everything in life, and we are about to see how badly Scottie wants to take a run at the Grand Slam.\n\nNo Scottie means we can play this signature sojourn straight up. Considering the recent run at RTL, Scottie's absence couldn't come at a better time. Wells Fargo is a wonderful warmup for next week at Valhalla. Many of the player features I discuss below will also apply in a week's time. It's almost as if we are getting the perfect warm-up venue for a major championship. There's no doubt a signature field will also reveal some serious clues going into the season's second major.\n\nThe course is in fabulous condition, exactly what I have come to expect when on property at QHC. The region has been relatively dry the past few weeks and we will only receive a couple of showers this week. Overall, the forecast calls for mild conditions, temperatures in the mid-70s, and wind in the low teens. Thursday could get a little wet -- but with a small field and late spring daylight, tournament officials can create a great competitive atmosphere.\n\nThe Quail Hollow Club is a very strong test. Nine par-4s are over 450 yards in length. The par-3s are treacherous and the finish is the hardest on TOUR. We learned last week on the 72nd hole that NOTHING IS CERTAIN. Make sure you manifest until the last putt goes in the hole. The finishes at Quail Hollow have been electric at times, just like so many of the winners they have crowned so early in their careers.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news",

After a few weeks off since his last start (RBC Heritage, T-55), I expect Homa to be well rested for a tournament where he's a past champion.\n\nThe fan-favorite won in Charlotte in 2019 and grabbed eighth last season.\n\nJustin Thomas (22/1)\n\nJustin Thomas of the USA smiles on the driving range prior to the RBC Heritage at Harbour Town Golf Links on April 16, 2024 in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.

He has had an up-and-down season, but with a major championship in his hometown on the horizon, I expect JT to find some form.\n\nIn his last three appearances at Quail Hollow, Thomas has finished 14th, 26th and 21st.\n\nTommy Fleetwood (25/1)\n\nTommy Fleetwood waits for the seventh green to clear during the first round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational.

In two starts before Harbour Town, however, the Englishman tied for third at the Masters and for seventh at the Valero Texas Open.\n\nIn his last two trips to Quail Hollow for the Wells Fargo (2023, 2021), Fleetwood has finished fifth and 14th, respectively.\n\nIt's time for Fleetwood to get it done on the PGA Tour.\n\nAdam Scott (40/1)\n\nAdam Scott chips on the 18th hole during the second round of the 2024 Masters Tournament at Augusta National Golf Club. (Photo: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Network)\n\nThe Aussie has played consistent golf in 2024, finishing inside the top 25 five times in 8 starts this year. At last year's Wells Fargo, Scott finished fifth. If you don't like him to win outright, Scott is +140 to finish inside the top 20.\n\nStephan Jaeger (45/1)\n\nStephan Jaeger acknowledges the fans after making a putt on the 15th green during the third round of the RBC Heritage golf tournament. Mandatory Credit: Aaron Doster-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSince his win in Houston, Jaeger missed the cut at the Masters but bounce back nicely with a T-18 finish at the RBC Heritage and T-20 finish at last week's CJ Cup Byron Nelson.\n\nWith Jaeger's new-found distance off the tee, I expect his game to fit Quail Hollow nicely.\n\nAt last year's Wells Fargo, Jaeger shot four straight 70s and tied for

I don't know what that's like, so it has been exciting,\" Clark said Wednesday as he prepared to tee off Thursday in the Wells Fargo Championship, the sixth of the US PGA Tour's eight $20 million Signature events, which feature smaller fields and no halfway cut.\n\nNow ranked third in the world, Clark was ranked 163rd when he arrived last year at Quail Hollow in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he out-dueled Olympic champion Xander Schauffele in a back-nine battle on Sunday to win his first career title by four strokes.\n\nHe would go on to win his first major title at the US Open and he set a Pebble Beach course record 60 on the way to victory in a weather-shortened Pebble Beach Pro-Am triumph in February.\n\nClark said his rise over the past year has been \"humbling and fun.\"\n\n\"In 12 months, yeah, it's crazy to think I jumped that many spots and have a few wins under my belt now,\" Clark said. \"I'm just really looking to continue to grow and get better. I like to think this is just the beginning, and hopefully it's the start of a lot of really good golf in the future years.\"\n\nThe 30-year-old from Colorado will be up against an elite field led by world number two Rory McIlroy, who won the title in 2010, 2015 and 2021.\n\nMcIlroy is coming off a victory alongside Ireland's Shane Lowry in the Zurich Classic of New Orleans PGA Tour team event.\n\n\"I think it freed me up a little bit,\" McIlroy said of playing in the unusual format, with a partner to take on some of the Sunday pressure.\n\nMore from this section Peter Andre unveils

case.\"\n\nSeven of the world's top 10 and seven past champions are in the field, including two-time winner Max Homa.\n\nThe most notable absentee is world number one Scottie Scheffler, who won a second Masters title and followed up with a win at the RBC Heritage last month.\n\nScheffler, winner of four of his last five starts, opted out of this final tuneup for next week's PGA Championship as he and his wife, Meredith, await the birth of their first child.\n\nWorld number six Ludvig Aberg withdrew with a knee injury.\n\nFourth-ranked Schauffele, who played on the victorious US Presidents Cup team at Quail Hollow in 2022, is hoping to break through for a win after seven top-10 finishes this season.\n\n\"I'd say I haven't really been able to get everything together at once, which is sort of the story for every tour pro, so still working on that bit,\" Schauffele said.\n\nOfficials and the 69-player field were bracing for severe weather, with thunderstorms expected to move in on Wednesday night and perhaps linger through the first and second rounds on Thursday and Friday.\n\nbb/js", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"},

Back then, even the most ardent golf fans would picture the hotel franchisor first if they heard his name uttered during a broadcast.\n\nBut, by the first week of May of 2023, the name ID of the player who is currently second on tour in strokes gained/total, behind Scottie Scheffler, would experience a seismic jump.\n\nThe latent potential that had once spurred the Denver born golfer to the top of the leaderboard at a pair of Colorado State Championships and the individual title at the Pac-12 Men's Golf Championships had gone partially dormant since turning pro. But after being bottled up for a few years it returned with a vengeance as the rank-and-file grinder has transformed into a consummate contender.\n\nSoFi's newest ambassador notched his inaugural PGA Tour victory at last year's Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow in Charlotte in dominant fashion, trouncing runner-up Xander Schauffele by four strokes.\n\nA whirlwind of success followed -- a month later he'd won his first major championship and earlier this year he added trophy at Pebble Beach to his haul. Toss in a pair of runner-up finishes in in March and Dubs has slingshot to No. 3 in the world rankings. It's understandable that his memory of the tourney that shifted his career into top gear is a tad blurred.\n\n\"I just remember the joy and excitement I had for getting my first PGA Tour win and the weight that was lifted off of me for finally breaking through and doing something I've always known I could do and dreamt of doing,\" Clark said.\n\nThose who've seen Neflix's Full Swing season 2's 'Mind Game' episode knows how huge an impact sports psychologist Julie Elion made in reshaping Clark's mental game so that he could more healthily handles course adversity and have a more positive attitude\n\nHis early years on the top tour were fraught with self-doubt. Asked if there were times he was unsure he would ever win an event, Clark doesn't hesitate to admit that would be dead on.\n\n\"Early on I thought I would win and then as I got to year three, four and the start of year five as I was playing really good golf and doing everything better than I ever had and still hadn't broken through, I was really frustrated. Last year leading up to Quail Hollow I had a handful of top finishes. Going into Sunday I was either tied for the lead or a couple shots off and didn't pull through and it started to wear on me.\n\n\"The great thing is a hung in there, kept believing I could do it, that good things are going to happen and then boom I won at Quail Hollow and now I have three wins which is pretty awesome.\"\n\nThe Wells Fargo win lit the spark that changed the course of Clark's career. It instilled him with a profound conviction in his own abilities that he could bank on while contending, overcoming late round setbacks and ultimately winning the U.S. Open at L.A. Country Club, the following month.\n\n\"That win was the reason I had such a good year last year and why I won a major. I felt really confident when I was at the U.S. Open. I just beat basically the same field at Quail Hollow at equally tough of a golf course. I had the belief that 'hey I can win and I did just win so now there was not a question of if I could win, it was just more of believing that it is going to happen and it's going to keep happening,'\" Clark said.\n\nThis is the final year of the Wells Fargo championship as the bank elected to not renew their sponsorship agreement leaving the future of Charlotte's tournament is currently up in the air for the time being. Clark for one hopes another company will step in and they continue to play at Quail Hollow, which is already set to host the 2025 PGA Championship, on an annual basis.\n\n\"I really hope we stay playing at Quail Hollow. This tournament has been rated amongst the players and caddies and families, a top three event -- if not the number one event -- every year as far as hospitality, how they treat us, the quality of the golf course, the fans, the city. It's always one of the best events and we don't have too many regular tour stops at major championship golf courses and to play at Quail Hollow year-in-and-year-out has been amazing. I really hope we keep playing there for another ten, twenty years.\"\n\nBack in 2003, when the event was fresh faced guppie on tour, David Toms stepped into the 18 tee box on the Sunday holding a commanding six-shot lead. But, the pressure cooker of a closing hole with a slender but ball-gobbling creek snaking along the entirety of the left-hand side, trees on the right and trouble all around the green that nearly shredded what was then a million dollar winner's check. Toms drive veered 50 yards right into the foliage, beginning a litany of foibles that led to a quadruple-bogey.\n\n\"A lot of golf holes you typically can just bail out and have a shot and that one you really can't. You got to hit a great tee ball and then a great second shot. It's an amazing golf hole,\" Clark explained.\n\nQuail Hollow is a brawny mettle tester throughout framed by thick Bermuda rough, but it's closing stretch of holes, the famous \"Green Mile,\" is the golf course's most taxing stanza.\n\n\"Once you get to 16, 17, 18 if you just play them even par for the whole week, you'd be gaining a ton on the field. It's definitely one of the more challenging stretches that we have in golf and it's exciting because a lot of stuff can happen,\" he added.\n\nWhether he has a great week or not, expect Wyndham to roll with the punches or rise up the leaderboard with equal aplomb. He has cultivated a Zen-like attitude in regard to his performance while also seemingly embracing the central tenets of stoicism and good old fashioned positive psychology -- feeling that he plays better inside the ropes when he feels gratitude.\n\n\"I'm so appreciative that every day I wake up I get to go to the golf course and do what I love and compete in front of thousands and millions of people and I'm thankful that I get to do that. I find when I'm in that posture of gratitude and thankfulness, it's when I'm the most focused and relaxed and my best golf comes out.\"\n\nWhen asked if he believes that he will be a multi-major champion, Clark proffers a similarly philosophical response.\n\n\"I can't control the outcomes. What I can control is my mental game, my process, the amount of work I put into it and if it's in the cards, if it's in God's plan and I'm supposed to win multiple-majors, then great.\"\n\nBut if not, he'll accept it and continue to enjoy the journey of striving to play his best golf while also doing his part as an ambassador of the game.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news",

Scottie Scheffler is out this weekend as he and his wife await the birth of their first child, giving other golfers a reprieve from his dominance so far in 2024. On a side note, if you want to get in on some Scottie action this week despite him sitting out, you can now bet on whether he will win all four majors this year.\n\nRory McIlroy is the favorite this weekend at Wells Fargo, holding +650 odds to win. He's won the tournament three times, setting a course record 21-over-par in 2015.\n\nHowever, last year's winner, Wyndham Clark, set the aggregate shot record when he won the tournament last year. He holds +1600 odds to win this year's tournament, which is the third-best odds. Xander Schauffele(+900) is sandwiched between McIlory and Clark.\n\nNow that we teed off with the basics, let's approach the top favorites and my portfolio for this tournament.\n\nIf you follow me on Twitter or read this column, you know I love betting on golf long shots (+1500 to +2000 or longer). There's just something thrilling about holding a lottery ticket deep into Sunday.

only three players have a better Round 1 scoring average than Lowry this season.\n\nThe Irishman has the upside to win this tournament, so I will back him to lead the field after 18 holes.\n\nI also like his chances to win this tournament at +7000; he's one of my two favorite long shots in the field.\n\nAs usual, things have been up and down for Emiliano Grillo in 2024, but the Argentine does have some strong results.\n\nHe has made the cut in 10 of the 11 events played on the PGA Tour this season, with two top-10 finishes, including a T8 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational in early March.\n\nHe also has a decent course history at Quail Hollow with a T9, T14 and T23 in his last three outings there.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Homa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Homa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny_McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denny McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiliano_Grillo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emiliano Grillo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer_Invitational", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Palmer Invitational"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/mcilroy-lowry-pga-wells-fargo-e1715124340749.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547461", "eventUri": "eng-9547461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

Caddie Ted Scott has also been given the week off as a result after earning close to $2 million via Scheffler's achievements in 2024 alone.\n\nAnd with Scheffler and Scott not around to vacuum up any winnings for at least a few days, many of the other competitors will be viewing this tournament as a legitimate chance to change their seasons and potentially their careers.\n\nIn what is the final Wells Fargo Championship under its current name - following the news that the financial services company is ending its backing of the event - a $20 million purse is on the line, $3.6 million of which will go to the winner.\n\nMost PGA Tour pros adhere to a standard 10% cut for their caddie, with between five and seven per cent going to their looper depending on how high up they finish.

He is out this week awaiting the birth of his first child, giving other golfers a reprieve from his 2024 dominance. On a side note, if you want to get in on some Scottie action this week despite him sitting out, you can now bet on whether he will win all four majors this year.\n\nSo who is favored to take down this event? Look no further than Rory McIlroy, who currently sits at +650 to win it all. He's won the tournament three times, setting a course record in 2015.\n\nWyndham Clark, who set the aggregate shot record when he won the tournament last year, is at +1600 to win, the third-best odds. Sandwiched between McIlroy and Clark comes Xander Schauffele at +900.\n\nNow that we teed off with the basics, let's approach the top favorites and my portfolio for this tournament.\n\nIf you follow me on Twitter or read this column, you know I love betting on golf long shots (+1500 to +2000 or longer). There's just something thrilling about holding a lottery ticket deep into Sunday. It also presents you with multiple hedging opportunities if you want to eliminate some of your risks.\n\nI know some big names are in this week's event, but long shots are hot in 2024.

{"uri": "8117481267", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-05-08", "time": "13:39:43", "dateTime": "2024-05-08T13:39:43Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-05-08T13:39:16Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5215686559677124, "url": "https://theathletic.com/5478091/2024/05/08/2024-wells-fargo-championship-odds-picks-sleepers/", "title": "2024 Wells Fargo Championship expert picks, odds, sleepers: Wyndham Clark among the best bets", "body": "Who will win the signature-event Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow with Scottie Scheffler missing?\n\nThat's right -- world No. 1 Scheffler will be missing from this week's field as he spends time with his expecting wife before the PGA Championship next week. Ludvig Aberg's withdrawal (sore knee) on Monday moved the field to 69 golfers.\n\nQuail Hollow has played host to the Wells Fargo Championship since 2003 (except for 2017 and 2022) and can play as difficult as a major championship golf course, thanks to its length and the speed of the greens. The large undulating Bermuda greens can touch 13 on the Stimp meter when the greens are dried out. I have had the pleasure of teeing it up at Quail Hollow and have three-putted from six feet due to the speed and movement of the putts. Don't go by me, though, because I'm just as capable of doing that at a muni that's been freshly aerated.\n\nMy model this week weighs driving distance heavily. I also zoned in on iron play from long distance. Strokes gained on approach from longer than 175 yards, strokes gained from longer than 200 yards, and strokes gained from 225+ yards are all in the model. Performance at Quail Hollow Club will also be important, as course history is a bigger factor here than at most golf courses. I also weighed Par 5 scoring a little heavier than usual as the three easiest holes on a very difficult course are the par 5s, and players will need to take advantage.\n\nFeatures: Quail Hollow Club was redesigned by Tom Fazio leading up to the 2017 PGA Championship and was the host course for the 2022 President's Cup, won by the Americans. Justin Thomas won his first major championship at Quail Hollow. Hideki Matsuyama was in the mix that week and was the clubhouse leader going into the final round. Quail Hollow features fast-undulating Bermuda greens. Ryegrass is the predominant grass for the fairways and rough in the spring, and Bermuda grass begins to take over in late spring.\n\nWyndham Clark (+1600) won the Wells Fargo Championship in 2023, gaining more than 11 strokes ball-striking and more than 7.4 strokes putting. He has since gone on to win a signature event at Pebble Beach and the U.S. Open. He was second to only Scottie Scheffler at both Bay Hill and TPC Sawgrass before tweaking his back before the Houston Open. He looks to be fully recovered from the back injury scare, as he gained over 3.5 strokes ball-striking over his last three rounds combined at the RBC Heritage. I would rather take Wyndham at this number than take Xander in the single digits.\n\nHideki Matsuyama (+3500) has taken some time off after struggling with his irons at the Masters. Before the Masters, Matsuyama was on a heater, gaining over 16 strokes combined on approach over his previous four tournaments. He has gained more than one stroke off the tee on the field in five straight tournaments and contended at Quail Hollow Club at the 2017 PGA Championship. I'm not sure why he has taken so much time off here since 2019, as his ball-striking numbers at this course are remarkable.\n\nSi Woo Kim (+4000) played well last week after flirting with the cut line. He struggled with the putter, losing more than a stroke on the greens, but he gained more than 5.6 strokes on approach. He is my team no-putt play this week with a slight edge over Tony Finau, as Si Woo has had some bursts of decent putting within his rounds.\n\nStephan Jaeger (+5500) has been a beast off the tee this year. He has become a longer player off the tee and has gained strokes off the tee in eight straight tournaments. His iron play and putting have been hit or miss. He has been trading off solid rounds with a poor one the next day.\n\nRory McIlroy ($11,800) won at the Zurich Classic, where he carried Shane Lowry. He has won three times at Quail Hollow and is the heavy betting favorite with Scottie Scheffler not in the field. I don't know what to make of his win at the Zurich Classic related to his current form. All I can tell you is that the pricing and field for this contest make it easy for me to fit McIlroy into some lineups. I wouldn't fade him with his track record here.\n\nXander Schauffele ($11,500) being priced this high is a hard sell for me. He hasn't looked as sharp since the Masters, and I like other options more this week.\n\nWyndham Clark ($10,500) See above.\n\nMax Homa ($9,400) finished T8 here last year, gaining strokes across the board. He gained strokes across the board at both the Valero Texas Open and the Masters before struggling with his putter at the RBC Heritage. I will excuse him for that as the course doesn't suit his game the best.\n\nViktor Hovland ($9,200) has been hard at work on his game since missing the cut at the Masters. I don't know what we will see from Viktor this week, but I will pay close attention in case we can get him at a good number on a futures bet for one of the majors. I'm also going to throw him in one or two GPP lineups, just in case.\n\nSahith Theegala ($9,100) has four top-nine finishes in his last seven stroke-play events. He is coming off of a second-place finish at the RBC Heritage and is priced right this week. He has gained strokes off the tee in six of his last seven stroke-play events, and he gained over 4.8 strokes on approach at the RBC Heritage.\n\nJustin Thomas ($8,500) looks like a solid play for any other name at this price. He has gained strokes across the board in three of his last seven tournaments. Yes, he missed the cut at the three biggest tournaments during that seven-tournament stretch, but we are talking about one of the best no-cut event players in the world. I'm in on Thomas at this price and based on what he did at the RBC Heritage.\n\nAlex Noren ($8,200) is playing some of the best golf of his career, and I'm surprised my colleagues didn't jump on him in one-and-done after I talked him up only to realize I had already used him in Texas. (Editors' Note: Dennis is in last place in OAD.) Noren gained more than 2.2 strokes in every category and helped me hedge a winner on Pendrith by pushing to the end. His price is a little higher than it usually would be in a field like this, but you can't ignore his current form.\n\nTony Finau ($8,000) has gained over 11 strokes combined off the tee in his last three events. He is struggling mightily with his putter but can't be ignored at this price.\n\nCorey Conners ($7,800) is tempting at this price because he has played decently here outside of the President's Cup. I don't love that he has lost strokes off the tee in three straight non-team events.\n\nAdam Scott ($7,700) finished T5 here last year and is coming off his best tournament of the year at the Byron Nelson, where he gained more than 5 strokes off the tee.\n\nAkshay Bhatia ($7,500) has been solid since winning the Texas Open. He was great with the putter and around the greens at the Masters, and he gained over 5 strokes on approach at the RBC.\n\nStephan Jaeger ($7,500) See above.\n\nAdam Schenk ($7,100) has gained strokes off the tee in six straight tournaments and more than a stroke on approach in four straight tournaments. He has been good ever since The Players Championship, and I expect that to keep up this week.\n\nChris Kirk ($7,100) has gained strokes off the tee in six of his last seven tournaments and gained more than 2.2 strokes on approach in two straight. His hands around the green made up for a putter that hasn't been quite as good as it usually is.\n\nRickie Fowler ($6,900) has gained strokes on approach in seven straight rounds and has an excellent course history here. His driver is a problem, but I wouldn't mind throwing him in some GPP lineups just in case he gets on these teeboxes and gets a good feeling.\n\nTaylor Moore ($6,700) has gained strokes off the tee in five of his last six stroke-play events, and he is one of the best in the field at strokes gained around the green.\n\nNick Taylor ($6,200) has struggled around the green since the Players but looked good in the team event at the Zurich Classic. He has an excellent course history here and gets a boost from his putter here.\n\nEach week, we will pick in reverse order of the standings, and we can't duplicate picks in the same week. Reference this spreadsheet tracking who we have used.\n\nStandings\n\nDennis Esser: I was leaning towards taking Ludvig Aberg in his first appearance at the Wells Fargo Championship, but then my jinx kicked in and Aberg pulled out of the tournament, citing knee soreness. I thought a lot about Wyndham Clark and Justin Thomas this week as they have both won here, but I decided to take Hideki Matsuyama, hoping he can get some revenge after losing his third-round lead at the 2017 PGA Championship.\n\nHugh Kellenberger: Xander Schauffele was the runner-up at Quail Hollow a year ago and possesses all the skills necessary to win it this time around. Moreover, I just like the play of taking a guy who relentlessly racks up top 10s in a limited-field, high-purse event like this one.\n\nBrody Miller: I've never used Wyndham Clark because for so long I never trusted Wyndham Clark. But now, he's just flat-out one of the four or five best golfers on tour. Oh, and he broke through for his first win here just a year ago. I'll take Clark.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dennis_esser@theathletic.com", "name": "Dennis Esser", "type": "author",

Since the start of 2024 he has won the AT&T at Pebble Beach before finishing second in both the Arnold Palmer Invitational and the Players Championship and although he missed the cut at the Masters, Clark bounced back nicely with a tied third at the RBC Heritage last time out.\n\nThe former US Open champion is worth an each-way nibble at 14/1 with bet365, as is Collin Morikawa at 20/1 with the same firm after a T3 at Augusta and a solo ninth in the Heritage.\n\nOur final e/w selection is 2019 and 2022 Wells Fargo champion Max Homa, who was T8 at Quail Hollow 12 months ago. He was also T3 at the Masters and can deposit cash in the accounts of those who back him for a top-eight finish at 18/1 with bet365.\n\n* Leeds United fan and world darts champion Luke Humphries will receive a huge reception when this week's Premier League Darts rolls into the Yorkshire city. He'll pull out all the stops against Rob Cross and is 27/5 with BetMGM to win their quarter-final match 6-4.\n\nMichael van Gerwen is 4/5 with Paddy Power and Betfair to beat Gerwyn Price outright, Nathan Aspinall is evens with Betway and many others to defeat Michael Smith and Luke Littler is 4/1 with Unibet and BetUK to beat Peter Wright 6-2.\n\n* Aston Villa are chasing Champions League qualification but don't play another match in the Premier League until Monday when they entertain Liverpool.\n\nThat means they can have a right old go at overturning their 4-2 Europa Conference League deficit when they travel to Greece for a semi-final, second leg with Olympiakos. Unai Emery's side are 21/20 with Bet Victor to win in 90 minutes and 7/2 with Sky Bet to reach the final.", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [],

You finished 11 under. I don't think I played half-bad at all. I definitely left some birdies out there, but I'm not mad about it.\"\n\nDaryn Dickens (Howard University) showcased her exceptional skills at the Wells Fargo Championship Pro-Am on Quail Hollow Club's golf course in Charlotte, North Carolina. The freshman from Howard, Darius Laws (University of Maryland Eastern Shore), and Alexandre Burnett (North Carolina Central University) won the First Tee Alumni Entrepreneurs Program essay contest focusing on their futures as entrepreneurs and golfers. Winning the competition allowed the HBCU students to play a round with a professional golfer and former PGA Tour caddie, Michael Collins.\n\n\"Wells Fargo has a long history of supporting HBCUs and is committed to advancing opportunities for diverse communities. One way that's on display here at the Wells Fargo Championship is through our longstanding partnership with First Tee. In addition to hosting a golf clinic for the local chapter in Charlotte, we are proud to have three First Tee graduates - who are current HBCU students - playing in Wednesday's Pro-Am alongside a PGA TOUR Pro and gaining access to networking and mentorship opportunities off the course.\" Kristy Fercho, Head of Diverse Segments, Representation and Inclusion at Wells Fargo\n\n\"I just finished my first year [at Howard] last week,\" Dickens said. \"And getting ready to go into my sophomore year in August. I'm really excited. I had a great first year and got really involved. Academics were superb.\" Superb is an understatement, as the aspiring attorney earned a 4.0 GPA in two semesters at Howard.\n\nAs a product of attorneys from the D.C. area, Dickens is \"debating between criminal or civil rights law\" as a career. \"I've learned being a history major, I've been able to explore just like a lot of the indifferences and injustices that we have faced as black people. I want to be a part of that movement. I feel like, you know, and talks about the civil rights movement.\"\n\nShe isn't a member of the Bison Golf Team but hopes to utilize her love for golf as a resource to open doors and dialogue for change before finishing at Howard and heading to law school. \"One of those things that I want to be a part of is the role in changing those laws and helping those who are affected by it.\"\n\nWhile on the beautiful Quail Hollow Club course, Fleetwood and Power gave the HBCU students a few pointers to enhance their game. Daryn specifically spoke to Fleetwood about practice and his regimen. \" I'm in college right now, and I don't play on the golf team, but, I still love to play golf. So fitting that in within my schedule, I want to make the most of my time because I can't go out every day to play.\" With Power, he gave tips on putting and drives, which she immediately put into their round together. \"I had the opportunity to talk to Seamus about my putting, and, ironically, as soon as we finished talking about it, I had this long, like, 25-footer, and I sank it for an eagle.\"\n\nAlthough Dickens doesn't see a future as a professional golfer, she believes Wells Fargo and First Tee have been tremendous for her and others from HBCUs. \"I'd like to give a big shout out to Wells Fargo for giving us this opportunity. First Tee helped me apply and get her, but Wells Fargo is offering us the opportunity to play with pros and be able to play Quail Hollow. Also, I feel like they truly care.\"\n\nWells Fargo has paired Daryn with a mentor who will be available for guidance and counseling until her graduation. \"That relationship is going to continue past this tournament this week that I'm here in Charlotte. And I'm truly grateful for an opportunity that Wells Fargo has given to us to let us, you know, be able to develop in our field that we want to.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Historically black colleges and universities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Dickens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_golfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional golfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Central_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina Central University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland_Eastern_Shore", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Maryland Eastern Shore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Howard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_civil_rights_movement_(1954\u20131968)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African-American civil rights movement (1954\u20131968)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sophomore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eagle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bison"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4543,h_2555,x_0,y_69/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/hbcu_legends/01hxfpk2rst2h7geraap.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547461", "eventUri": "eng-9547461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

It's a bit ironic that two of the best drivers of the ball in the world will be absent, given how off-the-tee prowess typically factors heavily into the recipe for success at Quail Hollow, with driving distance being more rewarded than tee balls that miss the fairway are penalized. Shorter clubs into fast and firm, but relatively sizable greens provide advantages for the bombers. Late-round drama is made possible by the Green Mile, as players attempt to survive the three-hole closing stretch that can play nearly an entire stroke over-par on average. It'll be essential to convert par-breaker opportunities on Quail Hollow's three par-5s, but possible rain early in the tournament should also encourage scoring chances as conditions potentially soften for a fairly perfect forecast for Rounds 3 and 4.\n\nRecently picking up his first win since January's Hero Dubai Desert Classic, McIlroy absolutely carried playing partner Shane Lowry to the finish line at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans where the duo emerged from a playoff victorious. A three-time past champion at the Wells Fargo Championship, McIlroy is able to lean on his elite driving ability in Charlotte.\n\nMax Homa - $38\n\nHoma posted a top-5 tee-to-green performance en route to a T3 finish at the Masters before struggling with the flat stick at Harbour Town, but he's back on familiarly favorable greens at Quail Hollow where he won in 2019 while pacing the field in SG: Putting. Homa added another top-10 here last year with a strong short-game showing.\n\nNoren extended his active streak of consecutive top-25 finishes to six with a third-place effort at THE CJ CUP Byron Nelson this past week, averaging six birdies per round in the process. The 41-year-old Swede is second to none in Bogey Avoidance and sixth in Par-5 Efficiency over his last 24 measured rounds.\n\nTony Finau - $31\n\nFinau's pedestrian T55 at the Masters was less than satisfactory after tying for runner-up honors in his previous start at the Houston Open, but he still ranked third among the field in SG: Off-the-Tee at Augusta National, and he followed that up with a top-15 finish at the RBC Heritage where he gained 4.4 strokes with his irons. He's second in Prox: 200-plus over his last 24 rounds, and Finau ranks top-10 in both Prox: 150-175 and Prox: 175-200 within this frame as well.\n\nJustin Thomas - $30\n\nNot only did Thomas become a major champion here at the 2017 PGA Championship hosted by Quail Hollow, but this $30 salary is well out of line with the consensus 25/1 outright odds that he carries to win this week. He rebounded from a tough stretch from THE PLAYERS Championship to the Masters by tying for fifth at the RBC Heritage where he gained at least 1.2 strokes in each SG subcategory. Over his last 24 rounds, Thomas ranks fourth in Par-5 Efficiency, sixth in SG: Approach and eighth in driving distance.\n\nDeserving of a salary in the $30s after notching six straight top-30s since the Arnold Palmer Invitational, Kim most recently ranked fifth in SG: APP at THE CJ CUP Byron Nelson while racking up 24 total birdies and an eagle on the way to a T13 result. Over his last 24 rounds, Kim resides top-10 in each of SG: T2G, Par-5 Efficiency and three-putt avoidance.\n\nStephan Jaeger - $22\n\nThe Scheffler slayer followed his win in Houston with a missed cut in his Augusta National debut, but Jaeger bounced back from the MC at the Masters by posting back-to-back top-20s at the RBC Heritage and THE CJ CUP Byron Nelson. Jaeger gained 11 collective strokes from tee to green across these eight rounds, and he ranked eighth among the 2023 Wells Fargo Championship field in SG: T2G.\n\nCorey Conners - $20\n\nConners' putting skills -- or lack thereof -- are worthy of this price, but his ball-striking upside with 72 guaranteed holes is too great to ignore down here. The Canadian tied for eighth at Quail Hollow last year when he hit 55 greens in regulation, and over his last 24 rounds, Conners sits No. 2 in SG: SG: APP, fourth in Prox: 150-175 and fifth in Prox: 200-plus.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBC_Heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RBC Heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Finau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Finau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Homa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Homa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai_Desert_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dubai Desert Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbour_Town_Golf_Links", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harbour Town Golf Links"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_National_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Augusta National Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer_Invitational", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Palmer Invitational"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Players_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Players Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Conners", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corey Conners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547461", "eventUri": "eng-9547461", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.7411764705882353, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

She and her teammates frequently helped manage the driving range at Quail Hollow Club when she was at Queens, leading to her first volunteer experience at the Wells Fargo Championship in 2005.\n\nThese volunteers -- known on the course as ambassadors -- play an integral role in the operations of the annual PGA Tour event that returns to the Charlotte this week.\n\nThere are roughly 2,100 volunteers, broken up into 40 different committees, who descend upon Quail Hollow from near and far when tournament week in May rolls around.\n\nThey keep coming back.\n\n\"The term that I continually hear is: 'It's a family reunion,'\" said Overaker, who now serves as the event's Director of Volunteers, Charity and Events. \"A lot of them have become friends, and they keep up with each other throughout the year. They send each other Christmas cards and all that. It's really neat.\"\n\nThe ambassadors typically grow close with the committee to which they're assigned -- in Overaker's case, those who helped set up the practice area of the driving range. About 100 ambassadors have been volunteering since the inaugural event -- then known as the Wachovia Championship -- in 2003.\n\nThe Wells Fargo Championship has had as many as 2,400 volunteers in recent years. There's even a wait list now -- and some people are turned away.\n\nAlready looking forward to next year\n\nFifteen years ago, Ryan Manzullo's wife worked at Wachovia -- since merged with Wells Fargo -- and he learned her company needed some help putting on the professional golf tournament for which her company was the title sponsor.\n\nA self-described \"die-hard golfer,\" Manzullo jumped at the chance to just be able to walk around Quail Hollow's course on a regular basis. He's been an ambassador at every Wells Fargo Championship and a volunteer in the weeks leading up to the tournament ever since.\n\nHe now oversees all of the golf carts, a volunteer journey that began with him shuttling members from the parking lot to the clubhouse. The committee -- which now has roughly 65 ambassadors -- had just about 10 people. It was very small, and everyone knew everyone.\n\nThe number of ambassadors has ballooned, but that close-knit culture, especially within each committee, remains unchanged.\n\n\"It's like family getting together when next week rolls around,\" said Manzullo, a retired schoolteacher who taught for 32 years, finishing at Davidson Day. \"When we get together next week, they'll be asking me about my grandkids. Some are coming in from out of town, and are literally staying in a hotel for a week just to do this.\n\n\"I love doing it. It's been a blast. I complain about the hours, but when this year ends, I'm looking forward to next year.\"\n\nIn December, Wells Fargo announced the end of its long-time sponsorship of the Charlotte event, with the change starting in 2025. A PGA Tour spokesperson told the Observer, at that time, that \"the tour plans to remain in Charlotte for the long-term and we are in active discussions with potential new title sponsors for 2025 and beyond.\"\n\nPeople want to step up\n\nThe ambassadors always love reconnecting when they return to their post at Quail Hollow. They'll be sharing pictures of their families and setting up dinner plans with their committees.\n\nThey also always seem to exhibit positive attitudes. If it rains, they'll be smiling in their ponchos and helping each other out.\n\nTheir roles on their individual committees are a big part of what makes everyone return. Some try to switch up their committees, or bounce around to different groups, but they almost always wind up back in their original spot.\n\n\"You've got the paid staff, which is 12 or 15, I think, and then you've got 2,000 volunteers,\" said Debbie Abels, who's been volunteering in the tournament staff office for the past six years. \"What would happen if people didn't step up? People want to do it. They come back year after year.\n\n\"You feel like it's very worthwhile, and you're doing something for the tournament. You're seeing friends and colleagues, and you're doing something for your city.\"\n\n'The oil that runs the machine'\n\nOveraker, the volunteer-turned-director, hasn't left Charlotte since volunteering at the early Wachovia Championships with her Queens teammates.\n\nA Knoxville, Tenn., native looking to play golf at a smaller school, she opted to head nearly 250 miles east to be in Charlotte. After her first year, her mother said: \"You're never coming home, are you?\" And she's lived in the Beverly Woods area of South Park, near the golf course, with her husband and two daughters since 2005.\n\nGetting what she called an \"eye-opening\" experience working a major PGA Tour event truly was a huge part of it. She had worked on developmental golf events for years prior, coordinating significantly more frequent tournaments alongside up-and-coming golfers.\n\nIt's fueled her desire to come back, just like the other 2,100 returning ambassadors.\n\n\"They're the oil that runs the machine,\" Overaker said. \"We could not work or function without them.\"", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shane_connuck@charlotteobserver.com", "name": "Shane Connuck", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Driving range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens_University_of_Charlotte", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queens University of Charlotte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidson_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Davidson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wachovia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wachovia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_cart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf cart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Observer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Observer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knoxville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knoxville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Knoxville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Volunteering", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Volunteering", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Volunteer_Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Volunteer Opportunities", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Pride_Celebrations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Pride Celebrations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.charlotteobserver.com/latest-news/thbqst/picture288318915/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/CLT_WellsFargoVolunteer_009", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547461", "eventUri": "eng-9547461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Some rounds of golf this year have seen multiple-hour delays.\n\nNevertheless, Akshay Bhatia, Matthieu Pavon, Justin Thomas, Taylor Pendrith, and the rest of the first players to tee off at the Wells Fargo Championship will not be able to start until at least noon EST. Then, the rest of the round can commence.\n\nWeather continues to derail golf tournaments with Wells Fargo Championship delay\n\nNearly every tournament on the PGA Tour this season, including a Major, has been affected by weather. Last week, the CJ Cup Byron Nelson had the same issue: inclement weather pushing back the start of round one.\n\nThe Masters Tournament (which also had weather issues in 2023), the Cognizant Classic, the RBC Heritage, and others have also seen delays. The AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am awarded Wyndham Clark a win after 54 holes because the fourth round was going to be impossible to play due to the weather.\n\nThis is what outdoor sporting events have to contend with, but it's perhaps even more prevalent for golf. The ground on which the ball lands is extremely important to the outcome. Wind can be hugely detrimental as well.\n\nIf the wind is blowing, golfers normally have a very tough time off the tee. The ground being soaked with water also prevents rolls and bounces that otherwise make a major difference in the outcome of a swing.\n\nSo to keep the scores accurate and prevent players from struggling mightily and taking a lot longer to finish their rounds, delays are enacted.

This Wednesday article will now serve as a final bow to wrap up a jam-packed week of PGA content at Flag Hunting. No fluff, no rants or superfluous soliloquies, just the entirety of our 2024 Wells Fargo Championship outright betting card.\n\nThe four names on this betting card are aimed at returning about 6.5 times our investment. Because of the inflated odds associated with the outright market, it becomes even more imperative to remain disciplined when setting your unit allocations from this article's picks. Golf outright betting is a notoriously fickle beast, and multiple month-long droughts are very much within the range of outcomes. However, at these prices, one single hit can pay off many weeks of poor decision-making.\n\nIn the two-year history at Flag Hunting, we've been fortunate enough to cash a total of 23 outright winners (a 20.7% hit rate) for a profit of over $15,000 (betting roughly $350 per week) and an aggregate ROI of 38.3%. The volatility of the sport means I can't promise you a winner in any given tournament. Still, suppose you're willing to bet methodically and stick with the process. In that case, the outright golf betting market has the potential to be one of the most profitable (and enjoyable) betting sweats in the business. But I suppose I'd better keep my word about the necessary rants, so with no further ado, here's every bet I've made for the 2024 Wells Fargo Championship!\n\nIf Wyndham Clark is not going to get proper respect at a golf course he lapped the field by four just 12 months ago, it's difficult to forecast what it will take for books to start treating him like the third best player on the planet.\n\nDespite three wins over his last 20 starts (at LACC, Pebble Beach, and Quail Hollow nonetheless), two runner-ups to Scottie Scheffler at Bay Hill and TPC Sawgrass, and an additional two third-place finishes both in his last start at Harbour Town and in last year's TOUR Championship, Clark still sits a clear tier behind Rory and Xander according to the bookmakers. I personally ran to the window to grab a piece at 18-1 after it was announced that Ludvig Aberg would be sitting out in Charlotte due to a knee issue, but even with Ludvig in attendance, I had a lot of interest in the ever-undervalued Clark.\n\nIt's difficult to find a better course fit for the Oregon product than this week either -- as the combination of Quail Hollow's distance-intensive, 7,600-yard layout, combined with recent rains that have softened up the fairways mean that his field-leading marks in both Ball Speed and Distance to Apex will make Wyndham's driver a weapon around the array of long Par 4s and 5s on this routing.\n\nWyndham also ranks second in my putting modeling when isolating for green complexes with similar speed and agronomy to Quail, and since the start of 2024, the long-iron game has become a true weapon for our 2023 U.S. Open Champion. Clark ranks in the 90th percentile for GIR % on approaches over 200 yards, and number one on the PGA Tour in Good Shot Percentage.\n\nFor whatever reason, books continue to price the World No. 3 as an afterthought in these marquee fields. I'm more than happy to endorse the 16/18-1s still available on market, and barring an unmitigated disaster over the next four days, the 28s currently posted in next week's future markets are worthy of strong consideration as well.\n\nIf Ludvig Aberg isn't destined to continue Quail Hollow's legacy of crowning the PGA Tour's future stars, I can think of no better candidate to take his place than Sahith Theegala. We've been banging this drum at Flag Hunting for most of this 2024 season, and this week, fresh off of a runner-up finish to the absentee Scottie Scheffler, I'm happy to take another shot at calling this kid's inevitable breakthrough.\n\nIt almost defies belief how quickly Sahith has turned a blatant deficiency in his game into one of his more bankable strengths -- as one year after ranking 134th on Tour in Strokes Gained: Off-the-Tee, Theegala now sits as the sixth best driver of the ball in this star-studded field over his last 36 rounds. For reference, this sample extends back to Round 1 of the Sentry Tournament of Champions this past January, and currently puts him right in between the likes of Wyndham Clark and Cameron Young off of the tee.\n\nCombine this stunning development with the upside we've long identified in the rest of his game, and it becomes clear just how high the ceiling could be for this elite-driving version of Sahith Theegala:\n\nFrom Bay Hill and TPC Sawgrass, to Muirfield Village, Harbour Town, and Torrey Pines, Theegala has proven time and time again that his game is well suited for the biggest and brightest stages the PGA Tour has to offer. My numbers have him rated far above his current 33-1 price tag, and unless something drastic were to change in his underlying stats, this won't be the last time I make this case in a big-time event.\n\nDid you know RotoBaller has a Premium DFS PGA subscription?

You also get access to weekly betting picks from Spencer Aguiar, one of the top betting minds in the industry.\n\nSpeaking of trending off-the-tee breakthroughs, a recent change in equipment has seemingly put Tony Finau back amongst the ranks of the PGA Tour's elite drivers. Since changing to the GT version of his Mitsubishi Diamana driver shaft in March's Houston Open, Finau has gained a whopping 11.7 shots off of the tee in 12 subsequent rounds. He ranked 2nd and 3rd in Total Driving at the two more driver-intensive courses in that time (Memorial Park and Augusta National), and ranks 6th in this field in Driving Distance thus far in 2024.\n\nQuail Hollow's collection of 480+ yard par fours should be a perfect venue for Tony to keep that driving rhythm going, and when you combine this recent driving form with one of the most compelling approach profiles in this field (1st in Long Iron Proximity, 2nd in SG/Shot, 4th in Good Shot Percentage), and a top 20 short game rating, and Finau becomes one of the week's top commodities in terms of expected tee-to-green performance.\n\nHis place as the 12th-15th name on odds boards does not fully encompass these recent ball-striking gains, and if we can truly count on him as an elite all-around driver of the ball, I think Tony isn't far away from taking back his place on the mantle of top names to watch at the Tour's most demanding venues. My numbers hold his in as high regard as anyone in this field after the top three, and I'm happy to take my shot at prices bordering on 40-1.\n\nWe end this week's pre-tournament betting card with a name for which I have very little to say about his lead-in form. Frankly, Viktor Hovland has been abysmal to start the 2024 season, and as the weeks go by and the disappointments mount, it becomes more and more difficult to write off these recent struggles as a fluke.\n\nI will fully concede that there is a universe where we look back on this bet and laugh, but everybody has their price. For me, Viktor Hovland at 50-1 is where I draw the line -- particularly at a golf course as well suited to his skillset as Quail Hollow.\n\n7,600 yards. Driving. Long-iron play. Difficult scoring conditions. If that's not a recipe for a Viktor Hovland resurgence, I'm not sure what is. Despite his horrid results over the last four months, Hovland still ranks out as a top 15 driver of the ball in this field. He ranks second in my long-term proximity model, and three years ago, Viktor put together the second best putting week of his season in a third-place finish around Quail Hollow.\n\nMaybe the best argument that can be made for Hovland is the nearly full month off he's had after an embarrassing second round 81 at Augusta National. As someone who's watched Viktor's career unfold with great interest, that Friday afternoon felt as close to rock-bottom as it could possibly get. I like the fact that he took Harbour Town off, and if you know anything about Viktor, it's that he's putting in the work to get things right. If by chance he has stumbled on the correct formula over the last few weeks, his ascension back to the top of the game could come without warning.\n\nWith these four names on the card, we're still left with ~20% of our weekly budget to use on in-tournament additions. This section will outline a few names to monitor in the live markets, as well as a few potential angles to use when assessing player viability over the course of the week.", "source": {"uri": "rotoballer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "rotoballer.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ian_mcneill@rotoballer.com", "name": "Ian McNeill", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahith_Theegala", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sahith Theegala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Hill_Club_and_Lodge", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bay Hill Club and Lodge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbour_Town_Golf_Links", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harbour Town Golf Links"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPC_at_Sawgrass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TPC at Sawgrass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach_Golf_Links", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach Golf Links"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Young", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tour Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Finau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Finau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_of_Champions_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tournament of Champions (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muirfield_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muirfield Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrey_Pines_Golf_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torrey Pines Golf Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_statistical_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan statistical area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_National_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augusta National Golf Club"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://cdn.rotoballer.com/2020/01/tony-finau-pga-dfs-lineup-picks-daily-fantasy-golf-draftkings-fanduel-icon.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547461", "eventUri": "eng-9547461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

Scheffler isn't the only golfer missing in action this week. The talented youngster Ludvig Aberg is set to miss after withdrawing Monday morning, citing a knee injury as the reason for his absence.\n\nWith the two out this week and Aberg withdrawing after the opening odds were released, the pricing for a few more prominent names certainly took a hit. Those who were by their computers and betting apps could take advantage of stale pricing. I was not; that's not stopping me from betting on this week's event and hopefully cashing an outright bet.\n\nThis week's Wells Fargo Championship is being played at the iconic Quail Hollow. Home to Tour events, majors, and Presidents Cups, the 7,558-yard par-71 course offers a challenging task for the 70 golfers to tee it up this week. The course length off the tee and the golfers must also be sharp with their long irons and remain focused on the greens.\n\nI considered spreading my wagers around instead of taking just one or two of the golfers at the top of the board. However, I decided to take Xander Schaffuele to win at a short price, which basically limited the number of golfers I could bet on.\n\nIt wasn't with light consideration that I came to this decision. Initially, I was 100% single bulleting Aberg to win. However, when he withdrew, that sent me into pivot mode.\n\nBetting on Schaffeule here should make a bit of sense. Not only did he finish runner-up here last season, but he's probably the most complete and consistent golfer in the field. He's first in the field in SG in the last 24 rounds, and his game travels well to most golf courses.\n\nSpecifically, you'd want to bet on or roster strong all-around golfers at difficult courses. RickRunGood.com data tools have Schaffuele first in their Adjusted Course Fit model.\n\nThere's no question that Schaffuele is in great form. His attitude in his losses has made me feel more confident in backing him at a short price. He sounds comfortable and poised to win again soon.\n\nOther Outright Bet: Wyndham Clark +1600\n\nBet the Edge is your source for the day in sports betting. Get all of Jay Croucher and Drew Dinsick's insight weekdays beginning at 6AM ET right here or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nThis is my weekly reminder to pay attention to whether or not your book pays ties in full or does dead heat.\n\nStephan Jaeger to finish inside the top 20 is my favorite bet this week. His pricing, at times, feels almost disrespectful. He's only won once on the PGA Tour, but he's so talented you'd imagine his top 20 price in smaller fields would be closer to the +120 range.\n\nJaeger's strength off the tee should give him a massive advantage on the field this week. Over the last 24 rounds, he's fifth in SG: OTT and 10 in driving distance.\n\nHe's also playing some fairly good golf this season. He has finished in the top 20 at three of his last four events, including his win at the Houston Open.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidents_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidents Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senior major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iron (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2a67baf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/786x442+108+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff4%2Fe6%2Fba8f28ab47fe9b925fe46f5aff57%2Fwells-fargo-model.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547461", "eventUri": "eng-9547461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

The purpose of this article is to present you with alternative options to consider and hopefully make your selection a much easier process weekly. With that plan in mind, let's get started!\n\nXander can be a bit of a hot potato topic among golf fans. Do we praise him for the elite consistency that he seems to bring to every big event or do we criticize him for his seeming inability to actually win meaningful tournaments?\n\nIn a sense, the Wells Fargo seems to fall in the perfect sweet spot for the talented enigma that is the X-Man...it's a Signature Event hosted on a major championship-caliber golf course, yet it doesn't quite bring major-level pressure with it. It's a great fit for Schauffele, who scored a runner-up finish in last year's edition of the Wells Fargo and gets a fairly clear runway this go 'round with both Scottie Scheffler and Ludvig Aberg sidelined this week.\n\nLike what you read today?

You also get access to weekly betting picks from Spencer Aguiar, one of the top betting minds in the industry. Spencer is absolutely crushing out of the gate in 2022!\n\nIf you are front-running a league and only need to make one selection, I would go toward Wyndham Clark. However, Cantlay will be the contrarian name who makes this article a little easier to produce since I need a solo hit.\n\nNice stuff from Benny An to back door a T4 for the Ketchup Kings. I am in utter disbelief looking back on my selections so far and realizing that Chan Kim at the Mexico was our third biggest earner ($220K) ... two hundred measly thousand dollars is our third best effort at finding the winner with all options on the table .... WE NEED TO GET IT TOGETHER!!!!\n\nThis has come out of complete left field but we need to get on the board and there is nobody left playing in the Well \"See ya\" Fargo Championship more rock solid right now than Xander Schauffele (my pun referencing both Scottie and Ludvig (arguably the world's two best players) not playing after withdrawals AND Wells Fargo (A Bank - A symbol of security and sustainability) is pulling out as Sponsor of this event...not good.\n\nAnyway, back to Xander. He gives us a very likely chance of cashing a top 10, if not a top 5, with a rather reasonable chance that he is battling one of our four outrights down the stretch on Sunday. So this is an emotional hedge avoid missing out on his first win, with Quail Hollow likely being a top-3 venue for him to land a win based off his course fit. If he doesn't win, lets pocket a few mil and move on once more.\n\nAll previous selections are supposed to be removed. Only Byron followed the rules.\n\nLet us know what you think of her chances this week!", "source": {"uri": "rotoballer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "rotoballer.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "spencer_aguiar@rotoballer.com", "name": "Spencer Aguiar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanDuel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FanDuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fantasy sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Man_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "X-Man (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_(marketing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Promotion (marketing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lord Byron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortinet_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fortinet Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chan_Kim", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chan Kim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getafe_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Getafe CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pun", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo,_North_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fargo, North Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fargo, North Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://cdn.rotoballer.com/2020/02/PGA-one-and-done-stock-image-Golf-DFS-lineup-picks-betting-icon.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547461", "eventUri": "eng-9547461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

However, the dividend growth rate presents a mixed picture: a 2.10% annual growth over the past three years, a decrease to -9.60% per year over five years, and -2.80% per year over the past decade.

You finished 11 under. I don't think I played half-bad at all. I definitely left some birdies out there, but I'm not mad about it.\"\n\nDaryn Dickens (Howard University) showcased her exceptional skills at the Wells Fargo Championship Pro-Am on Quail Hollow Club's golf course in Charlotte, North Carolina. The freshman from Howard, Darius Laws (University of Maryland Eastern Shore), and Alexandre Burnett (North Carolina Central University) won the First Tee Alumni Entrepreneurs Program essay contest focusing on their futures as entrepreneurs and golfers. Winning the competition allowed the HBCU students to play a round with a professional golfer and former PGA Tour caddie, Michael Collins.\n\n\"Wells Fargo has a long history of supporting HBCUs and is committed to advancing opportunities for diverse communities. One way that's on display here at the Wells Fargo Championship is through our longstanding partnership with First Tee. In addition to hosting a golf clinic for the local chapter in Charlotte, we are proud to have three First Tee graduates - who are current HBCU students - playing in Wednesday's Pro-Am alongside a PGA TOUR Pro and gaining access to networking and mentorship opportunities off the course.\" Kristy Fercho, Head of Diverse Segments, Representation and Inclusion at Wells Fargo\n\n\"I just finished my first year [at Howard] last week,\" Dickens said. \"And getting ready to go into my sophomore year in August. I'm really excited. I had a great first year and got really involved. Academics were superb.\" Superb is an understatement, as the aspiring attorney earned a 4.0 GPA in two semesters at Howard.\n\nAs a product of attorneys from the D.C. area, Dickens is \"debating between criminal or civil rights law\" as a career. \"I've learned being a history major, I've been able to explore just like a lot of the indifferences and injustices that we have faced as black people. I want to be a part of that movement. I feel like, you know, and talks about the civil rights movement.\"\n\nShe isn't a member of the Bison Golf Team but hopes to utilize her love for golf as a resource to open doors and dialogue for change before finishing at Howard and heading to law school. \"One of those things that I want to be a part of is the role in changing those laws and helping those who are affected by it.\"\n\nWhile on the beautiful Quail Hollow Club course, Fleetwood and Power gave the HBCU students a few pointers to enhance their game. Daryn specifically spoke to Fleetwood about practice and his regimen. \" I'm in college right now, and I don't play on the golf team, but, I still love to play golf. So fitting that in within my schedule, I want to make the most of my time because I can't go out every day to play.\" With Power, he gave tips on putting and drives, which she immediately put into their round together. \"I had the opportunity to talk to Seamus about my putting, and, ironically, as soon as we finished talking about it, I had this long, like, 25-footer, and I sank it for an eagle.\"\n\nAlthough Dickens doesn't see a future as a professional golfer, she believes Wells Fargo and First Tee have been tremendous for her and others from HBCUs. \"I'd like to give a big shout out to Wells Fargo for giving us this opportunity. First Tee helped me apply and get her, but Wells Fargo is offering us the opportunity to play with pros and be able to play Quail Hollow. Also, I feel like they truly care.\"\n\nWells Fargo has paired Daryn with a mentor who will be available for guidance and counseling until her graduation. \"That relationship is going to continue past this tournament this week that I'm here in Charlotte. And I'm truly grateful for an opportunity that Wells Fargo has given to us to let us, you know, be able to develop in our field that we want to.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historically_black_colleges_and_universities", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Historically black colleges and universities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles Dickens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_golfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional golfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Central_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina Central University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland_Eastern_Shore", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Maryland Eastern Shore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Howard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_civil_rights_movement_(1954\u20131968)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African-American civil rights movement (1954\u20131968)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophomore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sophomore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eagle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bison"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4543,h_2555,x_0,y_69/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/hbcu_legends/01hxfpk2rst2h7geraap.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547461", "eventUri": "eng-9547461", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 452991123, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 82, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 82}}}

They need even more from him to stay alive", "text": "Connor McDavid led the Edmonton Oilers out of a horrendous start, all the way to the playoffs and into the Stanley Cup Final. When Darnell Nurse was being criticized in the third round for his struggles, McDavid jumped to his defense. When Matthew Tkachuk, Sam Bennett and the Florida Panthers ganged up on Zach Hyman and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, it was McDavid \u2014 a player not known for being in the fray after the whistle \u2014 who pushed his way in and took a few uppercuts for his trouble. \u201cIt says a lot about him as a leader,\u201d Hyman said. \u201cI got hit in the head by Bennett, and I think he was the first one in there. He sticks up for his teammates and he\u2019s not afraid to get into a scrum.\u201d The 27-year-old McDavid called it just a chance to \u201cdo my part.\u201d He has done more than his part to get Edmonton to this point as the leading scorer in the NHL playoffs with 38 points and the unquestioned leader as the face of the franchise and best player in hockey. The longtime captain, now in his nith NHL season, has had fingerprints all over this long run, capped so far by a four-point performance to keep his team from getting swept. More of that McDavid magic might be needed with the Oilers down 3-1 going into Game 5 on Tuesday night at Florida. \u201cAny time our team\u2019s backs are against the wall, he\u2019s the first guy to push back,\u201d Hyman said. \u201cFor us to come back, he\u2019s got to be he best. He seems to always be the best when we\u2019re in these situations.\u201d The whole league has seen it. When the Oilers faced elimination the first time this postseason in Game 6 of the second round against Vancouver, McDavid had three assists. When they fell behind 2-1 to Dallas in the Western Conference final, yep, three more assists. That\u2019s why no one around the team was surprised \u2014 impressed, sure \u2014 when McDavid had a goal and three assists in Game 4 with Edmonton on the brink. \u201cThat\u2019s what the great ones do \u2014 they lead,\u201d said teammate Connor Brown, who first played with McDavid a decade ago in junior with the Ontario Hockey League\u2019s Erie Otters. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the greats. He leads by example. He leads with his words, leads by example. When you need a shift, when you need a play, he pulls it out time and time again.\u201d McDavid, a three-time MVP who has led the league in points five times and and in goals once and been a first-team All-Star six times, has accomplished just about everything on an individual basis. The latest was reaching 32 assists, breaking Wayne Gretzky\u2019s record for the most in a single postseason. With his mind solely on hoisting the Stanley Cup for the first time, he downplayed adding something else to the history books. \u201cObviously not the focus with where we\u2019re at, but not lost on me what he means to the game,\u201d McDavid said. \u201cNot the focus.\u201d McDavid\u2019s focus is on team success. Those closest to him on a daily basis see it the most in practice. \u201c(It\u2019s about) just how much he cares, how much he works,\u201d said forward Dylan Holloway, who scored twice in Game 4. \u201cHe\u2019s smart with the way he goes about it, and he always puts in max effort. Every rep in practice, he\u2019s dialed in. He\u2019s not kind of lollygagging, no matter how tired he is. I know he\u2019s tired, too, because he plays so much and practice the next day. I\u2019m tired and I play half what he plays, but he\u2019s so dialed in practice.\u201d McDavid was the biggest reason the Oilers made the final, and now it\u2019s squarely on his shoulders to, as McDavid said, drag the Panthers back to Alberta. \u201cIt\u2019s not an accident he is the player he is,\u201d Brown said. \u201cHe works harder than anyone I\u2019ve ever met. Night in, night out he competes as hard as he can. He\u2019s our best player, and he competes the hardest. We\u2019re lucky to have him.\u201d ___ AP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21jZGF2aWQtb2lsZXJzLXN0YW5sZXktY3VwLWVmOGYzNzliYTc1MmQ4ZjI0OTU0MTk5ZDUzY2E4MzBi0gEA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Connor McDavid led the Oilers to the Stanley Cup Final.

Other university arguments, Brann wrote, were based on similar misrepresentations.\n\nPenn State declined comment through a spokesperson, which is the university's general policy when litigation is ongoing. The university must answer the lawsuit within 14 days.\n\nWassel's lawsuit alleged the university's longtime head majorette coach fat-shamed, harassed, discriminated and retaliated against her during her four years at the university.\n\nThe harassment, as attorney Andy Shubin described it, was \"devastating and all encompassing.\" The 31-page suit also contained similar allegations from four other former majorettes.\n\nWassel, of Maryland, earned a spot on the majorettes team, which is part of the Blue Band, when she enrolled in 2018. The harassment, she alleged, began almost immediately.\n\nShe accused Bean of targeting her and some of her teammates based upon \"her view that their body size did not comport with what a stereotypical woman should look like.\" She alleged Bean deliberately forced her to wear a uniform that was too small and prohibited her from either exchanging or altering it.\n\nAs a result, according to the filing, Wassel developed an eating disorder.\n\n\"During virtually every practice session, Bean reprimanded Kaitlyn about her eating, body shape, and the fit of her uniform,\" Shubin wrote. \"She forced Kaitlyn to wear the ill-fitting uniform as a means to shame her and make her feel that she did not comport with what a woman should look like -- routinely in front of her teammates.\"\n\nWhen Wassel brought an allegation of sexual assault to Bean, the suit alleged the coach was \"enraged\" and berated her. She also claimed the coach refused to report it, ordered her to not report or speak about it and told teammates to stay away because she was a \"bad person.\"\n\nWhen a lice infestation broke out among the twirling team, Bean allegedly told Wassel it was her fault because she was \"such a whore\" and the team was \"lucky she did not spread an STD to them.\"\n\nThe suit also alleged Bean persistently questioned Wassel about her personal, social and sexual life, calling her in the evenings and on weekends to ask for private information.\n\nAfter a fellow majorette filed a formal discrimination complaint against Bean during Wassel's sophomore year, the coach allegedly told Wassel she would be kicked off the team or expelled if she ever filed a report.\n\nWassel's suit also alleged Bean ostracized her from the team, arranging for team photos to be taken only when Wassel was not present and enlisting a teammate to \"aggressively\" bully her.\n\nAccording to the suit, Bean told Wassel she deserved \"everything that's coming to you\" and that \"you should think about why you deserved to be bullied and fix yourself.\"\n\nShubin wrote that Wassel was happy, healthy, well-adjusted and driven before she arrived in Happy Valley, but was driven to panic attacks, sleeping problems, anxiety and other increasingly severe mental health symptoms.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged Bean's supervisor and Blue Band Director Gregory Drane was dismissive of her complaints and stripped Wassel of her role as team captain the day after a 2021 meeting.\n\nA week after graduating, Wassel and other twirlers and alumnae who separately initiated complaints against Bean banded together. A February 2023 letter that summarized a joint investigation said many of the allegations were corroborated and violated university policy.\n\nThe report found the university could not substantiate the allegations of sexual discrimination and harassment because it \"occurred without the presence of witnesses.\"\n\nThe university said it could not discipline Bean because she already resigned in fall 2022 after nearly three decades as majorettes coach. Bean was not named as a defendant in the suit.\n\n\"Bean ... amassed a record of competitive successes, including winning national championships for Penn State,\" Shubin wrote. \"Sadly, the University prioritized the prestige Bean brought to the University over the safety and well-being of its students; it valued its reputation over its integrity and Kaitlyn and other majorettes were predictable causalities.\"\n\nThe lawsuit claims Penn State violated Title IX -- the landmark U.S. law meant to bring equity between men and women in most facets of education -- and the equal protection clause of the Constitution.

Soon, Wassel joined a \"world-champion Baltimore-based twirling club,\" and was coached by \"a former Penn State twirler.\" This inspired her to apply to Penn State; which has had numerous national championship wins since its team, the Blue Band Majorettes was founded in 1972, according to the complaint citing the school's website at the time.\n\nAfter the lengthy audition process, Wassel made the team in 2018. She claims then-head coach, Heather Bean, harassed and bullied her \"almost immediately.\" The suit goes on to allege that Bean, who was the coach from 1994 through 2022, bullied and harassed her as part of a \"fat-shaming\" which included making her wear a uniform that was knowingly too small.\n\nThe suit also alleges that Bean repeatedly sexually harassed Wassel by calling her various names and calling her on the phone on nights and weekends to question her about her private life.\n\nWassel, states in the suit that she went to the other coach, Gregory Danes, about these issues but she was ignored. Wassel soon fell into depression, developed an eating disorder, and became suicidal -- all of which she attributes to the psychology state Coach Bean put her in, according to the complaint.\n\nAfter graduating with her Engineering degree, Wassel and four other women went to PSU to request that an investigation be conducted into Coach Bean and the team, as they believed the conduct violated the school's harassment policy, but Penn State refused saying that the university \"could not substantiate the allegations,\" according to the complaint.\n\nSince Bean has already resigned and the school doesn't feel this harassment was truly sexual-based discrimination, PSU filed a motion to have the case dismissed in February.\n\nThe judge's denial of the request means Wassel's case stands a chance at playing out in court.", "source": {"uri": "dailyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagerstown,_Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hagerstown, Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hagerstown, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma_of_obesity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social stigma of obesity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eating disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.dailyvoice.com/image/upload/c_limit,e_sharpen,q_auto:eco,w_640/Screenshot_2024-01-09_11.12.42_AM_jbtjpk.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551023", "eventUri": "eng-9551023", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Resources Safety Health Queensland says it was notified of an ignition of methane at the Grosvenor coal mine near Moranbah. It's the same mine where five workers suffered extensive burns after a methane explosion in May 2020. A RSHQ spokesperson said mines inspectors were attending the site. \"We understand all workers have been removed from underground and accounted for, with no injuries reported,\" they said. A spokesperson for mine owner Anglo America said there were no injuries and all workers were safe. Full investigation The fire comes just weeks after the Queensland Parliament passed new legislation aimed at improving safety in the resources sector. One of the key amendments is the implementation of critical controls \u2013 an important recommendation from the Coal Mining Board of Inquiry. Resources minister Scott Stewart confirmed that there had been an incident. \"There has been a serious incident at Anglo American's Grosvenor underground coal mine this morning,\" he said. \"I'm advised safety inspectors and workers' representatives are heading to the mine now and there will be a full investigation. \"Queenslanders have a right to come home safely from their work and I expect a full and thorough investigation into this.\" Mining and Energy Union industry safety and health representative Jason Hill said any incident that had put the lives of miners at risk was a concern. \"Until I get there and understand what has happened we won't know more,\" Mr Hill said. Loading... In the late afternoon of May 6, 2020, emergency services raced to the Grosvenor mine, where an explosion had occurred underground. Those in the immediate area of the blast were badly burned and one of the men describing the experience as \"like standing in a blowtorch\". The Coal Mine Board of Inquiry into the disaster as well as 40 other high potential incidents found the mine's gas drainage systems couldn't cope with the rate of production. Anglo coal divestment The incident comes as Anglo American announced the plan sale of all of its Australian coal mines after rejecting a takeover bid from rival BHP. It owns five coking coal mines in Queensland's Bowen Basin \u2014 Moranbah North, Capcoal, Dawson, Aquila and Grosvenor. Anglo American's five operations employ about 5,000 workers plus contractors, according to the mining union.", "summary": "A fire at an underground mine at Moranbah in Central Queensland has broken out at the same site where there was an explosion in 2020 that injured five workers.", "url": "https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-29/moranbah-grosvenor-coal-mine-evacuated-after-fire/104039616", "image": "https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/3b2778c168ada46e6b6a9debe8eebacf?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=677&cropW=1203&xPos=0&yPos=92&width=862&height=485", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:04:29", "author": "Danielle Jesser", "authors": ["Danielle Jesser"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "AU", "sentiment": -0.265}

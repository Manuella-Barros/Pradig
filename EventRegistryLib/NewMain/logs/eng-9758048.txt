Mateo's arm appeared to bend awkwardly on a collision with fellow infielder Gunnar Henderson as both pursued a batted ball from Marlins outfielder Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez during the third inning. After the game, the Orioles announced Mateo had returned negative X-rays, but that he was set to undergo an MRI.\n\nMateo, 29, came into Tuesday having hit .230/.268/.403 (92 OPS+) with five home runs and 13 stolen bases (on 15 attempts) over the course of his first 67 games. His contributions thus far this season have been worth an estimated 0.8 Wins Above Replacement, according to the calculations housed at Baseball Reference.\n\nOrioles manager Brandon Hyde subsequently removed Mateo from the contest and altered his defensive alignment. Jordan Westburg, Baltimore's starting third baseman, was shifted to the keystone; Ram\u00f3n Ur\u00edas came off the bench to take over at the hot corner.\n\nIt's worth noting that Mateo was not the only Orioles player to leave the field with an apparent injury during the third inning. Baltimore right-hander Albert Su\u00e1rez was struck in the foot by a line drive from the next batter, Otto L\u00f3pez. Su\u00e1rez, a pleasant surprise who entered the night with a 2.82 ERA on the season, was replaced by lefty Keegan Akin. Su\u00e1rez was described as having a bruised shin. (The Orioles are known to be in the trade market for pitching help.)\n\nIf Mateo is forced to miss any game action, it's at least possible that the Orioles would bring prospect Jackson Holliday back to the majors for the first time since his demotion in late April. Holliday has hit .316/.494/.614 since returning from the injured list in late June. He's homered three times and walked five more times than he's struck out in 17 Triple-A games.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_j_anderson@cbssports.com", "name": "R.J.

A.J. Puk (4-8) pitched two perfect innings of relief for the win.

He will undergo an MRI on Wednesday.\n\nSu\u00e1rez's outing ended when Miami's next hitter, Otto L\u00f3pez, hit a comebacker that deflected off the pitcher's right shin and rolled near the Marlins' dugout on the third-base side for a single that loaded the bases. Su\u00e1rez was diagnosed with a contusion.\n\n\"It hurts more now than when I got hit. The adrenaline is down now,\" Su\u00e1rez said. \"The X-rays came out negative, thankfully. Just swollen. Nothing else.\"\n\nChisholm had two hits, including a two-run double that capped a four-run second inning and put Miami ahead 4-1. S\u00e1nchez led off the inning with a 429-foot homer, his 12th of the season, and Gordon added a run-scoring single.\n\n\"Everybody before the game was talking about how they feel so good today and how we're going to have a great series against the Orioles,\" Chisholm said.\n\nChisholm also had two stolen bases and made a throw from center field that caught Colton Cowser at third after he took off from first on Ryan Mountcastle's single in the third.\n\n\"We talked about in the pre-game that you can't hurt ourselves on the bases and give away extra outs,\" Marlins manager Skip Schumaker said. \"We have to play the game the right way in order to beat a team like that. I felt like we did that.\"\n\nJosh Bell and Otto L\u00f3pez each had a pair of singles for the Marlins, who have the worst record in the National League at 36-65.\n\nTyler, promoted from Triple-A Tuesday, struck out five and allowed three earned runs in 4 2/3 innings. A.J. Puk (4-8) pitched two perfect innings of relief for the win. Tanner Scott closed with a scoreless ninth for his 17th save.\n\nMarlins relievers have allowed three runs over 18 innings since the All-Star break.\n\n\"That's our jobs down there, when your name's called, get the job done,\" Puk said. \"We're relaxed and confident and throwing the ball well.\"\n\nSu\u00e1rez (5-4) gave up six runs and eight hits in two-plus innings.\n\nThe Orioles scored two runs in the third on RBI singles by Ryan O'Hearn and Colton Cowser, before the Marlins extended their lead to 6-3 in the bottom half of the inning on a sacrifice fly by Xavier Edwards and Gordon's RBI groundout.\n\n\"We just did not play well,\" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said. \"We made a lot of mistakes early in the game, ran ourselves out of innings twice. We need to play better.\"\n\nJordan Westburg's run-scoring single in the first provided an early lead for Baltimore, which leads the majors in homers with 157 but didn't have another hit after O'Hearn's two-out single in the fifth.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMarlins: LHP Josh Simpson (left elbow neuritis) threw a 35-pitch bullpen Tuesday and could be scheduled for two additional bullpens before he progresses to throw live batting practice. ...

A.J. Puk (4-8) pitched two perfect innings of relief for the win. Tanner Scott closed with a scoreless ninth for his 17th save.\n\nSu\u00e1rez (5-4) gave up six runs and eight hits in two-plus innings.\n\nThe Orioles scored two runs in the third on RBI singles by Ryan O'Hearn and Colton Cowser, before the Marlins extended their lead to 6-3 in the bottom half of the inning on a sacrifice fly by Xavier Edwards sacrifice fly and Gordon's RBI groundout.\n\nJordan Westburg's run-scoring single in the first provided an early lead for Baltimore, which leads the majors in homers with 157 but didn't have another hit after O'Hearn's two-out single in the fifth.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMarlins: LHP Josh Simpson (left elbow neuritis) threw a 35-pitch bullpen Tuesday and could be scheduled for two additional bullpens before he progresses to throw live batting practice. ... RHP Yonny Chirinos was designated for assignment to make room Tyler' on the roster.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Orioles have not announced a starter for the second game of the series Wednesday.

The infielders ran into each other trying to field a ground-ball up the middle, and Henderson's leg jammed Mateo's arm awkwardly into the ground. Mateo immediately went down in pain and left the game after a conversation with head trainer Brian Ebel. Jordan Westburg took over for Mateo at second base, while Ram\u00f3n Ur\u00edas replaced Westburg at third.\n\nThe next batter in the inning, second baseman Otto L\u00f3pez, hit a 102 mph line drive that deflected off Su\u00e1rez's right foot and landed in foul territory near the Marlins' dugout along the third base line. Manager Brandon Hyde and assistant athletic trainer Patrick Wesley met the 34-year-old right-hander at the mound and pulled him from the game after a brief conversation.\n\nKeegan Akin, who was already warming in the bullpen with Su\u00e1rez off to a poor start, entered with the bases loaded and no outs. The left-hander allowed two inherited runners to score before getting out of the inning as the Orioles fell behind 6-3. Su\u00e1rez's final line featured six earned runs on eight hits over two innings.\n\nMateo, 29, has been the Orioles' everyday second baseman for most of the season, batting .229 with a .668 OPS while stealing 13 bases and playing strong defense up the middle. If forced to miss any time, this would be the second time this season Mateo has landed on the injured list after an errant swing by Cedric Mullins in the on-deck circle hit him in the head June 2 and forced him to the concussion IL.\n\nSu\u00e1rez, meanwhile, has been one of the most remarkable stories in baseball this season, entering Tuesday with a 2.82 ERA in his first season in the major leagues since 2017. The veteran has been invaluable for an Orioles rotation that lost Kyle Bradish, Tyler Wells and John Means to season-ending elbow injuries, making 12 starts and posting a 5-3 record.\n\nEven before the injury to Su\u00e1rez, the Orioles added a potential reinforcement for the rotation. Chayce McDermott, the Orioles' No. 2 pitching prospect behind Cade Povich, could make his MLB debut Wednesday after joining the club's taxi squad in Miami. The 25-year-old right-hander has a 3.96 ERA at Triple-A Norfolk this season.\n\nWhile their pitching staff has been hit hard by injuries, the Orioles' starting position players have largely remained healthy this season. Mateo's previous IL stint led to second base prospect Connor Norby getting his first taste of the major leagues. Should they need to dip back into the prospect ranks once again, middle infielder Jackson Holliday (No. 2 on Baseball America's top 100), corner infielder Coby Mayo (No. 12) and Norby would all be options for Baltimore.\n\nThe Orioles went on to lose, 6-3, as neither lineup managed to scrape another run across after the starters left the game.\n\nMiami came out aggressive against Su\u00e1rez early, scoring four runs in the second inning on a first-pitch solo home run by Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez, two stolen bases -- one of which forced a throwing error by Adley Rutschman -- and a two-run hustle double by Jazz Chisholm Jr. on a slow ground ball to right field.\n\nThe Orioles showed some fight early against Marlins starter Kyle Tyler, taking a 1-0 lead in the first after Rutschman scored on an RBI single by Westburg. They then responded to Miami's four-run frame with a two-spot of their own in the third, as Ryan O'Hearn and Colton Cowser each checked in with RBI singles to bring the Orioles within three.\n\nBut that was as far as they would get. Despite a parade of relievers in Akin, Burch Smith, Vinny Nittoli and Bryan Baker combining to pitch five scoreless frames, the Marlins' bullpen matched them out-for-out, capped off by a dominant ninth inning by former Orioles reliever Tanner Scott. It was the 17th save of the season for Scott, who is a trade candidate heading into next week's deadline.\n\nThe loss dropped the Orioles to 23-21 since June 1 and 60-40 overall. They've yet to announce their starter for Wednesday's contest but added pitching prospect Chayce McDermott to their taxi squad Tuesday and pushed Corbin Burnes back to Thursday to give him an extra day of rest.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

S\u00e1nchez reached on a single. Mateo initially stood up, but then fell to the ground and grimaced, favoring his left arm. He was tended to by an Orioles athletic trainer, and the team said he had left elbow pain.\n\nOrioles manager Brandon Hyde said X-ray results on Mateo's injury were negative, but he will undergo an MRI.\n\n\"Jorge brings a lot to the table for us, so we're hoping for the best,\" Hyde said.\n\nJordan Westburg shifted from third base to second and Ram\u00f3n Ur\u00edas entered at third in Mateo's batting spot, ninth in the order.\n\nOtto L\u00f3pez, the next batter, hit a hard comebacker that deflected off Su\u00e1rez's right foot and rolled near the Marlins dugout on the third-base side for a single that loaded the bases.

Mateo's arm appeared to bend awkwardly on a collision with fellow infielder Gunnar Henderson as both pursued a batted ball from Marlins outfielder Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez during the third inning.\n\nMateo, 29, came into Tuesday having hit .230/.268/.403 (92 OPS+) with five home runs and 13 stolen bases (on 15 attempts) over the course of his first 67 games. His contributions thus far this season have been worth an estimated 0.8 Wins Above Replacement, according to the calculations housed at Baseball Reference.\n\nOrioles manager Brandon Hyde subsequently removed Mateo from the contest and altered his defensive alignment. Jordan Westburg, Baltimore's starting third baseman, was shifted to the keystone; Ram\u00f3n Ur\u00edas came off the bench to take over at the hot corner.\n\nIt's worth noting that Mateo was not the only Orioles player to leave the field with an apparent injury during the third inning. Baltimore right-hander Albert Su\u00e1rez was struck in the foot by a line drive from the next batter, Otto L\u00f3pez. Su\u00e1rez, a pleasant surprise who entered the night with a 2.82 ERA on the season, was replaced by lefty Keegan Akin.\n\nThe severity of either player's injury is heretofore unknown. If Mateo is forced to miss any game action, it's at least possible that the Orioles would bring prospect Jackson Holliday back to the majors for the first time since his demotion in late April. Holliday has hit .316/.494/.614 since returning from the injured list in late June. He's homered three times and walked five more times than he's struck out in 17 Triple-A games.\n\nThe Orioles are known to be in the trade market for pitching help.

The 34-year-old's final line is brutal: two innings, eight hits, six hits, one walk, three strikeouts. The Marlins whiffed just five times on 31 swings against him, notable for a club near the bottom of the league in contact rate.\n\nIt was a shocking outcome after Su\u00e1rez's smooth first inning that required only 10 pitches and included two strikeouts. The vibes were high in that moment. The Orioles had just gone ahead 1-0 in the top of the inning on a Jordan Westburg single to score Adley Rutschman, and their starter looked great in the bottom of the frame. But the evening unraveled from there.\n\nMiami's first four hitters reached base to begin the second inning. That included a solo home run from Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez and an RBI single off the bat of Nick Gordon. After a sacrifice bunt put two runners in scoring position, Jazz Chisholm Jr. drove them both in with a run-scoring double to make it 4-1 Marlins.\n\nThe O's fought back in the top of the third. Their first three hitters of the inning got aboard: Adley Rutschman walk, Anthony Santander single, and Ryan O'Hearn single. Westburg nerfed the rally a bit with a run-scoring double play ground out. But Colton Cowser rescued it with a hustling infield single that drove in Santander and pulled the Orioles within a run. Cowser followed that immediately by being thrown out at third base on a Ryan Mountcastle single, a violation of baseball's Cardinal rules.\n\nIt turns out that was just the beginning of a series of awful happenings in the third inning.\n\nIn the bottom of the inning, with a runner on first base and no outs, S\u00e1nchez hit a slow grounder through the infield. Gunnar Henderson and Jorge Mateo both converged on the ball and collided on the edge of the dirt. Henderson bounced up and collected the ball while Mateo was left in a heap, clutching his left elbow. It didn't look good in real time, and the rather gruesome replay was even worse. Mateo's elbow bent in an abnormal manner, and it's safe to say he will be out for some time.\n\nMateo had settled into the Orioles' everyday second baseman role, and although his offensive production has waned since early this season, his speed and positional versatility will be difficult to replace. In the short term, it feels like Westburg will shift over to second base more often and Ram\u00f3n Ur\u00edas will play third most days. Internally, the Orioles could turn to Connor Norby or Jackson Holliday for second base help. Holliday just returned to playing the field this week after dealing with shoulder trouble for a few weeks, so the Orioles could slow play that though. Norby has been pushed to left field by that development, but should still be plenty comfortable on the dirt if needed. But he could also be part of a trade within the week. Whatever the case, they will need to fill in Mateo's playing time somehow.\n\nOn the very next at-bat, Su\u00e1rez was hit by a comebacker that deflected towards Ur\u00eeas -- who had entered as Mateo's replacement -- for a single. That loaded the bases and pushed the starter out of the game, either due to legitimate injury or under-performance. Su\u00e1rez did exit under the watch of a trainer, but it was also time for him to leave. Hopefully he doesn't have anything serious wrong. The Orioles need all the arms they can get, but Su\u00e1rez could be running short on starting opportunities.\n\nKeegan Akin was called upon to get out of the jam. He did not exactly do that as two of the three runners he inherited scored. But he stemmed the bleeding and kept the Marlins within sight.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive pitching performance of the game (from the O's perspective anyway) was Burch Smith. He entered after Akin and looked fantastic. Over 1.2 innings he struck out three and allowed just one hit. Considering he maxed out his fastball at 98.2 mph, it's possible he was amped up to face his former team. Whatever the case, he did well. The Orioles bullpen needs help, and it can't all come from big trade deadline moves. They need some of their waiver claims to pan out. So far, Smith has done that.\n\nVinny Nittoli was next out of the 'pen, just hit second appearance in an Orioles' uniform. He also did well, delivering two scoreless innings and striking out one with his right-handed finesses style.\n\nThe Orioles bats wouldn't put up much of a fight as the game went on. They had just two base runners after the third inning: an O'Hearn single in the fifth and an Austin Hays hit by pitch in the ninth. That was it. They were thwarted by a Marlins relief effort that included two shutout innings from A.J. Puk and a Tanner Scott save. Both of those lefties are trade candidates in the days ahead. Perhaps Mike Elias took notice.\n\nIt was a brutal evening of baseball all around. The Orioles lost to a bad team, and an important piece of their lineup went out with what appears to be a serious injury.\n\nAt least the bullpen was solid, albeit against a flawed lineup. The front office is sure to make moves in the days ahead to further bolster the unit, but what's already in-house will continue to make up the bulk of relief innings thrown from this point forward.\n\nThese two teams are back at in on Wednesday night in Miami. It is rumored that Chayce McDermott will make his MLB debut for the O's. The team is yet to announce a starter for the game, and the 25-year-old is on the taxi squad for this series. Maybe McDermott does well, but the fact that the Orioles are calling on a guy walking more than five batters per nine innings in Triple-A to start a game right now speaks to the need for another starter (or two).

Injury Explained", "body": "Many fans are wondering about what happened to Jorge Mateo after his recent absence from the field. The talented shortstop has been sidelined due to an unexpected injury, raising concerns among his fans and other Baltimore Orioles supporters.\n\nHere is everything that you need to know about George Mateo's injury and when he will return to play.\n\nHow did Jorge Mateo get injured playing baseball?\n\nDuring Tuesday night's game against the Miami Marlins, Jorge Mateo, the second baseman for the Baltimore Orioles, suffered an apparent left arm injury in the third inning. The injury occurred when Mateo collided with fellow infielder Gunnar Henderson while both were pursuing a batted ball from Marlins outfielder Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez.\n\nAfter the collision, Mateo experienced significant pain as his arm appeared to bend awkwardly. Despite negative X-rays, Mateo will undergo an MRI to determine the extent of the injury. The incident prompted manager Brandon Hyde to make strategic adjustments to cover Mateo's position on the field, leading to the Orioles' defensive lineup changes.\n\nWhen will Jorge Mateo return to play MLB?\n\nJorge Mateo will return to MLB action once the MRI results are available and the severity of his elbow injury is determined. According to MLB, manager Brandon Hyde said Mateo is day-to-day, and his return timeline will depend on the MRI results.\n\nMateo was a valuable player for the Orioles before he got injured. He was a strong contributor both in offense and defense, with a .230/.268/.403 slash line, five home runs, and 13 stolen bases in his first 67 games, according to OBS Sports. His injury led to changes in the Orioles' lineup, showing how important he is to the team.\n\nMateo's injury will have a big impact on the Orioles, but we're not sure how long he'll be out. The team is getting ready for different possibilities, like changing the roster, to make sure they can still compete while Mateo recovers.", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vritti_johar@comingsoon.net", "name": "Vritti Johar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Mateo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jorge Mateo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic resonance imaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jes\u00fas_S\u00e1nchez_(outfielder)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez (outfielder)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Hyde", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Hyde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Prevention_Issues", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Prevention Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Jorge-Mateo-injury-Baltimore-Orioles.jpg?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758048", "eventUri": "eng-9758048", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Two Baltimore Orioles infielders made a play on the ball \u00e2\u20ac\" Mateo and shortstop Gunnar Henderson.\n\nHenderson made the sliding stop, but Mateo crashed into him regardless. The second baseman's arm got caught under Henderson's leg, taking his glove clean off and forcing his arm to bend the wrong way.\n\nMateo was removed from the contest with a left elbow injury. Jordan Westburg slid over the second in his place, while Ram\u00c3\u00b3n Ur\u00c3\u00adas came in to play third.\n\nThe Orioles went on to lose 6-3.\n\nManager Brandon Hyde said after the game that the initial X-rays on Mateo's arm came back negative, and that he has been labeled day-to-day. Further testing is required, though, and Mateo is scheduled to undergo an MRI to determine next steps.\n\nBack on June 2, Mateo got hit in the head by Cedric Mullins' bat after he bent over in the on-deck circle. Mateo was forced out of that contest as well, and he wound up hitting the 7-day concussion injured list the next day.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Mateo will need to spend more time on the injured list in order to let his elbow heal.\n\nAccording to MASN Sports' Roch Kubatko and The Baltimore Banner's Andy Kostka, infield prospect Connor Norby is expected to join the Orioles in Miami in case Mateo is unable to go Wednesday or Thursday. Norby, who is ranked as the No. 3 prospect in Baltimore's farm system, made his MLB debut during Mateo's absence in June.\n\nThrough 68 appearances this season, Mateo is batting .229 with a .668 OPS, outpacing his figures from both 2022 and 2023. The 29-year-old has recorded five home runs, 18 RBI and 10 stolen bases in 2024, as well as a 0.8 WAR.\n\nFirst pitch between the Orioles and Marlins on Wednesday is scheduled for 6:40 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunnar_Henderson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gunnar Henderson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henderson,_Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Henderson, Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedric_Mullins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cedric Mullins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Hyde", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Hyde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-deck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-deck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magnetic resonance imaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Banner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Banner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MASN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MASN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wins Above Replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Farm team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3191,h_1794,x_0,y_86/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/fastball/01j3h6xedctmyy2q8wpc.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758048", "eventUri": "eng-9758048", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 1001, "textEnd": 1007}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The Marlins drew even when Sanchez led off the second inning with his 12th home run of the season and his first in seven games.\n\nLater in the inning, Gordon's single drove in the go-ahead run, before Chisholm rapped a two-run double, giving him five runs batted in during a three-game stretch. It was Chisholm's first double in more than 90 at-bats.\n\nBaltimore was within 4-3 after third-inning RBI singles from O'Hearn and Colton Cowser.

Ram\u00edrez added an RBI single in the sixth.\n\nSteven Kwan and rookie Jhonkensy Noel also hit homers for Cleveland, which has been in an offensive rut for weeks. The Guardians came in having scored two or fewer runs in six of their past eight games.\n\nWenceel Perez hit a two-run homer for the Tigers.\n\nCARDINALS 2, PIRATES 1\n\nPITTSBURGH (AP) -- Rookie Paul Skenes lost for the first time in 12 career major league starts, giving up Alec Burleson's tiebreaking single in the ninth inning that lifted St. Louis over Pittsburgh.\n\nPitching for the first time since starting for the National League in last week's All-Star Game, the 22-year-old right-hander pitched past the seventh inning for the first time in the major leagues.\n\nNolan Arenado put St. Louis ahead with a fifth-inning home run on a first-pitch curveball, and Nick Gonzalez tied the score with an RBI single in the eighth off JoJo Romero.\n\nSkenes (6-1) threw 91 pitches through eight innings, and Pirates manager Derek Shelton allowed him to remain on the mound for the ninth.\n\nPADRES 4, NATIONALS 0\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Luis Arraez and Jurickson Profar homered on consecutive pitches in the fifth inning, and San Diego blanked Washington.\n\nRandy V\u00e1squez pitched six innings to earn his first victory since June 22 for San Diego, which has won three in a row.\n\nWashington, which had won five of six, is 0-4 against the Padres this season. The Nationals were shut out for the 11th time.\n\nNationals starter DJ Herz (1-4), recalled from Triple-A Rochester earlier in the day, breezed through three innings, then escaped a bases-loaded jam in the fourth. He retired the first two batters in the fifth before facing the top of the lineup for the third time.\n\nMARLINS 6, ORIOLES 3\n\nMIAMI (AP) -- Jazz Chisholm Jr. and Nick Gordon each drove in two runs, Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez homered and Kyle Tyler and four relievers held Baltimore without a run after the third inning as Miami beat the Orioles.\n\nBaltimore, which slipped into a tie with Cleveland for the best record in the American League at 60-40, was slowed after losing second baseman Jorge Mateo and starting pitcher Albert Su\u00e1rez due to injuries in the third inning.\n\nMateo collided with shortstop Gunnar Henderson as they dove to catch a grounder off the bat of Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez behind the second base bag and left because of left elbow pain.\n\nSu\u00e1rez's outing ended when Miami's next hitter, Otto L\u00f3pez, hit a comebacker that deflected the pitcher's right foot and rolled near the Marlins' dugout on the third-base side for a single that loaded the bases.\n\nRAYS 4, BLUE JAYS 2\n\nTORONTO (AP) -- Brandon Lowe hit a two-run home run and Tampa Bay Rays won for the fourth time in five games by beating Toronto.\n\nToronto's Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit his 17th home run and outfielder Daulton Varsho made an impressive leaping catch for the second game in a row, but Toronto lost for the fifth time in seven games.\n\nRight-hander Shawn Armstrong opened for the Rays -- who climbed back over .500 at 51-50 -- in place of righty Ryan Pepiot, who was hospitalized in New York City on Sunday because of a knee infection.\n\nArmstrong exited after striking out four in two scoreless innings. Left-hander Tyler Alexander (3-3) followed and struck out four over three shutout innings.\n\nMETS 3, YANKEES 2\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Jeff McNeil kept up his sudden power surge with a two-run homer that snapped a sixth-inning tie, and the New York Mets held off the New York Yankees in their Subway Series opener.\n\nJose Quintana (5-6) and five relievers combined on a five-hitter at Yankee Stadium as the Mets (52-48) matched their season high of four games over .500. They are 3-0 against their crosstown rivals, including a two-game sweep at Citi Field last month.\n\nWith closer Edwin D\u00edaz unavailable, Jake Diekman worked a hitless ninth for his fourth save. After walking Juan Soto with one out, the veteran lefty froze Aaron Judge with a 96 mph fastball on the inside corner for a called third strike, then retired rookie Ben Rice on a grounder to end it.\n\nThe Mets had walked Judge his first four times up, once intentionally, but the Yankees couldn't capitalize.\n\nRANGERS 3, WHITE SOX 2\n\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Texas right-hander Jon Gray allowed one run pitching into the eighth inning and retired the last 15 batters he faced as the Rangers beat the Chicago White Sox.\n\nAfter Andrew Vaughn's RBI single with two outs in the third inning, the White Sox didn't get another batter on base against Gray (5-4). The last was pinch-hitter Tommy Pham for the second out of the eighth, when shortstop Jonathan Ornelas made a backhanded stop and was falling away from first base when he made a incredible throw.\n\nGray struck out five and walked none while throwing 63 of his 80 pitches for strikes.\n\nThe White Sox (27-76) have lost nine games in a row and 15 of 18. They are only the 12th team in MLB history with 76 losses in their first 103 games, and the first since the 1979 Oakland Athletics.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news",

Ram\u00edrez added an RBI single in the sixth.\n\nSteven Kwan and rookie Jhonkensy Noel also hit homers for Cleveland, which has been in an offensive rut for weeks. The Guardians came in having scored two or fewer runs in six of their past eight games.\n\nPitching for the first time since starting for the National League in last week's All-Star Game, the 22-year-old right-hander pitched past the seventh inning for the first time in the major leagues.\n\nNolan Arenado put St. Louis ahead with a fifth-inning home run on a first-pitch curveball, and Nick Gonzalez tied the score with an RBI single in the eighth off JoJo Romero.\n\nSkenes (6-1) threw 91 pitches through eight innings, and Pirates manager Derek Shelton allowed him to remain on the mound for the ninth.\n\nRandy V\u00e1squez pitched six innings to earn his first victory since June 22 for San Diego, which has won three in a row.\n\nWashington, which had won five of six, is 0-4 against the Padres this season. The Nationals were shut out for the 11th time.\n\nNationals starter DJ Herz (1-4), recalled from Triple-A Rochester earlier in the day, breezed through three innings, then escaped a bases-loaded jam in the fourth. He retired the first two batters in the fifth before facing the top of the lineup for the third time.\n\nBaltimore, which slipped into a tie with Cleveland for the best record in the American League at 60-40, was slowed after losing second baseman Jorge Mateo and starting pitcher Albert Su\u00e1rez due to injuries in the third inning.\n\nMateo collided with shortstop Gunnar Henderson as they dove to catch a grounder off the bat of Jes\u00fas S\u00e1nchez behind the second base bag and left because of left elbow pain.\n\nSu\u00e1rez's outing ended when Miami's next hitter, Otto L\u00f3pez, hit a comebacker that deflected the pitcher's right foot and rolled near the Marlins' dugout on the third-base side for a single that loaded the bases.\n\nRAYS 4, BLUE JAYS 2\n\nTORONTO (AP) -- Brandon Lowe hit a two-run home run and Tampa Bay Rays won for the fourth time in five games by beating Toronto.\n\nArmstrong exited after striking out four in two scoreless innings. Left-hander Tyler Alexander (3-3) followed and struck out four over three shutout innings.\n\nMETS 3, YANKEES 2\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Jeff McNeil kept up his sudden power surge with a two-run homer that snapped a sixth-inning tie, and the New York Mets held off the New York Yankees in their Subway Series opener.\n\nJose Quintana (5-6) and five relievers combined on a five-hitter at Yankee Stadium as the Mets (52-48) matched their season high of four games over .500. They are 3-0 against their crosstown rivals, including a two-game sweep at Citi Field last month.\n\nWith closer Edwin D\u00edaz unavailable, Jake Diekman worked a hitless ninth for his fourth save. After walking Juan Soto with one out, the veteran lefty froze Aaron Judge with a 96 mph fastball on the inside corner for a called third strike, then retired rookie Ben Rice on a grounder to end it.\n\nThe Mets had walked Judge his first four times up, once intentionally, but the Yankees couldn't capitalize.\n\nRANGERS 3, WHITE SOX 2\n\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Texas right-hander Jon Gray allowed one run pitching into the eighth inning and retired the last 15 batters he faced as the Rangers beat the Chicago White Sox.\n\nAfter Andrew Vaughn's RBI single with two outs in the third inning, the White Sox didn't get another batter on base against Gray (5-4). The last was pinch-hitter Tommy Pham for the second out of the eighth, when shortstop Jonathan Ornelas made a backhanded stop and was falling away from first base when he made a incredible throw.\n\nGray struck out five and walked none while throwing 63 of his 80 pitches for strikes.\n\nThe White Sox (27-76) have lost nine games in a row and 15 of 18. They are only the 12th team in MLB history with 76 losses in their first 103 games, and the first since the 1979 Oakland Athletics.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

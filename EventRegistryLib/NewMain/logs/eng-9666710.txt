But they are expected to \"take reasonable action to prevent their employees from illness and death.\" Nor is there a specific threshold that defines \"extreme heat,\" although OSHA said it is working \"towards enacting a federal heat standard that encompasses indoor and outdoor workers.\"\n\nThe heat an employee's body experiences will depend on a lot of factors beyond the general temperature. \"For someone working outside without shade and working on cement - the heat index is going to be higher for them than (if the thermometer says) it's 85 degrees,\" said attorney Jason Krasno, a senior partner at Krasno, Krasno & Onwudinjo, who specializes in worker compensation cases.\n\nThe same goes if someone is working in high humidity or in rooms where air circulation is poor and there is no air conditioning.

Increase their time by no more than 20% a day until they are used to working in the heat.\"\n\nIn a worker's first few days, the agency notes, \"absolutely all symptoms should be taken seriously\" and workers should be allowed to stop working and get an evaluation to see if they've developed a heat-related illness.\n\n\"New employees whose bodies have not had time to adjust to working in the heat are most vulnerable -- nearly 3 out of 4 workers who die from heat-related causes die in their first week on the job,\" OSHA notes in its Extreme Heat Hazard Alert.\n\nEncourage employees to dress for the heat.

What your employer should be doing to protect you on high-heat days", "body": "Construction workers doing street repair in Texas during a heat wave last year.\n\nSummer is just starting in North America, and already an intense \"heat dome\" is forecast to affect more than half the US population this week.\n\nSome areas, including Montpelier, Vermont; Syracuse, New York; and Pittsburgh, haven't seen heat like this in about three decades.\n\nAlong with stifling days comes the risk of developing dangerous heat-related conditions, such as dehydration, heat stress, heat exhaustion, heat stroke and other hazards.\n\nWhile you can take as many measures as you like to stay cool at home, what about when you go to work? What responsibilities does your employer have to prevent you from suffering a heat-related illness? And what can you do if you think those aren't being met?\n\nUnder the federal law that created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, employers always have a duty to keep your workplace free of known hazards. \"This includes protecting workers from heat-related hazards,\" OSHA notes on its website.\n\nAnd it applies whether you work outdoors or indoors.\n\nWhile some states have specific laws governing occupational heat exposure, there is no heat-specific federal regulation mandating how employers must prevent heat illness in the workplace. But they are expected to \"take reasonable action to prevent their employees from illness and death.\" Nor is there a specific threshold that defines \"extreme heat,\" although OSHA said it is working \"towards enacting a federal heat standard that encompasses indoor and outdoor workers.\"\n\nThe heat an employee's body experiences will depend on a lot of factors beyond the general temperature. \"For someone working outside without shade and working on cement - the heat index is going to be higher for them than [if the thermometer says] it's 85 degrees,\" said attorney Jason Krasno, a senior partner at Krasno, Krasno & Onwudinjo, who specializes in worker compensation cases.\n\nThe same goes if someone is working in high humidity or in rooms where air circulation is poor and there is no air conditioning. Anyone required to wear a uniform that doesn't breathe may be at greater risk of overheating. And an employee's underlying chronic conditions such as asthma and heart disease may make them more vulnerable to heat risks.\n\nAt minimum, your employer should take basic preventative measures\n\nAll that said, both OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which research the prevention of work-related illnesses and injury, provide recommendations for employers to follow as they seek to keep workers safe on hot days.\n\nThey recommend companies:\n\nHave a heat illness prevention plan. It should outline procedures, supplies and equipment necessary to prevent workers from getting a heat-related illness, as well as an emergency action plan if a worker shows signs of distress.\n\nMake water easily accessible. \"Encourage workers to drink at least one cup every 20 minutes, even if they are not thirsty,\" according to OSHA recommendations.\n\nAllow regular rest breaks. These should be in the shade or a cool area.\n\nGive employees time to acclimate. OSHA recommends the so-called \"20% rule.\" \"On the first day, don't allow employees to work more than 20% of a shift at full intensity in the heat. Increase their time by no more than 20% a day until they are used to working in the heat.\"\n\nIn a worker's first few days, the agency notes, \"absolutely all symptoms should be taken seriously\" and workers should be allowed to stop working and get an evaluation to see if they've developed a heat-related illness.\n\n\"New employees whose bodies have not had time to adjust to working in the heat are most vulnerable -- nearly 3 out of 4 workers who die from heat-related causes die in their first week on the job,\" OSHA notes in its Extreme Heat Hazard Alert.\n\nEncourage employees to dress for the heat. That means wearing light-colored, loose fitting, breathable clothing.\n\nMonitor workers for signs and symptoms of heat illness. These include dizziness, fainting, nausea and muscle spasms. Also, do verbal checks frequently with workers who are wearing face coverings or wearing face equipment like a respirator. Managers should encourage employees to do the same for themselves and their coworkers. Should any signs appear, try to cool the worker down and \"when in doubt, call 911,\" OSHA recommends.\n\nChange work hours. Another OSHA-recommended accommodation employers may make when feasible is to alter employees' working hours so that they work primarily during the coolest parts of a day -- such as very early morning or after the sun goes down, said attorney Alka Ramchandani-Raj, who is co-chair of the occupational safety and health practice group at Littler, a law firm representing employers in employment law and labor practice issues.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nTo find out more about your particular employer's obligations and commitment to providing one, first check the company's safety handbook to see what recommendations they build into their policies and what the best way is to alert managers about potentially unsafe working conditions, Ramchandani-Raj noted.\n\nNext, check to see which rules and recommendations your employer should be following in the state where you work. While more than 20 states are subject to federal OSHA requirements, which establish the most basic obligations of most US employers, your particular state may have its own OSHA-like agency that establishes more stringent rules.\n\nIf you suspect your employer is not providing a healthy workplace, you can file a confidential complaint with OSHA either by calling 800-321-OSHA or filing online. \"You have the right to speak up about hazards without fear of retaliation,\" OSHA notes.\n\nThe agency also noted that it \"is planning enhanced enforcement actions, with a strategic focus on geographic locations and industries where high heat impacts vulnerable worker populations.\" Translation: More inspection activity and greater enforcement.\n\nAnd, it added, \"OSHA will also be providing outreach and compliance assistance to ensure employers, including those not covered by the OSH Act, and worker organizations have the tools to protect workers from hazardous heat.\"",

But they are expected to \"take reasonable action to prevent their employees from illness and death.\" Nor is there a specific threshold that defines \"extreme heat,\" although OSHA said it is working \"towards enacting a federal heat standard that encompasses indoor and outdoor workers.\"\n\nThe heat an employee's body experiences will depend on a lot of factors beyond the general temperature. \"For someone working outside without shade and working on cement - the heat index is going to be higher for them than (if the thermometer says) it's 85 degrees,\" said attorney Jason Krasno, a senior partner at Krasno, Krasno & Onwudinjo, who specializes in worker compensation cases.\n\nThe same goes if someone is working in high humidity or in rooms where air circulation is poor and there is no air conditioning. Anyone required to wear a uniform that doesn't breathe may be at greater risk of overheating. And an employee's underlying chronic conditions such as asthma and heart disease may make them more vulnerable to heat risks.\n\nBasic preventative measures\n\nAll that said, both OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which research the prevention of work-related illnesses and injury, provide recommendations for employers to follow as they seek to keep workers safe on hot days.\n\nThey recommend companies:\n\nHave a heat illness prevention plan. It should outline procedures, supplies and equipment necessary to prevent workers from getting a heat-related illness, as well as an emergency action plan if a worker shows signs of distress.\n\nWeather Scorching temperatures, humidity making life miserable for millions from Midwest to Maine MICHAEL CASEY Associated Press\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMake water easily accessible. \"Encourage workers to drink at least one cup every 20 minutes, even if they are not thirsty,\" according to OSHA recommendations.\n\nAllow regular rest breaks. These should be in the shade or a cool area.\n\nGive employees time to acclimate. OSHA recommends the so-called \"20% rule.\" \"On the first day, don't allow employees to work more than 20% of a shift at full intensity in the heat. Increase their time by no more than 20% a day until they are used to working in the heat.\"\n\nIn a worker's first few days, the agency notes, \"absolutely all symptoms should be taken seriously\" and workers should be allowed to stop working and get an evaluation to see if they've developed a heat-related illness.\n\n\"New employees whose bodies have not had time to adjust to working in the heat are most vulnerable -- nearly 3 out of 4 workers who die from heat-related causes die in their first week on the job,\" OSHA notes in its Extreme Heat Hazard Alert.\n\nEncourage employees to dress for the heat. That means wearing light-colored, loose fitting, breathable clothing.\n\nMonitor workers for signs and symptoms of heat illness. These include dizziness, fainting, nausea and muscle spasms. Also, do verbal checks frequently with workers who are wearing face coverings or wearing face equipment like a respirator. Managers should encourage employees to do the same for themselves and their coworkers. Should any signs appear, try to cool the worker down and \"when in doubt, call 911,\" OSHA recommends.\n\nChange work hours. Another OSHA-recommended accommodation employers may make when feasible is to alter employees' working hours so that they work primarily during the coolest parts of a day -- such as very early morning or after the sun goes down, said attorney Alka Ramchandani-Raj, who is co-chair of the occupational safety and health practice group at Littler, a law firm representing employers in employment law and labor practice issues.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nTo find out more about your particular employer's obligations and commitment to providing a healthy workplace, first check the company's safety handbook to see what recommendations they build into their policies and what the best way is to alert managers about potentially unsafe working conditions, Ramchandani-Raj noted.\n\nNext, check to see which rules and recommendations your employer should be following in the state where you work. While more than 20 states are subject to federal OSHA requirements, which establish the most basic obligations of most US employers, your particular state may have its own OSHA-like agency that establishes more stringent rules.\n\nIf you suspect your employer is not providing a healthy workplace, you can file a confidential complaint with OSHA either by calling 800-321-OSHA or filing online. \"You have the right to speak up about hazards without fear of retaliation,\" OSHA notes.\n\nThe agency also noted that it \"is planning enhanced enforcement actions, with a strategic focus on geographic locations and industries where high heat impacts vulnerable worker populations.\" Translation: More inspection activity and greater enforcement.\n\nAnd, it added, \"OSHA will also be providing outreach and compliance assistance to ensure employers, including those not covered by the OSH Act, and worker organizations have the tools to protect workers from hazardous heat.\"\n\nWorkplace fatalities on the rise: These are the top 10 most dangerous jobs in America Workplace fatalities on the rise: These are the top 10 most dangerous jobs in America On-the-job deaths

Another OSHA-recommended accommodation employers may make when feasible is to alter employees' working hours so that they work primarily during the coolest parts of a day -- such as very early morning or after the sun goes down, said attorney Alka Ramchandani-Raj, who is co-chair of the occupational safety and health practice group at Littler, a law firm representing employers in employment law and labor practice issues.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nTo find out more about your particular employer's obligations and commitment to providing a healthy workplace, first check the company's safety handbook to see what recommendations they build into their policies and what the best way is to alert managers about potentially unsafe working conditions, Ramchandani-Raj noted.\n\nNext, check to see which rules and recommendations your employer should be following in the state where you work. While more than 20 states are subject to federal OSHA requirements, which establish the most basic obligations of most US employers, your particular state may have its own OSHA-like agency that establishes more stringent rules.\n\nIf you suspect your employer is not providing a healthy workplace, you can file a confidential complaint with OSHA either by calling 800-321-OSHA or filing online. \"You have the right to speak up about hazards without fear of retaliation,\" OSHA notes.\n\nThe agency also noted that it \"is planning enhanced enforcement actions, with a strategic focus on geographic locations and industries where high heat impacts vulnerable worker populations.\" Translation: More inspection activity and greater enforcement.\n\nAnd, it added, \"OSHA will also be providing outreach and compliance assistance to ensure employers, including those not covered by the OSH Act, and worker organizations have the tools to protect workers from hazardous heat.\"\n\nWorkplace fatalities on the rise: These are the top 10 most dangerous jobs in America Workplace fatalities on the rise: These are the top 10 most dangerous jobs in America On-the-job deaths

But they are expected to \"take reasonable action to prevent their employees from illness and death.\" Nor is there a specific threshold that defines \"extreme heat,\" although OSHA said it is working \"towards enacting a federal heat standard that encompasses indoor and outdoor workers.\"\n\nThe heat an employee's body experiences will depend on a lot of factors beyond the general temperature. \"For someone working outside without shade and working on cement - the heat index is going to be higher for them than (if the thermometer says) it's 85 degrees,\" said attorney Jason Krasno, a senior partner at Krasno, Krasno & Onwudinjo, who specializes in worker compensation cases.\n\nThe same goes if someone is working in high humidity or in rooms where air circulation is poor and there is no air conditioning. Anyone required to wear a uniform that doesn't breathe may be at greater risk of overheating. And an employee's underlying chronic conditions such as asthma and heart disease may make them more vulnerable to heat risks.\n\nBasic preventative measures\n\nAll that said, both OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which research the prevention of work-related illnesses and injury, provide recommendations for employers to follow as they seek to keep workers safe on hot days.\n\nThey recommend companies:\n\nHave a heat illness prevention plan. It should outline procedures, supplies and equipment necessary to prevent workers from getting a heat-related illness, as well as an emergency action plan if a worker shows signs of distress.\n\nWeather\n\nScorching temperatures, humidity making life miserable for millions from Midwest to Maine\n\nMICHAEL CASEY Associated Press\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMake water easily accessible. \"Encourage workers to drink at least one cup every 20 minutes, even if they are not thirsty,\" according to OSHA recommendations.\n\nAllow regular rest breaks. These should be in the shade or a cool area.\n\nGive employees time to acclimate. OSHA recommends the so-called \"20% rule.\" \"On the first day, don't allow employees to work more than 20% of a shift at full intensity in the heat. Increase their time by no more than 20% a day until they are used to working in the heat.\"\n\nIn a worker's first few days, the agency notes, \"absolutely all symptoms should be taken seriously\" and workers should be allowed to stop working and get an evaluation to see if they've developed a heat-related illness.\n\n\"New employees whose bodies have not had time to adjust to working in the heat are most vulnerable -- nearly 3 out of 4 workers who die from heat-related causes die in their first week on the job,\" OSHA notes in its Extreme Heat Hazard Alert.\n\nEncourage employees to dress for the heat. That means wearing light-colored, loose fitting, breathable clothing.\n\nMonitor workers for signs and symptoms of heat illness. These include dizziness, fainting, nausea and muscle spasms. Also, do verbal checks frequently with workers who are wearing face coverings or wearing face equipment like a respirator. Managers should encourage employees to do the same for themselves and their coworkers. Should any signs appear, try to cool the worker down and \"when in doubt, call 911,\" OSHA recommends.\n\nChange work hours. Another OSHA-recommended accommodation employers may make when feasible is to alter employees' working hours so that they work primarily during the coolest parts of a day -- such as very early morning or after the sun goes down, said attorney Alka Ramchandani-Raj, who is co-chair of the occupational safety and health practice group at Littler, a law firm representing employers in employment law and labor practice issues.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nTo find out more about your particular employer's obligations and commitment to providing a healthy workplace, first check the company's safety handbook to see what recommendations they build into their policies and what the best way is to alert managers about potentially unsafe working conditions, Ramchandani-Raj noted.\n\nNext, check to see which rules and recommendations your employer should be following in the state where you work.

But they are expected to \"take reasonable action to prevent their employees from illness and death.\" Nor is there a specific threshold that defines \"extreme heat,\" although OSHA said it is working \"towards enacting a federal heat standard that encompasses indoor and outdoor workers.\"\n\nThe heat an employee's body experiences will depend on a lot of factors beyond the general temperature. \"For someone working outside without shade and working on cement - the heat index is going to be higher for them than (if the thermometer says) it's 85 degrees,\" said attorney Jason Krasno, a senior partner at Krasno, Krasno & Onwudinjo, who specializes in worker compensation cases.\n\nThe same goes if someone is working in high humidity or in rooms where air circulation is poor and there is no air conditioning. Anyone required to wear a uniform that doesn't breathe may be at greater risk of overheating. And an employee's underlying chronic conditions such as asthma and heart disease may make them more vulnerable to heat risks.\n\nBasic preventative measures\n\nAll that said, both OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which research the prevention of work-related illnesses and injury, provide recommendations for employers to follow as they seek to keep workers safe on hot days.\n\nThey recommend companies:\n\nHave a heat illness prevention plan. It should outline procedures, supplies and equipment necessary to prevent workers from getting a heat-related illness, as well as an emergency action plan if a worker shows signs of distress.\n\nWeather Scorching temperatures, humidity making life miserable for millions from Midwest to Maine MICHAEL CASEY Associated Press\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMake water easily accessible. \"Encourage workers to drink at least one cup every 20 minutes, even if they are not thirsty,\" according to OSHA recommendations.\n\nAllow regular rest breaks. These should be in the shade or a cool area.\n\nGive employees time to acclimate. OSHA recommends the so-called \"20% rule.\" \"On the first day, don't allow employees to work more than 20% of a shift at full intensity in the heat. Increase their time by no more than 20% a day until they are used to working in the heat.\"\n\nIn a worker's first few days, the agency notes, \"absolutely all symptoms should be taken seriously\" and workers should be allowed to stop working and get an evaluation to see if they've developed a heat-related illness.\n\n\"New employees whose bodies have not had time to adjust to working in the heat are most vulnerable -- nearly 3 out of 4 workers who die from heat-related causes die in their first week on the job,\" OSHA notes in its Extreme Heat Hazard Alert.\n\nEncourage employees to dress for the heat. That means wearing light-colored, loose fitting, breathable clothing.\n\nMonitor workers for signs and symptoms of heat illness. These include dizziness, fainting, nausea and muscle spasms. Also, do verbal checks frequently with workers who are wearing face coverings or wearing face equipment like a respirator. Managers should encourage employees to do the same for themselves and their coworkers. Should any signs appear, try to cool the worker down and \"when in doubt, call 911,\" OSHA recommends.\n\nChange work hours. Another OSHA-recommended accommodation employers may make when feasible is to alter employees' working hours so that they work primarily during the coolest parts of a day -- such as very early morning or after the sun goes down, said attorney Alka Ramchandani-Raj, who is co-chair of the occupational safety and health practice group at Littler, a law firm representing employers in employment law and labor practice issues.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nTo find out more about your particular employer's obligations and commitment to providing a healthy workplace, first check the company's safety handbook to see what recommendations they build into their policies and what the best way is to alert managers about potentially unsafe working conditions, Ramchandani-Raj noted.\n\nNext, check to see which rules and recommendations your employer should be following in the state where you work. While more than 20 states are subject to federal OSHA requirements, which establish the most basic obligations of most US employers, your particular state may have its own OSHA-like agency that establishes more stringent rules.\n\nIf you suspect your employer is not providing a healthy workplace, you can file a confidential complaint with OSHA either by calling 800-321-OSHA or filing online. \"You have the right to speak up about hazards without fear of retaliation,\" OSHA notes.\n\nThe agency also noted that it \"is planning enhanced enforcement actions, with a strategic focus on geographic locations and industries where high heat impacts vulnerable worker populations.\" Translation: More inspection activity and greater enforcement.\n\nAnd, it added, \"OSHA will also be providing outreach and compliance assistance to ensure employers, including those not covered by the OSH Act, and worker organizations have the tools to protect workers from hazardous heat.\"\n\nWorkplace fatalities on the rise: These are the top 10 most dangerous jobs in America Workplace fatalities on the rise: These are the top 10 most dangerous jobs in America On-the-job deaths

State: Murder defendant fought Bloomington man over a gun before fatal shooting Linda Sue Zook Aaron Rossi accused of defrauding state of Illinois during COVID-19 pandemic\n\nUnder the federal law that created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, employers always have a duty to keep your workplace free of known hazards. \"This includes protecting workers from heat-related hazards,\" OSHA notes on its website.\n\nAnd it applies whether you work outdoors or indoors.\n\nWhile some states have specific laws governing occupational heat exposure, there is no heat-specific federal regulation mandating how employers must prevent heat illness in the workplace. But they are expected to \"take reasonable action to prevent their employees from illness and death.\" Nor is there a specific threshold that defines \"extreme heat,\" although OSHA said it is working \"towards enacting a federal heat standard that encompasses indoor and outdoor workers.\"\n\nThe heat an employee's body experiences will depend on a lot of factors beyond the general temperature. \"For someone working outside without shade and working on cement - the heat index is going to be higher for them than (if the thermometer says) it's 85 degrees,\" said attorney Jason Krasno, a senior partner at Krasno, Krasno & Onwudinjo, who specializes in worker compensation cases.\n\nThe same goes if someone is working in high humidity or in rooms where air circulation is poor and there is no air conditioning. Anyone required to wear a uniform that doesn't breathe may be at greater risk of overheating. And an employee's underlying chronic conditions such as asthma and heart disease may make them more vulnerable to heat risks.\n\nBasic preventative measures\n\nAll that said, both OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which research the prevention of work-related illnesses and injury, provide recommendations for employers to follow as they seek to keep workers safe on hot days.\n\nThey recommend companies:\n\nHave a heat illness prevention plan. It should outline procedures, supplies and equipment necessary to prevent workers from getting a heat-related illness, as well as an emergency action plan if a worker shows signs of distress.\n\nWeather Scorching temperatures, humidity making life miserable for millions from Midwest to Maine MICHAEL CASEY Associated Press\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMake water easily accessible. \"Encourage workers to drink at least one cup every 20 minutes, even if they are not thirsty,\" according to OSHA recommendations.\n\nAllow regular rest breaks. These should be in the shade or a cool area.\n\nGive employees time to acclimate. OSHA recommends the so-called \"20% rule.\" \"On the first day, don't allow employees to work more than 20% of a shift at full intensity in the heat. Increase their time by no more than 20% a day until they are used to working in the heat.\"\n\nIn a worker's first few days, the agency notes, \"absolutely all symptoms should be taken seriously\" and workers should be allowed to stop working and get an evaluation to see if they've developed a heat-related illness.\n\n\"New employees whose bodies have not had time to adjust to working in the heat are most vulnerable -- nearly 3 out of 4 workers who die from heat-related causes die in their first week on the job,\" OSHA notes in its Extreme Heat Hazard Alert.\n\nEncourage employees to dress for the heat. That means wearing light-colored, loose fitting, breathable clothing.\n\nMonitor workers for signs and symptoms of heat illness. These include dizziness, fainting, nausea and muscle spasms. Also, do verbal checks frequently with workers who are wearing face coverings or wearing face equipment like a respirator. Managers should encourage employees to do the same for themselves and their coworkers. Should any signs appear, try to cool the worker down and \"when in doubt, call 911,\" OSHA recommends.\n\nChange work hours. Another OSHA-recommended accommodation employers may make when feasible is to alter employees' working hours so that they work primarily during the coolest parts of a day -- such as very early morning or after the sun goes down, said attorney Alka Ramchandani-Raj, who is co-chair of the occupational safety and health practice group at Littler, a law firm representing employers in employment law and labor practice issues.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nTo find out more about your particular employer's obligations and commitment to providing a healthy workplace, first check the company's safety handbook to see what recommendations they build into their policies and what the best way is to alert managers about potentially unsafe working conditions, Ramchandani-Raj noted.\n\nNext, check to see which rules and recommendations your employer should be following in the state where you work. While more than 20 states are subject to federal OSHA requirements, which establish the most basic obligations of most US employers, your particular state may have its own OSHA-like agency that establishes more stringent rules.\n\nIf you suspect your employer is not providing a healthy workplace, you can file a confidential complaint with OSHA either by calling 800-321-OSHA or filing online. \"You have the right to speak up about hazards without fear of retaliation,\" OSHA notes.\n\nThe agency also noted that it \"is planning enhanced enforcement actions, with a strategic focus on geographic locations and industries where high heat impacts vulnerable worker populations.\" Translation: More inspection activity and greater enforcement.\n\nAnd, it added, \"OSHA will also be providing outreach and compliance assistance to ensure employers, including those not covered by the OSH Act, and worker organizations have the tools to protect workers from hazardous heat.\"\n\nWorkplace fatalities on the rise: These are the top 10 most dangerous jobs in America Workplace fatalities on the rise: These are the top 10 most dangerous jobs in America On-the-job deaths

Another OSHA-recommended accommodation employers may make when feasible is to alter employees' working hours so that they work primarily during the coolest parts of a day -- such as very early morning or after the sun goes down, said attorney Alka Ramchandani-Raj, who is co-chair of the occupational safety and health practice group at Littler, a law firm representing employers in employment law and labor practice issues.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nTo find out more about your particular employer's obligations and commitment to providing a healthy workplace, first check the company's safety handbook to see what recommendations they build into their policies and what the best way is to alert managers about potentially unsafe working conditions, Ramchandani-Raj noted.\n\nNext, check to see which rules and recommendations your employer should be following in the state where you work. While more than 20 states are subject to federal OSHA requirements, which establish the most basic obligations of most US employers, your particular state may have its own OSHA-like agency that establishes more stringent rules.\n\nIf you suspect your employer is not providing a healthy workplace, you can file a confidential complaint with OSHA either by calling 800-321-OSHA or filing online. \"You have the right to speak up about hazards without fear of retaliation,\" OSHA notes.\n\nThe agency also noted that it \"is planning enhanced enforcement actions, with a strategic focus on geographic locations and industries where high heat impacts vulnerable worker populations.\" Translation: More inspection activity and greater enforcement.\n\nAnd, it added, \"OSHA will also be providing outreach and compliance assistance to ensure employers, including those not covered by the OSH Act, and worker organizations have the tools to protect workers from hazardous heat.\"\n\nWorkplace fatalities on the rise: These are the top 10 most dangerous jobs in America Workplace fatalities on the rise: These are the top 10 most dangerous jobs in America On-the-job deaths

But they are expected to \"take reasonable action to prevent their employees from illness and death.\" Nor is there a specific threshold that defines \"extreme heat,\" although OSHA said it is working \"towards enacting a federal heat standard that encompasses indoor and outdoor workers.\"\n\nThe heat an employee's body experiences will depend on a lot of factors beyond the general temperature. \"For someone working outside without shade and working on cement - the heat index is going to be higher for them than (if the thermometer says) it's 85 degrees,\" said attorney Jason Krasno, a senior partner at Krasno, Krasno & Onwudinjo, who specializes in worker compensation cases.\n\nThe same goes if someone is working in high humidity or in rooms where air circulation is poor and there is no air conditioning. Anyone required to wear a uniform that doesn't breathe may be at greater risk of overheating. And an employee's underlying chronic conditions such as asthma and heart disease may make them more vulnerable to heat risks.\n\nBasic preventative measures\n\nAll that said, both OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which research the prevention of work-related illnesses and injury, provide recommendations for employers to follow as they seek to keep workers safe on hot days.\n\nThey recommend companies:\n\nHave a heat illness prevention plan. It should outline procedures, supplies and equipment necessary to prevent workers from getting a heat-related illness, as well as an emergency action plan if a worker shows signs of distress.\n\nMake water easily accessible. \"Encourage workers to drink at least one cup every 20 minutes, even if they are not thirsty,\" according to OSHA recommendations.\n\nAllow regular rest breaks. These should be in the shade or a cool area.\n\nGive employees time to acclimate. OSHA recommends the so-called \"20% rule.\" \"On the first day, don't allow employees to work more than 20% of a shift at full intensity in the heat. Increase their time by no more than 20% a day until they are used to working in the heat.\"\n\nIn a worker's first few days, the agency notes, \"absolutely all symptoms should be taken seriously\" and workers should be allowed to stop working and get an evaluation to see if they've developed a heat-related illness.\n\n\"New employees whose bodies have not had time to adjust to working in the heat are most vulnerable -- nearly 3 out of 4 workers who die from heat-related causes die in their first week on the job,\" OSHA notes in its Extreme Heat Hazard Alert.\n\nEncourage employees to dress for the heat. That means wearing light-colored, loose fitting, breathable clothing.\n\nMonitor workers for signs and symptoms of heat illness. These include dizziness, fainting, nausea and muscle spasms. Also, do verbal checks frequently with workers who are wearing face coverings or wearing face equipment like a respirator. Managers should encourage employees to do the same for themselves and their coworkers. Should any signs appear, try to cool the worker down and \"when in doubt, call 911,\" OSHA recommends.\n\nChange work hours. Another OSHA-recommended accommodation employers may make when feasible is to alter employees' working hours so that they work primarily during the coolest parts of a day -- such as very early morning or after the sun goes down, said attorney Alka Ramchandani-Raj, who is co-chair of the occupational safety and health practice group at Littler, a law firm representing employers in employment law and labor practice issues.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nTo find out more about your particular employer's obligations and commitment to providing a healthy workplace, first check the company's safety handbook to see what recommendations they build into their policies and what the best way is to alert managers about potentially unsafe working conditions, Ramchandani-Raj noted.\n\nNext, check to see which rules and recommendations your employer should be following in the state where you work.

It should outline procedures, supplies and equipment necessary to prevent workers from getting a heat-related illness, as well as an emergency action plan if a worker shows signs of distress.\n\nWeather Scorching temperatures, humidity making life miserable for millions from Midwest to Maine MICHAEL CASEY Associated Press\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMake water easily accessible. \"Encourage workers to drink at least one cup every 20 minutes, even if they are not thirsty,\" according to OSHA recommendations.\n\nAllow regular rest breaks. These should be in the shade or a cool area.\n\nGive employees time to acclimate. OSHA recommends the so-called \"20% rule.\" \"On the first day, don't allow employees to work more than 20% of a shift at full intensity in the heat. Increase their time by no more than 20% a day until they are used to working in the heat.\"\n\nIn a worker's first few days, the agency notes, \"absolutely all symptoms should be taken seriously\" and workers should be allowed to stop working and get an evaluation to see if they've developed a heat-related illness.\n\n\"New employees whose bodies have not had time to adjust to working in the heat are most vulnerable -- nearly 3 out of 4 workers who die from heat-related causes die in their first week on the job,\" OSHA notes in its Extreme Heat Hazard Alert.\n\nEncourage employees to dress for the heat. That means wearing light-colored, loose fitting, breathable clothing.\n\nMonitor workers for signs and symptoms of heat illness. These include dizziness, fainting, nausea and muscle spasms. Also, do verbal checks frequently with workers who are wearing face coverings or wearing face equipment like a respirator. Managers should encourage employees to do the same for themselves and their coworkers. Should any signs appear, try to cool the worker down and \"when in doubt, call 911,\" OSHA recommends.\n\nChange work hours. Another OSHA-recommended accommodation employers may make when feasible is to alter employees' working hours so that they work primarily during the coolest parts of a day -- such as very early morning or after the sun goes down, said attorney Alka Ramchandani-Raj, who is co-chair of the occupational safety and health practice group at Littler, a law firm representing employers in employment law and labor practice issues.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nTo find out more about your particular employer's obligations and commitment to providing a healthy workplace, first check the company's safety handbook to see what recommendations they build into their policies and what the best way is to alert managers about potentially unsafe working conditions, Ramchandani-Raj noted.\n\nNext, check to see which rules and recommendations your employer should be following in the state where you work. While more than 20 states are subject to federal OSHA requirements, which establish the most basic obligations of most US employers, your particular state may have its own OSHA-like agency that establishes more stringent rules.\n\nIf you suspect your employer is not providing a healthy workplace, you can file a confidential complaint with OSHA either by calling 800-321-OSHA or filing online. \"You have the right to speak up about hazards without fear of retaliation,\" OSHA notes.\n\nThe agency also noted that it \"is planning enhanced enforcement actions, with a strategic focus on geographic locations and industries where high heat impacts vulnerable worker populations.\" Translation: More inspection activity and greater enforcement.\n\nAnd, it added, \"OSHA will also be providing outreach and compliance assistance to ensure employers, including those not covered by the OSH Act, and worker organizations have the tools to protect workers from hazardous heat.\"\n\nWorkplace fatalities on the rise: These are the top 10 most dangerous jobs in America Workplace fatalities on the rise: These are the top 10 most dangerous jobs in America On-the-job deaths

But they are expected to \"take reasonable action to prevent their employees from illness and death.\" Nor is there a specific threshold that defines \"extreme heat,\" although OSHA said it is working \"towards enacting a federal heat standard that encompasses indoor and outdoor workers.\"\n\nThe heat an employee's body experiences will depend on a lot of factors beyond the general temperature. \"For someone working outside without shade and working on cement - the heat index is going to be higher for them than (if the thermometer says) it's 85 degrees,\" said attorney Jason Krasno, a senior partner at Krasno, Krasno & Onwudinjo, who specializes in worker compensation cases.\n\nThe same goes if someone is working in high humidity or in rooms where air circulation is poor and there is no air conditioning. Anyone required to wear a uniform that doesn't breathe may be at greater risk of overheating. And an employee's underlying chronic conditions such as asthma and heart disease may make them more vulnerable to heat risks.\n\nBasic preventative measures\n\nAll that said, both OSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which research the prevention of work-related illnesses and injury, provide recommendations for employers to follow as they seek to keep workers safe on hot days.\n\nThey recommend companies:\n\nHave a heat illness prevention plan.

(FOX5) - Thursday is the first official day of summer and as the hottest temperatures of the year are ahead in the next few months, OSHA is calling for action.\n\nThey want to make sure Nevada employers are protecting workers from the dangers of extreme heat.\n\n\"About 125-130 is the hottest we have seen on our job sites. Working in the Vegas heat, it is tough. A lot of people don't realize if your ambient temperatures are at 100, 110 degrees and you are out here working on black rebar, working around structural steel it is 10-15 degrees hotter,\" Colton Morano Safety Director at Sletten Construction shared. Morano says the heat dictates workflow during the summer.\n\n\"Anywhere in the desert ecosystem, you want to make sure that your guys are hydrated and taking breaks,\" Morano contended.\n\nA few months ago, they learned of the OSHA Heat Safety Tool, a free downloadable app, and now everyone on their team is using it.\n\n\"The guys don't have to have an extra book or paperwork on them, they can pull out their phones, look at the app and it tells you the temperature, the relative humidity, and your risk factor of that area,\" Morano reported.\n\n\"The app ranges from caution to warning to danger,\" explained Zachary Barnett, Las Vegas Area Director of OSHA. OSHA is issuing a heat safety alert because the beginning of the hottest months of the year is the most dangerous time for workers. Nearly three out of four heat illness fatalities happen during the first week of work in extreme heat.\n\n\"When workers aren't properly acclimated to the environment, that is when they really have the highest levels of heat-related illness, and that is what we are trying to prevent,\" Barnett revealed.\n\nBarnett says federal law entitles you to safety in your workplace, and both employers and employees need to take precautions in extreme heat.\n\n\"If there is one message OSHA can get across for workers out there, it is water, rest, and shade,\" Barnett stated.\n\nThe free OSHA Heat Safety Tool also details signs of heat-related illness and has first aid instructions. It is available in English and Spanish.

(WPRI) -- Those who regularly work outdoors often have no choice but to grin and bear the heat during the dog days of summer.\n\nThe U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) states that Americans who work in agriculture, construction, landscaping and delivery are much more susceptible to heat-related illnesses.\n\nIn fact, OSHA estimates that the vast majority of worker deaths happen within the first few days of hazardous heat exposure.\n\nMaggie Morrissey-Basler, an assistant professor at Providence College, said dangerously hot workdays put millions of Americans in extremely vulnerable situations each year.\n\n\"Workers are particularly vulnerable because, not only are they exposed to environmental heat, they're also performing physically-exerting work and are often wearing clothing that insulates their body, which increases their risk of having a heat-related injury or illness,\" she explained.\n\nMorrissey-Basler said workers should prioritize dressing appropriately, staying hydrated, taking frequent breaks and staying out of the sun when possible. She also encouraged workers to avoid overexerting themselves by lightening their workloads.\n\nWorkers should also keep in mind personal risk factors that may make them more susceptible to heat-related illness, which include medical conditions, lack of physical fitness, alcohol consumption and use of certain medications, according to OSHA.\n\nNew workers are especially at risk for heat-related illness, according to Morrissey-Basler. That's because their bodies aren't acclimated to their working environment yet.\n\n\"For new workers, they should be slowly and progressively exposing themselves to heat so that they don't overexert themselves,\" Morrissey-Basler said, noting that having a low heat tolerance can have \"dire consequences.\"\n\nMorrissey-Basler suggested employers consistently monitor new workers and schedule them for shorter shifts so their body can adapt. In addition, OSHA urged employers to keep an eye on workers returning from extended absences, since most of them will have lost their heat tolerance.", "source": {"uri": "wpri.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WPRI.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_doiron@wpri.com", "name": "Sarah Doiron", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Occupational Safety and Health Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Providence College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscaping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landscaping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence,_Rhode_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Providence, Rhode Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Providence, Rhode Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholic drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Government_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Government Agencies", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy_and_Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy and Environment", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.wpri.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/06/Construction-worker.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666710", "eventUri": "eng-9666710", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Providence, Rhode Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

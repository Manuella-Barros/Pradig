Their method? Driving a 911 GT3 and a 911 GT3 RS through the glass windows of the Fremont Porsche showroom after midnight. Not exactly the epitome of a smooth getaway.\n\nThankfully, the real world has a pesky detail these thieves may have overlooked: police. Both stolen vehicles were recovered within days, and one suspect is currently behind bars. As for the other one, well, let's just say their high score remains elusive.\n\nMore: Thieves In Dodge Challenger Smash Dealership With Equinox To Steal New Corvette, Camaro\n\nThe Hollywood-style burglary took place on Thursday, April 4, at around 12.45 a.m on the Cushing Parkway of Fremont, California. Authorities responded to reports about two suspects stealing a red 911 GT3 RS (991) and a white 911 GT3 (likely a 991.2) from the showroom floor of Porsche Fremont.\n\nWhen the officers arrived at the scene, the suspects were already gone, leaving broken glass behind them. However, detectives determined the vehicle's direction of travel, and followed their traces. Several hours later, the Special Operations Division of the Fremont Police Department located the 991 GT3 RS in Milpitas, California, and returned it to the dealership.\n\nThe white GT3 was located a day later on April 5, thanks to the use of high-end camera technology. Following \"several hours of surveillance,\" officers identified the suspect behind the wheel of the stolen Porsche and located his residence. The 22-year-old was arrested, and the second Porsche was returned to the dealer, putting an end to its adventure.\n\nDuring a search of the suspect's residence, officers uncovered \"several high-capacity rifles, stolen property, money, and a police radio scanner,\" which further compounded his legal troubles. Now, the convicted felon faces charges including vehicle burglary, driving or taking a vehicle without the owner's consent, conspiracy, possession of a firearm and ammunition, as well as willfully resisting or delaying a peace officer.\n\nWhile there is no information available about the other suspect, it's likely that their freedom will be short-lived.\n\nThe dealer estimated that the combined value of the vehicles was in excess of $500,000. It is unclear if the two Porsches were damaged during the burglary and how expensive it will be to restore them to their previous state. Fortunately, the car thieves didn't crash the exotics during their joyride, and no one ended up being injured.", "source": {"uri": "carscoops.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Carscoops"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thanos_pappas@carscoops.com", "name": "Thanos Pappas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_GT3", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Group GT3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Porsche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fremont,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fremont, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fremont, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_911_GT3", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Porsche 911 GT3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motor vehicle theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Challenger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dodge Challenger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Camaro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Camaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Corvette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burglary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burglary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drug Enforcement Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Equinox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet Equinox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milpitas,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milpitas, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milpitas, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Driving and Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Car_Rentals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Car Rentals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/porsche-911-gt3-rs-and-gt3-1-copy.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554151", "eventUri": "eng-9554151", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-04", "textStart": 845, "textEnd": 852}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-05", "textStart": 1497, "textEnd": 1504}], "sentiment": -0.3411764705882353, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Each generation somehow finds a way to go faster around a race track. Aero, power, tires, suspension, and tech adjustments keep bringing the most hardcore version of the 911 closer to track superiority. Every new version finds serious track-proven lap time improvements, but is it always a better car?\n\nYouTube's Vin Anatra recently took a trip to the Porsche Experience Center smack in the middle of Los Angeles to test the theory. He brought his lightly modified 997-generation GT3 RS, the car he calls his favorite of all time, to compare it to the newest and wildest car in the Porsche stable, the 992-generation GT3 RS. These are wildly different cars that approach speed in very different ways. Before you watch the video, think about which one you'd rather have.\n\nOkay, now that you've seen it, did your opinion change? I know mine didn't. I've spent a lot of time in a lot of 911s, and the 997 remains my personal sweet spot. The later 991 and 992 feel significantly bigger and more video-gamey. Vin even comments while on track that the 992 -- with its PDK gearbox, launch control, track modes, downforce-inducing control arms and electronically-controlled everything -- \"feels like it just does everything for you, not for you, but it's so assertive.\"\n\nPorsche definitely knows what it's doing in building these cars, as they seem to get more popular and more expensive every year. That said, I will always gravitate toward a car that requires more from the driver. I want the three-pedal, sawing-at-the-wheel, get-all-your-braking-done-in-a-straight-line driving experience that 911s have always been known for. I want something that puts the sport in sports car. I don't particularly care about lap times, I just want to listen to that clutch chatter.", "source": {"uri": "jalopnik.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jalopnik"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Porsche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_suspension", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Car suspension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street-legal_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Street-legal vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_GT3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Group GT3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_911_GT3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porsche 911 GT3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auto racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_track", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race track"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_control_(automotive)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Launch control (automotive)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clutch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-clutch_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dual-clutch transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manual transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports car"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Car_Rentals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Car Rentals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit_Cars_and_Replicas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit Cars and Replicas", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Retail", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/d0827e7c3f2d8f62f161237c572f4371.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554151", "eventUri": "eng-9554151", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

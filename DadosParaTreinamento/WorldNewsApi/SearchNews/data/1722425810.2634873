After Aaron Boone gave him two days off because he felt the second baseman\u2019s rough start to the season was weighing on him, Torres was back in the lineup to face Blue Jays left-hander Yusei Kikuchi in the second game of a four-game set at Rogers Centre. \u201cWe all know what he\u2019s capable of, he knows what he\u2019s capable of,\u201d Boone said before the game. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you go out and get a result right away. It\u2019s too fickle of a game in that way. Hopefully just in a good place physically and mentally to go out there and contribute to winning baseball. \u201cHopefully this is something that serves him well, serves us well having a couple days to reset. But there\u2019s never any guarantees, either.\u201d Torres said Thursday night he used the two days to work in the batting cage, trying to fix his swing that he felt had gotten out of whack. The 27-year-old, who is a pending free agent, entered Friday batting .215 with a .628 OPS on the season. Clarke Schmidt\u2019s shutdown is finished. Nearly four weeks since he last pitched in a game and was diagnosed with a lat strain a few days later, Schmidt began playing catch on Monday and was expected to throw again on Friday. The right-hander likely will need at least four weeks to build back up, giving him a chance to return at some point in August if all goes well. Giancarlo Stanton (hamstring) also has started to do some physical activity, including getting on the treadmill on Thursday. \u201cNot a lot, but moving now,\u201d Boone said. In what has been a brutal stretch for the Yankees, Phil Bickford unintentionally provided some levity on Thursday night. In the fifth inning of the Yankees\u2019 9-2 loss, Boone had walked out to the mound, where Carlos Rodon eventually talked his way into staying in the game to finish out the frame. But Bickford thought he was coming in, so he began to run in from the bullpen, only to make it about halfway through right field before turning and running back to the bullpen. Boone did not see it until after the game, but was able to get a chuckle out of it. \u201cObviously [Thursday] night wasn\u2019t a great night for us, but I did get some enjoyment in seeing the video of him realizing that, kind of panicking and sprinting back to the bullpen,\u201d Boone said with a grin. \u201cThat was kind of fun.\u201d Fortunately for Rodon, who went on to finish the inning, Bickford did not get far enough onto the field for the umpires to force the Yankees to make a pitching change. \u201cHey, I like the fact that he wanted in there and let\u2019s go,\u201d Boone said. \u201cIn fairness, I told him to be ready for the next hitter.\u201d", "summary": "Gleyber Torres\u2019 \u201creset\u201d lasted two games before he returned to the Yankees\u2019 lineup on Friday night.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/28/sports/gleyber-torres-returns-to-yankees-lineup-after-two-game-reset/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-o33x1gvpy-1719620334227.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1719605957&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:19:37", "author": "Greg Joyce", "authors": ["Greg Joyce"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.386}

{"id": 231943966, "title": "Best Internet Providers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "text": "What is the best internet provider in Philadelphia? Verizon Fios is the best internet provider in Philadelphia. It's the only fiber provider in the city. It's available at around 9 in 10 addresses. And it offers generous discounts for Verizon Wireless customers. For most people, the search begins and ends with Verizon. Xfinity is the cheapest internet provider in Philadelphia. The cable internet provider doesn't quite offer the same upload speed, and a 100% fiber-optic service is likely to provide you with more-reliable internet, but Xfinity offers you more -- and cheaper -- internet options. If you don't want a wired connection for some reason, you can opt for wireless internet in Philadelphia, with Verizon 5G Home Internet and T-Mobile Home Internet widely available. The only real reason to go with wireless is if you're a T-Mobile cellphone customer looking to take advantage of bundling discounts. Source: CNET analysis of provider data. Other available internet providers in Philadelphia Satellite internet: A satellite connection is available pretty much anywhere, including throughout Philadelphia but is best suited for rural internet connections. However, Philadelphia residents will have faster, cheaper internet options than Hughesnet or Viasat. PhillyWhisper: Local fixed wireless provider PhillyWhisper advertises a single residential internet plan starting at $50 monthly for minimum speeds of ranging from 25 to 500Mbps. Different speeds will vary on your location, single-family homes can expect a minimum of 100Mbps, whereas, apartment buildings can expect up to 500Mbps. Since PhillyWhisper doesn't lock you into a contract, there's no risk to seeing what kind of speeds are available at your address. T-Mobile Home Internet: Another major 5G home internet provider, T-Mobile offers speeds ranging from 72 to 245Mbps starting at $60 per month ($40 for qualifying T-Mobile customers). Like Verizon 5G, equipment and unlimited data are included, and no contracts are required, but T-Mobile doesn't quite deliver the same speed potential for the price as Verizon. T-Mobile home internet coverage is also somewhat spotty throughout Philadelphia, covering only about a third of homes in the area. Cheap internet options in Philadelphia Xfinity and 5G home internet from Verizon or T-Mobile (if you qualify for a discount with either) will be your cheapest internet options in the Philadelphia area. Aside from those providers and circumstances, expect to pay at least $50 monthly for home internet. Source: CNET analysis of provider data.

With a high availability of gigabit plans from Xfinity and Verizon throughout the area, median download speeds are slightly lower in Philly than in the rest of Pennsylvania. However, depending on your chosen provider and plan, your speeds could be much higher. Verizon Fios is the fastest Philadelphia internet provider, with average speeds of 249/170Mbps. Xfinity, for comparison, has average speeds of 189/22Mbps. Source: CNET analysis of provider data. What\u2019s a good internet speed? Most internet connection plans can now handle basic productivity and communication tasks. If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the FCC. Note that these are only guidelines -- and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address. For more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need. 0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics -- browsing the internet, sending and receiving email, streaming low-quality video.5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.40 to 100Mbps should give one user sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming. 100 to 500Mbps allows one to two users to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming. 500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more users to engage in high-bandwidth activities at the same time. How CNET chose the best internet providers in Philadelphia Internet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it's impractical to personally test every internet service provider in a given city. So what's our approach? For starters, we tap into a proprietary database of pricing, availability and speed information that draws from our own historical ISP data, partner data and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov. But it doesn't end there. We go to the FCC's website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication. Once we have this localized information, we ask three main questions: Does the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they're paying? Are customers happy with their service? Though the answers to those questions are often layered and complex, the providers that come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet providers, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, though we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports.

When it comes to the best internet providers, the ones that I would recommend and consider if I lived in Philadelphia would be Verizon and Xfinity. While Xfinity offers the same top speeds as Verizon, Verizon\u2019s fiber-optic service can\u2019t be beaten for upload speeds, pricing and service details.

Rick Scott of Florida says he\u2019ll be voting in November against a ballot amendment to legalize recreational marijuana in his state, a deeply personal decision based on his brother\u2019s long history of addiction. The senator and former Florida governor said he watched his brother Roger Scott begin smoking marijuana as a teenager and then struggle with substance use for the rest of life. \u201cPeople end up with addictive personalities, and so he did,\u201d Scott said in an interview. \u201cIt messes up your life, and so that\u2019s why I\u2019ve never supported legalization of drugs.\u201d When Roger Scott died in April at 67, the cause wasn\u2019t substance abuse, but rather \u201ca life of drugs and alcohol\u201d catching up with him, the senator said. He had lived in an apartment in Dallas, Texas, where he served jail time in 1990 on a misdemeanor conviction of possessing dangerous drugs, court records show. Rick Scott became wealthy as a lawyer and health care industry executive before entering politics. Now running for reelection, he lamented that his brother had a \u201ctough life\u201d and says it all began with marijuana. Scott\u2019s no-vote on marijuana falls in line with other state and national Republicans who question whether marijuana leads to using other riskier substances. The National Institute of Drug Abuse included in a 2019 webpage that most cannabis users don\u2019t go on to use \u201charder substances,\u201d but a statement from the agency also said using THC, marijuana\u2019s psychoactive compound, may cause brain changes that could make a person more likely to develop an addiction to other drugs. Amie Goodin, who researches marijuana safety at the University of Florida, said studies have found those who use riskier drugs often previously used marijuana, but that research hasn\u2019t established whether marijuana \u201cis actually the cause\u201d for someone to seek more powerful substances. Florida\u2019s voter initiative would legalize recreational marijuana use if the amendment receives 60% or more yes votes this November. That would also obligate the Florida Legislature to establish regulations and a framework for production and sales. Florida is among 38 states that have legalized medical marijuana, and would join 24 others that have legalized recreational use. Scott opposes this change alongside Florida\u2019s Republican Party, which formally announced its opposition in early May. They contend the amendment would \u201cbenefit powerful marijuana special interests, while putting children at risk and endangering Florida\u2019s family-friendly business and tourism climates.\u201d The amendment\u2019s sponsor, Smart & Safe Florida, said on its website that approval would enable Floridians to have \u201caccountability, transparency, and regulations\u201d in place. Among other benefits, this could ensure legal cannabis won\u2019t be laced with unknown and potentially dangerous chemicals, it said. Voters approved medical marijuana when Scott was governor, but Scott and the Legislature placed tight restrictions on its use, including banning smokable marijuana. Cannabis advocates then sued and a court agreed to allow smokable medical marijuana just before Scott left office. His successor, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, chose not to appeal.", "summary": "The senator and former Florida governor said he watched his brother Roger Scott begin smoking marijuana as a teenager and then struggle with substance use for the rest of life.", "url": "https://www.orlandosentinel.com/2024/06/09/florida-sen-rick-scott-says-hell-vote-against-recreational-pot-after-brothers-death/", "image": "https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Marijuana-Rick-Scott-Florida_63581.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:59:38", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.154}

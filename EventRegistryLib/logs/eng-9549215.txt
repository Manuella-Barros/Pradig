Now, one of the team's longest-tenured players and a multi-time All-Pro selection might've played his last NFL snap.\n\nDrew Brees was the first Saints' legend to walk away, followed shortly after by running back Mark Ingram. While New Orleans has been able to fill voids at some of the positions vacated by departures of franchise legends, others have left massive holes in the starting lineup.\n\nRelated: NFL power rankings, see where New Orleans Saints placed\n\nNew Orleans had been hoping to avoid that with offensive tackle Ryan Ramczyk. A three-time All-Pro selection and the 32nd overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, it appears Ramczyk's NFL career might be over before he even takes a snap in his age-31 season.\n\nNFL news first surfaced in December that Ramczyk might be dealing with a career-ending injury. The 6-foot-6 offensive tackle played in just 12 games last season due to a knee injury that has only worsened over the last three years. He admitted in December that retirement was on the table, but he first needed to meet with specialists for further evaluation. Unfortunately, it appears retirement is now the likely outcome.\n\nRelated: NFL defense rankings 2024, see where New Orleans Saints land\n\nWhen asked about Ramczyk's availability for the 2024 season, Nick Underhill of NewOrleans.Football said not only is he expecting the Saints' tackle to not play this fall but his current belief is that Ramczyk never plays another NFL snap.\n\nLosing the veteran right tackle would be another blow for a Saints offensive line that was one of the worst in the NFL last season. If Ramczyk is unable to play, it would create massive holes at both offensive tackle spots heading into training camp.\n\nRelated: New Orleans Saints open to trade offers on star player\n\nNew Orleans already needed to replace left tackle Trevor Penning, the 19th overall pick in the 2022 NFL Draft, who has been one of the worst offensive tackles in football since entering the league. However, that spot was supposed to be addressed with the addition of Taliese Fuaga.\n\nA career-ending injury to Ramczyk might change things. Fuaga is a more natural fit at right tackle and starting the 2024 first-round selection on the right side could work out better for the Saints offensive line. However, that would also mean Penning - 53.6 Pro Football Focus grade in 2024 - would remain in the lineup. With Ramczyk not expected to see the field in 2024, New Orleans will likely look to add more depth at offensive tackle before training camp.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_johnson@sportsnaut.com", "name": "Matt Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Saints"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Ingram_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Ingram II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Brees", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drew Brees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://sportsnaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NFL-Chicago-Bears-at-New-Orleans-Saints-21826044.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549215", "eventUri": "eng-9549215", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Could they still use a starter?", "body": "One starter from the New Orleans Saints 2023 offensive line (left guard James Hurst) announced his retirement a few days before the NFL draft.\n\nAnother (left tackle Andrus Peat) signed with the Las Vegas Raiders this week in free agency.\n\nAnother (right tackle Ryan Ramczyk) is currently on the roster, but there is serious concern that he may never play football again because of a chronic knee injury that has plagued him for years.\n\nAdd it up, and that means the Saints may be breaking in new starters at three of their five offensive line positions in 2024. With about four months between now and the start of the regular season, the team is still facing some big questions about how it is going to fill those gaps.\n\nThe Saints appeared to have shored up one of those spots with their most valuable chip when they selected Oregon State tackle Taliese Fuaga with the No. 14 overall pick, but is there still work to do? And if so, how much?\n\nHere is a look at the Saints current group of offensive linemen. New additions are in bold, career starts are in parentheses.\n\nTackle: Ramczyk (101), Fuaga (0), Trevor Penning (6), Landon Young (7), Josiah Ezirim (0), Justin Heron (11)\n\nGuard: Cesar Ruiz (56), Oli Udoh (18), Shane Lemieux (12), Nick Saldiveri (0), Tommy Kraemer (3), Mark Evans (0)\n\nCenter: Erik McCoy (74)\n\nWhile the Saints have not officially ruled out the possibility of Ramczyk suiting up this season, for this exercise let's assume the worst-case scenario and operate as though he is not playing.\n\nWith that in mind, here is what a Saints Week 1 offensive line might look like, barring injury.\n\nLeft tackle: Penning, whom the Saints have not given up on despite two shaky pro seasons.Left guard: Udoh, who has played a total of 176 offensive snaps the last two seasons.Center: McCoy, who is clearly the Saints best offensive lineman and is coming off a Pro Bowl season.Right guard: Ruiz, who has shown flashes of being very good but has also been inconsistent throughout his career and is coming off a down season.Right tackle: Fuaga, whom the Saints are very high on but is still an unproven rookie.\n\nEven after drafting Fuaga, tackle could still be a weak spot for the Saints.\n\nThere remains a chance that Penning still develops into the player the Saints envisioned when they made him the No. 19 pick of the 2022 NFL Draft. He lost most of his rookie season to a freak injury in the preseason finale, then lost most of the ensuing offseason because of another freak injury he suffered in the final game of his rookie season.\n\nPenning was not good last season, which is why the Saints benched him in favor of Peat five games into the season. Rather than let him learn on the field, New Orleans kept him banished to the bench even when it had opportunities to get him back on the field. He played 13 offensive snaps in the final 11 games.\n\nThis year marked the first professional off-season Penning has had, and that might be enough to help him turn a corner. But would the Saints be comfortable going into the season with Penning penciled in as a starter? And what are their other options?\n\nFuaga could potentially fit on the left side, though most pre-draft reviews of him as a player pegged him as a better fit at right tackle, which is the position he played at Oregon State. If he slid in on the left, Landon Young has played decent football as a fill-in for Ramczyk, though he has had trouble against the more athletic edge rushers.\n\nNew Orleans might've gotten a draft steal in seventh-rounder Ezirim, who definitely has pro-ready size, but it would be a surprise to everyone if he contributed starting-caliber play as a rookie. Herron played 33 offensive snaps the last two years combined and is likely a depth piece.\n\nThere are still some free agents available with recent starting experience, though at this stage of the process, all come with some question marks.\n\nFormer Packers tackle David Bakhtiari is the biggest name of the bunch. At his peak, he was considered one of the NFL's best blindside protectors, earning first- or second-team All-Pro honors five straight seasons (2016-20). But it's impossible to tell how far Bakhtiari may be removed from his peak because he's played in just 13 of a possible 51 games since he tore his ACL late in the 2020 season (including just one last season).\n\nDonovan Smith is also still on the free agent market. He is coming off a down season in Kansas City, during which he played a career-low 12 games and 749 offensive snaps. But he has won a pair of Super Bowl rings, has stayed mostly healthy throughout his career and he only allowed two sacks last season according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nThe last available tackle who started multiple games last year is former Commanders lineman Charles Leno, whom Washington released this spring to free up cap space. Leno has enjoyed a solid pro career since the Bears selected him in the seventh round of the 2014 draft, making a Pro Bowl team in 2018, but he will turn 33 in October and he underwent surgery on his hip earlier this year.", "source": {"uri": "theadvocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Advocate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "luke_johnson@theadvocate.com", "name": "Luke Johnson", "type":

Andrus Peat, who played both guard and tackle last season, left in free agency for Las Vegas.

New Orleans has by no means given up on Penning, but the pace at which he improves remains to be seen.\n\nThis upcoming season, the Saints' offense will change systems under new coordinator Klint Kubiak, whose scheme is expected to emphasize outside zone runs -- a good fit for a prospect such as Fuaga, whose ability to run and block in space was seen as a strength.\n\nFuaga started all 12 games at right tackle in 2023 for Oregon State, which averaged nearly 5 yards per rush, and he was selected first-team All-Pac-12 last season.\n\nFuaga was the fourth offensive tackle drafted (after Joe Alt at No. 5, JC Latham at No. 7 and Olumuyiwa Fashanu and No. 11 ).\n\nIn the NFL, rookie contracts are determined primarily by a scale in the league's collective bargaining agreement.

Ramczyk's reworked deal includes $6.5 million in guaranteed money. However, a large portion now includes up to $9 million in potential bonuses.\n\nAccording to Nick Underhill of neworleans.football, there are four major incentives in 2024 in the newly worded contract for Ramczyk:\n\n* $1 million for a Pro Bowl selection\n\n* $1 million for an All-Pro season\n\n* $1 million for at least 90% of the offensive snaps\n\n* up to $6 million for other playing time clauses\n\nRamczyk, who turned 30 in April, was the 32nd overall choice in the first round of the 2017 NFL Draft out of Wisconsin by New Orleans. He has been a fixture at right tackle since his rookie year.\n\nAmong his many honors has been a 2017 All-Rookie Team selection and 1st Team All-Pro in 2019.\n\nBetween 2017 to 2021, Ramczyk was considered perhaps the league's best right tackle and among the NFL's top offensive linemen at any spot. Between 2017 and 2020, he'd start 70 of 71 contests, including playoffs.\n\nRamczyk missed only one only start from his rookie year until midway through 2021, a span of 80 contests. That was a coach's decision in the 2018 season finale when most of the team's starters did not play.\n\nSince missing eight of the last nine games in 2021, Ramczyk has dealt with serious knee issues. He'd miss just one game in 2022, but his once elite mobility was noticeably affected and he rarely practiced. Last season, Ramczyk appeared in just 12 games, missing the last four games of the year.\n\nSeveral reports have circulated this offseason that Ramczyk's knee could sideline him for the start of the 2024-25 campaign. Some have speculated that he could miss the entire season and his career may even be in jeopardy.\n\nWith Ramczyk's future and even availability to start 2024 in doubt, the Saints spent their first-round draft choice on Taliese Fuaga, an offensive tackle out of Oregon State. Fuaga is projected to have the ability to play either tackle, but was primarily a right tackle in college.\n\nRyan Ramczyk's restructured deal creates some additional salary cap space for the Saints.

The three-day camp begins Friday.\n\nBecause of the NFL's collective bargaining agreement, rookie contracts follow a standard template and the pay and length are often determined by the spot the player is drafted.\n\nFuaga, for instance, was projected to earn a four-year, $17.3 million contract with a $9.4 million signing bonus, according to Spotrac. That would fall in line with what last year's 14th pick, Broderick Jones, signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers (four years, $16.6 million). First-round contracts also are fully guaranteed.\n\nThe Saints took Fuaga in this year's draft to address a glaring need along the offensive line. The 6-foot-6, 324-pound lineman was a two-year starter at Oregon State, where he did not allow a sack in 25 starts at right tackle. The Saints have not said whether they see Fuaga more as a right tackle or a left tackle, and both spots are question marks entering 2024 for New Orleans.\n\nFuaga was the fourth offensive lineman taken in this year's draft. He was selected after the Los Angeles Chargers' Joe Alt (No. 5), the Tennessee Titans' J.C. Latham (No. 7) and the New York Jets' Olu Fashanu (No. 10). A record eight tackles were drafted in the first round.\n\nFuaga appears to be the third first-rounder this year to sign his rookie contract. He joins Seattle Seahawks defensive tackle Byron Murphy II (No. 16) and Baltimore Ravens cornerback Nate Wiggins (No. 30).\n\nThe Saints made seven selections after entering the draft with nine. The team traded up in the second round to grab cornerback Kool-Aid McKinstrk with the 41st pick. To land No. 41, they sent picks 45, 168 (fifth round) and 190 (sixth round) to the Green Bay Packers.", "source": {"uri": "nola.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NOLA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_paras@nola.com", "name": "Matthew Paras", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Saints"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_bonus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Signing bonus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_Beavers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oregon State Beavers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Byron Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Los_Angeles_Chargers_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2017 Los Angeles Chargers season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/3a/03a0336e-04e3-11ef-8675-ab7cb81e091a/662d77fe13c75.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549215", "eventUri": "eng-9549215", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

How has the NFC South shaped up, and where are the Saints on the totem pole?\n\nI say that they're right at the top, with the Atlanta Falcons not that far behind. Then it's the Buccaneers and the Panthers at the bottom. The Saints only improved on areas of need in April but have also made some key free agent signings that put them over the top of the division. Additions like Tailese Fuaga and Chase Young are prime examples of this.\n\nOn the first day of the NFL Draft, the Saints selected Tailese Fuaga, an offensive tackle out of Oregon State. He has primarily played at right tackle but can play on the left side if needed. The team has expressed that they see him as a tackle prospect and not a guard. With his skill and upside compared to others in the offensive line room, I think Fuaga has a big chance to start in September.\n\nFree agent defensive end Chase Young was signed in March to a one-year, $13 million deal. His neck procedure took the wind out of a lot of people's sails, but this is still a positive signing. Young can be a star in this league, and even won Rookie of the Year in 2020 also making the Pro-Bowl that same year. In his five seasons in the league, Young has gathered 100 tackles, 16.5 sacks, six forced fumbles, and three fumble recoveries.

Instead, the New Orleans Saints drafted a defensive tackle who can contribute immediately and an offensive tackle prospect with fantastic potential.\n\nDT Khristian Boyd - Northern Iowa\n\nBeing this late of a draft pick brings a lack of expectations. This is a little different with defensive tackle Khristian Boyd. The Saints came into the NFL Draft with a significant need for a nose tackle. They needed a player who could stop the run and take double teams so Bryan Bresee could have a one-on-one. At 6-foot-4, 317 pounds, Boyd is the perfect piece for the Saints defensive line. He was one of the three NTs in the draft, and he has the potential to be one of the best defensive tackle prospects. He is a good run defender but has also flashed in pass rush. The Saints have valued Shrine Bowl participants equally with Senior Bowl participants in this year's draft, which stays true with Boyd. At the Shrine Bowl, Khristian Boyd dominated, which was one reason why most of the league invited him to pre-draft meetings. The other reason was that Boyd did not get an NFL Combine invite, and many people were confused by this decision. It was a blessing for the Saints because Boyd would have been drafted higher if invited.\n\nOT Josiah Ezirim - Eastern Kentucky\n\nThis selection in the 7th round was the last pick in the Saints 2024 draft class. Going into the draft, the offensive line was the most significant need. The Saints got an amazing tackle with Taliese Fuaga, but many people felt they needed one more pick at that position. Josiah Ezirim was that pick, and he has a lot of potential. At this time, Ezirim is a very raw prospect, moving from defensive tackle to offensive tackle during his time in college. This potential, matched with great character and drive, allowed the Saints to pinpoint him on their draft board. Ezirim is good at run blocking and has significantly improved in pass blocking. These improvements occurred because of Ezirim's drive to get better. He also had great measurables, which was very important because of his height, 6-foot-6. At 329 pounds, he was able to run a 5.10 40-yard dash. Yet another prospect who participated at the Shrine Bowl, Ezirim, flashed during the drills at offensive tackle. When he was drafted, Ezirim had one of the best draft day videos ever, and it showed the high character but extremely driven player that the Saints wanted in their building.", "source": {"uri": "canalstreetchronicles.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Canal Street Chronicles"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_tackle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defensive tackle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Iowa_Panthers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Iowa Panthers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Saints"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Kentucky_Colonels_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Kentucky Colonels football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senior Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40-yard_dash", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "40-yard dash"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/2D_Drafting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/2D Drafting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/Associations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vy3aiR3f9IIXQTYFQmcssMnqa_c=/0x354:4240x2474/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25428660/usa_today_13168488.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549215", "eventUri": "eng-9549215", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

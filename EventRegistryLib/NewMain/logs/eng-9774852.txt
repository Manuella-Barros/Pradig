The death toll in the Kerala landslides has risen to 158.\n\nThe Kerala government could have minimised the losses that occurred in Wayanad as a result of Tuesday's landslides if they had become \"alert\" after the Central Government's warning over it and the consequent threat to the lives of residents, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said in the Rajya Sabha.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe added that irrespective of party politics, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government will stand with the people of Kerala.\n\nAccording to the Kerala Revenue Department, the death toll in the landslides has risen to 158, news agency ANI reported.\n\nAccording to Shah, the Central government had sent an early warning to the government of Kerala seven days before the incident, and then again on July 24, 25 and 26.\n\n\" Questions are being raised about the early warning system of the government. I want to clarify something for the country... They kept on talking about early warning [on the possibility of landslides]. I want to clarify that on July 23, that is seven days before the incident, the government of India had given an early warning to the government of Kerala. That is why the same day, at my direction, nine teams of NDRF (National Disaster Response Force) were sent to the state. They were again issued an early warning on July 24 and 25. On July 26, a warning was issued, alerting the government of the possibility of heavy rainfall of more than 20 cm. They were told that there were chances of landslides, which could lead to mudflow and people could lose lives,\" Shah said.\n\nQuestioning the Kerala government, he asked, \"What did the Kerala government do? Were the people shifted? And if they were shifted then how did they die?\" Shah said.\n\nShah, however, said that it was the time to stand with the people of Kerala.\n\n\"Had they become alert the day the teams landed in the state, a lot could have been saved. But this is the time to stand with the government and the people of Kerala. Irrespective of the party politics, the Narendra Modi government will stand with the people of Kerala,\" the Home Minister said, adding that three more teams of NDRF were sent to the state on Tuesday.\n\nThe Union Minister also informed the Upper House of the Parliament that the government has spent Rs 2,000 crore after 2014 for the early warning system.\n\n\"The project of early warning started in 2016, and by 2023, India had the most modern early warning system... There are only four countries to predict [major events] seven days in advance and India is one among them,\" Shah informed.\n\nMeanwhile, the search and rescue operations continue at landslide-affected Chooralmala in Wayanad. Around 1,200 rescue workers from the Indian Army, Defence Security Corps (DSC) centre, Territorial Army, NDRF, Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force (IAF) are deployed in Wayanad.\n\nThe Commandant of the Para Regimental Training Centre, Brigadier Arjun Seagan, said that 500 to 600 personnel from NDRF, army, state police, forest officials, and volunteers have been carrying out the rescue operations on Wednesday.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Indian Army ramped up its rescue operations and successfully evacuated more than 1,000 people from the affected areas to safety.\n\nThe Army's Southern Command said that up to 1,000 personnel have been rescued so far using man-made bridges and human effort.\n\nDespite adverse climatic conditions and poor visibility, IAF helicopters conducted the search & rescue operations in Wayanad, rescuing stranded people from a narrow strip of land.\n\nAt least two massive landslides struck Kerala's Wayanad on Tuesday morning, causing widespread destruction.

They kept on talking about early warning. I want to clarify that on July 23, the government of India gave an early warning to the government of Kerala, which was 7 days before the incident, and then on July 24 and 25 too early warning was given. On July 26, a warning was given that there was a chance of heavy rainfall of more than 20 cm, and there were chances of landslides, there could be mudflow and people could lose lives in this.

What did the Kerala government do? Were the people shifted? And if they were shifted then how did they die?\" Shah said.\n\n\"The project of early warning started in 2016 and by 2023, India had the most modern early warning system...

At the moment, 1200 rescue workers from the Indian Army, DSC centre, Territorial Army, NDRF, Indian Navy and the IAF are deployed here.\n\nThe Commandant of the Para Regimental Training Centre, Brigadier Arjun Seagan, said that 500 to 600 personnel from the NDRF, army, state police, forest officials, and volunteers have been carrying out the rescue operations on Wednesday.\n\nEarlier today, the Indian Army ramped up its rescue operations and successfully evacuated more than 1,000 people from affected areas to safety. The Army's Southern Command said that up to 1,000 personnel have been rescued so far using man-made bridges and human effort.\n\nDespite adverse climatic conditions and poor visibility, Indian Air Force Helicopters also conducted search & rescue operations in Wayanad rescuing stranded people from a narrow strip of land.\n\nAt least two massive landslides struck Kerala's Wayanad on Tuesday morning, causing widespread destruction. The first occurred in Mundakkai, a town, and the second in Chooralmala. The massive landslides wreaked havoc in the region, damaging houses and roads, uprooting trees, and swelling water bodies, which hindered rescue operations. Relief and rescue efforts are currently underway.\n\nThe first landslide occurred at 2 am on July 30, followed by another at 4:10 am, causing immense damage to homes and livelihoods. Many areas, including Meppadi, Mundakkai and Chooralmala, have been isolated, and roads have been washed away. The Vellarmala GVH School was completely buried.

On July 26, a warning was given that there was a chance of heavy rainfall of more than 20 cm, and there were chances of landslides, there could be mudflow and people could lose lives in this\", Shah added.\n\nIn the Rajya Sabha, Amit Shah criticized the Kerala government for not responding to early warnings or the arrival of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams. He revealed that nine NDRF battalions were dispatched on July 23, with an additional three sent on July 30, yet the state failed to take adequate action.\n\nAmit Shah criticised the opposition for questioning the central government's early warning systems, and its response to the tragedy.\n\n\"Questions are being raised about the early warning system of the government... The government has spent Rs. 2000 crores after 2014 for the early warning system...\" Shah slammed the CPI(M) government in Kerala.\n\nAmit Shah also noted that several states, including Odisha and Gujarat, have effectively utilized the early warnings provided by the Centre to mitigate the impact of natural disasters such as cyclones.\n\nHome Minister Amit Shah suggested that if the Kerala government had responded promptly upon receiving the early warning and acted quickly when NDRF teams arrived, the extent of the losses could have been significantly reduced.\n\nThe series of catastrophic landslides in Kerala's Wayanad district has resulted in at least 158 fatalities and over 200 injuries, with the death toll likely to rise as rescue operations continue.\n\nHowever, on Wednesday MoS Home Nityanand Rai while addressing the Rajya Sabha said \"133 bodies recovered so far\".", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [],

The Army's Southern Command said that up to 1,000 personnel have been rescued so far using man-made bridges and human effort.\n\nDespite adverse climatic conditions and poor visibility, Indian Air Force Helicopters also conducted search & rescue operations in Wayanad rescuing stranded people from a narrow strip of land.\n\nAt least two massive landslides struck Kerala's Wayanad on Tuesday morning, causing widespread destruction. The first occurred in Mundakkai, a town, and the second in Chooralmala. The massive landslides wreaked havoc in the region, damaging houses and roads, uprooting trees, and swelling water bodies, which hindered rescue operations. Relief and rescue efforts are currently underway.\n\nThe first landslide occurred at 2 am on July 30, followed by another at 4:10 am, causing immense damage to homes and livelihoods. Many areas, including Meppadi, Mundakkai and Chooralmala, have been isolated, and roads have been washed away. The Vellarmala GVH School was completely buried.

He lambasted the Pinarayi Vijayan government and stated that the Union government gave them early warnings, several days in advance of the major calamity. He also charged the Communist government with ignoring early warning alerts issued by the Union government.\n\nNotably, Home Minister Shah briefly addressed the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday and shared details about the centre's response and effectiveness of India's 'early warning system' in the wake of landslides in Wayanad. He assured the House and the country that the Modi government is standing like a rock with the Kerala government and the people to deal with the tragedy.\n\nIn Rajya Sabha, he listed out the dates on which the Kerala government could have acted to avert the high casualty figures.\n\nHome Minister Shah said, \"My condolences to the bereaved families... I want to clarify something for the country... They kept on talking about early warning. I want to clarify that on July 23, the government of India gave an early warning to the government of Kerala, which was 7 days before the incident, and then on July 24 and 25 too early warning was given.\"\n\nHe added, \"On July 26, a warning was given that there was a chance of heavy rainfall of more than 20 cm, and there were chances of landslides, there could be mudflow and people could lose lives in this. Questions are being raised about the early warning system of the government... \"\n\nHe slammed the Pinarayi Vijayan-led LDF government and emphasised that the number of deaths could have been minimised had the Kerala government been alert and acted on the Centre's warning or after the arrival of NDRF teams.\n\nHe also adviced the opposition parties to read the early warning alerts issued by the Union government saying, \"Please, read it\" instead of shouting, \"Please listen us\" and repeat old and worn out slogans.\n\nShah told Rajya Sabha that the Centre had dispatched nine NDRF teams on 23rd July to Kerala after heavy rainfall was predicted for the southern state.\n\nHe added, \"... Under this early warning system, on July 23, at my direction, 9 NDRF teams were sent to Kerala considering that there could be landslides... What did the Kerala government do? Were the people shifted? And if they were shifted then how did they die?... The project of early warning started in 2016 and by 2023, India had the most modern early warning system... There are only 4 countries to predict 7 days in advance and India is one amongst them.\"\n\nWe have early warning system for rainfall, heatwave, cyclone, thunderstorm and even for lighting which informs respective DM directly, 10 minutes in advance. The government has spent Rs. 2000 crores after 2014 for the early warning system, the Home Minister told Rajya Sabha.\n\nHome Minister Shah noted that while the Kerala government ignored the early warning alerts, other state governments including the then BJD-led Odisha government ensured zero-casaulty disaster management because of these alerts.\n\nHe added that there are governments that took cognisance of the alerts sent by the early warning system and ensured \"zero-casualty disaster management\". He lauded the then Odisha government which was headed by Naveen Patnaik.\n\nHe noted that the Union government alerted the then Odisha government 7 days in advance about cyclones and it prevented major loss of lives. Incidentally, only person lost his life because of some mistakes.\n\nThe Home Minister added that they sent a cyclone alert to the Gujarat government three days in advance, and the latter ensured zero-casaulty.\n\nTaking a jibe seemingly at TMC MP Mahua Moitra who was expelled from the Last Lok Sabha over 'cash-for-query' scam, Home Minister said that some MPs open 'foreign sites' rather than visiting official website. He explained that apart from sending early warning alerts to the state governments, 7 days in advance, the information is available on site for all to see but for that people would have to see Indian site, he added.\n\nTwo massive landslides struck the state's hilly areas in Meppadi panchayat early on July 30 morning with villages Mundakkai, Chooralmala, Attamala and Noolpuzha among the severely affected. The area which has been witnessing incessant rainfall over the past two weeks faced devastation after the landslide struck, with rivers and their tributaries swelling and changing course, flowing through the villages and wreaking destruction. As per reports, over 150 people have died in these landslides in Wayanad district.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Had the Kerala government got itself alerted and acted as soon as NDRF teams landed there, losses could have been minimised, the Home Minister said.\n\nReplying to the calling attention motion, Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai informed the House that 133 bodies have been recovered so far and death toll may rise.", "source": {"uri": "zeenews.india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zee News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Kerala", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government of Kerala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayanad_district", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wayanad district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wayanad district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Disaster_Response_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Disaster Response Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Landslide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amit Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Home_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Home Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Modi_ministry", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Modi ministry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Upper house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nityanand_Rai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nityanand Rai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Odisha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2024/07/31/1454924-ami.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774852", "eventUri": "eng-9774852", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wayanad district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 180, "textEnd": 187, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 1153, "textEnd": 1160, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 1201, "textEnd": 1208}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

He also promised all help from the central government.\n\nThe home minister was intervening in response to statements from the Opposition who blamed the loss of lives to the lack of early warning systems for natural calamities such as the one in Wayanad, amid calls from several members cutting across party lines to declare the tragedy in Kerala a national disaster.\n\n\"There were accusations, whether in the absence of information or what I do not know but I need to specify here through the House to the entire nation. They kept saying early warning, early warning...I would like to specify that on July 23, the Kerala government was given an early warning by the central government,\" Shah asserted.\n\nHe further said,\"On July 23, seven days prior, then again on July 24, and July 25. On July 26 it was informed that there will be heavy rainfall of more than 20 centimeters, there is a possibility of a landslide, there could be a rush of mud and people could even die by getting buried beneath it.\" Taking a dig at the Opposition, the home minister said,\"...that is why I say, do not shout please listen to us, please read it. Read the warning that has been sent.\" There are many state governments who have achieved zero casualty by heeding to these early warnings for natural calamities, Shah said citing examples of Odisha and Gujarat.\n\nAsserting that there is an early warning system, he said the government has spent Rs 2,000 crore on it after 2014, and this information is shared with states seven days prior and that information is also available on the website for all, including MPs.\n\nIn an apparent dig at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, he said, \"But some people do not open Indian sites, only foreign sites, now on overseas (websites) this early warning system will not show, you will have to open our sites\".\n\n\"I would like to reiterate that early warning was given and therefore we dispatched nine NDRF teams there on July 23 whereas three battalions were sent yesterday (July 30),\" Shah said.\n\nIf the state government was alert to the arrival of the NDRF teams, a lot could have been saved, the home minister claimed.\n\n\"The central government sent nine NDRF teams by air. May I ask what the Kerala government did? Whether or not unauthorised people were living there, this was a vulnerable situation at hand, were the people evacuated? Why were they not evacuated? Who stopped them and if they were evacuated how did the (people) die?,\" Shah asked.\n\nHe claimed that the people were evacuated later not earlier but expressed solidarity with the state and reassured the Rajya Sabha that irrespective of party politics, the Modi government will stand by the people and the government of Kerala like a rock.\n\nThe home minister also emphasised that India boasts of the world's most technologically-advanced early warning system and shared that only four countries, including India are able to detect the possibility of such natural calamities seven days prior to the incident.\n\nReplying to the calling attention motion, Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai informed the Upper House that 133 bodies have been recovered so far and death toll may rise.\n\nInitiating the calling attention motion on the Wayanad tragedy, Arun Singh (BJP) informed the Upper House of several steps taken by the Centre to aid relief and rescue operations.\n\nTaking part in the discussion, John Brittas CPI(M) termed it the worst landslide that occurred in Kerala, while urging the Centre to declare it as a 'national disaster'.\n\nJebi Mather Hisham (Congress) also joined him in seeking the Wayanad tragedy to be declared a national disaster and lamented that there were no early warning systems for such natural calamities. Raghav Chadha (AAP) also called for strengthening early warning systems as part of measures to prepare \"ourselves for such unfortunate incidents in the future\".\n\nPraful Patel (NCP), M Thambidurai (AIADMK) also supported the call to declare the Wayanad tragedy a national disaster.\n\nSaket Gokhale (AITC), Muzibulla Khan (BJD), Tiruchi Siva (DMK), Manoj Kumar Jha (RJD), V Sivadasan CPI (M), AA Rahim CPI(M), Harish Beeran (IUML), Ramji (BSP) and GK Vasan TMC (M) also took part in the discussion.\n\nBJP member Surendra Singh Nagar, without naming Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said had the former MP of Wayanad raised various issues affecting people of the constituency in Parliament during his term, the lives could have been saved.\n\nHe alleged that Gandhi hasn't visited Wayanad so far after the tragedy struck.\n\nAnother BJP member Lahar Singh Siroya also echoed similar sentiments about Gandhi.

Clarifying the warnings issued were not confined to a single day, he said the warnings continued on 24 and 25 July with clear alerts on the possibility of heavy rainfall and landslides. The final warning was issued on 26 July that rainfall would be more than 20 centimeters with the possibility of mudflows and risk to lives.\n\nShah took the chance to console families of those who lost their loved ones during the catastrophe but at the same time tried to protect the effectiveness of the had been effected and how it had been effected. Shah also attacked the state government on how they handled the warnings raised by the authorities by questioning what type of precautions were taken into consideration for the safety of the people staying there. \"My condolences to the bereaved families.I want to clarify something for the country.They kept on talking about early warning.\". \"I want to clarify that on July 23, the government of India issued an early warning to the government of Kerala, which was 7 days prior to the incident,\" Shah said.\n\nNine NDRF Teams Deployed to Kerala Following Early Warnings\n\nThe home minister also highlighted how the Centre had responded proactively by sending out nine teams from the National Disaster Response Force to Kerala following the first warnings. Shah said this was part of the early warning system that the central government has been heavily investing in. \"Under this early warning system, on July 23, at my direction, 9 NDRF teams were sent to Kerala considering that there could be landslides,\" he said.\n\nShah noted that the government's expenditure under the huge financial commitment in early warning infrastructure began in 2014 and that the total expenditure before today was over 2000 crores of rupees. Further, he pointed out that though India's early warning system was initiated in the year 2016, it was capable of predicting weather events seven days in advance and brought at par with the best in the world by 2023.\n\nAddressing Concerns About Early Warning Effectiveness\n\nThe purpose of the comments made by the minister is to address the various concerns and criticisms regarding the effectiveness of the early warning adopted by the local authorities for preparedness. Shah's clarification also aims to clarify that the onus of the aftermath of this disaster does not lie solely on the central government but with the state authorities who passed on these warnings and had a role in disaster management.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, there are demands for an inquiry into the handing of the early warnings and the state's response to disaster. The incidents in Wayanad have yet again brought to the table the urgent need to work on disaster preparedness and the response strategies that could be further fine-tuned so that the central and state governments are put in a better position to ensure minimum causalities in natural disasters.", "source": {"uri": "dnpindia.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNP INDIA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sparsh_goel@dnpindia.in", "name": "Sparsh Goel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amit Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landslide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Kerala", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of Kerala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Home_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Home Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Disaster_Response_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Disaster Response Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_union_territories_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States and union territories of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayanad_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wayanad district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wayanad district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster_Relief_and_Recovery", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster Relief and Recovery", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Growth_and_Development", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Growth and Development", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.dnpindia.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Amit-Shah-2.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9774852", "eventUri": "eng-9774852", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "dateEnd": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 636, "textEnd": 650}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 409, "textEnd": 416, "freq": 4}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 754, "textEnd": 761}], "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

He also questioned the state government not taking preventive measures despite the warnings.\n\nThe Home Minister began his speech by offering condolences to the families of the victims of the Wayanad landslides and slammed the Opposition for politicising the issue.\n\nOn Tuesday night, massive landslides occurred at Churalpara in Kerala's Wayanad at around 2 a.m.\n\nThe area was cut off, but the local people and a team of rescuers were engaged in locating the missing people in the area, which had been ripped into two. The death toll has touched 184 while 225 people are reported missing while around 7,000 people have been housed in around 50 relief camps.\n\nShah stated, \"On July 23, the Government of India issued a warning to the Kerala government. Warnings were sent on July 24, July 25 and also July 26, indicating that heavy rainfall exceeding 20 cm could lead to landslides and fatalities.\"\n\nResponding to the \"irrelevant\" questions regarding the Early Warning System of the government, he said that instead of \"shouting, read the warnings that were sent.\"\n\n\"There are many state governments who were able to secure zero casualty disaster management following the warnings sent by the Central government,\" he said, citing Odisha and Gujarat as examples.\n\n\"The government has spent Rs 2000 crore on this system since 2014 after Prime Minister Narendra Modi assumed power,\" the Home Minister asserted.\n\nHe said that the state government was sent a warning seven days prior to the disaster, and that warning is also accessible to everyone on the site, however, \"some people don't open national sites, they are solely focused on the international sites, where they do not get national information.\"\n\nShah mentioned that only four countries in the world issue disaster warnings seven days in advance, and India is one of them.\n\nThe Home Minister mentioned that on July 23, nine NDRF teams were dispatched to Kerala following his approval in response to the warnings of potential landslides.\n\nSlamming the lack of acknowledgement to the warning system, he said, \"It is okay if they are unaware, but if they (Opposition) are politicising the issue, then it is disheartening. \"\n\nQuestioning the state government's failure to implement preventive measures Shah said, \"Everyone is questioning the government, but I would like to ask what the Kerala government did. It was a vulnerable situation, and they were warned about it, but why were people not relocated to safer places? They were only relocated after the disaster.\"\n\nAddressing concerns about disaster fund allocation, Shah clarified, \"Those who are saying that there is no provision by which the state government can release the disaster funds are wrong.\"\n\nHe said that under the State Disaster Response Fund, states have the authority to release up to 10 per cent of the allocated funds without the Centre's approval.\n\nHe added that \"irrespective of party politics, the Modi government will firmly stand with the people and the government of Kerala during this crisis.\"", "source": {"uri":

The entire country has converged all agencies to help out the people in distress. The PM and CM, everyone is alert and engaged in the activity.\"\n\nLeader of Opposition (LoP) in the Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, said, \"I don't have complete information about the incident. I only learnt about the incident through newspaper reports and phone calls with the authorities. Many people have been killed due to the landslide. Because the incident happened in the night, no one was aware of how many people were killed.\"\n\nHe urged the Vice President to ask the government to answer the Opposition's questions about the \"forces deployed there, financial help provided and rescue operations that are taking place.\"\n\nHowever, dismissing the LoP's request for a Kerala Congress MP to be allowed to speak on the issue, Dhankhar said, \"We express our condolences and our solidarity...Any disaster in any part of the country is of grave importance to us... I cannot confine tragedy to one state.\"\n\nResponding to the concerns, Leader of the House, JP Nadda, emphasised nationwide empathy for the tragedy and said that the \"entire country is pained\" by the incident.\n\nHe assured that the Government of India, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is \"taking all necessary steps for the rescue operations.\"\n\n\"Our concerns are understandable, but a standard procedure is followed in incidents like these. Our central agencies have reached the spot to carry out the rescue operations in coordination with the state government,\" the Union Minister added.\n\nNadda further said that the government under the leadership of PM Modi is \"proactive and pro-responsive\" and that the agitation of Kerala MPs is understandable, but \"we have to translate it into action.\"\n\nUnion Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju also addressed allegations that the Centre was not releasing funds, asserting that this was \"not the time to play politics.\"\n\nRijiju clarified that funds were provided in advance under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), a collaborative resource of the state and central governments for natural disasters.\n\nHe assured that all available rescue forces, including the NDRF, SDRF, Indian Army, and Air Force, have been mobilised.\n\nRijiju concluded by promising a detailed report from the Home Ministry \"if requested by the House,\" stressing the government's \"proactive and coordinated response\" to the crisis.", "source": {"uri": "socialnews.xyz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social News XYZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice-President_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice-President of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landslide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayanad_district", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wayanad district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wayanad district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kerala"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brittas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Brittas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India_(Marxist)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of India (Marxist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagdeep_Dhankhar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jagdeep Dhankhar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kerala Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallikarjun_Kharge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mallikarjun Kharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Nadda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

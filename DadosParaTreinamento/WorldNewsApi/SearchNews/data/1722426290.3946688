But then a hold-up emerged. Some 17 hours after Biden botched his big debate moment, his former boss came to the rescue. For many high-ranking Democrats, a single tweet from former President Barack Obama appeared to nix any chance of the 44th president meeting with the 46th and urging him to drop out. \u201cBad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know,\u201d Obama posted on X, alluding to his own rusty performance against Mitt Romney in 2012. \u201cBut this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself. Between someone who tells the truth; who knows right from wrong and will give it to the American people straight\u2014and someone who lies through his teeth for his own benefit. \u201cLast night didn\u2019t change that, and it\u2019s why so much is at stake in November.\u201d Democratic sources who spoke to The Daily Beast said there were only four credible messengers who could convince Biden to step aside. Or, at the very least, four who could convince him to put withdrawal on the table as an option, if post-debate polling confirms Democrats\u2019 worst fears: that Biden tanked his re-election chances and handed Trump a pass to a second term. Those heavy hitters are Obama; former President Bill Clinton; First Lady Jill Biden; and Valerie Biden Owens, the president\u2019s sister and longtime campaign manager. \u201cJill has a blindspot,\u201d one Democratic donor bundler, who has known the Bidens for decades, told The Daily Beast. According to this high-ranking Democrat, the first lady is overly protective of her husband and can sometimes unintentionally reinforce Biden\u2019s image as too frail and too old for the job. The source pointed to Biden\u2019s post-debate appearance in Atlanta on Thursday. As she often does, Jill Biden grabbed her husband at several points, appearing to show him where to go. It may well be just her way of showing affection. But, the source said, Joe Biden \u201cis in his 80s, and it might be some of that \u2018Watch out for this\u2019 type of thing that you would do with a family member of that age.\u201d The senior Democrat was not as worried as others about how bad the first debate could prove for Biden\u2019s chances. Trouble is reportedly brewing among Biden donors. But according to the donor bundler, donors deciding not to show up to fundraisers, a scenario multiple outlets have reported, likely won\u2019t make any difference in the president\u2019s calculus. If Bill, Jill, or Valerie intervened, that might actually move the needle, the source said. Obama\u2019s tweet therefore came as welcome news to the source, who had been inundated by worried texts from donors and other party bigwigs. \u201cI think it\u2019s helpful, because everybody has so much respect for him,\u201d the source said, calling Obama \u201cthe face of the party\u201d before saying Biden is still technically in that role. Nonetheless, the source could not \u201cthink of anybody else who would have as much sway over people as\u201d Obama himself. Others in the party worried what booting Biden from the ticket could entail. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna lie, last night was not a good night for Joe Biden,\u201d longtime North Carolina Democratic strategist Doug Wilson told The Daily Beast. Yet Wilson said the president still enjoyed a strong base of support in his battleground state, citing the greeting for his arrival after the debate, on Air Force One. \u201cWhen it comes to North Carolina, I think we got a firsthand reaction to how the party and the base feels about him,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cTo me, that feels like he still has support. It\u2019s almost like a team coming from traveling, even after a loss.\u201d Wilson cautioned that chatter about pushing Biden out in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris\u2014or the even more chaotic option of a brokered convention in Chicago\u2014runs the risk not only of handing the election to Trump, but of damaging the party in the long term. If Democrats aren\u2019t careful, Wilson said, they could usher in a second Reagan Revolution\u2014another decade and-a-half of Republican rule. \u201cI think the question that Democrats have to ask themselves is, one, do we want a repeat of 1980?\u201d Wilson said, referring to Edward Kennedy\u2019s primary challenge to President Jimmy Carter. \u201cDo we wanna throw out our guy after one bad performance?\u201d Speaking before Obama\u2019s tweet, Wilson explained why it was already unlikely that Biden\u2019s former boss would be the one to sit him down and tell him to fall on his sword. Obama had a similar conversation with Biden ahead of the 2016 election, when he told him former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s run would make it impossible to endorse his old vice president. \u201cI don\u2019t know if Obama wants to do that same thing here,\u201d Wilson said. It turned out, he doesn\u2019t. Wilson said Harris might be able to improve the party\u2019s standing in North Carolina. But he was not sure. \u201cThe question is, is the country ready for a Black woman?\u201d said Wilson, who is Black. \u201cThey sure as hell weren\u2019t ready for a white woman in 2016. So the question is, unfortunately, the party is ready for a Black woman, but will the country be ready?\u201d", "summary": "<figure><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/240628-lahut-joe-biden-debate-hero_y8gtzz\"/><figcaption>Photo Illustration by Erin O\u2019Flynn/The Daily Beast/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure><p>On Friday afternoon, in the aftermath of <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/joe-biden\">President Joe Biden\u2019s</a> disastrous debate against <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/donald-j-trump\">Donald Trump</a>, private murmurs and public calls for an \u201cintervention\u201d ricocheted through Democratic circles.

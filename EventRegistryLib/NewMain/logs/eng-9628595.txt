This festival, held every four years, brings together cultural practitioners and custodians from 28 Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs), providing a platform for them to share their cultural practices and advocate for the protection and safeguarding of Pacific cultures.\n\nThe inaugural FestPAC was hosted by Fiji and set the stage for what would become the most significant Pacific cultural gathering in the world. At the time, leaders and cultural custodians from the Pacific region recognised the need for a unified platform to address the loss of cultural practices in the face of colonisation and globalisation.\n\nSince its establishment, FestPAC continues to be supported by the South Pacific Commission (now the Pacific Community - SPC) to promote and protect the diverse cultural heritage of the Pacific region through regular, large-scale cultural exchanges and celebrations.\n\n\"At FestPAC you will hear of elders and cultural leaders speak of FestPAC as that time and place where we come together as Pacific peoples in a unified voice and movement to celebrate as peoples with generations of integrated relationships, but coming together with one clear objective - to elevate our cultural practitioners and custodians and support them to protect their cultures, their lands and oceans,\" said Letila Mitchell, Culture Advisor and FestPAC focal point at SPC.\n\n\"As many Pacific nations have gained sovereignty, others continue to struggle to retain their cultural independence, FestPAC offers a safe gathering space where cultural exchange, inter-generational dialogue and a powerful, shared Pacific voice is enabled.\"\n\nFestPAC has always had a foundational focus on the recovery and revitalisation of endangered heritage arts and cultural practices.\n\nThese heritage art forms, and cultural practice are at the foundation of all Pacific cultures and together at FestPAC a revitalised effort to share and exchange knowledge has seen this cultural recovery strengthened.\n\n\"Since its inception, FestPAC has been crucial in providing a platform for Pacific cultural practitioners and custodians to ensure continued practice and sharing of cultural knowledge amidst the challenges of modernisation and globalization,\" said Ms. Mutchell.\n\n\"It has continuously focused on safeguarding cultural practices, which are integral to the resilience and survival of Pacific communities.\"\n\nSince the 8th FestPAC in New Caledonia, creative exploration into new storytelling mediums such as film, digital storytelling, fashion, and new visual arts forms, as well as the introduction of live broadcasts and the internet, has continued to elevate the dynamic nature of Pacific cultures.\n\nWhile heritage practices and cultural knowledge remain at its core, the festival reflects Pacific people's ability to embrace innovation, technology and adapt to its changing environments.\n\nSubsequent festivals in Palau, American Samoa and Guam have had a unique opportunity to highlight their cultural assets and address pressing cultural safeguarding issues, such as the impacts of climate change on their lands and heritage sites. Each festival emphasises the transmission of knowledge from elders to youth, ensuring that their cultural practices are not lost.\n\nAs FestPAC looks to the future, it aims to continue adapting while staying true to its mission of gathering indigenous Pacific Peoples to celebrate their success and spotlight the exemplars of cultural practice in the region, while dialogue on common challenges faced by these island nations. There is strength found in cultural solidarity and it is a commemoration of resilience, and a testament to the enduring spirit of the Pacific peoples.\n\nThe 13th Festival of Pacific Arts and Culture (FestPAC13) will be hosted\u202fby Hawai'i from 6 - 16 June 2024.

They raise their voices in song and affirm connections across the vast seaways of the Pacific.\n\nWatching and listening are delegates and visitors from many islands. All have come to learn, to represent and to connect. Scenes such as this will be a focus when the 13th Festival of Pacific Arts & Culture - known by many simply as FestPAC - kicks off on O'ahu in Hawai'i today.\n\nFor the next ten days, dancers and singers, carvers and creators, storytellers and orators, scholars and educators will celebrate, demonstrate and reflect on life and culture within the vast and complex Pacific region.\n\nWith 28 Pacific nations represented, this year marks the return of FestPAC after a long hiatus due to the COVID pandemic. The eight years since 2016's event in Gu\u00e5han (Guam) have been the longest absence since the festival's founding in 1972.\n\nTaking place every four years (except for 2020), each event sees a different location and host culture within Oceania. Delegations from most Pacific countries and states come together for an intensive and wide-ranging exchange of art forms and cultural practices.\n\nPast festivals have focused on the endurance of ancestral traditions and legacies, in keeping with FestPAC's established goals, as well as emphasising the preservation and revival of Indigenous languages.\n\nBut there is also an increasing focus on contemporary culture. The festival is known for its eclectic range of art forms, practices and creativity, as well as providing a forum for political ideas about cultural ownership and identity.\n\nIndeed, the inaugural festival in 1972 was in part a response by the South Pacific Commission (now the Pacific Community) to concerns about cultural change in the region.\n\nDescribed as \"the world's largest celebration of Indigenous Pacific Islanders\", it was aimed at promoting exchange among Pacific communities and cultures.\n\nEach festival is organised around a theme. The first, in Fiji, was about \"preserving culture\".\n\nThe sixth festival, in 1992 in Rarotonga, featured a \"seafaring heritage\" theme. The significance of ocean voyaging has continued to define the festival. A key opening protocol is the dawn arrival of voyaging canoes that have made the crossing from their homelands to the host country.\n\nAt the 2016 festival on Gu\u00e5han, navigators, voyagers, builders and scholars came together for a special canoe summit that examined and affirmed the remarkable voyaging traditions of the Pacific.\n\nOther festivals have had a focus on the survival of unique art forms and revitalisation of cultural practices. This year, the Aotearoa New Zealand delegation includes the Haumanu Collective, exponents of taonga p\u016boro, traditional M\u0101ori instruments.\n\nOverall, the 2024 festival is looking toward the future with the theme of \"Ho\u02bboulu L\u0101hui: Regenerating Oceania\". There's a varied programme of ceremonies and protocol, heritage arts, performing arts, visual arts and symposiums.\n\nBut the festival also encapsulates the idea that art and cultural practices are more than just entertainment or ways to communicate aspects of ancestral heritage. They are also vehicles for unification, historical awareness and political resistance.\n\nFestPAC delegations have a long history of engaging with current social and political issues, including climate change and decolonisation. Global politics and regional identity often feature in various forms and forums.\n\nDuring the 2004 festival on Palau, for example, host leaders invited an Indigenous delegation from Taiwan to take part as a means of emphasising the ancient Austronesian roots of the Pacific Islands. This took place against the backdrop of increasing competition for regional influence between the US and China.\n\nThe West Papuan independence struggle has also been communicated through song and performance. And this year's festival offers a stage for Kanaka Maoli (Indigenous Hawaiians) to express solidarity within their own struggles with colonialism and militarisation.\n\nSadly, New Caledonia has withdrawn from the festival due to violent unrest over political representation and independence in the French territory. Nevertheless, Kanak music and song remains a vital expression of resistance and protest.\n\nThe withdrawal comes as New Caledonia is set to host the next festival in 2028. It's a reminder of the enduring social and political struggles still happening in the region.\n\nBut as FestPAC makes a welcome return in Hawai'i this week, there will be new opportunities for regional dialogue and solidarity across a vast yet connecting ocean. After a long wait, the past, present and future of the Pacific will come to life again in this unique and unifying event.\n\nBrian Diettrich does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive

Log in now to continue reading.\n\nThe 13th Festival of Pacific Arts &Culture, beginning Thursday, will feature a Festival Village of hale, or houses, at the Hawai'i Convention Center exhibition hall -- representing all 28 participating Pacific nations or territories and their cultures.\n\n\"Each country will receive their own hale to provide opportunities for cultural demonstrations and such,\" said festival Director Aaron Sala.\n\nThe Festival Village will be ready by today, and the 10-day festival will include more than 2,200 delegates, including artists, cultural practitioners, scholars and officials from participating nations. It will feature more than 50 programs and events, including conferences and symposiums, live performances, cultural workshops, hands-on demonstrations, films and storytelling.\n\nFestPAC officially commences Thursday, but a private Wa'a Arrival Ceremony will be held this morning at Kualoa Regional Park.\n\nWhile 28 delegations were initially slated to participate, New Caledonia and Vanuatu have withdrawn from the event. Sala said Pitcairn Island withdrew its participation just last week.\n\nTwenty-five representatives from each delegation will arrive at Kualoa Regional Park by canoe.\n\nAlthough New Caledonia and Vanuatu are not participating, their hale will still be on display, while Pitcairn Island's house will be repurposed for general cultural demonstrations.\n\nThe hale, each measuring 20 by 30 feet, are constructed using invasive albizia, macaranga and gunpowder trees, and designed by Architects Hawaii Ltd. and produced by the Albizia Project.\n\nThe state Department of Land and Natural Resources removed over 1,000 invasive trees from about 2 acres of land in Waimanalo, which have been used to construct the village. \"In the long run they will be repurposed and gifted to nonprofit organizations and schools for outdoor curriculum activities, etc.,\" Sala said.\n\nThe city's Department of Facility Maintenance, along with support from the Honolulu Police Department and the Department of Transportation Services, facilitated the creation of the Festival Village.\n\nThe city said in a statement that crews transported building materials for the hale from the Windward side to the Hawai'i Convention Center over two days.\n\n\"I am incredibly proud that the City and County of Honolulu is hosting the 13th annual Festival of Pacific Arts and Culture (FestPAC),\" Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi said in a statement. \"This event is a vibrant celebration of the rich cultural heritage and diversity of the Pacific Islands. It is an honor to welcome artists, performers, and visitors from across the region to share their traditions and stories with us. Together, we will create lasting memories and strengthen the bonds that unite our Pacific community.\"\n\nThe Festival Village it\u00ad\u00adself cost just under $3 million, primarily funded by Kamehameha Schools with $2.52 million and supplemented by $500,000 from the state.\n\nThe total FestPAC budget amounted to $20.39 million, with the majority of funding provided by the state, as it serves as the overall host of the festival.\n\n\"It's actually a living village,\" Sala said. \"This is absolutely an exhibition, but the goal of the Festival Village really is to create that village atmosphere.\"\n\nHe imagines that Cook Islanders will showcase their drumming, prompting a response from Solomon Islanders with their own cultural traditions, while Aotearoa desires to perform a haka in return.\n\n\"It's a very organic experience and really an opportunity to bring the Pacific together,\" Sala said.\n\nHe also said that there will be two immersive experiences One is a star compass that attendees can use to gaze upon the night sky; the other is an immersive experience, \"where you stand in the center or anywhere within the space itself and you sort of are able to take in the sights and sounds of Hawaii.\"\n\nFestPAC runs Thursday through June 16, and many of the events are free and open to the public. In addition to the convention center, events will take place at the University of Hawaii Manoa, Bishop Museum and throughout Waikiki.\n\nThe city warned residents to expect traffic congestion in many areas as hundreds of VIPs and dignitaries frequent FestPAC sites.\n\nFor more information and a full schedule, visit the FestPAC website, festpachawaii.org/festival-schedule.", "source": {"uri":

They raise their voices in song and affirm connections across the vast seaways of the Pacific.\n\nWatching and listening are delegates and visitors from many islands. All have come to learn, to represent and to connect. Scenes such as this will be a focus when the 13th Festival of Pacific Arts & Culture - known by many simply as FestPAC - kicks off on O'ahu in Hawai'i today.\n\nFor the next ten days, dancers and singers, carvers and creators, storytellers and orators, scholars and educators will celebrate, demonstrate and reflect on life and culture within the vast and complex Pacific region.\n\nWith 28 Pacific nations represented, this year marks the return of FestPAC after a long hiatus due to the COVID pandemic. The eight years since 2016's event in Gu\u00e5han (Guam) have been the longest absence since the festival's founding in 1972.\n\nPast and present together\n\nTaking place every four years (except for 2020), each event sees a different location and host culture within Oceania. Delegations from most Pacific countries and states come together for an intensive and wide-ranging exchange of art forms and cultural practices.\n\nPast festivals have focused on the endurance of ancestral traditions and legacies, in keeping with FestPAC's established goals, as well as emphasising the preservation and revival of Indigenous languages.\n\nBut there is also an increasing focus on contemporary culture. The festival is known for its eclectic range of art forms, practices and creativity, as well as providing a forum for political ideas about cultural ownership and identity.\n\nIndeed, the inaugural festival in 1972 was in part a response by the South Pacific Commission (now the Pacific Community) to concerns about cultural change in the region.\n\nDescribed as \"the world's largest celebration of Indigenous Pacific Islanders\", it was aimed at promoting exchange among Pacific communities and cultures.\n\nEach festival is organised around a theme. The first, in Fiji, was about \"preserving culture\".\n\nMore than entertainment\n\nThe sixth festival, in 1992 in Rarotonga, featured a \"seafaring heritage\" theme. The significance of ocean voyaging has continued to define the festival. A key opening protocol is the dawn arrival of voyaging canoes that have made the crossing from their homelands to the host country.\n\nAt the 2016 festival on Gu\u00e5han, navigators, voyagers, builders and scholars came together for a special canoe summit that examined and affirmed the remarkable voyaging traditions of the Pacific.\n\nOther festivals have had a focus on the survival of unique art forms and revitalisation of cultural practices. This year, the Aotearoa New Zealand delegation includes the Haumanu Collective, exponents of taonga p\u016boro, traditional M\u0101ori instruments.\n\nOverall, the 2024 festival is looking toward the future with the theme of \"Ho\u02bboulu L\u0101hui: Regenerating Oceania\". There's a varied programme of ceremonies and protocol, heritage arts, performing arts, visual arts and symposiums.\n\nBut the festival also encapsulates the idea that art and cultural practices are more than just entertainment or ways to communicate aspects of ancestral heritage. They are also vehicles for unification, historical awareness and political resistance.\n\nPolitical culture\n\nFestPAC delegations have a long history of engaging with current social and political issues, including climate change and decolonisation. Global politics and regional identity often feature in various forms and forums.\n\nDuring the 2004 festival on Palau, for example, host leaders invited an Indigenous delegation from Taiwan to take part as a means of emphasising the ancient Austronesian roots of the Pacific Islands. This took place against the backdrop of increasing competition for regional influence between the US and China.\n\nThe West Papuan independence struggle has also been communicated through song and performance. And this year's festival offers a stage for Kanaka Maoli (Indigenous Hawaiians) to express solidarity within their own struggles with colonialism and militarisation.\n\nSadly, New Caledonia has withdrawn from the festival due to violent unrest over political representation and independence in the French territory. Nevertheless, Kanak music and song remains a vital expression of resistance and protest.\n\nThe withdrawal comes as New Caledonia is set to host the next festival in 2028. It's a reminder of the enduring social and political struggles still happening in the region.\n\nBut as FestPAC makes a welcome return in Hawai'i this week, there will be new opportunities for regional dialogue and solidarity across a vast yet connecting ocean. After a long wait, the past, present and future of the Pacific will come to life again in this unique and unifying event.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Log in now to continue reading.\n\nA few thousand people showed up Wednesday morning at Kualoa Regional Park to attend the wa'a ceremony, kicking off the start of the 13th Festival of Pacific Arts and Culture, which officially begins today.\n\nState Sen. Jarrett Keohokalole, one of the nine FestPAC commissioners, represented Hawaii at the wa'a ceremony by arriving on the Hokule'a voyaging canoe.\n\nKeohokalole expressed that Hawaii hosting FestPAC is a \"tremendous honor.\"\n\n\"We've been eagerly awaiting everyone's arrival; it's been eight years in the making,\" he said. \"There's been a lot of anticipation and excitement.\"\n\n\"According to the moolelo (traditional stories), when you pass through Koolaupoko (the southeastern district of the windward coast of Oahu, from Kualoa in the north to Waimanalo in the south), you go to Mokapu or Moku kapu -- sacred island -- and present hookupu (a gift in exchange for spiritual energy) to elders at Puu Hawaiiloa (a cinder cone on the Mokapu Peninsula).\"\n\nThe wa'a were staged Tuesday night at Mokapu before being rowed out to Kualoa for the ceremony.\n\n\"There's a lot of protocol attached because we are welcoming our families from around the Pacific,\" Keohokalole said. \"We're happy that it's going well.\"\n\nDue to the shallow waters near the shore, the double-\u00adhulled voyaging canoe Hokule'a could not pull up directly to the shore. Instead, Keohokalole was transferred to a smaller escort canoe, which rowed him safely to land.\n\nThe Hokule'a was first launched on March 8, 1975, at the same spot where Keohokalole arrived for the wa'a ceremony Wednesday. It was built with the aim of reviving Hawaii's rich history and legacy of exploration and courage that brought the first Polynesians to the archipelago.\n\nSince the Hokule'a's inaugural voyage to Tahiti in 1976, it has sailed over 140,000 nautical miles across the Pacific, symbolizing a noteworthy journey of cultural rediscovery and connection.\n\nBilly Richards, a member of the original crew that sailed to Tahiti, attended FestPAC and witnessed the representation of Hawaii by the Hokule'a.\n\n\"Hokule'a did our first FestPAC in 1992 when it was held in Rarotonga, and we had asked why we weren't invited to the FestPACs before because it started in 1971,\" Richards said. \"It was because, they said, 'You're not Hawaiians, you're Americans.'\"\n\nAccording to Richards, before the Rarotonga trip, Nainoa Thompson -- Pwo Navigator and CEO of Polynesian Voyaging Society -- had talked with Cook Islanders about navigation. The Hokule'a then traveled to the Cook Islands to collaborate on building canoes, and together they sailed to Rarotonga for FestPAC.\n\n\"Since that time, canoes had been a big part of this festival,\" Richards said.\n\nThis year, the only two voyaging canoes that sailed from afar were the Fa'afaite from Tahiti and the Marumaru Atua from the Cook Islands.\n\n\"The wa'a ceremony is the spiritual beginning of FestPAC. There's so much love and connection in the air,\" Gov. Josh Green said. \"It's probably a once-in-\u00ada-generation opportunity -- it's an honor of a lifetime.\"\n\nDelegates from 25 different Pacific islands and territories came together, dressed in their uniforms or cultural costumes, to showcase their cultures and traditions. \"Ho'oulu Lahui: Regenerating Oceania,\" is the theme of the event, which runs through June 16.\n\nRapa Nui male delegates arrived wearing feather headdresses, decorated garments around their waists, showcasing tribal tattoos and body painting, and ornament necklaces around their necks. Tahitian male delegates arrived with only black cloth tied around their waists, while the female delegates wore cropped matching red FestPAC shirts and low-waisted black cloth skirts.\n\nHotu Iti Araki, a first-time FestPAC participant and first-time visitor to Hawaii as a Rapa Nui delegate, arrived Tuesday night after a journey from Rapa Nui to Hawaii that took about 50 hours.\n\n\"We are extremely excited,\" Araki said. \"We hope to do it with mana, share the mana so we can connect to our roots and our friends and our brothers and sisters across Polynesia and remember our tupuna (ancestors).\"\n\nRaumata Teuanui, a 22-year-old Pacific youth leader, was part of a group made up of over 100 people from all five archipelagos of French Polynesia.\n\n\"There's a lot of good energy here this morning, there's a lot of good mana,\" Teuanui said.\n\nTeuanui said that the French Polynesia delegates prepared Ori Tahiti -- which is a traditional Tahitian dance -- and Himene tarava and Himene ruau -- traditional singing -- specifically for the wa'a ceremony, along with arts and crafts exhibitions throughout the festival.\n\nWhile waiting for delegate representatives to arrive on shore with their respective wa'a, the Cook Islanders began singing and drumming by the shore.\n\nLed by partners Mark Short and Jane Rubena, the Cook Islands National Arts Theatre group -- which led the Cook Islands' performance -- consists of 46 dancers, singers and drummers who came to Hawaii to showcase their culture.\n\n\"I'm so privileged to lead this group,\" said Rubena, a CINAT choreographer. \"I have two daughters, 17 and 15, and an 11-year-old son who are performing as a part of this group.\"\n\nWhile most delegates came to showcase their culture, Taiwan delegates are attending FestPAC primarily to observe and learn.\n\nTaiwan delegates, comprising professors and students specializing in Austronesian Studies at National Taitung University, attended FestPAC as a field trip to deepen their understanding of the diverse cultures and traditions across the Pacific.\n\nYayoi Mitsuda, an assistant professor at National Taitung University, emphasized Taiwan's significance in Austronesian society, which is why her students are attending FestPAC as a school trip to conduct on-site research.\n\nOne of Mitsuda's graduate students, Ihsin Chen, said that although they are not performing like other delegates, they will be learning through immersing themselves in the experience.\n\nLily Wen, a 61-year-old Taiwanese Indigenous doctoral student, expressed excitement about learning more about other Pacific and Indigenous tribes at FestPAC.\n\n\"It gives me a strong sense of recognition to elevate my own culture,\" Wen said.\n\nOnly 2% of Taiwan's population identifies as Indigenous.\n\nWen is a member of the Rukai tribe, which is one of the 16 federally recognized Indigenous tribes in Taiwan, each with its unique traditions and language.\n\nThis year, Taiwan has a total of 68 delegates.\n\nHoromana Horo from Aotearoa (New Zealand) attended his first FestPAC in 2008, which was the 10th FestPAC hosted by Pago Pago, American Samoa.\n\nHe also participated in the 12th FestPAC held at Hagatna, Guam, in 2016. This year marks his third attendance.\n\nHoro said he's seen a lot of familiar faces at the wa'a ceremony.\n\nHoro's wife, Regan Balzer, called FestPAC a celebration \"to continue connecting the networks and build meaningful relationships across the Pacific.\"\n\nNgira Sinmonds, chief of staff to the Maori King, said that the \"royal family is pleased to be here and celebrate everything about our identity.\"\n\nWhile the king and queen of Aotearoa (New Zealand) did not attend the wa'a ceremony, Princess Te Puhi Ariki Ngawai Hono i te Po represented the royal family by attending and welcoming the representatives who arrived on canoe.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(literally dominated national and international categories at Cooks Dance of the Year comp her entire life till she 'retired' from the stage when her younger sister was old enough to compete.)\n\nShe is a part of the performing arts team who have spent the past year choreographing traditional dance performances for the festival.\n\nSpeaking to RNZ Pacific after their rehearsal on Tuesday, Mateariki says she is \"very excited, grateful and honoured to be here and represent my homeland.\"\n\n\"This is very important for my people, because we are here to promote and showcase our beautiful Cook Islands culture through dance.\"\n\nThe festival's grand opening is on Thursday 6 June Hawai'i time (7 June NZT).\n\nThousands are expected to attend and get their first taste of what to expect as the hundreds of delegates parade the Stan Sheriff Centre grounds for the official opening ceremony.\n\nThe Hawaii Convention Centre will be the main hive of activities in the two weeks to follow, with Pacific Village spaces spread out across the venue, offering a unique cultural experience for all.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indigenous peoples"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festival_of_Pacific_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Festival of Pacific Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islander", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Islander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_tradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oral tradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNZ_Pacific", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RNZ Pacific"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teariki_Mateariki", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teariki Mateariki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_knowledge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Traditional knowledge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_States_of_Micronesia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federated States of Micronesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federated States of Micronesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Time in New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Folk dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performing_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Performing arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cultural heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Islands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cook Islands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cook Islands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts and Events", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Festivals", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Conferences_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Conferences and Events", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Festivals", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Festivals", "wgt": 31}], "image": "https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--0OP10Z3Q--/t_tohu-badge-twitter/v1717623503/4KP0MK3_Cook_Islands_rehersals_png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628595", "eventUri": "eng-9628595", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 2603, "textEnd": 2609}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 2624, "textEnd": 2630}], "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

indigenous Pacific islanders kicks off this week", "body": "After an eight-year break due to the Covid pandemic, the world's largest Pacific festival is kicking off this week.\n\nHundreds of indigenous Pacific islanders are gathered in Hawai'i for the 13th Festival of Pacific Arts and Culture (FestPAC).\n\nThe event was established over 50 years ago in 1972, aimed at providing a space for indigenous people to come together and keep their traditional practises alive.\n\nUsually held every four years, the festival is a highly anticipated calendar event, showcasing high calibre dance performances, traditional arts and crafts, oral traditions and much, much more.\n\nTwenty-seven Pacific nations are involved in this year's cultural exchange, with a packed 10-day program promising to teleport festival-goers into the heart of each country, experiencing the sights, sounds, and flavours of the region.\n\nFestival director Dr Aaron Sala told RNZ Pacific the festival honours Pacific ancestors and recognises the valuable traditional knowledge held and passed on by community elders.\n\n\"Youth can sit at the feet of elders, to learn, to literally touch the hands of elders as they weave, to thus know the world that our ancestors lived in,\" he said.\n\n\"That is the power of the Festival of Pacific Arts and Culture.\"\n\nWith most pacific delegations coming with over 100 team members, there are a large number of young people who are attending and participating for the very first time.\n\nTravelling all the way from the Federated States of Micronesia is Christopher Sigrah.\n\n\"I'm so excited to be here, I'm looking forward to the performances, the arts, the carving,\" he said.\n\n\"For past festivals I've been watching them online, so being here in person this time means a lot.\"\n\nWith it being his first time alongside his peers, Sigrah said they are all hyped up to share their cultural heritage with the world.\n\nFlying the Cook Islands flag is Ambushia Mateariki, a famous champion dancer in the community.\n\nShe is a part of the performing arts team who have spent the past year choreographing traditional dance performances for the festival.\n\nSpeaking to RNZ Pacific after their rehearsal on Tuesday, Mateariki says she is \"very excited, grateful and honoured to be here and represent my homeland.\"\n\n\"This is very important for my people, because we are here to promote and showcase our beautiful Cook Islands culture through dance.\"\n\nThe festival's grand opening is on Thursday 6 June Hawai'i time (7 June NZT).\n\nThousands are expected to attend and get their first taste of what to expect as the hundreds of delegates parade the Stan Sheriff Centre grounds for the official opening ceremony.\n\nThe Hawaii Convention Centre will be the main hive of activities in the two weeks to follow, with Pacific Village spaces spread out across the venue, offering a unique cultural experience for all.",

We have begun to meet former prime ministers and people that are in parliament,\" stated Governor Josh Green. \"You can hear the prayers in the background over Wa'a, you can hear the music in the air.\"\n\nThe Wa'a ceremony initiated FestPAC with performances and spiritual teaching from across Oceania. Some delegations canoed directly from their home to Hawaii spending weeks on the ocean. A program schedule for the ten-day festival starting Thursday, June 6 to Sunday, June 16 can be found here.\n\n\"The canoes from the South Pacific islands decided that they were going to come. That feat is a huge feat. It's not easy, even for all the canoes that didn't come necessarily by sailing. They were shipped over,\" stated an ambassador for Ohana Wa'a.\n\nThe festival hosted on Oahu for the first time in its 52-year-long history only happens once every four years and in different countries.\n\n\"We're all connected, this ocean has always connected us. It's never separated us, as others might have thought, but it allowed us to stay as one family. So being together today, we get to celebrate that,\" said Master Navigator, Chadd Paishon.\n\nThe main showcase of FestPAC will be the Festival Village at the Hawaii Convention Center. Every delegation will have a dedicated hale to share their cultural practices and traditions.

I think it will be an eye-opener for our young people to see the different kinds of cultures that come from our sister countries and what they bring. I loved it.\"\n\nTimi Leopoldo, Tweetie Anderson, and 12-year-old Karter Smith are part of the local canoe club and paddled out to welcome the arriving wa'a.\n\n\"I cannot wait to pick up all the people who are voyaging,\" Ms Leopoldo said.\n\nKarter said he had been paddling for three to four years after he was inspired by his family to take it up.\n\nHe will be the youngest on the canoe, sitting on top.\n\n\"I will be blowing the conch,\" he said.\n\nLibby and Regan, both from the Aotearoa New Zealand delegation, said they hadn't had much sleep since arriving, but the beautiful morning on the shores of Kauloa made up for it.\n\n\"[I'm] really looking forward to the connections and interconnections between our people, to share narratives and to receive as well,\" Libby said.\n\n\"Having participated in different gatherings around the Pacific and around the world, you always take something special back home,\" Regan agreed.\n\n\"And we make a point of sharing it with our people, sharing it through our artwork, and so you're always growing and growing.\"\n\nHila'an San Nicolas is a traditional chamorro jeweller from Guam and said an event like FestPAC was important because \"we are all cousins\".\n\n\"I'm pretty sure back in ancient times we all traded with each other, and it's just since our westernisation that we've forgotten some of these ancient connections and I think FestPAC is a way to maintain that with each other,\" he said.\n\nFrancesca, from the village of Talo'fo'fo, is also part of the Guam delegation and is showcasing her contemporary and traditional clothing items.\n\nWhile Hila'an will showcase his work too, he's looking forward to connecting with other carvers.\n\n\"[Hopefully] they're willing to share some of their methods, their tips and what they've learnt through the years in carving their different materials.\"", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors":

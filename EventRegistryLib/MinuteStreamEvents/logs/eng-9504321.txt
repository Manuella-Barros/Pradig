Powered by Adobe's new Firefly Image 3 foundation model, these new tools are available now via the Photoshop beta desktop app and will be generally available later this year, according to an Adobe press release.\n\nThe most notable tool is Reference Image. It uses user-uploaded images as inspiration for output generated by Adobe AI and matches similar elements in style and color. Instead of repeatedly adjusting prompt descriptions, such as his blue vintage truck with flower decals, users can instead provide a reference image that Photoshop uses as a guide.\n\nEly Greenfield, Adobe's chief technology officer for digital media, told The Verge that prompts are a pain. He doesn't have to spend an hour creating a three-paragraph prompt if he has an image created of exactly what he wants to reference. The adage that a picture is worth a thousand words applies here as well.\n\nUploaded reference images guide the results produced by Photoshop AI and prevent users from adjusting text prompts too often.Image: Adobe\n\nUsers are expected to have the right to use the images they wish to reference. Greenfield told the Verge that the tool will flag this ownership requirement in a message the first time it is used, and that the company will also notify the Adobe Content Authenticity Initiative that the images will be used as a reference. He said that he is working on developing a universal training ban tag that will block. Images uploaded as reference materials are not used for Firefly training. Although the ownership responsibility rests with the user, Adobe says the new reference tool is safe for commercial use, which means Adobe says Firefly is safe for competing generative AI models. He claims to have one of the most notable advantages.\n\nAdditional generative AI tools available in the Photoshop beta app include background generation, which replaces background images such as product photos to create a new background, and detail enhancement, which sharpens images to make them appear sharper. .\n\nAdobe touts background generation as a tool to quickly add variety to product photos without the need for reshoots.Image: Adobe\n\n\"Generate Similarity\" is also available. This uses one of his three images generated by the Photoshops Firefly tool as a reference to create similar content. Generate Image, on the other hand, allows users to start with a blank page and generate the entire image from the text description on the first page. time.\n\nThe Firefly tool produces three outputs that you can choose from in Photoshop if you want to see a similar version. You can do that by simply generating something similar.Image: Adobe\n\nAdobe's 3rd generation Firefly model features higher quality image generation compared to previous generations and is also available in a public global beta that anyone can try outside of Photoshop through the Firefly web application. Adobe says his latest Firefly model has improved lighting, positioning, and attention to detail for unprecedented photorealistic quality.

You select a photo, area, or image object in Photoshop, and then in the text prompt area describe what you want to appear. I've used it to extend table tops to help fill out a 16:9 aspect-ratio image, and to add a metallic apple to this Getty Image (below).\n\nImage Model 3, however, will add much finer control and new image workflows to Firefly's generative arsenal. Among the key enhancements are:\n\nPerhaps most useful might be Firefly's ability to help virtually anyone fill a blank canvas with pro-level imagery.\n\nIn a demonstration I watched, Adobe executives started with a blank canvas and then described in a prompt the scene they wanted: a bear playing guitar by a campfire. What's new here, though, is how the enhanced generative tools include the ability to use reference images, set a content type, and add effects, all before generation begins.\n\nIt still takes about 20-25 seconds for a render to complete, but there are now more options; and the image detail, even when zoomed in, is far superior to what I've seen from Firefly Image 1 or 2 models.\n\nThe new reference image skills are especially powerful. With the bear, we selected its acoustic guitar, and from a series of reference guitar images chose an electric one and then had Firefly replace the original guitar. Firefly not only put the new guitar in place, but it properly lit it and adjusted the bear image so that its grip matched the fresh instrument.\n\nIt's also now just as easy to swap out a background for something new. We started with a bottle of pink perfume and then removed the background and asked Firefly to put it in pink water. The result was a dramatically lit bottle floating on a sea of pink water. Because the background is just an object, swapping it for snow or sand was also easy. I noticed how in each instance, the lighting and blend between the bottle and the new backgrounds were visually perfect.\n\nReference images mean that you can have an idea of how you want to replace a fill, surface, or object and use reference images to drive each of those iterations. Firefly just makes it all look natural and good.\n\nThe new Generate Similar looks like a great way to iterate on an initial image idea.\n\nAdobe's VP of Generative AI, Alexandru Costin, told me the new model is now better at understanding longer prompts and takes advantage of an improved style engine. The results are also more natural because Firefly Image 3 Model doesn't default to what might look most aesthetically pleasing, like producing all portraits in \"golden hour light.\"\n\nIt can use references to match styles, but also image structure and then build countless variations.\n\nFirefly Image 3 model will arrive first in Adobe Photoshop desktop beta and the Firefly web app in beta today (April 23, 2024).

The output will also include a wide range of colours, styles, backgrounds, subject poses and more. With Structure Reference, users can generate output similar to reference images. Using Style Reference, users can personalise the styles of the results.\n\n\"Firefly Image 3 has a better understanding of text prompts and scenes, enabling image generations that accurately reflect long, complex prompts and include richer details,\" Adobe said. Users can also try out the improved capabilities for generating icons, logos, raster images and other illustrations. The generative AI will be available in beta via the Firefly web app. Adobe offers paid and free plans with Generative Credits to use AI features in Adobe apps.\n\nFirefly is trained on the licensed content of services like Adobe Stock to generate output for commercial use. At Max London, the Creativity Conference of the company, new advancements for Photoshop in beta were also announced. While 'Reference Image' allows a user to imagine photos via user-selected content, the 'Text to Image with Generate Image' allows text-based image generation in Photoshop directly.\n\nAlso Read: Adobe Introduces Acrobat AI Assistant For $4.99, But Some Users Can Access It For Free; Check Features Here\n\n'Generate Background' (to replace and create backgrounds) and 'Generate Similar' (to explore variations of output) are among other features highlighted by Adobe.

Adobe has already gotten on the AI train with features like Photoshop Generative Fill, and today, at the Adobe MAX event in London, the company is upgrading the feature with the latest Adobe Firefly Image 3 foundation model, alongside introducing a new Generate Image feature.\n\nAdobe further mentions that Firefly was trained on licensed content, such as Adobe Stock, and public domain content. Consequently, Firefly is designed to generate content for commercial use that does not infringe on copyright and other IP rights. Adobe offers customers IP indemnification for Firefly-generated content.\n\nPhotoshop has had Generative Fill and Generative Expand features, but it could not create images from scratch from text prompts. That is changing today, as the latest Photoshop beta comes with a new Generate Image feature that, thanks to AI, allows for text-to-image generation.\n\nWhat sets this feature apart from the Generative Fill is that the image is created from scratch. You aren't working on an existing image as you did with Generative Fill or expanding on an existing image with Generative Expand.\n\nThe Generate Image feature is powered by the new Adobe Firefly Image 3 foundation model.\n\nGenerative Fill has been massively popular for Photoshop, quickly becoming one of its most used features. Compared to other features, Generative Fill in Photoshop saw ten times the adoption rate, and Adobe says it drove over 30% year-on-year increase in gross new Photoshop subscriptions.", "source": {"uri": "androidauthority.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Android Authority"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firefly (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adobe MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Creative_Cloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Creative Cloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "License"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public domain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Development_Frameworks", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Development Frameworks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop_Customization", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop Customization", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.androidauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Generate-Image_Circular-Neon-Portal-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504321", "eventUri": "eng-9504321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Firefly Image 3 will bring massive advancements to quality and control to users. This includes higher-quality image generations, better understanding of prompts, new levels of detail and variety and significant improvements that enable fast creative expression and ideation. Adobe's newest Firefly model delivers photorealistic quality like never before with better lighting, positioning, attention to detail, advancements to text display and more.\n\nAvailable today in the Firefly web application, users can access Firefly Image 3 in features including Structure Reference and Style Reference in the Text to Image module and a new Generative Expand feature in the Generative Fill module, which enables users to expand and change the aspect ratio of images.\n\n\"In just over a year, Firefly has become the image generation tool of choice used by millions of creators to ideate every day, and we're just getting started,\" said Ely Greenfield, chief technology officer, Digital Media at Adobe. \"As we continue to advance the state of the art with Image 3 Foundation Model, we cannot wait to see how our creative community will push the bounds of what's possible with this beta build.\"\n\nFirefly has been used to generate over 7 billion images worldwide since its initial debut in March 2023. Adobe built it for direct integration into workflows Adobe customers use every day, including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Express, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Substance 3D and now Adobe InDesign. In just one year, Firefly has transformed image editing, template creation, vector design and 3D texturing and staging for the better. With each new foundation model, Adobe releases the technology as a beta to its creative community to give feedback and advance the outputs.\n\nThe New Firefly Image 3 Foundation Model\n\nFirefly Image 3 equips users with the power of fast ideation and experimentation. It allows creators to bring their visions to life more easily, work more productively and generate higher-quality, more detailed images.\n\nFirefly Image 3 delivers:\n\nNew levels of creative expression with auto-stylization capabilities: Powered by a new style engine, new auto-stylization capabilities in Firefly Image 3 deliver higher quality outputs with more variety, giving users more control and personalization over the styles of images they generate. Image outputs include new varieties of styles, colors, backgrounds, subject poses and more, giving users a wide array of options for creative ideation and enabling faster exploration.Advancing creative control with Structure Reference and Style Reference: Firefly Image 3-powered Structure Reference and Style Reference capabilities deliver exceptional user control and state-of-the-art visual quality. With Structure Reference, users can quickly generate new images that match the structure of a reference image, eliminating the trial and error of having to write the perfect prompt. Style Reference then delivers higher quality outputs, giving users more control and personalization over the styles they generate. When these capabilities are combined, users can reference both the structure and style of an image to quickly bring their ideas to life.Stunning photographic quality: Firefly Image 3 delivers new levels of photographic quality with better lighting, positioning and more variety. Significant improvements can be seen in people rendering (with detailed features and a variety of moods and expressions), complex structures and crowds.Astonishingly rich detail and prompt accuracy: Firefly Image 3 has a better understanding of text prompts and scenes, enabling image generations that accurately reflect long, complex prompts and include richer details. Text renderings are also improved, resulting in image generations with clear text displays. This makes ideation for assets like posters more efficient.Broader range of styles for illustrations and icons: Firefly Image 3 makes significant improvements to illustrations in outputs to enable the quick creation of icons, logos, raster images and line art.\n\nFirefly Image 3 is available in beta. Users can access it via the Firefly web application at firefly.adobe.com. Adobe offers both free and paid plans that include an allocation of Generative Credits for the use of generative AI features powered by Firefly in Adobe applications.\n\nAdobe Firefly was trained on licensed content, such as Adobe Stock. It was designed to generate content for commercial use that does not infringe on copyright and other intellectual property (IP) right such as trademarks and logos. Adobe uses a multi-layered, continuous review and moderation approach to block and remove content that violates Adobe's policies and offers customers IP indemnification for Firefly generated content.\n\nAccelerating Content Creation and Production Across Enterprises\n\nAdobe recently introduced Adobe Firefly Services and Custom Models to fundamentally change how brands create and produce personalized content at scale. Firefly Services provide access to generative and creative APIs, tools and services for content generation, editing and assembly, which can be integrated into any production or workflow so organizations can maintain quality and control when automating the production of content at scale. In addition, Custom Models enable enterprises to train generative AI models based on their IP, product and brand styles to support brand consistency amongst creative and marketing teams.\n\nCommitment to Responsible Innovation\n\nAdobe is committed to developing AI in accordance with the company's AI Ethics principles of accountability, responsibility, and transparency. In a recent Adobe study, 76% of U.S. consumers emphasized the importance of knowing if online content is AI-generated. To provide transparency around the use of AI, Content Credentials are automatically attached to Firefly generated content. Like a nutrition label for digital content, Content Credentials are tamper-evident metadata that can provide more information about the digital content, including whether AI was used in the creation or editing process.\n\nContent Credentials are built on the C2PA open standard and supported by the Adobe-led Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), which was founded in 2019 to increase trust in the digital ecosystem. Today, the CAI has grown into a global coalition of over 2,500 members across tech, policy, media companies, creative professionals, researchers and more, all working together to add transparency to digital content.\n\nAdobe MAX\n\nAdobe MAX London (April 23, 2024) brings together diverse and vibrant creative communities from around the world for a uniquely immersive and engaging experience, showcasing the latest Adobe products, features and innovations.

Just type a few words describing what you want to see into Dall-E, Midjourney, or any of the many AI-powered image creation websites and up pops surprisingly high-quality representations of your visual request.\n\nBut as intriguing as these individual sites may be for explorations and experiments, when you need an image for a document, project, or social media post, though, you'll typically want to create it in a software application focused on imaging. Adobe has built these kinds of applications for decades now, and its Photoshop has long been considered the king of photo and image editing tools. In fact, \"photoshopping\" an image is a term used almost as widely as \"googling\" an internet search request.\n\nLast year, Adobe brought generative AI (GenAI) capabilities into Photoshop via its Firefly image-focused foundation model -- a type of algorithm used in all GenAI applications. The initial implementation allowed you to extend the size of an existing image with new material that matched what was in the original image through features called Generative Fill and Generative Expand. Though not as flashy as text-based image generation, the features proved to be extremely popular with, and useful for, Photoshop users, according to Adobe.\n\nThis year, leveraging version 3 of the Firefly model, Adobe is greatly expanding the range and quality of those applications within Photoshop. First is Generate Image, which, as its name suggests, brings the full potential of text-based image creation into Photoshop. What makes it even more interesting, however, is the addition of something called Reference Image.\n\nBuilding on the new Reference Style and Reference Structure capabilities of Firefly Image 3, you can have Photoshop create your image in a manner that adopts the style and/or overall structure of an image that you supply it with. For example, if you see an image of a person posing in a certain way with a particular type of lighting, you can have the latest version of Photoshop generate a new image that looks and feels like the reference image.\n\nIn addition, new capabilities such as Generate Similar or Generate Background allow you to easily customize a given image - either one created by Photoshop or a photo of your own. The net result is a significantly faster and much easier way to generate the kind of image, illustration, or other graphical element that you're trying to create. Plus, the combination of a new Enhance Detail feature, along with generally refined image generation skills, can lead to almost scarily impressive results with little effort.\n\nAdmittedly, some photo professionals have been concerned for years about the level of image manipulation that Photoshop has enabled, and these new capabilities bring that to a whole other level. For most people, however, these new features should turn Photoshop from what was traditionally a powerful, but challenging, tool into something that almost anybody can use to create amazing images. There's little doubt that even professional photographers will embrace some of the advanced editing features that this newest version of Photoshop enables.\n\nMeta AI: What does Meta AI do? The latest upgrade creates images as you type and more.\n\nDespite these benefits, even non-photographers have been concerned about the potential manipulation of image creation software for nefarious purposes, particularly in the era of \"deep fakes.\" To address these and other critical issues, Adobe has taken a strong stand on ethics and fair use, and it has approached the creation of its AI models in a unique and open way.\n\nFirst, the Firefly model was trained on images from the company's own Adobe Stock (ITS stock image and video service). This means that the raw data initially fed into Firefly in order for it to \"learn\" the characteristics and patterns of images as they relate to text -- the basic essence of how all generative AI models work -- comes from Adobe's own content.\n\nThe company carefully controls and monitors what images go into Adobe Stock and has strict rules about what can and can't be included. Specifically, the company filters for inappropriate material as well as copyrighted images, trademarks, photos of people without model release forms, etc. Because of this approach, Adobe guarantees that images created by its tools can be freely used without concerns. In addition, for businesses, Adobe provides indemnification. This means that a company using Adobe's software can't be sued for using one of the images the software generates -- a huge issue that many organizations have been concerned about for all GenAI applications.\n\nIn addition, as a founding member of the Content Authenticity Initiative, Adobe also makes a point to tag any image it generates with Content Credentials, signifying that it was created by a GenAI tool. While not visible, this metadata ensures that anyone opening or using the image can see how it was generated.\n\nIf you're curious to try out the new Photoshop beta, Adobe is offering a free 7-day trial. Monthly subscriptions start at $19.99. You can try Firefly 3 if you sign up for an Adobe account. Adobe also recently announced that it will be adding GenAI capabilities to its Premiere Pro video editing software later this year.\n\nThe world of GenAI-powered applications and services has already opened up some exciting and, frankly, pretty amazing new capabilities. These new image creation/editing tools from Adobe add to that arsenal and offer an intriguing and appealing view of where the technology is headed.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midjourney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midjourney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_editing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Image editing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Application software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Creative_Cloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Creative Cloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_editing_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video editing software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metadata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fair use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Premiere_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Premiere Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer monitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Methods_and_Techniques", "label": "dmoz/Science/Methods and Techniques", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Imaging", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Imaging", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Methods_and_Techniques/Imaging_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Methods and Techniques/Imaging Science", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/04/23/USAT/73430636007-generate-image-circular-neon-portal.jpg?auto=webp&crop=3839,2159,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504321", "eventUri": "eng-9504321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

By providing a reference image, users can guide Photoshop's AI to match similar elements in style and color, eliminating the need for complex prompt descriptions. This feature streamlines the design process, allowing users to quickly achieve their desired outcomes with minimal effort.\n\nEly Greenfield, chief technology officer for Digital Media at Adobe, emphasized the practicality of the Reference Image tool, stating, \"Prompting is a pain in the butt... Why spend an hour trying to craft a three-paragraph prompt if you have an image that you've created that's exactly the thing you want to reference?\"\n\nTo ensure ethical usage, Adobe requires users to have the rights to the images they upload as reference materials. Additionally, the company is developing a universal \"do not train\" tag as part of its Content Authenticity Initiative to prevent unauthorized images from being used as references. Despite placing ownership responsibility on users, Adobe assures that the referencing tool is safe for commercial use, distinguishing it from rival generative AI models.\n\nIn addition to the Reference Image tool, the Photoshop beta app introduces several other generative AI tools. Generate Background enables users to replace and create new background images, making it ideal for tasks like product photography. Enhance Detail enhances image clarity and sharpness, while Generate Similar produces content similar to a reference image generated by Photoshop's Firefly tools. Notably, Generate Image allows users to generate entire images from text descriptions, marking a significant advancement in AI-assisted design.\n\nBeyond generative AI, Adobe is enhancing Photoshop with new standard tools aimed at streamlining creative workflows. The Adjustment Brush enables non-destructive changes, such as color adjustments, to specific image sections. Adjustment Presets provide quick image transformations using filters, while the improved Font Browser grants real-time access to over 25,000 fonts in Adobe's cloud directly within the Photoshop application.\n\nFurthermore, Adobe is making its third-generation Firefly model available to the public through the Firefly web application, offering high-quality image generation capabilities with improved lighting, positioning, and attention to detail. The latest Firefly model excels at understanding descriptive text prompts and produces images with photorealistic quality.\n\nIn summary, Adobe's latest update to Photoshop represents a significant leap forward in AI-driven design capabilities. By leveraging the power of the Firefly model, Adobe is empowering users to create stunning visuals with unprecedented ease and efficiency.

Version 3 of the platform is significantly improved over previous iterations and promises to be able to make photorealistic images with greater variety.\n\nAfter being used to generate over seven billion images over the last year (it passed a billion in its first few months), Adobe Firefly is taking a big step forward with Version 3 which enters beta today. These updates, which are available in the Firefly web application, promise massive advancement to quality and control including higher-quality image generations, better understanding of prompts, and enhanced detail and variety.\n\nBelow, Adobe shows that the same prompt can provide a range of results when specific details are absent from the text, such as varied race or ethnicity.\n\nThe use of the term \"photorealistic\" does not appear to be an over-promise either, as generations have better and more believable lighting, positioning, detail, and the ability to display text. Until now, Firefly lagged behind its contemporaries when it came to generating images that looked like photos (or any image type at all, really). That doesn't appear to be the case any longer.\n\nAdobe promises that Version 3 of Firefly is not only vastly improved in the quality of what it can produce but does so faster than before, too. Not only that, Firefly supposedly understands text prompts even better than before, which Adobe says allows it to create image generations that can accurately reflect long, complex prompts and include more details.\n\nFirefly 3 brings what Adobe is calling a new style engine which allows it to deliver higher quality outputs with more variety. Outputs have a more diverse set of colors, backgrounds, and subject poses which makes them more useful across a wider range of applications.\n\nThe update adds two new features: Structure Reference and Style Reference. Structure Reference allows users to generate new images that match the general structure of a reference image, which Adobe says will eliminate the trial and error associated with writing prompts.\n\nStyle Reference is what Adobe is calling Firefly's ability to generate higher quality output, giving users more control and the ability to personalize the generations. These tools can be combined, too.\n\nText, which is as difficult for generative AI to produce as hands, is also improved. Adobe promises that Firefly Version 3 can make images with clear text that actually makes sense. Similarly, the platform is much better at icons, logos, raster images, and line art.

The Generative Fill inpainting function in particular benefits from the new features.\n\nPreviously based on the significantly inferior first-generation Firefly, Firefly 3 bypasses Firefly 2 and delivers much higher-quality results.\n\nAccording to Adobe, Firefly Image 3 promises more creative control, new auto-stylization capabilities, Structure Reference and Style Reference, improved photographic quality and prompt accuracy, and a wider range of styles for illustrations and symbols.\n\nAccording to Adobe, the model also offers significant improvements in generation speed, making the ideation and design process more productive and efficient.\n\nFirefly Image 3 also brings new features to the beta version of Photoshop. Images can now be created directly in the desktop application without having to go through the website. In addition, Photoshop not only uses the new model for text-to-image, Generative Fill and Generative Expand, but can also be better controlled using reference images.\n\nWith Firefly 3, you can also create backgrounds or variations of image content at the touch of a button. The update also includes features such as Enhance Detail, which automatically adjusts sharpness and clarity, and non-destructive adjustments with presets and brushes.\n\nThe new features are available today in a beta version of the Photoshop desktop application and will be included in a stable release later this year.\n\nAdobe introduced its first Firefly model only about a year ago, followed by a major update in October with Firefly 2. The big difference to the competition from Midjourney, SDXL, Ideogram, and DALL-E 3 is the origin of the training data: Adobe is one of the few vendors to claim that it can produce legally flawless images because the model is trained only on licensed material from its own stock database.\n\nRecently, however, it was revealed that Adobe Stock now also contains images generated by Midjourney, which presumably ended up in Firefly's training material. Whether this will be the case with Firefly 3 is unclear.

These new features empower everyone to generate infinite background variations, create a multitude of design concepts with differentiated color and style and bring to life detailed scenes from scratch with complete control.\n\n\"This massive new update to Photoshop takes creativity to unprecedented levels - whether you are a professional or brand new to Photoshop,\" said Ashley Still, senior vice president, Creative Product Group at Adobe. \"Through new Firefly-powered features in Photoshop, we are bringing ideation and creation closer together and making editing images both more powerful and approachable so everyone can realize their creative vision.\"\n\nTransforming Ideation to Creation with New Levels of Creative Control\n\nPhotoshop's new innovations further enhance and accelerate creative workflows, empowering users to make complex edits and create unique designs while saving time. By bringing ideation and creation together in one workflow, they deliver new levels of control and help everyone bring their creative vision to life at the speed of imagination:\n\nPhotoshop is introducing additional valuable tools for design and creation:\n\nAdobe has over a decade-long history of AI innovation, delivering hundreds of intelligent capabilities that hundreds of millions of people in the creative community rely upon in their workflows every day. Last May, Photoshop's Generative Fill and Generative Expand unlocked a new era for Creative Cloud, resulting in an unprecedented community response: Users have already generated over 7 billion images with Firefly since launch, and have adopted Generative Fill at 10X the rate of other popular Photoshop features. Thanks to the breakthrough Firefly Image 3 Model, the latest version of Photoshop produces even more lifelike and realistic imagery with the Generative Fill and Generative Expand tools.\n\nAdobe Firefly was trained on licensed content, such as Adobe Stock. It was designed to generate content for commercial use that does not infringe on copyright and other intellectual property (IP) right such as trademarks and logos. Adobe uses a multi-layered, continuous review and moderation approach to block and remove content that violates Adobe's policies and offers customers IP indemnification for Firefly generated content.\n\nCommitment to Responsible Innovation\n\nAdobe is committed to developing AI in accordance with the company's AI Ethics principles of accountability, responsibility, and transparency. In a recent Adobe study, 76% of U.S. consumers emphasized the importance of knowing if online content is AI-generated. To provide transparency around the use of AI within Adobe's applications, Firefly-powered features in Photoshop will automatically attach Content Credentials to the content. Like a nutrition label for digital content, Content Credentials are tamper-evident metadata that can provide more information about the content, including whether AI was used in the creation or editing process.\n\nContent Credentials are built on the C2PA open standard and supported by the Adobe-led Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), which was founded in 2019 to increase trust in the digital ecosystem. Today, the CAI has grown into a global coalition of over 2,500 members across tech, policy, media companies, creative professionals, researchers and more, all working together to add transparency to digital content.\n\nCommunity Inspiration\n\nConnect with your favorite designers and Creative Cloud evangelists as they live stream their Photoshop and Firefly tips and tricks on 23 April from 4 am and 2 pm PT as they answer questions.\n\nAvailability\n\nPhotoshop's latest release is available today in the Photoshop desktop (beta) app and will be generally available later this year.\n\nAdobe MAX\n\nAdobe MAX London (April 23, 2024) brings together diverse and vibrant creative communities from around the world for a uniquely immersive and engaging experience, showcasing the latest Adobe products, features and innovations.

Adobe has built these kinds of applications for decades now, and its Photoshop has long been considered the king of photo and image editing tools. In fact, \"photoshopping\" an image is a term used almost as widely as \"googling\" an internet search request.\n\nLast year, Adobe brought generative AI (GenAI) capabilities into Photoshop via its Firefly image-focused foundation model -- a type of algorithm used in all GenAI applications. The initial implementation allowed you to extend the size of an existing image with new material that matched what was in the original image through features called Generative Fill and Generative Expand. Though not as flashy as text-based image generation, the features proved to be extremely popular with, and useful for, Photoshop users, according to Adobe.\n\nThis year, leveraging version 3 of the Firefly model, Adobe is greatly expanding the range and quality of those applications within Photoshop. First is Generate Image, which, as its name suggests, brings the full potential of text-based image creation into Photoshop. What makes it even more interesting, however, is the addition of something called Reference Image.\n\nBuilding on the new Reference Style and Reference Structure capabilities of Firefly Image 3, you can have Photoshop create your image in a manner that adopts the style and/or overall structure of an image that you supply it with. For example, if you see an image of a person posing in a certain way with a particular type of lighting, you can have the latest version of Photoshop generate a new image that looks and feels like the reference image.\n\nIn addition, new capabilities such as Generate Similar or Generate Background allow you to easily customize a given image - either one created by Photoshop or a photo of your own. The net result is a significantly faster and much easier way to generate the kind of image, illustration, or other graphical element that you're trying to create. Plus, the combination of a new Enhance Detail feature, along with generally refined image generation skills, can lead to almost scarily impressive results with little effort.\n\nAdmittedly, some photo professionals have been concerned for years about the level of image manipulation that Photoshop has enabled, and these new capabilities bring that to a whole other level. For most people, however, these new features should turn Photoshop from what was traditionally a powerful, but challenging, tool into something that almost anybody can use to create amazing images. There's little doubt that even professional photographers will embrace some of the advanced editing features that this newest version of Photoshop enables.\n\nMeta AI: What does Meta AI do? The latest upgrade creates images as you type and more.\n\nDespite these benefits, even non-photographers have been concerned about the potential manipulation of image creation software for nefarious purposes, particularly in the era of \"deep fakes.\" To address these and other critical issues, Adobe has taken a strong stand on ethics and fair use, and it has approached the creation of its AI models in a unique and open way.\n\nFirst, the Firefly model was trained on images from the company's own Adobe Stock (ITS stock image and video service). This means that the raw data initially fed into Firefly in order for it to \"learn\" the characteristics and patterns of images as they relate to text -- the basic essence of how all generative AI models work -- comes from Adobe's own content.\n\nThe company carefully controls and monitors what images go into Adobe Stock and has strict rules about what can and can't be included. Specifically, the company filters for inappropriate material as well as copyrighted images, trademarks, photos of people without model release forms, etc. Because of this approach, Adobe guarantees that images created by its tools can be freely used without concerns. In addition, for businesses, Adobe provides indemnification. This means that a company using Adobe's software can't be sued for using one of the images the software generates -- a huge issue that many organizations have been concerned about for all GenAI applications.\n\nIn addition, as a founding member of the Content Authenticity Initiative, Adobe also makes a point to tag any image it generates with Content Credentials, signifying that it was created by a GenAI tool. While not visible, this metadata ensures that anyone opening or using the image can see how it was generated.\n\nIf you're curious to try out the new Photoshop beta, Adobe is offering a free 7-day trial. Monthly subscriptions start at $19.99. You can try Firefly 3 if you sign up for an Adobe account. Adobe also recently announced that it will be adding GenAI capabilities to its Premiere Pro video editing software later this year.\n\nThe world of GenAI-powered applications and services has already opened up some exciting and, frankly, pretty amazing new capabilities. These new image creation/editing tools from Adobe add to that arsenal and offer an intriguing and appealing view of where the technology is headed.\n\nUSA TODAY columnist Bob O'Donnell is the president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research, a market research and consulting firm.

Thanks to the breakthrough Firefly Image 3 Model, the latest version of Photoshop produces even more lifelike and realistic imagery with the Generative Fill and Generative Expand tools.\n\nAdobe Firefly was trained on licensed content, such as Adobe Stock. It was designed to generate content for commercial use that does not infringe on copyright and other intellectual property (IP) right such as trademarks and logos. Adobe uses a multi-layered, continuous review and moderation approach to block and remove content that violates Adobe's policies and offers customers IP indemnification for Firefly generated content.\n\nCommitment to Responsible Innovation\n\nAdobe is committed to developing AI in accordance with the company's AI Ethics principles of accountability, responsibility, and transparency. In a recent Adobe study, 76% of U.S. consumers emphasized the importance of knowing if online content is AI-generated. To provide transparency around the use of AI within Adobe's applications, Firefly-powered features in Photoshop will automatically attach Content Credentials to the content. Like a nutrition label for digital content, Content Credentials are tamper-evident metadata that can provide more information about the content, including whether AI was used in the creation or editing process.\n\nContent Credentials are built on the C2PA open standard and supported by the Adobe-led Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), which was founded in 2019 to increase trust in the digital ecosystem. Today, the CAI has grown into a global coalition of over 2,500 members across tech, policy, media companies, creative professionals, researchers and more, all working together to add transparency to digital content.\n\nCommunity Inspiration\n\nConnect with your favorite designers and Creative Cloud evangelists as they live stream their Photoshop and Firefly tips and tricks on 23 April from 4 am and 2 pm PT as they answer questions.\n\nAvailability\n\nPhotoshop's latest release is available today in the Photoshop desktop (beta) app and will be generally available later this year.\n\nAdobe MAX\n\nAdobe MAX London (April 23, 2024) brings together diverse and vibrant creative communities from around the world for a uniquely immersive and engaging experience, showcasing the latest Adobe products, features and innovations.

By creating images from text prompts, these rivals challenge Adobe's dominance in picture and video editing tools used by creative professionals.\n\nAdobe developed Firefly, an image-generation AI system, in response to competition. Adobe-owned data serves as the training data for this technology, aiming to minimize accusations of copyright infringement against users.\n\nAdobe announced comprehensive picture production capabilities at a London conference on Tuesday, building on Photoshop's image-filling and enlargement features. According to CNA, this feature will be powered by Firefly Image 3 coming later this year.\n\nAdobe's new image-generation tool will generate an image's composition using a user's submitted image, demonstrating its commitment to improving professionals' productivity. The tech firm claims exceptional \"photorealistic quality\" with better lighting, placement, and detail in the new Firefly model. This advances picture-generating technologies significantly, per The Verge.\n\nFirefly Image 3 gets better at comprehending long, detailed text cues. It also produces crisper lettering in photos than the previous Firefly model.\n\nRead Also: The Future of Submarine Warfare? Chinese Laser Tech Could Propel Subs at Unprecedented Rates\n\nAdobe hopes these updates will boost consumers' creativity and image quality. The global beta release allows anyone worldwide to use Firefly Image 3 outside of Photoshop.\n\nAdobe Chief Technology Officer for Digital Media, Ely Greenfield, said, \"Borrowing from the reference saves me from having to carefully describe what goes where and make sure I'm specifying what I want and don't. So this is quite strong.\"\n\nAdobe said on Tuesday that a test \"beta\" version of the new Firefly is available to select users but did not indicate a public release date.\n\nThe core models of generative AI, according to artists, authors, and creative professionals, are trained on copyrighted media without authorization or payment. In response, generative AI businesses are in legal conflict with many artists and authors.\n\nAdobe asserts that it trained Firefly, its latest AI project, on commercially designed Adobe Stock imagery, setting it apart from its competitors, as reported by Engadget. This sets it apart from Midjourney, whose models purportedly use internet-scraped images. A spokesperson of the firm confirmed that Firefly used AI-generated photos from competitors like Midjourney, but only less than 5% of its training data.\n\nAdobe proactively addressed concerns about the use of generative AI to spread misinformation. Photoshop generates tamper-proof \"Content Credentials\" in metadata for every generative AI-generated picture. This labeling system, akin to digital \"nutrition labels,\" signifies the AI-generated nature of the image.\n\nDespite the program's efforts to enhance transparency, content exploitation remains possible due to the circumvention of metadata and watermarks.\n\nThese new Photoshop capabilities, which improve AI-generated content transparency and accountability, will be available in beta today and fully rolled out later this year.

By bringing ideation and creation together in one workflow, they deliver new levels of control and help everyone bring their creative vision to life at the speed of imagination:\n\nPhotoshop is introducing additional valuable tools for design and creation:\n\nAdobe has over a decade-long history of AI innovation, delivering hundreds of intelligent capabilities that hundreds of millions of people in the creative community rely upon in their workflows every day. Last May, Photoshop's Generative Fill and Generative Expand unlocked a new era for Creative Cloud, resulting in an unprecedented community response: Users have already generated over 7 billion images with Firefly since launch, and have adopted Generative Fill at 10X the rate of other popular Photoshop features. Thanks to the breakthrough Firefly Image 3 Model, the latest version of Photoshop produces even more lifelike and realistic imagery with the Generative Fill and Generative Expand tools.\n\nAdobe Firefly was trained on licensed content, such as Adobe Stock. It was designed to generate content for commercial use that does not infringe on copyright and other intellectual property (IP) right such as trademarks and logos. Adobe uses a multi-layered, continuous review and moderation approach to block and remove content that violates Adobe's policies and offers customers IP indemnification for Firefly generated content.\n\nMarketing Technology News: MarTech Interview with Frank Paterno, SVP of Marketing at GlobalMeet\n\nCommitment to Responsible Innovation\n\nAdobe is committed to developing AI in accordance with the company's AI Ethics principles of accountability, responsibility, and transparency. In a recent Adobe study, 76% of U.S. consumers emphasized the importance of knowing if online content is AI-generated. To provide transparency around the use of AI within Adobe's applications, Firefly-powered features in Photoshop will automatically attach Content Credentials to the content. Like a nutrition label for digital content, Content Credentials are tamper-evident metadata that can provide more information about the content, including whether AI was used in the creation or editing process.\n\nContent Credentials are built on the C2PA open standard and supported by the Adobe-led Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI), which was founded in 2019 to increase trust in the digital ecosystem. Today, the CAI has grown into a global coalition of over 2,500 members across tech, policy, media companies, creative professionals, researchers and more, all working together to add transparency to digital content.", "source": {"uri": "martechseries.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MarTech Series"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideation_(creative_process)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ideation (creative process)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firefly (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_editing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Image editing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web application"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Creative_Cloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Creative Cloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metadata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open standard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Development_Frameworks", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Development Frameworks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Presentation", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Presentation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://martechseries.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Adobe-Announces-Generative-AI-Solutions-to-Jumpstart-Content-Supply-Chain-for-Enterprises.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504321", "eventUri": "eng-9504321", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5921568627450979, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

On Tuesday, the company announced that Photoshop is getting the ability to generate images with simple text prompts directly within the app. There are also new features to let the AI draw inspiration from reference images to create new ones and generate backgrounds more easily. The tools will make using Photoshop easier for both professionals as well as casual enthusiasts who may have found the app's learning curve to be steep, Adobe thinks.\n\n\"A big, blank canvas can sometimes be the biggest barrier,\" Erin Boyce, Photoshop's senior marketing director, told Engadget in an interview. \"This really speeds up time to creation. The idea of getting something from your mind to the canvas has never been easier.\" The new feature is simply called \"Generate Image\" and will be available as an option in Photoshop right alongside the traditional option that lets you import images into the app.\n\nAn existing AI-powered feature called Generative Fill that previously let you add, extend or remove specific parts of an image has been upgraded too. It now allows users to add AI-generated images to an existing image that blend in seamlessly with the original. In a demo shown to Engadget, an Adobe executive was able to circle a picture of an empty salad dish, for instance, and ask Photoshop to fill it with a picture of AI-generated tomatoes. She was also able to generate variations of the tomatoes and choose one of them to be part of the final image. In another example, the executive replaced an acoustic guitar held by an AI-generated bear with multiple versions of electric guitars just by using text prompts, and without resorting to Photoshop's complex tools or brushes.\n\nThese updates are powered by Firefly Image 3, the latest version of Adobe's family of generative AI models that the company also unveiled today. Adobe said Firefly 3 produces images of a higher quality than previous models, provides more variations, and understands your prompts better. The company claims that more than 7 billion images have been generated so far using Firefly.\n\nAdobe is far from the only company stuffing generative AI features into its products. Over the last year, companies, big and small, have revamped up their products and services with AI. Both Google and Microsoft, for instance, have upgraded their cash cows, Search and Office respectively, with AI features. More recently, Meta has started putting its own AI chatbot into Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram. But while it's still unclear how these bets will pan out, Adobe's updates to Photoshop seem more materially useful for creators. The company said Photoshop's new AI features had driven a 30 percent increase in Photoshop subscriptions.\n\nMeanwhile, generative AI has been in the crosshairs of artists, authors, and other creative professionals, who say that the foundational models that power the tech were trained on copyrighted media without consent or compensation. Generative AI companies are currently battling lawsuits from dozens of artists and authors. Adobe says that Firefly was trained on licensed media from Adobe Stock, since it was designed to create content for commercial use, unlike competitors like Midjourney whose models are trained in part by illegally scraping images off the internet. But a recent report from Bloomberg showed that Firefly, too, was trained, in part, on AI-generated images from the same rivals including Midjourney (an Adobe spokesperson told Bloomberg that less than 5 percent of images in its training data came from other AI rivals).\n\nTo address concerns about the use of generative AI to create disinformation, Adobe said that all images created in Photoshop using generative AI tools will automatically include tamper-proof \"Content Credentials\", which act like digital \"nutrition labels\" indicating that an image was generated with AI, in the file's metadata. However, it's still not a perfect defense against image misuse, with several ways to sidestep metadata and watermarks.\n\nThe new features will be available in beta in Photoshop starting today and will roll out to everyone later this year. Meanwhile, you can play with Firefly 3 on Adobe's website for free.", "source": {"uri": "engadget.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "engadget"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Firefly (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engadget", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Engadget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_marketing_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief marketing officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tomato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acoustics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demo_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demo (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midjourney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midjourney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Creative_Cloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Creative Cloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metadata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Watermark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Development_Frameworks", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Development Frameworks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop_Customization", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop Customization", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Presentation", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Presentation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rBsIOxTgrrRvl6Va.y8sQw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/e4778fb0-0135-11ef-bfef-ea7abf08d2c1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504321", "eventUri": "eng-9504321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Users can augment the feature using a reference image, promising more realistic and accurate results with enhanced control.\n\nGenerative AI technology goes far beyond Generative Fill. Much like Adobe Firefly enables users to create something from scratch, turning a blank page into a rich canvas, Photoshop's new Generate Image offers the same option. Adobe's new Firefly Image 3 Foundation Model is now available natively within Photoshop, where it powers Generative Fill, Generative Expand, and, of course, Generate Image.\n\nPhotographers can use a reference image when using Generative Fill, and they can also use a reference image for Generate Image and Generative Expand. In a similar spirit, the new Generate Similar feature enables creators to iterate AI-created content using selected variants.\n\nAI-powered tools go beyond outright content creation. Much like Adobe recently implemented new-and-improved noise reduction in Photoshop, Adobe Camera Raw, and Lightroom, the company is also putting an AI spin on sharpness with Enhance Detail. The new feature promises to improve the apparent crispness of images through tweaks to sharpness and clarity.\n\nThere are also new tools that AI doesn't power. In the new Photoshop beta, Adobe is adding an Adjustment Brush that enables users to apply non-destructive adjustments to specific areas of an image, similar to tools already available in Lightroom and Adobe Camera Raw.\n\nAnother Lightroom-inspired feature is Adjustment Presets. These allow creators to quickly change the appearance of images inside Photoshop with one-click filters. Users can tweak these filters and save changes as new presets as well.\n\nAdobe is also implementing an improved font browser, with real-time access to Adobe's 25,000-plus fonts in the cloud.\n\n\"This massive new update to Photoshop takes creativity to unprecedented levels -- whether you are a professional or brand new to Photoshop,\" says Ashley Still, senior president of the Creative Product Group at Adobe. \"Through new Firefly-powered features in Photoshop, we are bringing ideation and creation closer together and making images both more powerful and approachable so everyone can realize their creative vision.\"\n\nSince Adobe introduced Generative Fill and Generative Expand to Photoshop last May and July, users have adopted the former at a 10 times greater rate than the average new Photoshop feature.

The latest beta version of Photoshop includes the new Firefly Image 3 foundation model, which Adobe says will produce higher-quality images and backgrounds compared with the previous version. You can take a peek at the beta now if you want to live dangerously, but you still need to have an active Photoshop license if you want to experiment for more than a week.\n\nFor starters, Adobe says the updated model is better at understanding prompts. That means the results from your pie-in-the-sky ramblings will look more like what you imagine. Details are sharper, there are fewer classic AI slip-ups, and lighting is more realistic. Image 3 can also understand longer prompts, so you can really zero in on a particular style. If the batch of three generated images isn't quite right, you create a riff on one of the images with the new Generate Similar option.\n\nIf you don't fancy typing long prompts to get Firefly to produce just the right image, Adobe has you covered. Image 3 supports a new feature called Reference Image. When generating a new object or modifying an existing one, you can provide an image for Photoshop to use as a guide instead of typing another prompt.\n\nAdobe expects you to have the rights to the images you add to Reference Image, but thankfully, it's not going to give you a hard time about it. There will be a warning when you first use the feature, but that's it. Knowing people are going to break that rule, Adobe says it's not going to use data from Reference Image to improve its AI model. Unlike many generative image systems, Adobe has implemented a \"content authenticity\" system to protect its models from infiltration by copyrighted content.\n\nThe current Photoshop tools let you remove backgrounds, but the updated Firefly will add the option to generate new backgrounds. Adobe pitches this as a way to speed up product photography without doing reshoots or gathering props. There's also an Enhance Detail feature to sharpen blurry images. Image upscaling is a common AI tool in 2024, but this is the first time Adobe has supported it in Photoshop.\n\nPhotoshop subscribers users can try the new AI features by downloading the beta version of the app, which can run in parallel with the stable build. New users can tinker for seven days without paying, too. This update also includes a few non-AI features such as an adjustment brush for refining and tweaking parts of an image non-destructively. There's also an improved font browser that provides access to Adobe's catalog of 25,000+ fonts. All these features will come to the stable build of Photoshop later this year, but there's no firm timeline.", "source": {"uri": "extremetech.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExtremeTech"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_whitwam@extremetech.com", "name": "Ryan Whitwam", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_editing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Image editing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scaling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Image scaling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Font"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photography"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Books", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Books", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Methods_and_Techniques/Imaging_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Methods and Techniques/Imaging Science", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://i.extremetech.com/imagery/content-types/03ejAYvWRG5yurnMTiEpJeh/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504321", "eventUri": "eng-9504321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The model offers what Adobe claims are photographic quality images, thanks to improvements in lighting, positioning, and variety. The AI is also better at understanding text prompts and scenes, leading to images that more accurately resemble the vision of the user, as well as more style choices for illustrations that can help design logos and line art.\n\nThe new foundational model also augments Photoshop with a new auto-stylization tool that lets users adjust the look, background, subject pose, and colors of an image. The software also includes a new structure reference and style reference toolkit that lets users match their creation to the structure and style of reference images.\n\n\"In just over a year, Firefly has become the image generation tool of choice used by millions of creators to ideate every day, and we're just getting started,\" Adobe chief technology officer for digital media Ely Greenfield said in a statement. \"As we continue to advance the state of the art with Image 3 Foundation Model, we cannot wait to see how our creative community will push the bounds of what's possible with this beta build.\"\n\nLike its previous versions, Firefly Image 3 is trained on licensed content, such as Adobe Stock, to ensure compliance with copyright and trademark rules.

This invite-only event in SF will explore the intersection of technology and business. Find out how you can attend here.\n\nAdobe has been a creative software pioneer since its founding in 1982, and it aims to continue that storied and acclaimed history in the generative AI era.\n\nToday, the company is announcing a fleet of Gen AI upgrades to Photoshop, including putting the image generation capabilities of its newly unveiled Firefly Image 3 AI model directly into the program. Adobe Firefly Image 3 will also exist as a stand-alone web app, like its predecessors.\n\nNow, instead of users having to generate an image with the stand-alone Firefly web app, download it, and import it into Photoshop, they can simply click the new \"Generate Image\" pop over menu option in Photoshop, type in a text prompt or select from several pre-set starter options and edit them, and viola -- within a few seconds, the Firefly AI model will generate the requested image.\n\nSolving the 'empty page' aka blank page or tabula rasa problem\n\n\"What we noticed when we looked at all these new people who were coming into Photoshop is that they were getting stuck with this 'empty page,' problem\" explained Zeke Koch, Adobe VP of Generative AI Product Management, in a video call interview with VentureBeat that took place days before the announcement under embargo.\n\n\"So we gave them the ability to generate images, full text to images...Because once you have your image in Photoshop, all of a sudden you can use all the tools that we have already in Photoshop to make it better,\" Koch added.\n\nAfter all, Photoshop has more than 70 different separate tools and literally hundreds of different settings and options for creating and editing imagery, and its long history of continuing to add and advance tools such as lassos and context-aware fill have made it nearly industry standard among photography, illustration, and graphic design professionals (according to revenue intelligence software firm 6sense, Photoshop is the no. 2 graphic design software globally behind Adobe Illustrator).\n\nBuilding on the success of Generative Fill\n\n\"It really makes it possible for our new-to-Photoshop users to be able to bring their creative visions to life,\" said Audrey Sousa, Principal Product Manager of Adobe Photoshop, in the same video interview that VentureBeat conducted with Koch.\n\nSousa also noted that Photoshop had seen an influx of new users following the debut of its Firefly-powered Generative Fill feature that debuted almost a year ago in May 2023.\n\nThat feature allowed users to highlight portions of an existing image and replace or augment what was already there by clicking the Generative Fill button and typing in a text prompt for what they wanted to add, remove, transform, or replace -- turning a cowboy's lasso into spaghetti, for one example (a pun on \"Spaghetti western\" movies).\n\nBut now, with the new Generate Image feature, Adobe is going much further, allowing you to generate full images powered by Firefly right from the get-go.\n\nIn addition, Adobe is upgrading Generative Fill, too, allowing users to add a \"Reference Image.\"\n\nThis new tool allows users to upload a selected image which Firefly will use to guide its generations in place of a text prompt: you can upload a hand drawn sketch, for example, or a brand logo or product asset, and the underlying Firefly 3 AI model will attempt to fill in the highlighted space of your image with something resembling or inspired by your reference.\n\nAdobe is further launching Generate Background in Photoshop, which simplifies the creation of seamless backdrops.\n\n\"It's probably one of the top use cases of Photoshop, generating new backgrounds,\" Sousa noted. \"Generate Background gives the user tons of options to work with and it really harmonizes the user image with the background.\"\n\nThis feature is especially critical for those enterprises and brands offering or marketing physical products: simply upload a product image, select it with a lasso or other selection tool, remove the background and then click \"Generate Background\" and type in what you want the new background to be.\n\nFirefly will try to match the background to the text prompt instructions you've provided, even adding appropriate coloration, shadows, water effects, and realistic textural effects to make it look like your product (or whatever the foreground image) is really there against a new background.\n\nThe utility is immense and obvious: allowing for entire series of new marketing and advertising assets to be created rapidly around the same product.\n\n\"You want to create a whole set of ads for it -- one for summer, winter, fall, spring...in the old days, you'd have to go bring the product into a light box with props and move it all around,\" explained Koch. \"We automatically wholesale generate the background behind it, but then pick up the shadows, reflections, and light, so it really feels embedded in the image.\"\n\nAnother feature, Generate Similar, allows you to create variations of what you just made with Generate Image, and Enhance Detail, which essentially upscales images, improving their sharpness and level of intricacy.\n\nAll the new Photoshop features are available starting today in the latest Photoshop (beta) app for desktop. Photoshop costs $22.99 per month when purchased on its own as a monthly subscription, with discounts for bundling it with other Adobe Creative Cloud software.\n\nEthical and enterprise-safe AI?\n\nAs has been its party line for the Gen AI era, Adobe's press materials and employees told VentureBeat the company was committed to AI Ethics and specifically \"accountability, responsibility, and transparency.\" It says it does this by having trained Firefly only on \"licensed content, such as Adobe Stock.\"\n\nIn addition, Firefly \"was designed to generate content for commercial use that does not infringe on copyright and other intellectual property (IP) right such as trademarks and logos,\" and in a big win for users, it \"offers customers IP indemnification for Firefly generated content,\" as Adobe's press materials state.\n\nIn the case of the new Generate Image feature and any other Firefly-powered features used to generate new portions of images with AI, Adobe will automatically apply its \"Content Credentials,\" metadata embedded in the image that indicates it was made with AI. Adobe says this is \"tamper proof.\"\n\nIt may not ease all concerns -- given a recent report that a small percentage of Adobe Stock images used to train Firefly were likely from rival AI image generator Midjourney, itself trained on data and imagery from human artists scraped without express consent from around the web -- but in the fast-moving world of gen AI, it probably sounds pretty damn good.\n\nVentureBeat uses Adobe Firefly, Midjourney and other AI tools and programs to generate content.", "source": {"uri": "venturebeat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VentureBeat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carl_franzen@venturebeat.com", "name": "Carl Franzen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firefly (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Web application"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VentureBeat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "VentureBeat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_rasa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tabula rasa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_art_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphic art software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Illustrator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Illustrator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cowboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphic design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midjourney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midjourney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Creative_Cloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Creative Cloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_bundling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Product bundling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Books", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Books", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Methods_and_Techniques/Imaging_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Methods and Techniques/Imaging Science", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Firefly-a-robot-holds-a-holograph-paintbrush-in-front-of-a-colorful-neon-canvas-of-various-robot-han-1.jpg?w=1200&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504321", "eventUri": "eng-9504321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

It has also helped the nearly 40-year-old image-editing software Photoshop realize a 30% year-over-year increase in users, said Zeke Koch, vice president of generative AI product management.\n\nNow, as competitors like Google and OpenAI push into Adobe's visual turf with gen AI tools like Gemini and Sora, Adobe wants to remind users of its prowess in visual content.\n\nThe Firefly Image 3 Foundation Model offers \"massive advancements to quality and control,\" Adobe says.\n\nThat includes more photorealistic images thanks to better lighting, positioning and attention to detail -- particularly when it comes to rendering people, including emotions.\n\nIf you look closely at AI-generated images, you'll likely notice certain details like hands or clothing aren't quite right, or are sometimes blatantly weird. This is what Adobe sought to address in the latest model -- in part by offering what Koch referred to as \"photographic detail.\"\n\nThat would be an improvement from earlier this year, when CNET's Stephen Shankland found that \"Firefly images suffered plenty of the common generative AI problems like weird anatomy and unreal rendering of areas where two subjects come into contact.\"\n\nAdobe also says that Firefly Image 3 has a better understanding of text prompts and scenes, which means you can input long, complex prompts to get precisely what you want.\n\n\"We made a new version of Firefly that's about twice as big inside,\" Koch said. \"And because it's twice as big, it has twice as much of an understanding of the world [and] it generates images that are way more photographically detailed.\"\n\nFirefly Image 3 is available in beta via Photoshop and firefly.adobe.com. That means you can try it out and provide feedback, but you can't use the tool commercially. A spokesperson said it will be more widely available later this year.\n\nOn Tuesday, Adobe also announced the addition of new editing features to Photoshop, which are powered by Firefly Image 3. They include the ability to use reference images to generate new content, as well as to create and replace backgrounds and fine-tune images. Firefly is also coming to publishing software InDesign.\n\nThe goal is to help users bring their ideas to life more quickly.

But Adobe is trying to right the ship with its third-generation model, Firefly Image 3, releasing this week during the company's Max London conference.\n\nThe model, now available in Photoshop (beta) and Adobe's Firefly web app, produces more \"realistic\" imagery than its predecessor (Image 2) and its predecessor's predecessor (Image 1) thanks to an ability to understand longer, more complex prompts and scenes as well as improved lighting and text generation capabilities. It should more accurately render things like typography, iconography, raster images and line art, says Adobe, and is \"significantly\" more adept at depicting dense crowds and people with \"detailed features\" and \"a variety of moods and expressions.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, in my brief unscientific testing, Image 3 does appear to be a step up from Image 2.\n\nI wasn't able to try Image 3 myself. But Adobe PR sent a few outputs and prompts from the model, and I managed to run those same prompts through Image 2 on the web to get samples to compare the Image 3 outputs with. (Keep in mind that the Image 3 outputs could've been cherry-picked.)\n\nNotice the lighting in this headshot from Image 3 compared to the one below it, from Image 2:\n\nThe Image 3 output looks more detailed and lifelike to my eyes, with shadowing and contrast that's largely absent from the Image 2 sample.\n\nHere's a set of images showing Image 3's scene understanding at play:\n\nNote the Image 2 sample is fairly basic compared to the output from Image 3 in terms of the level of detail -- and overall expressiveness. There's wonkiness going on with the subject in the Image 3 sample's shirt (around the waist area), but the pose is more complex than the subject's from Image 2. (And Image 2's clothes are also a bit off.)\n\nSome of Image 3's improvements can no doubt be traced to a larger and more diverse training data set.\n\nLike Image 2 and Image 1, Image 3 is trained on uploads to Adobe Stock, Adobe's royalty-free media library, along with licensed and public domain content for which the copyright has expired. Adobe Stock grows all the time, and consequently so too does the available training data set.\n\nIn an effort to ward off lawsuits and position itself as a more \"ethical\" alternative to generative AI vendors who train on images indiscriminately (e.g. OpenAI, Midjourney), Adobe has a program to pay Adobe Stock contributors to the training data set. (We'll note that the terms of the program are rather opaque, though.) Controversially, Adobe also trains Firefly models on AI-generated images, which some consider a form of data laundering.\n\nRecent Bloomberg reporting revealed AI-generated images in Adobe Stock aren't excluded from Firefly image-generating models' training data, a troubling prospect considering those images might contain regurgitated copyrighted material. Adobe has defended the practice, claiming that AI-generated images make up only a small portion of its training data and go through a moderation process to ensure they don't depict trademarks or recognizable characters or reference artists' names.\n\nOf course, neither diverse, more \"ethically\" sourced training data nor content filters and other safeguards guarantee a perfectly flaw-free experience -- see users generating people flipping the bird with Image 2. The real test of Image 3 will come once the community gets its hands on it.\n\nImage 3 powers several new features in Photoshop beyond enhanced text-to-image.\n\nA new \"style engine\" in Image 3, along with a new auto-stylization toggle, allows the model to generate a wider array of colors, backgrounds and subject poses. They feed into Reference Image, an option that lets users condition the model on an image whose colors or tone they want their future generated content to align with.\n\nThree new generative tools -- Generate Background, Generate Similar and Enhance Detail -- leverage Image 3 to perform precision edits on images. The (self-descriptive) Generate Background replaces a background with a generated one that blends into the existing image, while Generate Similar offers variations on a selected portion of a photo (a person or an object, for example). As for Enhance Detail, it \"fine-tunes\" images to improve sharpness and clarity.\n\nIf these features sound familiar, that's because they've been in beta in the Firefly web app for at least a month (and Midjourney for much longer than that). This marks their Photoshop debut -- in beta.\n\nSpeaking of the web app, Adobe isn't neglecting this alternate route to its AI tools.\n\nTo coincide with the release of Image 3, the Firefly web app is getting Structure Reference and Style Reference, which Adobe's pitching as new ways to \"advance creative control.\" (Both were announced in March, but they're now becoming widely available.) With Structure Reference, users can generate new images that match the \"structure\" of a reference image -- say, a head-on view of a race car. Style Reference is essentially style transfer by another name, preserving the content of an image (e.g. elephants in the African Safari) while mimicking the style (e.g. pencil sketch) of a target image.\n\nI asked Adobe if, with all the upgrades, Firefly image generation pricing would change. Currently, the cheapest Firefly premium plan is $4.99 per month -- undercutting competition like Midjourney ($10 per month) and OpenAI (which gates DALL-E 3 behind a $20-per-month ChatGPT Plus subscription).\n\nAdobe said that its current tiers will remain in place for now, along with its generative credit system. It also said that its indemnity policy, which states Adobe will pay copyright claims related to works generated in Firefly, won't be changing either, nor will its approach to watermarking AI-generated content. Content Credentials -- metadata to identify AI-generated media -- will continue to be automatically attached to all Firefly image generations on the web and in Photoshop, whether generated from scratch or partially edited using generative features.", "source": {"uri": "techcrunch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechCrunch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_wiggers@techcrunch.com", "name": "Kyle Wiggers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_data_sets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Training, validation, and test data sets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Creative_Cloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Creative Cloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firefly (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midjourney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midjourney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DALL-E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural language generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Typography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web application"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raster graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalty-free", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royalty-free"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "License"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Library"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public domain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Services", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Techniques_and_Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Techniques and Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Structure-Reference-output-with-elephant-prompt.jpeg?resize=1200,933", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504321", "eventUri": "eng-9504321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Previously, you could add elements to existing images, but now Adobe is allowing customers to start with a blank canvas and simply type a text prompt describing the image they want the AI to generate.\n\nAutomatic background removal has been a feature of Photoshop for some time, but now customers can generate AI replacements. So, for example, you may have a photo of a dog lying on grass, then select the option to remove the background and generate a beach surrounding.\n\nPhotoshop offers three different background alternatives and the background is adapted to the lighting, size and positioning of the subject. In the case of the dog, for instance, the sand on the beach should form around the dog's paws and body.\n\nOne thing that hasn't improved since the previous generation of Firefly AI is the resolution of the images created. Whether you're generating images from scratch or generating new backgrounds, the generated image will top out at around 1,500 x 1,500 pixels in size, which could make it difficult to use generated images at full-page size in magazines, for example. If the image in which a background is being replaced is larger than 1,500 x 1,500, the generated image will effectively be stretched.\n\nAdobe's chief technology officer, Ely Greenfield, told me the company is working to improve resolution, but it becomes a question of balancing cost and processing times.\n\nHe said there are three ways the company could improve the resolution of generated images. The first would be with \"more horsepower -- just throw more data at it, more compute at it.\" However, Greenfield admitted that extra compute power \"gets very expensive, very quickly\" and increases the amount of time it takes to generate images considerably.\n\nAlternatively, the company could apply upscaling. \"We can separate the task of generating [images] from the task of making it really detailed,\" he said.\n\nThe third method would be to generate images piece by piece instead of as one complete image. \"We're looking at all three of those [methods],\" Greenfield claimed.\n\nEven if image resolution requires further improvement, the sheer quality of the images generated by Firefly AI has improved almost beyond recognition since it was first unveiled a little over a year ago.\n\nWhen Firefly was first released, faces were often a disfigured mush, hands looked deformed and text was impossible to render. All three have been vastly improved, along with the overall quality of generated images.\n\nGreenfield explains how some improvements simply required better training data. Adobe insists that its AI has only been trained on \"commercially safe\" images, such as photos stored in its own stock library. That can create problems when it comes to generating specific types of images.\n\nFor example, Adobe's stock image library has relatively few images of crowds of people, because photographers are required to get model release forms signed from everyone that appears in such images. \"When we do have crowds, it's people facing away from the camera,\" said Greenfield. \"So with the first version of Firefly, if you tried to get a general image of crowds, you could get it, but they were always facing away from the camera.\"\n\nGreenfield says the company has also put a lot of focus on \"prompt adherence\", ensuring that the AI delivers what people are actually asking for. \"In the original days of Firefly, if you asked for a hippo riding a boat, you might get a hippo on a boat, or you might get a boat on a hippo.\"\n\n\"Firefly has got much better at that, but it's still an area we keep investing in. Does the model understand prepositions? Does it understand associations with color? How deeply can it understand the description of the text?\"\n\nThe AI improvements to Photoshop and Adobe's other Creative Suite apps are being announced at Adobe Max, which starts in London today.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firefly (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_InDesign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adobe InDesign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flagship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broadband"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canvas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scaling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Image scaling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief technology officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pixel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Creative_Suite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Creative Suite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Image resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Library (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippopotamus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hippopotamus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop_Customization", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop Customization", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Textures", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Textures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66276e3a28c8dd795c7bde93/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504321", "eventUri": "eng-9504321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Adobe -- at a conference in London on Tuesday -- said full image generation will come later this year, based on a new AI system called Firefly Image 3.\n\nMuch of Adobe's focus has been on speeding up the work of professionals who use its software. The new image-generation tool will have the ability to tap a user's uploaded image as a reference for the general composition of an image, Reuters news report said.\n\nFor example, a designer could make a quick sketch of a scene on a napkin, snap a photo of that napkin with a smartphone and then ask Photoshop to generate fully featured images in a variety of styles, said Ely Greenfield, chief technology officer for digital media at Adobe.\n\nThat's after a court ordered his social media company X to take down footage of an alleged terrorist attack in Sydney.\n\n\"Rather than having to very carefully describe exactly what goes where and try to make sure that I'm specifying the things I want things and that I don't, it's borrowing from the reference. So this is an amazingly powerful capability,\" Ely Greenfield said.\n\nAdobe said a test \"beta\" version of the software is available to some users on Tuesday but did not give a date for general availability.", "source": {"uri": "infotechlead.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InfotechLead"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stable Diffusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midjourney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midjourney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_editing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video editing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copyright infringement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief technology officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Imaging", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Imaging", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Methods_and_Techniques/Imaging_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Methods and Techniques/Imaging Science", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://infotechlead.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Adobe-AI-tools.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504321", "eventUri": "eng-9504321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

For 2024 the announcements are significant, especially if you're a Photoshop user with a love of generative AI features.\n\nWhile Photoshop has already integrated some Gen AI features from Adobe's standalone Firefly application, the latest beta app will integrate the latest Image Model 3 version of Firefly, and enable two key things: in-app AI image generation, and a 'reference image' addition to Generative Fill to prompt and guide results to be closer to your intention.\n\nThe work behind the scenes has seen Adobe level up Firefly's previous Image Model 2 engine to uprated Image Model 3, which is a more capable image-generation system. The company has enhanced focus in two specific areas of improvement: in rendering straight lines with higher accuracy; and rendering higher-resolution structures and details with greater accuracy. The results are more authentic, while human renders are also portrayed across a wider range of emotions.\n\nWhile the best phones of today offer some great AI tools, such as Google's Magic Editor, and Adobe also offers an iPad version of Photoshop, this latest beta version of Photoshop is full-fat application - and the better your best MacBook (or, indeed, best laptop) is the quicker it'll be able to leverage these power-intensive generative tools.\n\nThe message from Adobe is that its products will offer \"more quality, more control, and more consistency\" when using its Gen AI tools. Being able to prompt a text to image starting point is a massive addition to Photoshop's tools. It can even now be used to create vector art.\n\nGenerative Fill, too, gains additional new features: Generate Background, Generate Similar, and Enhance Detail. Ultimately more controls at your fingertips to push creations further all from within Photoshop, in separate layers, non-destructively.\n\nAs ever, the idea of artificial intelligence will raise red flags for some, but Adobe claims it is committed to ethical creation and that all AI-created and AI-assisted edits will mark-up files accordingly.

Firefly Image 3, announced at Adobe Max London, includes a variety of new features for apps used in Photoshop and InDesign, but will also be included in the new beta version of his standalone Firefly web app .\n\nFirefly Image 3 brings major qualitative updates, including photorealistic images, and Adobe is also adding tools for both new users and professionals. In addition to new text-to-image tools that let you create images in seconds, other features in Photoshop include how to generate backgrounds, replace objects in images, and let Firefly tell you what to create. including how to use reference images.\n\nMarketing experts think the new AI model's capabilities are impressive, but Adobe's critical mass and gravity could provide additional benefits. Marketing experts also believe the update could help lower the barrier to entry for regular users, as well as make professionals' jobs faster and easier. That's what Adobe is hoping for, too.\n\nErin Boyce, Adobe's senior director of product marketing for Photoshop, said the shortened learning curve has helped attract new customers to Adobe's products. Photoshop saw a 30% year-over-year increase in new Photoshop subscriptions, but she said the majority of people who visit the Fireflys website are completely new to Adobe.\n\nBoyce said that when new customers open Photoshop and open a new file, they are faced with a large blank canvas and have no idea where to start. Get started right away with simple text prompts. For professionals, this is a great way to come up with ideas directly in Photoshop, go from initial idea through iteration, and into the editing process where you do all the work.\n\nSince its debut a year ago, Firefly has generated 7 billion images, according to Adobe. While Adobe is rolling out a number of new features across a variety of apps, we've also worked to improve the reliability of how we train our AI models. The company claims that it ushered in new content authenticity standards and that Firely was trained using only licensed images. However, recent reports have pointed out that some of the images used to train Firefly come from Midjourney, which is facing a lawsuit for scraping content on the internet without permission.\n\nAdobe's news is just one of many recent updates from various generative AI image platforms. Startups like Stability AI and Leonardo AI are adding new tools and ways to access their platforms, with Stability debuting new APIs for Stable Diffusion 3 models and Leonardo expanding its business customer base with enterprise APIs. We are paying attention to. Meanwhile, Canva recently acquired professional layout software startup Affinity, Google Ads introduced a way to use AI images in demand generation campaigns, and Meta AI's Metas update includes instant creation of images and animations. Contains how to.\n\nWhile Firefly 3 helps improve image quality, advertisers and analysts say Adobe's strategy to integrate Firefly 3 across its app ecosystem favors adoption. In addition to having a large base of enterprise customers, Adobe's familiar UX will drive adoption of new tools using generative AI.\n\nGartner analyst Nicole Green said marketers are forgetting to inject generative AI into their strategies and are focusing on AI as a series of technology developments. That's the risk of bringing generational AI to a function that just has new points and features and capabilities, and not saying, \"What do we already have?\"\n\nGreene said Adobe's integration of content credentials and use of licensed images are helping it appeal to enterprise customers, adding that both factors have become something of a stake. And while many marketers are still reluctant to use AI to generate entire images, tools like GenerativeHiFi are attractive.\n\nIn a recent Gartner survey of 300 marketers, 47% said they had generated images within the past six months. But the benefits also bring existential risks. 47% said using AI tools has saved them time and increased their creativity, but 87% are concerned about how AI might replace their roles. It also says that there are.\n\nEven if an agency's designers use tools from Adobe or Midjourney to help with the concept, AI-generated images aren't always incorporated into ads, at least for now.\n\nOne of the primary ways generative AI impacts government agencies is through workflow automation and optimization. Ly Nguyen, head of creative at Movement Strategy, adds that tools like Firefly can help create large amounts of content for clients, which is especially important for agencies that are still in the process of scaling. I did. As an example, you can use Firefly to remove or change the background of hundreds of images with the push of a button.\n\nThere is a threshold, or a certain point, for people to work sustainably, Nguyen said. Once you start liking large amounts of work, it becomes unwise to have someone else perform such tasks manually.\n\nFirefly and other tools are part of a broader set of tools used by government agencies to do more than just create AI images from text. Brian Brown, Razorfish's senior vice president and creative innovation lead for the U.S., said many of the companies' generative AI capabilities overlap, but some are better at certain tasks than others. . For example, some people have different aesthetics, some are better at automation, some are better at creating certain types of content, and some are better at personalization.\n\nWhen it comes to evaluating new tools, Brown says it comes back to automation. Could this make us more efficient or make us more creatively powerful in ways that nothing else currently does?\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firefly (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-to-image_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Text-to-image model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stable Diffusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_InDesign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adobe InDesign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorealism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photorealism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gravity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualitative research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leonardo da Vinci"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web application"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midjourney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midjourney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gartner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "License"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Methods_and_Techniques/Imaging_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Methods and Techniques/Imaging Science", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://digiday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/ai-brain-digiday.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504321", "eventUri": "eng-9504321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

These competitors offer AI-driven services capable of generating images from textual prompts, posing a challenge to Adobe's market dominance.\n\nIn response to this evolving landscape, Adobe is leveraging its resources to develop its own AI image-generation system, codenamed Firefly. Unlike some competitors, Firefly is trained exclusively on data that Adobe possesses the rights to, a strategic move aimed at mitigating potential copyright infringement claims against users.\n\nWhile Adobe has previously introduced image-generation tools in Photoshop for tasks such as filling in or expanding parts of existing images, the forthcoming update promises full-scale image generation capabilities. This enhancement will be powered by a new AI system named Firefly Image 3, slated for release later this year.\n\nOne of the key features of the new image-generation tool is its ability to utilise a user's uploaded image as a reference for generating fully realised compositions. For instance, designers can sketch a scene on a napkin, capture an image of the sketch with a smartphone, and instruct Photoshop to generate fully featured images in various styles.\n\nEly Greenfield, Chief Technology Officer for Digital Media at Adobe, highlighted the intuitive nature of the tool, stressing its ability to streamline the creative process. \"Rather than having to very carefully describe exactly what goes where...it's borrowing from the reference.

Sharpness, clarity and other details can also be enhanced with the Enhance Detail tool (more on this later).\n\nUsing a rather random example in the press preview last week, Adobe used the prompt 'profile photo of rainbow bear playing guitar and looking at a roaring campfire' and the new AI tools in Photoshop duly delivered an image of an ursine guitar player in front of a fire (see below).\n\nThe guitar was then instantly changed from acoustic to electric to further emphasise the flexibility and range of the new features.\n\n'Adobe's newest Firefly model delivers photorealistic quality like never before with better lighting, positioning, attention to detail, as well as advancements in text display,' said the company.\n\nYou can also experiment with the Generate Similar feature, with produces similar images to your start image if you need more inspiration and ideas.\n\nIn terms of specific editing tools, the new Photoshop beta now includes an Adjustment Brush, enabling you to work on specific parts of an image as you can already do in Lightroom and Camera Raw, while the Enhance Detail feature mentioned above can also be used to fine-tune photographs.\n\nConcerns have been raised about the impact of Adobe's strong AI push on the livelihoods of photographers, and with the company now claiming to have made it even easier to generate 'photorealistic images,' these concerns are not going to go away.\n\nAs part of this new AI roll-out, Adobe is continuing to push Content Credentials, which it describes as 'a nutrition label for online content that shows what has gone into the creating editing process - whether AI was used or not.'\n\nThe latest Photoshop Beta is available now to download for Adobe Creative Cloud subscribers.\n\nLast week, Adobe also previewed generative AI features within Adobe Premiere Pro that will enable users to streamline video editing, including adding or removing objects in a scene or extending an existing clip.

At a conference in London on Tuesday, the company said full image generation will come later this year, based on a new AI system called Firefly Image 3.\n\nMuch of Adobe's focus has been on speeding up the work of professionals who use its software.

It's easy to use with reference images. Concerned about AI deception? Adobe adds Content Credentials to generated images for transparency. Verify AI creation details easily. Try the new Firefly model in the web app, Adobe Photoshop, or InDesign without signing up. No premium plan required for a test run.\n\nWhen you think of AI image generators, what comes to mind? Maybe you think of DALL-E 3 with ChatGPT, or maybe Microsoft's Designer. However, not many people know about Adobe's Firefly, which has been putting out some top-quality images lately. If you've never given it a try before, now is the best time to jump in, as it has just received a massive update that you can take for a spin right now.\n\nRelated How to use ChatGPT: Making an account, prompts, and more ChatGPT is a tool that many people may have heard of but aren't sure how to use. This is how to get started and what you can use it for! Adobe Firefly Image 3 has arrived with some great new features\n\nAs announced on the official Adobe website, the Firefly Image 3 model is now here. It boasts a lot of positives across the board, such as matching custom styles, rendering text in images better, and producing higher-quality images. If you find that wrestling with AI prompts is too difficult, you can instead opt to feed Firefly reference images. Firefly will then do its best to produce new images based on the inspiration you gave it.\n\nWhenever an AI model gets slightly too good, it raises concerns about whether these images will be used to deceive others. With so much misinformation already circling the internet, it's a very reasonable concern. Fortunately, Adobe is also adding Content Credentials to its generated images. This allows people to not only verify that the image was AI-generated, but also see details such as the prompt used to get the result, the app used to make it, and the user who made it.\n\nIf you want to give this new model a try, you can do so either in the Firefly web app, Adobe Photoshop, or Adobe InDesign.

But Adobe is trying to right the ship with its third-generation model, Firefly Image 3, releasing this week during the company's Max London conference.\n\nThe model, now available in Photoshop (beta) and Adobe's Firefly web app, produces more \"realistic\" imagery than its predecessor (Image 2) and its predecessor's predecessor (Image 1) thanks to an ability to understand longer, more complex prompts and scenes as well as improved lighting and text generation capabilities. It should more accurately render things like typography, iconography, raster images and line art, says Adobe, and is \"significantly\" more adept at depicting dense crowds and people with \"detailed features\" and \"a variety of moods and expressions.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, in my brief unscientific testing, Image 3 does appear to be a step up from Image 2.\n\nI wasn't able to try Image 3 myself. But Adobe PR sent a few outputs and prompts from the model, and I managed to run those same prompts through Image 2 on the web to get samples to compare the Image 3 outputs with. (Keep in mind that the Image 3 outputs could've been cherry-picked.)\n\nNotice the lighting in this headshot from Image 3 compared to the one below it, from Image 2:\n\nFrom Image 3. Prompt: \"Studio portrait of young woman.\"\n\nSame prompt as above, from Image 2.\n\nThe Image 3 output looks more detailed and lifelike to my eyes, with shadowing and contrast that's largely absent from the Image 2 sample.\n\nHere's a set of images showing Image 3's scene understanding at play:\n\nFrom Image 3. Prompt: \"An artist in her studio sitting at desk looking pensive with tons of paintings and ethereal.\"\n\nSame prompt as above. From Image 2.\n\nNote the Image 2 sample is fairly basic compared to the output from Image 3 in terms of the level of detail -- and overall expressiveness. There's wonkiness going on with the subject in the Image 3 sample's shirt (around the waist area), but the pose is more complex than the subject's from Image 2. (And Image 2's clothes are also a bit off.)\n\nSome of Image 3's improvements can no doubt be traced to a larger and more diverse training data set.\n\nLike Image 2 and Image 1, Image 3 is trained on uploads to Adobe Stock, Adobe's royalty-free media library, along with licensed and public domain content for which the copyright has expired. Adobe Stock grows all the time, and consequently so too does the available training data set.\n\nIn an effort to ward off lawsuits and position itself as a more \"ethical\" alternative to generative AI vendors who train on images indiscriminately (e.g. OpenAI, Midjourney), Adobe has a program to pay Adobe Stock contributors to the training data set. (We'll note that the terms of the program are rather opaque, though.) Controversially, Adobe also trains Firefly models on AI-generated images, which some consider a form of data laundering.\n\nRecent Bloomberg reporting revealed AI-generated images in Adobe Stock aren't excluded from Firefly image-generating models' training data, a troubling prospect considering those images might contain regurgitated copyrighted material. Adobe has defended the practice, claiming that AI-generated images make up only a small portion of its training data and go through a moderation process to ensure they don't depict trademarks or recognizable characters or reference artists' names.\n\nOf course, neither diverse, more \"ethically\" sourced training data nor content filters and other safeguards guarantee a perfectly flaw-free experience -- see users generating people flipping the bird with Image 2. The real test of Image 3 will come once the community gets its hands on it.\n\nImage 3 powers several new features in Photoshop beyond enhanced text-to-image.\n\nA new \"style engine\" in Image 3, along with a new auto-stylization toggle, allows the model to generate a wider array of colors, backgrounds and subject poses. They feed into Reference Image, an option that lets users condition the model on an image whose colors or tone they want their future generated content to align with.\n\nThree new generative tools -- Generate Background, Generate Similar and Enhance Detail -- leverage Image 3 to perform precision edits on images. The (self-descriptive) Generate Background replaces a background with a generated one that blends into the existing image, while Generate Similar offers variations on a selected portion of a photo (a person or an object, for example). As for Enhance Detail, it \"fine-tunes\" images to improve sharpness and clarity.\n\nIf these features sound familiar, that's because they've been in beta in the Firefly web app for at least a month (and Midjourney for much longer than that). This marks their Photoshop debut -- in beta.\n\nSpeaking of the web app, Adobe isn't neglecting this alternate route to its AI tools.\n\nTo coincide with the release of Image 3, the Firefly web app is getting Structure Reference and Style Reference, which Adobe's pitching as new ways to \"advance creative control.\" (Both were announced in March, but they're now becoming widely available.) With Structure Reference, users can generate new images that match the \"structure\" of a reference image -- say, a head-on view of a race car. Style Reference is essentially style transfer by another name, preserving the content of an image (e.g. elephants in the African Safari) while mimicking the style (e.g. pencil sketch) of a target image.\n\nI asked Adobe if, with all the upgrades, Firefly image generation pricing would change.

It is initially available through the Firefly website and will roll out to other Adobe products in the future, including alongside AI video models like Sora in Premiere Pro.\n\nIn addition to generative fill, Adobe is launching generative expand for the Firefly web app. This feature allows users to expand the canvas or change the orientation of any image, and Firefly fills in the gaps.\n\nAdobe has been rapidly improving its Firefly family of transformer models, adding new features such as style reference and integrating them with existing Adobe products.\n\nFirefly 3 was trained on licensed Adobe Stock images -- which includes some creations from Midjourney -- and will likely be the first version to have video capabilities later this year.\n\nMost people will interact with Firefly through generative fill in Photoshop or template and other content creation in Illustrator or InDesign, but Adobe is investing in its Firefly web app.\n\nThe text-to-image model can also use an existing image and copy its style or structure. For example, if you have a photograph with perfect lighting, you could copy that style, or if you have a product image, you could copy the structure but change the content.\n\n\"In just over a year, Firefly has become the image generation tool of choice used by millions of creators to ideate every day, and we're just getting started,\" said Ely Greenfield, chief technology officer, Digital Media at Adobe.\n\n\"As we continue to advance the state of the art with Image 3 Foundation Model, we cannot wait to see how our creative community will push the bounds of what's possible with this beta build.\"\n\nI tried it on a handful of prompts and compared them to Firefly 2, which was already impressive at things like art and design-based creation. Firefly 3 is a major improvement in photorealistic images. I think it will hit the stock image sector.\n\nAdobe says the work on Firefly 3 was focused on speeding up ideation, allowing designers to go from an idea to a fully-fledged image in as little time and with as little friction as possible.\n\nI think they've achieved it. Unlike Midjourney, where you have to learn multiple parameters and how to implement them, Firefly has a series of well-defined and clear menu options.\n\nFirefly 3 seems to have better photorealism, a wider variety of outputs from a single prompt across styles like photo, art and illustration, as well as options to set the mood or lighting.\n\nThe company says it also has a better understanding of the prompt, which I put to the test by asking it to show me an old castle by a lake with people boating -- and it was spot on.

Well, those of you in the Adobe ecosystem of products have a powerful image-generation tool of your own. Today, Adobe announced the Firefly Image 3 model, and it boasts some notable improvements over its predecessor.\n\nAdobe has been working on its presence in the AI market. Recently, the company announced some new AI tools coming to Adobe Premier, the company's video editing platform. These tools include the ability to make artificially generated frames to extend your shots, video generation, Etc. This shows that the company is looking at more ways of refining the creative process.\n\nAlso, the company recently launched its Adobe Express app. This gives you access to powerful generative AI tools right on your phone. It's available now to download for Android and iOS.\n\nRight now, pretty much all of the image generators we see on the market are capable of generating some breathtakingly realistic images. Well, Adobe's Firefly model was a bit behind the race. However, the company unveiled Firefly Image 3, and it brings the company more in line with the competition.\n\nJust like with other image generators, you're able to turn text prompts into images. You could be as descriptive as you want with the prompts, and the image model will do its best to create images based on what you typed.\n\nHowever, the functionality doesn't stop there. You are also able to upload images to have the model generate its own version of them. This is a tool that many of the models have, so it's great to see it coming to Firefly. One thing that makes this model great is the fact that it supports higher-resolution images, smarter AI, and custom style matching.\n\nIf you are excited about trying out this new model, you can access it through the dedicated web app, Adobe InDesign, and Photoshop.

Generative AI capabilities are powered by Adobe's Firefly Image 3 model which was also released today.\n\nNew to the photo-editing software is a Generate Image tool that creates an image from a text prompt, giving people feeling daunted by a blank page a jumping off point.\n\nGenerative Fill, a preexisting tool that fills out the background or expands an image with a broader scene, now includes the ability to build off of an image with a Reference Image feature. So if you want to create an image with a specific aesthetic you can upload an image and nudge the tool to work off that aesthetic or motif.\n\nFor Photoshop novices (and pros for that matter) these tools make it incredibly easy to bring their ideas to life. Especially now that Firefly Image 3 is capable of amazing photorealistic detail and improved understanding of prompts. But Adobe has pushed ahead with generative AI features despite controversy around its training data and backlash from creative professionals.\n\nThe issue of training data for AI models is a murky one that isn't going away any time soon. Companies like Google and OpenAI have been sued for training their models on copyrighted works, and that's just for text outputs. The unveiling of OpenAI's Sora (which isn't available to the public yet) and AI video generators like the one Adobe just released have expanded the issue to other mediums. While companies are charging forward with AI advancements to meet their competitors, many creatives like @Rahll on X, are outraged by the lack of oversight over technologies that threaten to replace or overhaul their vocations.\n\nAdobe has been adamant about Firefly being safe for commercial use, and has touted its model as the ethical alternative to competitors like Midjourney or Stable Diffusion that have been accused of training their models on copyrighted works without credit and compensation. Yet a recent Bloomberg report found that Firefly was trained on AI-generated images derived from Midjourney and other rivals, meaning Adobe's purported \"commercially safe\" model contains training data drawn from works perceived by many as having been infringed upon or stolen.\n\nA spokesperson said Adobe's generative AI models are trained on \"licensed content, such as Adobe Stock, along with public domain content.\" But, according to Midjourney enthusiast Nick St. Pierre, around 13 percent of Adobe's stock library is AI-generated content which is part of the data used to train Firefly.\n\nThat said, the spokesperson said \"the training data must comply with our IP guidelines and pass our multi-layered, continuous review and moderation process,\" so there is ongoing moderation of unlicensed AI-generated content that might slip through the cracks.\n\nParticularly when it comes to the Reference Image tool, X users have pointed out the issue of creating an image based on a photographer or artist's work. \"Awesome. Steal 'reference images' from real photographers who went to great lengths and great expense to make them,\" posted @notbrodyjenner. \"Then pick an artist who spent their career creating a unique style, rip it off wholesale and make whatever ai garbage you want. Awesome.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said Adobe compensates contributors through Stock royalties and through a bonus program that incentivizes users to contribute to Firefly training.", "source": {"uri": "mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firefly (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_data_sets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Training, validation, and test data sets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aesthetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midjourney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midjourney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_editing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Image editing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorealism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photorealism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stable Diffusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalty_payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royalty payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "License"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Library"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public domain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Development_Frameworks", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Development Frameworks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Presentation", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Presentation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/02akNMA7U3HOKQQpTeSDKHr/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1713898270.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504321", "eventUri": "eng-9504321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

At a conference in London on Tuesday, the company said full image generation will come later this year, based on a new AI system called Firefly Image 3.\n\nMuch of Adobe's focus has been on speeding up the work of professionals who use its software. The new image-generation tool will have the ability to tap a user's uploaded image as a reference for the general composition of an image.\n\nFor example, a designer could make a quick sketch of a scene on a napkin, snap a photo of that napkin with a smartphone and then ask Photoshop to generate fully featured images in a variety of styles, said Ely Greenfield, chief technology officer for digital media at Adobe.\n\n\"Rather than having to very carefully describe exactly what goes where and try to make sure that I'm specifying the things I want things and that I don't, it's borrowing from the reference. So this is an amazingly powerful capability,\" Greenfield said.\n\nAdobe said a test \"beta\" version of the software is available to some users on Tuesday but did not give a date for general availability.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Franciso; Editing by Jamie Freed)", "source": {"uri": "money.usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@money.usnews.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "artificial_intelligence@money.usnews.com", "name": "Artificial Intelligence", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stable Diffusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midjourney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midjourney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copyright infringement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief technology officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Imaging", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Imaging", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Methods_and_Techniques/Imaging_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Methods and Techniques/Imaging Science", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/c97e152/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F74%2Fea46e864099d5e8997a74ce22a38a2%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXNPEK3M0AS%3A12024-04-23T090225Z_1_LYNXNPEK3M0AS_RTROPTP_3_ADOBE-AI.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504321", "eventUri": "eng-9504321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Powered by its Firefly Image 3 foundation model, the third iteration of the company's in-house text-to-image generation model, the new Photoshop will be able to generate images from text prompts directly within the app for the first time. The app is currently in beta, but the company has said it will be launched to all users later this year.\n\nMaking the announcement via a post in its newsroom, Adobe unveiled the new Photoshop for desktop app. The app was officially showcased at its Creativity Conference event. The new beta app comes with multiple new AI features such as Reference Image, Generate Image, Generate Similar, Generate Background, and Enhance Detail. The existing features such as Generative Fill and Generative Expand have also been improved.\n\nThe company also released a short video showcasing the capabilities of the new photo-editing software. The biggest addition with the new Firefly Image 3 model is the Reference Image. This feature allows users to upload an image as a reference to generate images. Users can also use the reference image on top of a generated image to enhance it further. The next big addition is the debut of text-to-image generation capabilities within the Photoshop app. Earlier, users could only use Generative Fill and Generative Expand inside the app.\n\nFurther, the Generate Background feature replaces and creates backgrounds, whereas Generate Similar generates different variations of an already generated image for granular control over the outcome. Apart from the AI features, Adobe has also added other tools such as Adjustment Brush for non-destructive adjustments to specific portions of images, an improved font browsing experience, and adjustment presets.\n\nThe company claimed that the Firefly Image 3 foundation model was only trained on licensed content such as Adobe Stock. To ensure the AI-generated images can be identified from real images, Adobe follows the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) open standard which requires AI tool makers to add an AI label as well as to include details about its creation process within the metadata. In addition, it also follows the Adobe-led Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI) standard.", "source": {"uri": "gadgets360.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV Gadgets 360"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_editing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Image editing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Creative_Cloud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Creative Cloud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Font"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metadata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "License"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Development_Frameworks", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Development Frameworks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop_Customization", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop Customization", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Presentation", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Presentation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/photoshop_ai_1713872444811.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504321", "eventUri": "eng-9504321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The Reference Image feature uses selected images to inspire and shape outputs, closely aligning results with what creatives envision.\n\nThe new Generate Image capability reduces the gap between a blank page and finished content by introducing direct text-to-image conversion within Photoshop. This is a first for the application.\n\nAdditionally, the Generate Background function simplifies the creation of new backgrounds that integrate with existing images. The Generate Similar tool allows creators to rapidly iterate on their designs with selected variations.\n\nThe Enhance Detail feature is designed to fine-tune images, enhancing their sharpness and clarity.\n\nComplementing these Firefly-powered enhancements, Photoshop introduced several other valuable tools for design and creation. The Adjustment Brush lets users quickly apply non-destructive adjustments to specific parts of an image.\n\nAn improved Font Browser provides instant access to more than 25,000 Adobe fonts directly from the cloud, eliminating the need to exit Photoshop to find the perfect font for any project.\n\nFinally, Adjustment Presets offer a straightforward way for creators to alter the appearance of images with single-click filters, along with the option to create and save customized presets for repeated use.\n\nAdobe has also rolled out an update for its Adobe Express mobile app on iOS, integrating the Firefly generative AI capabilities. The update enables mobile users to access the power of Adobe's advanced AI directly from their devices.\n\nThe inclusion of Firefly in Adobe Express enhances the app's functionality.

Thus, Adobe continues progressing the main state of Gen AI in the creative industry. ADBE stock went up during the first trading session.\n\nAdobe's latest Photoshop advancements\n\nAt the company's latest conference in Max London, Adobe gave us an insight into their latest Photoshop updates, including tools that produce images similar to a photo and create text commands to generate photo backgrounds. First, it proved how such a method can generate more vivid and vivid images from simple prompts.\n\nIn a recent trend, Adobe released a handful of AI powered by the Adobe Firefly Innovative Model. Individuals could download them from here, which is already in the beta version, and start using them after the release later this year.\n\n\"Added to the fact that this is Adobe Photoshop's new major software update that opens up new horizons beyond professional photo-editing - the tool is built for newbies as well as the experts,\" stated Ashley Still, senior VP Creative Product Group at Adobe in a statement. \"Along with new Firefly-powered features in Photoshop, we are trying to play two birds with the same stone. Firstly, you can start your creative journey from the ideation stage without hassle. Once you have a clear vision, the execution becomes more powerful and easier so that everyone can ultimately bring their most creative ideas to life.\"\n\nLast week, the company previewed generative AI innovations for Adobe Premiere Pro video editing tool, and now the Color and composition generation is available for Photoshop.\n\nOn 15th April 2023, Adobe rolled out its range of the latest generative AI tools, which will be added to Premiere Pro later this year. These machines will enable creative fans to delete an object in the scene to prolong the takes and beyond.\n\nIn addition, Adobe is working on a model for a video AI service; hence, users can create videos with just a single sentence command. AI technology will also significantly integrate third-party generative AI video models like those from OpenAI, Pikalabs, and Runway into Premiere Pro.\n\nADBE stock rises generative AI\n\nAccording to the IBD Stock Checkup, the ADBE stock's IBD Composite Rating is medium or ranks 54 compared to 99. IBD's Composite Rating adds up to five ratings, each one deeply researched and weighted, into a single convenient rating. The stocks with the most growth in composite must be 90 or better.\n\nLast year, the stock rose by 77%, and now it has slid by 22% this year (2024). The company followed the path of its AI Ethics principles - the responsibility to be accountable for one's actions, the commitment to act responsibly, and the guarantee of transparency. In Adobe's most recent study, 3 out of 4 American consumers feel it is crucial to know if online material was created with the help of AI systems.\n\nOne avenue the company can use to provide transparency around AI usage in Adobe's apps is that in the features powered by Firefly, users in Photoshop will automatically use Content Credentials to upload sounds, photos, and videos. Like a nutrition label that provides different information about the product to the consumers, content credentials provide metadata indicating that AI was used in the creation process or otherwise or that the information was modified after the original record.\n\nContent Credentials are based on open C2PA standards, and CAI supports an initiative founded in 2019 by Adobe to increase the trust between digital entities. In the current dynamics, the CAI has evolved to a global coalition of around 2500 members that includes tech companies, researchers, commercial entities, media outlets, and creative people, all in partnership to help improve the transparency involved in digital content.", "source": {"uri": "cryptopolitan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cryptopolitan"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benson_mawira@cryptopolitan.com", "name": "Benson Mawira", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firefly (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Premiere_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Premiere Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_editing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video editing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_editing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Image editing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Compositing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metadata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_(communication)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Media (communication)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Digital_Video", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Digital Video", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Books", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Books", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Default_generative_artificial_intelligence_tools_for_its_flags_1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504321", "eventUri": "eng-9504321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Along with a new text-to-image tool that lets people make images in seconds, other features for Photoshop include ways to generate backgrounds, replace objects within images and use reference images to inform what Firefly should create.\n\nWhile marketing experts find the new AI model's capabilities impressive, Adobe's critical mass and gravitational pull could also give it an added advantage. Marketings experts also think the updates could help lower the barrier to entry for everyday users but also make professionals' jobs faster and easier. That's something Adobe is hoping for as well.\n\nShortening the learning curve has helped draw in new customers to Adobe's products, according to Erin Boyce, senior director, Photoshop Product Marketing at Adobe. While Photoshop has had a 30% year-over-year increase in gross new Photoshop subscriptions, she said the \"vast majority\" of people visiting Firefly's website are completely new to Adobe.\n\n\"What we find for new customers is they open Photoshop, they open a new file and there's a big blank canvas staring them in the face and they don't quite know where to start,\" Boyce said. \"With a simple text prompt, they can get started right away creating. For pros, this is an amazing way to ideate right in Photoshop and get from first idea to iteration to iteration, right into editing where they're doing all of their work.\"\n\nSince it debuted a year ago, Firefly has generated 7 billion images, according to Adobe. While rolling out numerous new features across various apps, Adobe has also sought to build more trust with how the AI models are trained. Along with spearheading new content authenticity standards, the company also claims Firely was trained using only licensed images. However, recent reports have noted some of the images used to train Firefly came from Midjourney, which has faced lawsuits for scraping content on the internet without permission.\n\nAdobe's news is just one of many recent updates from a range of generative AI image platforms. Startups like Stability AI and Leonardo AI have added new tools and ways to access their platform, with Stability debuting a new API for its Stable Diffusion 3 model, and Leonardo eyeing business customers with its enterprise API. Meanwhile, Canva recently acquired the professional layout software startup Affinity, Google Ads introduced a way to use AI images in demand-generation campaigns, and Meta's updates for Meta AI include ways to instantly create images and animations.\n\nWhile Firefly 3 helps improve image quality, advertising execs and analysts say Adobe's strategy of integrating it across its ecosystem of apps provides an advantage for adoption. Along with having a massive base of enterprise customers, Adobe's familiar UX helps drive adoption of new tools using generative AI.\n\n\"Marketers forget to infuse their strategy with generative AI and they look to it more as this series of tech deployments,\" said Gartner analyst Nicole Greene. \"That's the risk of going out just to bring gen AI into a function with a new point or feature or function versus saying, 'What do we already have?'\"\n\nAdobe's integration of content credentials and its use of licensed images help it appeal to enterprise customers, Greene said, adding that both factors have become more like table stakes. And while many marketers are still averse to using AI to generate entire images, tools like generative fill be appealing.\n\nAccording to Gartner's recent survey of 300 marketers, 47% said they've generated images in the past six months. But the benefits also bring an existential risk. Although 47% said using AI tools have saved time and made them more creative, 87% also said they worry about how AI could potentially replace their roles.\n\nEven if agency designers are using tools in Adobe and Midjourney to help with concepts, the AI-generated images aren't always making their way into ads -- at least not yet.\n\nOne of the main ways generative AI is impacting agencies is through automating and optimizing workflows. Tools like Firefly help with creating high volumes of content for clients, said Ly Nguyen, head of creative at Movement Strategy, adding that it's especially important for agencies that are still in the process of scaling. One example is using Firefly to remove or change the background for hundreds of images that can be done with the push of a button.\n\n\"There's a threshold, a certain point where you have people doing the work that is sustainable,\" Nguyen said. \"When you get to like large volumes, it becomes not smart anymore to have someone manually do that type of work.\"\n\nRather than just creating AI images from text, Firefly and other tools are part of a broader set of tools agencies are using. Brian Brown, U.S. svp and creative innovation lead at Razorfish, said many generative AI features from companies overlap, but some are better at certain tasks than others. For example, some might differ in aesthetic, some might help more with automation, some might be better at making certain types of content, while others might help more with personalization.\n\n\"When it comes to evaluating new tools, it also comes back to automation,\" Brown said. \"Is there something that this does in a way that's going to make us more efficient, or more creatively powerful that something else isn't doing right now?\"", "source": {"uri": "digiday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digiday"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marty_swant@digiday.com", "name": "Marty Swant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firefly (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-to-image_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Text-to-image model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stable Diffusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorealism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photorealism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gravity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualitative_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualitative research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leonardo da Vinci"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "License"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midjourney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midjourney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gartner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "User experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Presentation", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Presentation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://digiday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/ai-brain-digiday.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504321", "eventUri": "eng-9504321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Thus, Adobe continues progressing the main state of Gen AI in the creative industry. ADBE stock went up during the first trading session.\n\nAt the company's latest conference in Max London, Adobe gave us an insight into their latest Photoshop updates, including tools that produce images similar to a photo and create text commands to generate photo backgrounds. First, it proved how such a method can generate more vivid and vivid images from simple prompts.\n\nIn a recent trend, Adobe released a handful of AI powered by the Adobe Firefly Innovative Model. Individuals could download them from here, which is already in the beta version, and start using them after the release later this year.\n\n\"Added to the fact that this is Adobe Photoshop's new major software update that opens up new horizons beyond professional photo-editing - the tool is built for newbies as well as the experts,\" stated Ashley Still, senior VP Creative Product Group at Adobe in a statement. \"Along with new Firefly-powered features in Photoshop, we are trying to play two birds with the same stone. Firstly, you can start your creative journey from the ideation stage without hassle. Once you have a clear vision, the execution becomes more powerful and easier so that everyone can ultimately bring their most creative ideas to life.\"\n\nLast week, the company previewed generative AI innovations for Adobe Premiere Pro video editing tool, and now the Color and composition generation is available for Photoshop.\n\nOn 15th April 2023, Adobe rolled out its range of the latest generative AI tools, which will be added to Premiere Pro later this year. These machines will enable creative fans to delete an object in the scene to prolong the takes and beyond.\n\nIn addition, Adobe is working on a model for a video AI service; hence, users can create videos with just a single sentence command. AI technology will also significantly integrate third-party generative AI video models like those from OpenAI, Pikalabs, and Runway into Premiere Pro.\n\nAccording to the IBD Stock Checkup, the ADBE stock's IBD Composite Rating is medium or ranks 54 compared to 99. IBD's Composite Rating adds up to five ratings, each one deeply researched and weighted, into a single convenient rating. The stocks with the most growth in composite must be 90 or better.\n\nLast year, the stock rose by 77%, and now it has slid by 22% this year (2024). The company followed the path of its AI Ethics principles - the responsibility to be accountable for one's actions, the commitment to act responsibly, and the guarantee of transparency. In Adobe's most recent study, 3 out of 4 American consumers feel it is crucial to know if online material was created with the help of AI systems.\n\nOne avenue the company can use to provide transparency around AI usage in Adobe's apps is that in the features powered by Firefly, users in Photoshop will automatically use Content Credentials to upload sounds, photos, and videos. Like a nutrition label that provides different information about the product to the consumers, content credentials provide metadata indicating that AI was used in the creation process or otherwise or that the information was modified after the original record.\n\nContent Credentials are based on open C2PA standards, and CAI supports an initiative founded in 2019 by Adobe to increase the trust between digital entities. In the current dynamics, the CAI has evolved to a global coalition of around 2500 members that includes tech companies, researchers, commercial entities, media outlets, and creative people, all in partnership to help improve the transparency involved in digital content.", "source": {"uri": "cryptorank.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoRank"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Premiere_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Premiere Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_editing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video editing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_editing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Image editing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Compositing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metadata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_(communication)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Media (communication)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Development_Frameworks", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Development Frameworks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Presentation", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Presentation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504321", "eventUri": "eng-9504321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

While Adobe had already started playing around with AI features, last year's release was the first one to properly be outfitted for the generative AI era. The new \"generative fill\" feature allowed you to use AI to change parts of an image, expand images, and overall edit images to your will using AI. Now, a better version of this feature is coming to Photoshop's upcoming 2025 release.\n\nAt MAX London, Adobe's big annual event, Adobe unveiled a new beta version of Photoshop, featuring advancements in Generative Fill and adding overall improvements to Photoshop with a bunch of extra new AI additions. All of this new stuff is powered by Adobe's new Firefly 3 AI model, which is more capable than its predecessors, and should result in not only new AI features, but also improvements to all the features you already had access to. Images and outputs generated by the model should look better, more realistic, have more detail, and the model should stick to your prompts more closely as well. It's not the only AI addition by Adobe to its software in recent memory, but Photoshop's AI features are perhaps among the most used.\n\nPhotoshop's AI generations weren't bad by any means, but as other image generation models like DALL-E 3 started landing, the outputs by Photoshop started to look a bit lacking in comparison, so this was a much needed improvement. It also enables new features such as Reference Image, Generate Image, Generate Similar, Generate Background, and Enhance Detail, providing users with tools to bring their creative visions to life quickly.\n\nGenerate Image allows users to just generate an image completely from scratch, like DALL-E 3 does, while Reference Image will allow you to take an existing image as reference for an AI generation. Generate Similar and Enhance Detail are also self-describing. Other additions include Adjustment Brush, Improved Font Browser, and Adjustment Presets.\n\nThe features are now available in the beta version of Photoshop, and if you want to play around with it, you can give it a spin on your computer now. The \"final\" version of these improvements will be landing later this year, so if you don't want to play with beta-grade software, you'll probably want to wait.\n\nSource: Adobe", "source": {"uri": "howtogeek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The How-To Geek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DALL-E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Books", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Books", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Methods_and_Techniques/Imaging_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Methods and Techniques/Imaging Science", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/53091354479_cdcb8de69f_o.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504321", "eventUri": "eng-9504321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

For the first time ever in the Photoshop app, users can now generate full images from scratch without ever needing to leave the program. The innovation is powered by the company's new Firefly Image 3 model, and comes alongside the abilities to generate backgrounds, upload reference images, and iterate on existing AI art.\n\nWhat is Adobe Firefly?\n\nFirefly is Adobe's own take on an AI art generator, and while it's been slightly integrated into Photoshop since last year, enabling features like the aspect ratio stretching generative expand, the ability to generate imagery from scratch has, until now, been restricted to the Firefly web app (barring some cheats with using generative fill on a blank canvas).\n\nFirefly differentiates itself from other AI art models by limiting its training data to stock photography and art that Adobe owns, with the goal being to make it safer for commercial use. Firefly Image 3 is the latest update to the model, promising \"higher-quality images\" with a greater focus on composition and lighting as well as better understanding of prompts.\n\nHow to use Photoshop to generate an AI image with a reference\n\nPhotoshop doesn't restrict you to generating images from scratch. You can also use an existing image to give the AI an idea of what to make.\n\nTo use a reference image when generating AI art in Photoshop, first generate a base image using the instructions above. Then, navigate to the Contextual Task Bar or Properties Panel and select Reference Image. Upload your image and run your prompt again to tweak it to better match your reference. Photoshop also comes with a number of its own reference images that you can use instead of an upload.\n\nHow to tweak AI art generated in Photoshop\n\nIncluded in the most recent Photoshop beta is a \"Generate Similar\" feature, which allows for slight tweaking of already generated AI images. Essentially, this works like the \"Reference Image\" feature, but allows you to use freshly generated images rather than requiring you to download and re-upload them.\n\nTo Generate Similar AI art, first follow the steps in this article's second subheading to generate an AI image from scratch. Then, select your image and click on Generate Similar from either the Contextual Task Bar or under the three dots icon in the Variations Panel. You'll be able to view your generated variations from the Properties Panel.\n\nJoining this new suite of AI features is the Adjustment Brush, which can apply non-destructive, non-AI-powered color and lighting edits to specific parts of an image.

You get features like auto-stylization, as well as structure and style references so you can create AI-generated images, akin to Microsoft's Image Creator from Designer.\n\nBut for Adobe, it's so much more than that. While the DALL-E 3-powered Designer has arrived for quite some time, Microsoft's Designer may not be as detailed as a graphic or image editing app as Photoshop.\n\nBesides being available on the Adobe Firefly website, this text-to-image model is also coming to the beta version of Photoshop, where you get features like better generative fill/generative background, as well as detail enhancer.\n\nIn the demo video, Adobe demonstrates that you can generate AI images inside Photoshop, then highlight a certain part of the new image to enhance it even further or change some details. Or, generate something similar if you're not happy with what it presents, automatically delete the background & regenerate it, and more.\n\n3.

Announced at MAX London, this update amplifies the creative capabilities available to users of all skill levels, effectively bridging the gap between a blank canvas and striking visual content.\n\nUnderpinning these powers is the all-new Firefly 3 artificial intelligence model, providing users with tools that allow for more detailed and varied visual expressions, while offering improvements in image detail, prompt understanding, and overall image quality. Advancements include photorealistic renderings with enhanced lighting and positioning, more nuanced text display, and faster processing times for more dynamic creative exploration.\n\nPrompt: \"An artist in her studio sitting at desk looking pensive with tons of paintings and ethereal atmosphere.\" Images courtesy of Adobe\n\nPrompt: \"Light leak photo of woman in black shade of light.\" Images courtesy of Adobe\n\nStarting on a blank slate won't feel so painful anymore with 'Generate Image', which brings full text-to-art abilities to Photoshop for the first time ever. You'll get to work on a canvas that begins with a desired graphic dreamed up using text prompts, and then add to it with further descriptions.\n\nFor a whole new scene altogether, 'Generate Background' gets the AI to whip up a fresh backdrop for your project, eliminating the need to hunt down stock photos or spend ages crafting one yourself.\n\nFeeling stuck on a design concept? 'Generate Similar' lets you take an existing image and create variations on it. Play with different color schemes, tweak the composition, or explore new ideas altogether, all within Photoshop.\n\nFor those who crave even more control, 'Reference Image' lets you use your own photos as a starting point. Let's say you have a portrait you like, but the background is rather drab. Use 'Reference Image' to feed the AI a picture of a dramatic mountain range, and it'll create a new image that blends your portrait with the new background.\n\nAdditionally, the 'Enhance Detail' feature sharpens and clarifies images, adding a final touch of refinement.\n\nPhotoshop has also rolled out practical tools such as the Adjustment Brush for targeted, non-destructive edits, an improved Font Browser providing access to over 25,000 Adobe fonts directly in the cloud, and Adjustment Presets for applying quick effects or saving customized settings.\n\n\"This massive new update to Photoshop takes creativity to unprecedented levels - whether you are a professional or brand new to Photoshop,\" shares Ashley Still, senior vice president of the Creative Product Group at Adobe. \"Through new Firefly-powered features in Photoshop, we are bringing ideation and creation closer together and making editing images both more powerful and approachable so everyone can realize their creative vision.\"\n\nThis update is currently available in the Photoshop desktop beta app, with a wider release planned for later this year.", "source": {"uri": "designtaxi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DesignTAXI"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mikelle_leow@designtaxi.com", "name": "Mikelle Leow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firefly (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canvas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorealism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photorealism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Font"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Books", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Graphics/Books", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Methods_and_Techniques/Imaging_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Methods and Techniques/Imaging Science", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://editorial.designtaxi.com/images/Adobe-Firefly-Model-3-Photoshop-1-1713935855.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504321", "eventUri": "eng-9504321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Users can create images from text prompts and make nuanced stylistic choices. New features include utilizing reference images, generating backgrounds, and making selective edits.\n\nToday, at its MAX London event, Adobe announced a new version of Photoshop Beta with a range of significant new features and improvements. Many of these upgrades rely on the Adobe Firefly Image 3 Foundation model, which the company also detailed today. Adobe says that Firefly Image 3 offers \"higher-quality image generations, better understanding of prompts, new levels of detail and variety, and significant improvements that enable fast creative expression and ideation.\" It also claims that photorealistic quality is improved with better lighting positioning, detail, text display, and more.\n\nRelated Google Photos Magic Editor: How the AI editor works and where you can get it Bad Photoshop skills? No worries. Google's new Magic Editor uses gen AI to erase and replace parts of your photo. But that's not all it can do.\n\nI've been playing around with Photoshop Beta since the announcement to test out just how great these new features may be. While there were more announcements than just these, below are five of the best new features. Remember, though, that these are just available in Photoshop Beta, not regular Photoshop. You can get the Beta version or update your existing Beta app in the Adobe Cloud app.\n\n1 Image creation from text prompts\n\nCreate wild images from scratch using just text.\n\nWhile most know Photoshop's AI features best for its ability to fill in or replace areas of images automatically, it can now create something entirely from scratch. The new Photoshop Generate Image feature acts like any other AI image generator. You enter a text prompt, and it will generate an image based on that.\n\nClose\n\nFor the images above, I used the prompt \"photorealistic grizzly bear lounging in a hot tub outside of a Spanish-style mansion with palm trees and a beach in the background.\" I then tested out the ability to choose options that influence style. First, you can select between art and photo. I tried both in my albeit brief testing and had plenty of \"Photo\" versions that were less photorealistic than the \"Art\" versions, so I'm not sure how reliable this will actually be for the time being.\n\nYou can also choose from quite a few more specific stylistic options. Those include different categories, including art materials (charcoal, claymation, etc.), techniques (double exposure, palette knife, fresco, etc.), effects (bokeh effect, dark, etc.), and more. I didn't test all of them, but they do promise to change the final output significantly, though some are definitely more subtle.\n\nI also tested out creating a complete portrait from scratch, simply with a prompt of \"portrait of a woman in a studio setting with simple lighting.\" Sure enough, it provided a photo-quality portrait of a woman in the studio. Then, knowing hands are usually the tell for AI, I tried asking for a full-body portrait in a studio setting. It didn't quite listen, with two of the three results only from the waist up and the one that was full-body, including for portraits in one. Overall, it was impressive, but there are still the telltale signs of AI in the hands.\n\n2 Use reference images\n\nUse example images to guide the AI results\n\nAnother new feature related to Firefly Image 3 is the ability to utilize reference photos. You can either upload your own (Adobe warns you that you need the right to use the image) or use suggested Adobe Stock images. It tends to stick to that reference image pretty closely, though, paying more attention to that than your text prompt. For example, I tried the same bear prompt I did above. Without any reference images, it did an alright job. Then, when I selected a randomly suggested stock image of a painted windmill, it completely ignored the photorealistic part and created a very painterly style image.\n\n3 Replace and generate backgrounds\n\nTurn existing images into something totally new.\n\nWhile you could already remove backgrounds in Photoshop, automatically adding and generating new ones was not possible. That is now available in Photoshop Beta, though. I took this photo of my dog on the beach and removed the background, then provided a prompt of \"a living room with a couch\" for the Generate Background option. It was pretty vague, so I really didn't expect much, but was completely blown away by the results.\n\nOne of the most useful applications of this is for product photographers who want to take one image of their product but replace the background so they don't have to take multiple images. I tried it out on an image of some watches that I took for a review. It took a few tries of fine-tuning my prompt, but then I was able to get some results that I was pretty happy with. There are still some issues with the shadows, but if you aren't paying close attention, it's definitely passable.\n\n1:03 Related How to use Photoshop Generative Fill: Use AI on your images Generative fill is a powerful tool for editing your images.\n\n4 Generate variations\n\nCreate similar iterations of an image you like without extra fuss.\n\nWhile Adobe's AI always provides at least a few options for each prompt, it now adds the option to \"Generate Similar.\" With this feature, you can choose the result you like the most, and it will then use that to create more options. This allows you to really narrow in on a result that hits what you are looking for. It also means that you can create similar versions of the same image that could be used in different types of marketing content, for example. I used the same watch image as above, and it actually gave me a more polished result that I like more.\n\n5 Selectively make changes with the Adjustment Brush\n\nPaint on adjustments without permanently changing your image.\n\nThe new release also included some non-AI features. Lightroom users have long had access to the Adjustment Brush, but now the feature has made its way to Photoshop Beta. The brush allows you to paint on adjustments to individual parts of images. If you wanted to do this before, you would have to create a layer that impacted the entire image, add a layer mask, and brush out the areas you didn't want to have that adjustment (or some variation of this).\n\nNow, using a brush, you can choose between adjustments like curves, exposure, levels, brightness and contrast, color balance, and more.

ADBE stock rose in early trading.\n\nAt the company's Max London conference, Adobe introduced its latest Photoshop advancements, including tools for generating similar images from a photo and creating photo backgrounds with text commands. It also showed how it can create more complex and detailed images from simple prompts.\n\nThe new AI tools are powered by Adobe Firefly Image 3 Foundation Model. They are available now in beta testing and will be generally available later this year.\n\n\"This massive new update to Photoshop takes creativity to unprecedented levels -- whether you are a professional or brand new to Photoshop,\" Ashley Still, senior vice president, Creative Product Group at Adobe, said in a news release. \"Through new Firefly-powered features in Photoshop, we are bringing ideation and creation closer together and making editing images both more powerful and approachable so everyone can realize their creative vision.\"\n\nIn premarket trades on the stock market today, ADBE stock rose 0.5% to 469.10.\n\nSince Adobe launched Firefly in March 2023, users have generated over 7 billion images, the company said.\n\nThe new generative AI tools for Photoshop come a week after Adobe previewed generative AI innovations for its Adobe Premiere Pro video-editing software.\n\nOn April 15, Adobe debuted new generative AI tools coming to Premiere Pro later this year. Those tools will allow creative pros to remove objects in a scene, extend a shot and more.\n\nAdobe also is developing a video model for Firefly so users can generate videos with simple text commands. It also plans to bring third-party generative AI video models from OpenAI, Pika Labs and Runway directly into Premiere Pro.\n\nADBE stock has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 54 out of 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. IBD's Composite Rating combines five separate proprietary ratings into one easy-to-use rating. The best growth stocks have a Composite Rating of 90 or better.\n\nAfter rising 77% in 2023, ADBE stock is down about 22% year to date in 2024.\n\nFollow Patrick Seitz on X, formerly Twitter, at @IBD_PSeitz for more stories on consumer technology, software and semiconductor stocks.\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE:\n\nStreaming Music Leader Spotify Tops Earnings Target In First Quarter\n\nCadence Design Systems Stock Drops On Weak Q2 Guidance\n\nNetflix Stock Tumbles On Soft Guidance, Reduced Disclosure\n\nMarketSurge: Research, Charts, Data And Coaching All In One Place", "source": {"uri": "investors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investor's Business Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_seitz@investors.com", "name": "Patrick Seitz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Firefly (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Premiere_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Premiere Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Seitz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Seitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadence_Design_Systems", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cadence Design Systems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Development_Frameworks", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Development Frameworks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/AutoCAD", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/AutoCAD", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Presentation", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Presentation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Stock-Adobe-Generate-Portal_company.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504321", "eventUri": "eng-9504321", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-15", "textStart": 1528, "textEnd": 1536}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Today, Adobe just made it better -- and spun off several additional features that complement Generative Fill, too.\n\nAdobe added what it calls the \"Firefly Image 3 Model\" to its Firefly image-generation service as well as to Photoshop -- at least the beta. Firefly is a text-to-image generator, trained on Adobe stock imagery to avoid complaints that it's been trained on artists' work without permission.\n\nIt's difficult to show exactly how Firefly Image 3 differs from earlier models, but this is what Adobe has to say: \"This combination delivers considerably better photographic image quality, precise controls to inform your outputs, prompt comprehension to understand complex descriptions, and generation variety to explore different results.\"\n\nYou might wonder why a journalist would use AI to alter images. It's true that I use it sparingly; one of my favorite features within the Windows' Photos app has been Spot Fill, which uses AI to get rid of any spare specks of dust that might coat a laptop or USB-C hub. That's now been replaced by Generative Erase.\n\nThe broader point is that we need art to illustrate our stories, when art isn't always available. My editors would prefer that I use real images of products, or logos. But those might be just tiny images tucked away on a website or within a PowerPoint presentation. Could I enlarge them? Sure. But that might make them look grainy or odd. What to do?\n\nIn this case, I'll take a chip image or logo, \"remove\" it from the presentation, then expand the size. Here's where Generative Fill comes in: Photoshop's \"crop\" tool can actually \"expand\" the boundaries of an image, which allows me to effectively enlarge the total scene. Most readers aren't going to care about the background of an image, as long as the product is portrayed accurately. Generative Fill allows me to create a neutral though unique background in case I need it.\n\nAll I need to do is \"crop out\" from an image and let Generative Fill do its work. Counterintuitively, I do not enter a prompt; I just let it extend the image.\n\nThe other point, too, is that Generative Fill works quickly and accurately. I don't have to \"lasso\" an object and maneuver it around, hoping I've captured every pixel accurately. Photoshop's AI understands what (if anything) it needs to remove, and generates a replacement. It's important to note that I and other editors still frame shots of, say, laptops with an eye toward simply cropping down an existing backdrop, rather than replacing it with something that's artificially generated. (Teams, Zoom, Google Meet, and others do that on video calls!)\n\nGenerative Fill does allow you to specify what Photoshop fills in, such as adding a castle to the background of a beach scene. But it's always had to work from what it guesses from your prompt. Even suggesting three options can be unsatisfying.\n\nNow, Generative Fill can work from a reference image that you specify, which makes sense: \"Make it look like this\" is a perfectly valid way of describing something.\n\nThere's more. When Adobe's Generative Fill suggests new AI art, it gives you a choice of three options. Generate Similar works like Reference Image: It allows you to use one of the suggestions as a reference image, and iterate on that.\n\nBut it's also true that Adobe has wanted you to use Photoshop to edit an image, not create one wholesale. (You could already do that in Firefly, but would then have to import it. You could also use Generative Fill to add elements to an existing image.) Now you can go to Generate Image in the Contextual Task Bar on a blank canvas, or to Edit > Generate Image on the Tools panel and start from scratch.\n\nThis feels overdue. Otherwise, this looks like many of the other image generation tools on the market. Photoshop even adds \"upscaling,\" of a sort, through a feature called Enhance Detail. Essentially, this uses AI to produce sharper images.\n\nFinally, Photoshop also allows you to remove and then generate a new background. Essentially, it's removing the steps of selecting a foreground subject, removing it, creating a new background mask, and adding it in.\n\nFor years, I hesitated to use Photoshop for two reasons: One, I wasn't sure how much I should edit reality, and two, it was so dang complicated and time-consuming to use.

This development is part of Adobe's Content Authenticity Initiative. The new AI tools suite also includes Generate Background for creating new background images for product photography, and Enhance Detail for improving image clarity and sharpness.\n\nThe third iteration of Adobe's Firefly model promises superior image generation capabilities in comparison to its predecessor. It excels at interpreting lengthy descriptive text prompts, and can generate clearer text within images. This model is open for public testing outside of Photoshop through the Firefly web application. The AI tools suite also includes Generate Similar and Generate Image, which allow users to create similar content or an entire image from a text description, respectively.\n\nAdobe is enhancing Photoshop with new standard tools designed to expedite creative processes. These include an Adjustment Brush for making non-destructive changes like color adjustments to specific parts of an image.

However, the upgrades aren't immune to some of the pitfalls associated with AI, occasionally yielding humorous results.\n\nAdobe's new AI-based foundation model, Firefly Image 3, is now in beta. Available in Photoshop and the Firefly web app, the update enhances the performance of the company's generative AI tools and introduces new methods for creating and editing images.\n\nIntroduced last year, Firefly utilizes AI to add or remove objects from pictures, alter surfaces, expand images to wider aspect ratios, and make other modifications. The primary focal points for Firefly Image 3 are style and consistency. Users can now generate pictures in a wider variety of styles or instruct the software to produce new images in a style similar to a reference.\n\nThe lighting in realistic pictures should now be more accurate. Furthermore, the new version of Firefly can comprehend longer and more complex prompts more accurately than its predecessor.\n\nPhotoshop's generative fill tool, which many users amusingly used to expand iconic album covers last year, gains several new functions from Firefly Image 3. Adobe's most popular image-editing software now features text-to-image generation for the first time, and users can also generate backgrounds for existing pictures.\n\nMoreover, they can enhance details for a sharper image and iterate on creations by requesting similar outputs. Adobe's demonstration video (above) makes Photoshop's new tools appear seamless, but one user recently discovered that they can still lead to unexpected results.\n\nDeveloper and animator Nina Nikolic attempted to use generative fill to expand the aspect ratio of a photo of herself in which her shoulder was cut off. However, when she asked the AI model to improve how it filled in the shoulder, it instead generated an entire extra person - a naked man - next to her picture. Another attempt resulted in a hideously deformed giant face.\n\nIn related news, Adobe researchers recently unveiled their work on an AI-based video super-resolution tool. The technology, called VideoGigaGAN, shares the same goal as Nvidia's RTX Video Super Resolution - making low-resolution footage appear cleaner on high-resolution displays.

They are instead creations generated by Adobe's new Model 3 generative AI on Firefly.\n\nAdobe has been using some form of AI for years, whether it is the spot removal tool or the magic wand, however, the new generative capabilities of AI have kicked things up a notch, enabling the generation of photorealistic images from a single prompt. Adobe is not the only, or by no means the first software program, to offer this kind of image generation but the announcement at Adobe Max that Firefly will be introduced to Photoshop, places this generative tool in the hands of many more people - and I am not sure what this means for the industry or the wider implications of content consumption in general.\n\n* See our guides for the best AI image generators\n\nIn a world where it is already difficult to believe everything you see or hear on social media, the addition of generating seemingly real images can be a dangerous one and one that I think more people should be aware of. As you can see from these images the ability to resemble real objects and people is coming out the other side of the uncanny valley and is wholly believable, and if you are quickly scrolling through social media, even more so.\n\nI am not for one minute calling for a ban on this kind of technology, as it is a fantastic creative tool that is producing some amazing art, and even acting as an idea generator. Adobe has made retouching, editing, and video editing much easier and has simplified many aspects of post-production via AI. I am personally excited by where AI might take us, especially in terms of video generation and video post-processing.\n\nI am instead expressing concern for those unaware of the capabilities of this technology, and urge more scrutiny in questioning image validity and sources more rigorously. This is even more of a concern with large political elections on the horizon.\n\nThankfully this is also a concern for official organizations that have created bills and policies that deter false news and challenge the authenticity of images, but at present, this is easy to bypass.\n\nAdobe is an example of a company doing its part by issuing strict guidelines that stop the generation of images that could be used for harm or social manipulation, however, some aren't as rigid.\n\nI think that is also worth noting that some of these images would not look out of place among a shortlist of photography competitions. Suppose these images can be created by typing a sentence into a search bar. In that case, you may start to see these photographs feature more prominently on social media or competitions themselves, with no statement of AI involvement.\n\nIt is also worth pointing out that the current iteration of this sort of image and video generation is the worst it will ever be, and will only become more realistic and believable!", "source": {"uri": "digitalcameraworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "digitalcameraworld"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kalum_carter@digitalcameraworld.com", "name": "Kalum Carter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Firefly (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorealism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photorealism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(illusion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magic (illusion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photograph_manipulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photograph manipulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrolling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scrolling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_editing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video editing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-production", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Post-production"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uncanny valley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_post-processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video post-processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horizon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Methods_and_Techniques", "label": "dmoz/Science/Methods and Techniques", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Methods_and_Techniques/Imaging_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Methods and Techniques/Imaging Science", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3AxPPeTeRGRpdwrwFDkR4X-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9504321", "eventUri": "eng-9504321", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

The company is betting on this tool since its latest updates, and programs like Adobe Premiere or Adobe Acrobat have become more useful and practical than ever thanks to AI.\n\nHowever, the programs where AI stands out the most are Photoshop and Lightroom. These two applications have been the trusted tools of photographers and image editors for decades, but now they have reached a new level thanks to their unique features.\n\nEditing images has never been so fast and fun. Now you can use applications like Generative Fill in Photoshop, which allows you to fill gaps in your images to adjust them to the aspect ratio you need, as well as fix any previous errors you may have overlooked, and of course, create unique images from scratch without the need for external programs.\n\nLightroom doesn't fall behind either. The photo editing application has added AI in a very detailed way. As soon as you include a new photo in the program, the AI analyzes it and recommends the best filters and settings to bring out the best in it and, in the process, save you hours of tests that lead nowhere.\n\nFrom color to saturation, all parameters can be balanced with AI, and it even allows you to remove grain from darker images quickly and uniquely. Certainly, the possibilities of AI in Adobe systems are endless, and it has become an essential tool for professionals in all disciplines.

This allows Firefly 3 to automatically apply a wide variety of styles, colors, backgrounds, and poses to your AI-generated imagery. It gives creatives much more control and personalisation over the look and feel.\n\nThe Structure Reference and Style Reference tools are also getting a big boost. Structure Reference lets you generate new images that perfectly match the layout and composition of a reference image, avoiding the trial-and-error of trying to craft the ideal text prompt. Style Reference then applies your desired artistic style with higher fidelity.\n\nCombining these two features allows you to essentially remix existing images into entirely new artistic compositions based on the structure and aesthetic you specify. Adobe says this enables much faster creative ideation and exploration.\n\nOf course, improved image quality is a central focus. Firefly 3 renders human features, expressions, crowds, and complex structures with vastly more realism. It also better understands conversational text prompts to more accurately depict detailed scenes. Even text rendering quality within the images has been enhanced.\n\nIllustrations, icons, and line art are getting refinements too. The new model produces a much wider range of illustration styles for things like logos, graphics, and concept art.\n\nFirefly Image 3 is launching today in beta via Adobe's web app, with integration coming soon to apps like Photoshop, Express, Illustrator, and InDesign. Both free and paid plans are available that include usage credits for AI generation.\n\nThe company emphasises that Firefly was trained exclusively on licensed stock content to avoid intellectual property issues.

Adobe has made this task bar even more central to the Photoshop experience by presenting users with a prompt to generate a full image whenever they open a blank canvas.\n\nThis UX change seems to go against Adobe's previous stance on generative AI. Instead of framing AI as an add-on utility that makes mundane tasks easier, Firefly is now a core feature right from the start. The new prompt box aims to alleviate the fear of a blank canvas. It's a smart new direction that will appeal to in particular to amateurs, or the would-be Canva users who want to graduate from the online platform into something bigger and more powerful.\n\nPhotoshop's new AI features will make everyone happy, even the hardest of Photoshop's hardcore users.

The report states that City are seeking damages.\n\nThe two organisations are already set for a game-defining hearing later this year over the 115 rule breaches that City have been accused of by the Premier League. And it is claimed that top-flight clubs are concerned that success in this case could strengthen City's hand for that hearing. They deny all 115 charges.\n\nCity are claimed to have argued that the APT rules - introduced in 2021 in the wake of the Newcastle United takeover - are against competition law, as well as being discriminatory to clubs with ties to the Gulf region and clubs that are based outside of London. As well as looking to end the rules, the club are also said to be seeking damages for money they have not been able to make since the 'unlawful' rules were brought in.\n\nALSO READ: \"I have to think\": Kevin De Bruyne casts doubt on Man City future\n\nALSO READ: Guardiola's dream coaching team and the coveted Man City blueprint rivals love\n\nThe two-week hearing starting on Monday will have ramifications across the Premier League and ups the stakes between City and the league before the pair battle it out in their charges hearing later this year. The most serious allegations the Blues are defending themselves against in that matter relate to whether or not they provided genuine details of sponsorship deals.\n\nThe hearing into their 115 alleged breaches is believed to be going ahead in the autumn. It has been alleged that City concealed payments made by their owner Sheikh Mansour through third parties and disguised them as sponsorship revenue, which in itself was inflated.\n\nIf rules around related party transactions are now deemed unlawful, it could significantly strengthen City's defence at the hearing later this year.

Now, they're suing the Premier League.\n\nIt has been reported by The Times that the Citizens have launched an unprecedented legal action against the Premier League, triggering a civil war between the country's biggest clubs.\n\nCity have been involved in legal disputes for a long-time, not least their unresolved 115 alleged breaches of Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations, but this matter threatens to impact even that.\n\nSo what exactly is the legal action about and could it change football in England forever?\n\nCity are attempting to get rid of the league's Associated Party Transaction (APT) rules, which, in a 165 page legal document, they argue are unlawful, 'discriminatory' and were brought in by the 'tyranny of the majority'.\n\nThe rules were introduced in December 2021 soon after the Saudi Arabia-led takeover of Newcastle and prevent clubs from inflating commercial deals with companies linked to their owners, effectively allowing them to spend an unlimited amount on transfers and improving infrastructure.\n\nSince 2008, City have been run by the Abu Dhabi United Group, owned by Sheikh Mansour, a member of the United Arab Emirates' royal family.\n\nWhile they are not the only club to use sponsors closely linked with their owners, they are by far the most notable, with four of their top ten sponsors having ties to the UAE, including stadium and shirt sponsor Etihad Airways.\n\nAdditionally, Pep Guardiola's side are suing for damages and are arguing that the system by which Premier League clubs vote for rule changes is broken.\n\nImplementing changes currently requires a two-thirds majority (14 out of the 20).\n\nIf they win their claim, clubs will no longer have to have their sponsorship deals independently assessed and approved, thus theoretically allowing them to pump as much money into the club as possible without breaking financial fair play rules.\n\nRival clubs fear this will irreparably damage the competitiveness of the Premier League, with state-owned clubs like City and Newcastle able to spend far greater than anyone else.\n\nThe remaining 19 clubs have been invited to take part in the legal process, with at least half stepping forward to aid the Premier League's case, while one has sided with City.\n\nNevertheless, there is fear that the Citizens will win having spared no expense on their legal team.\n\nThe dispute will be settled in a private arbitration hearing which will begin on Monday, 10 June.\n\nIt is expected to last two weeks.\n\nA separate hearing into the 115 charges will take place in November and will last six weeks.\n\nCity were charged with breaking financial rules over a nine-year period from 2009 to 2018 but have always strongly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nWhile separate cases, the first hearing will have a huge impact on the second, as if they win, it will damage the case against them with sponsorship deals linked to the UAE a fundamental part of the alleged breaches.\n\nEven if they lose, the Premier League is being forced to invest heavily in their legal team for the June hearing, potentially diverting attention away from the November one.\n\nShould City be found guilty of breaching FFP rules, they could face fines, points deductions or relegation.", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri":

or two-thirds of those who vote - to implement rule changes gives the majority unacceptable levels of control.\n\nIt is claimed that the remaining 19 Premier League clubs 'have been invited to participate in the legal action' launched by Man City, and between 10 and 12 teams have already come forward to provide either witness statements or a letter detailing evidence in support of the league's defence.\n\nNeither Man City nor the Premier League are yet to comment on the reports at this stage.\n\nID:545176:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect5211:", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_thomas@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Oliver Thomas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Financial_Fair_Play_Regulations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_First_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football League First Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyranny of the majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/24/20/manchester-city_2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624062", "eventUri": "eng-9624062", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 2184, "textEnd": 2191}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

For example, Abu Dhabi-owned City have United Arab Emirates airline Etihad Airways as their stadium and shirt sponsor, while Newcastle and Chelsea also have agreements with companies linked to their majority investors.\n\nSuch transactions have to be independently assessed to be of \"fair market value\".\n\nCity, who have won an unprecedented four Premier League titles in a row and six of the last seven, believe the financial rules are anti-competitive. Their case also includes a variety of other complaints against various legislature imposed by the governing body.\n\nA two-week private arbitration hearing, which is due to start on Monday, will put City on course with many of their Premier League rivals with the one-time European champions arguing the league's democratic system of needing at least 14 clubs to implement rule changes gives the majority a level of control they deem as unacceptable.\n\nThe Times states that an 165-page legal document prepared by City claims they are the victims of \"discrimination against Gulf ownership\" and that the Associated Party Transaction rules were approved by rivals to stop their domination of the Premier League and are a \"tyranny of the majority\".\n\nWhile it is claimed at least one Premier League club has submitted a written statement in support of City, more than half are said to be on the side of the governing body. City filed the case in February with written statements having to be submitted before the end of March.\n\nShould City be successful in their legal battle, it would mean the richest clubs could value their sponsorship deals without independent assessment from the Premier League. And it would potentially weaken the case of the Premier League regarding City's 115 charges of alleged financial misconduct. If found guilty, City - who have always denied any wrongdoing - could face massive fines, points deductions or even relegation.\n\nThe case isn't the first time City have hinted at discrimination within the Premier League. In October 2022, one national newspaper reported Etihad insiders believed comments from then Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp were \"borderline xenophobic\" when stating \"there are three clubs in world football who can do what they want financially\" - an implicit reference to City and fellow Gulf-owned clubs Newcastle and Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nKlopp later refuted such claims with the Football Association believing there was no cause to charge the German, a stance backed by anti-discrimination groups.\n\nThe ECHO has contacted the Premier League for a comment.", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ian_doyle@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Ian Doyle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arne_Slot", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arne Slot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etihad_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Etihad Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arbitration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyranny of the majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xenophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article29293619.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1995443234.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624062", "eventUri": "eng-9624062", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The charges against City, who deny wrongdoing, include 54 failures to provide accurate financial information 2009-10 to 2017-18, 14 failures to provide accurate details for player and manager payments from 2009-10 to 2017-18, five failures to comply with Uefa's rules including Financial Fair Play (FFP) 2013-14 to 2017-18, seven breaches of the Premier League's PSR rules 2015-16 to 2017-18 and 35 failures to co-operate with Premier League investigations December 2018-February 2023.\n\nPotential expulsion from the league is among available punishments should the club be found guilty. The case cannot go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), but either side could appeal, prompting speculation the saga could take years yet to be resolved.\n\nIn a 2020 judgement, Uefa banned City from the Champions League for two seasons and fined them 30m euros. However, the punishment was overturned by Cas.\n\nThe separate legal case against APTs came to light as Premier League clubs prepare to meet in Harrogate on Thursday for their AGM.

The outcome could drastically change the outlook on the professional game.\n\nAccording to The Times, City will attempt to end the APT regulations, which they claim are unlawful and were approved by rival clubs in an attempt to stifle their success. It's argued the rules are designed to stop clubs from inflating commercial deals with companies that relate to owners.\n\nThe rule was integrated in the wake of the Saudi-led Newcastle takeover to maintain the competitiveness of the Premier League. Instead, now sponsorship deals have to be independently assessed and will only be approved if they are considered as 'fair market value' to the rest of the division.\n\nREAD MORE: Newcastle United Eze and Olise transfer claim after England debut\n\nREAD MORE: Newcastle confirm exciting deal ahead of Adidas launch after Mike Ashley battle\n\nIf City are successful with their claim - which the report states some clubs fear they will be - it would allow them to boost the amount of money they can raise via commercial revenue. It means others, such as Newcastle, can benefit from deals generated from partners close to the ownership group.\n\nCity would be able to spend more on players, at a time when teams elsewhere are struggling to operate and spend more under strict Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR). The report says that the other 19 Premier League teams have been invited to participate in the legal action, with up to 12 stepping forward.\n\nThis comes amid a separate battle between City and the Premier League relating to the 115 alleged breaches of financial rules between 2009 and 2023. That hearing, expected to start in November and last six weeks, could lead to massive fines and even relegation for City.\n\nIt was reported last week that Pep Guardiola will leave City at the end of next season when his contract expires. This is after the Spaniard confirmed back in November that he would stay at the club even if they relegated down to League One due to the potential implications of the hearing.\n\n\"In the moment we are innocent until guilt is proven. I know the people want it. I know, I feel it. I will wait,\" Guardiola said at the time.\n\n\"Wait and see it and after the sentence has been done we will come here and explain it. But absolutely I will not consider my future [if] it depends [on] being here or being in League One. Absolutely. There is more chance to stay if we are in League One than if we were in the Champions League.\"", "source": {"uri": "chroniclelive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chronicle Live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kieran_king@chroniclelive.co.uk", "name": "Kieran King", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Olise", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Olise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Ashley_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Ashley (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_League_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL League One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Informal_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Informal Sports", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article29280671.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2066580593.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624062", "eventUri": "eng-9624062", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The regulations were instigated to prevent clubs from overly benefitting from commercial deals from companies that are linked to the club's ownership.\n\nWhilst introduced to prevent Newcastle from signing massive sponsorship deals with Saudi companies, City - owned by United Arab Emirates royalty in the shape of Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan - have also been impacted given their ongoing commercial deals with a number of UAE corporations including Etihad Airways, who sponsor their stadium.\n\nNow City have decided to sue as they feel the rules are \"restrictive and anti-competitive\". A two-week private arbitration will start on Monday - as confirmed by The Times. City are looking for the ATP rules to be scrapped, which would also allow them to sue the league for damages.\n\nEvery Premier League club is aware of the impending action as City are also pointing to the fact that the league's majority brought through the rules to as a clear sign of \"discrimination against Gulf ownership\" due to the fact they were brought as a reaction to Newcastle's takeover.\n\nThe other clubs are able to put forward evidence or statements backing City or the Premier League.\n\nThis lawsuit should not be confused with City's other legal battle with the Premier League as they are charged with 115 breaches of the league's regulations and Financial Fair Play rules (FFP).\n\nCity have always strenuously denied the allegations that were first alleged in 2018 and sources state they are 'confident' that they will not be facing any punishments - such as that have been seen in the Premier League this season with the likes of Everton and Nottingham Forest both being hit with points penalties.\n\nWe spoke to leading sports lawyer and partner at Leathes Prior, Dan Chapman about City's impending action and what it could mean for football.\n\n\"It is very difficult to properly assess the true nature of this particular dispute between Man City and the Premier League as these are arbitration proceedings, which are held in private and are confidential.\n\n\"Whilst clearly there has been a leak to the media of some aspects of these proceedings, we do need to measure any commentary with a note of caution that we do not yet fully appreciate what the proceedings are contending. That said, it is not surprising to hear that Man City would wish to contest the APT rules as they now are, but one would suspect that even if such a challenge is successful, it ought not to alter the position in relation to most of the disciplinary charges which relate to the period prior to the APT rules being introduced.\n\n\"Whether a win in these proceedings would give Man City some tactical litigation advantage, or moral high ground, that boosts their defence to the disciplinary charges is another matter - it certainly would not harm them.\"", "source": {"uri": "hitc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HITC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "graeme_bailey@hitc.com", "name": "Graeme Bailey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansour_bin_Zayed_Al_Nahyan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Financial_Fair_Play_Regulations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etihad_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Etihad Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arbitration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham_Forest_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham Forest F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Informal_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Informal Sports", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.hitc.com/static/uploads/2024/06/Rodri-Premier-League-1024x576.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624062", "eventUri": "eng-9624062", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

City have appointed three KCs - Lord Pannick, supported by Paul Harris and Rob Williams, to lead the case.\n\nCity are seeking \"damages for the losses which it has incurred as a result of the unlawfulness of the FMV [fair market value] rules\", their case says, adding that the aim is led by rival clubs to \"safeguard their own commercial advantages\".\n\nThe rules were \"deliberately intended to stifle commercial freedoms of particular clubs in particular circumstances, and thus to restrict economic competition\", the claim reportedly says.\n\n\"There is no rational or logical connection between a club's financial non-sustainability and its receipt of revenues from entities linked to ownerships,\" City state.\n\nCity filed their claim, which includes a demand for damages, on February 16, around a week after club shareholders voted through a toughening of the rules.\n\nThe other 19 clubs have been invited to participate in the legal action, with 12 already stepping forward to support the Premier League's defence, it is claimed.\n\nCompetition executives had narrowly won approval in February to strengthen terms first implemented in 2021 to ensure fair market value on sponsors and transfers.\n\nA total of 12 clubs finally backed the changes, with two clubs abstaining. \"It's hardly an endorsement,\" added one dissenting executive.\n\n\"Following a full review of the existing associated party transactions rules and fair market value assessment protocols, clubs agreed to a series of amendments to further enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the system,\" the league said.\n\nTeams with close partnerships with other clubs internationally - such as Chelsea, Newcastle, City and Manchester United - had most at stake from a redrafting in the rules. City had been among eight clubs to vote down a temporary ban on loans between connected teams for January at the last meeting of the competition.\n\nThe 12-strong global City Football Group is the biggest empire in the game, but other English club ownerships are looking to follow suit.\n\nCity are separately contesting profit and sustainability charges, with a hearing taking place in October or November. The charges against City, who deny wrongdoing, include 54 failures to provide accurate financial information 2009-10 to 2017-18, 14 failures to provide accurate details for player and manager payments from 2009-10 to 2017-18, five failures to comply with Uefa's rules including Financial Fair Play (FFP) 2013-14 to 2017-18, seven breaches of the Premier League's PSR rules 2015-16 to 2017-18 and 35 failures to co-operate with Premier League investigations December 2018 - Feb 2023.\n\nPotential expulsion from the league is among available punishments should the club be found guilty. The case cannot go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas), but either side could appeal, prompting speculation the saga could take years yet to be resolved.\n\nIn a 2020 judgement, Uefa banned City from the Champions League for two seasons and fined them 30m euros. However, the punishment was overturned by Cas.\n\nThe separate legal case against APTs came to light as Premier League clubs prepare to meet in Harrogate on Thursday for their AGM.

The tribunal is set to last two weeks and comes as both sides are preparing for November's long-awaited hearing on City's 115 charges of alleged rule-breaking related to financial fair play.\n\nCity's legal challenge centres on associated party transaction (APT) rules. APTs, in which clubs strike sponsorship or revenue deals with businesses linked to their owners, have been the subject of scrutiny from the league for some time. In February clubs voted to approve tougher rules regarding how such deals are valued. A requirement to assess fair market value for APTs has been challenged by City, who are reported to have argued it contravenes competition law.\n\nIn another claim reported to form part of the suit, City are taking aim at the League's voting rules. The requirement that 14 of 20 clubs must vote in favour of any proposal in order for it to be adopted has long been hailed as one of the competition's strengths, meaning that clubs must align behind any change before it is implemented. According to the Times, however, City's suit claims the voting system preserves \"the tyranny of the majority\".\n\nAccording to its report between 10 and 12 top flight clubs have responded to a league request for submissions in support of its rules. One club is meanwhile reported to have provided testimony in support of City's claim. The takeover of Newcastle United by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund in 2021 had previously occasioned hurried attempts by clubs to change APT rules.\n\nCity's new legal claim is reported to have been filed in February, with the Premier League informing its clubs of the matter in March. It will be seen as a steep increase in hostilities between City and the competition in which they have won six of the past seven titles, and puts further strain on the Premier League, which has been attempting to deal with multiple governance issues from improved financial regulations to the government's plans for an independent regulator for English football.\n\nThe Premier League did not comment.

The full 115 charge list was revealed in a Premier League statement in February 2023.\n\nCity allegedly face multiple breaches of FFP throughout multiple seasons, which makes the list of potential breaches longer and has resulted with the club being charged with a whopping 115 breaches of FFP regulations.\n\nAll the charges faced by Manchester City are serious and if they are proved to have broken all or some of these charges, serious repercussions should be expected.\n\nThe charges against the club will be investigated, reviewed and analysed by an independent commission.\n\nManchester City - 115 FFP Charges Type of breachNumber of charges relating to breachDate of trial Date of decision Failure to provide accurate and up-to-date financial information from 2009-10 to 2017-18 54

League investigations from December 2018-present 35 Charges explained\n\nThe first alleged breach and the breach which City face the most charges from claims that from every season from 2009-10 to 2017-18, the Manchester side failed to follow the rules that states that member clubs must provide accurate financial information to the league.\n\nThis allows the FFP a 'true and fair' view of a club's revenue which includes sponsorship deals and their operating cost, which involve player salaries.\n\nEvery club in the Premier League signs up to a code of compliance, which essentially translates to clubs agreeing to behave themselves and provide the league with accurate and up-to-date accounts that are expected to be audited each year.\n\nOver the past few year's City have been accused of inflating the value of their sponsorships which are connected to their owners.\n\nAnother charge which City face accuses City of not being truthful in the reporting of the compensating they handed out to leaving managers over the course of multiple seasons.\n\nThey also face accusations of reducing the cost of player and coach salaries by introducing a third party who paid a portion of the wages.\n\nAll of City's 115 charges were first reported by German outlet, Der Spiegel.\n\nMan City manager Pep Guardiola (second from left) with club owners Sheikh Mansour (right)\n\nCharges include not being truthful about compensation offered to previous managers as they were leaving the club\n\nTimeline of the 115 charges coming to light November 2018: German media, Der Speigel outlet

to be reached Trial and potential punishments\n\nThe legal trial between Manchester City and the Premier League is set to get underway this Autumn, 2024.\n\nThe trial will be heard in private as the Premier League rule regarding FFP breaches states that any ruling before an independent commission will be held in private and will be strictly confidential.\n\nAs the trial is to take place behind closed doors, it means Media outlets will learn no knowledge of the case until a final verdict is revealed by the Premier League.\n\nTherefore the media will learn of the ruling at the same time as everybody else.\n\nIn relation to punishments, the current legislation has eight potential punishments for a club who have been found to of breached FFP rules.\n\nLike any form of punishment, some are a lot more severe than others, with one essentially being a slap of the wrist and others being detrimental to the club's future.\n\nManaging director of the Premier League, Richard Masters has been central to the case\n\nIf found to have breached any of FFP's rules City could face one of a potential eight punishments\n\nEight FFP punishments:\n\nA formal warning Fines (amount depending on

According to The Times, City's lawyers are bidding to overturn the league's Associated Party Transaction (ATP) rules which limit what companies can invest in a club if they have common owners. The newspaper claims the move has sparked a 'civil war' between top-flight clubs.\n\nCity believe the rules are \"unlawful\" and are seeking damages for revenue they have lost since the regulations were voted in. ATP rules regard commercial and sponsorship deals with companies owned or associated with the same club's owners.\n\nThe rules say such transactions have to be independently assessed to ensure they are of fair market value. They were introduced to stop the inflation of commercial deals with companies also linked to the club's owners, but The Times quote a 165-page legal document in which City argue they are the victims of \"discrimination\".\n\nREAD | Aston Villa's 'intelligent' transfer approach could spark quick Douglas Luiz exit\n\nREAD | Aston Villa after the whistle: Everything that's happened since the last game of season\n\nThe dispute is set to be the focus of a two-week arbitration hearing beginning on Monday, June 10, as City push to end ATP rules that were brought in when Newcastle United were bought by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund in December 2021.\n\nAccording to The Times, up to 12 Premier League clubs have so far agreed to provide witness statements or a letter in support of the Premier League's defence. It is not known if Villa are one of them. However, if City are successful with their claim, it 'could dramatically alter the landscape of the professional game', it is suggested.\n\nThat's because such a change will allow the champions and the Premier League's other rich clubs to conduct sponsorship deals without independent assessment, therefore increasing the amount of money they can raise, leading to bigger transfer budgets to bolster their squads. City's sponsors currently include Etihad Airways, Etisalat and Experience Abu Dhabi - all linked in some way to the club's owners The Times also claims success in the case will also aid City's case against 115 financial fair play charges as some relate to the alleged inflation of sponsorship deals. That hearing is set to get underway in November.\n\nAfter qualifying for Champions League football last season, Aston Villa are increasing their revenue streams in a bid to catch up with the 'big six', who have been generating vast amounts of money for over a decade following Villa's failed attempts to reach the Champions League under Randy Lerner. A loosening of sponsorship rules could potentially allow them to operate with less pressure from the top-flight's spending rules.\n\nThe club's president of business operations, Chris Heck, recently spoke about how the club needs to boost revenue to allow Unai Emery to continue improving his squad and therefore the chances of more success in the coming years.\n\n\"We have a real focus on tackling that problem [FFP], but it'll take a lot of time, a lot of effort and a lot of changes as we grow our business,\" he said on Villa TV. We use the analogy with FFP that we have a train which is the football side, and a train on the business side.\n\n\"The train on the football side is going lightning fast and that's a good thing. The business side has to catch that train. We're working around the clock trying to do sponsorship deals, changing the stadium to be beneficial to Financial Fair Play, find new revenue streams, take in our merchandise in-house and things of that nature.\"", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_townley@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "John Townley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_of_Tennis_Professionals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association of Tennis Professionals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Luiz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Luiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arbitration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTV_(Maldives)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "VTV (Maldives)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Financial_Fair_Play_Regulations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Lerner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Randy Lerner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etihad_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Etihad Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unai_Emery", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unai Emery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Combining", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Combining", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Informal_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Informal Sports", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29294260.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1995443222.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624062", "eventUri": "eng-9624062", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 1273, "textEnd": 1280}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

It is hard to see how effective governance could take place without a threshold such as this, so Man City's challenge could plunge the Premier League's governance structure into chaos and make it harder for any decision to take place.\n\n\"This move might be seen by some sceptics as Man City trying to manoeuvre the narrative and legal arguments in its favour, ahead of its own defence of the 115 charges for breaching Profitability and Sustainability rules (and, in particular, the Associate Party Transaction rules) coming up in November.\"", "source": {"uri": "cityam.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CityAM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_hardy@cityam.com", "name": "Matt Hardy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansour_bin_Zayed_Al_Nahyan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etihad_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Etihad Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Kites/Rules", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Kites/Rules", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Informal_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Informal Sports", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www.cityam.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gettyimages-1387333776-612x612-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624062", "eventUri": "eng-9624062", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

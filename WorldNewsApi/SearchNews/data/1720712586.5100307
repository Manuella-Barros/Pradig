A football match being played at the home turf of team \u2018TSV Blau-Wei\u00df Eggersdorf\u2019 at B\u00f6rdeland-Eggersdorf in Saxony-Anhalt against \u2018Union 1861 Sch\u00f6nebeck\u2019 was cancelled in the second half after fans started singing a song calling for migrant deportations. The Salzland District Football Association said they had initiated disciplinary procedures over the fans\u2019 behaviour and notified the state-level sports authority. The police were also called, who identified those involved and began an investigation which has now been taken over by the state security police, who are looking into \u201cincitement\u201d charges. According to German newspaper Die Welt a group of around ten football fans at the game \u2014 which had already reached its 70th minute and was being resoundingly won 7:0 by Eggersdorf \u2014 including teens and adolescents were heard singing \u201cDeutschland den Deutschen, Ausl\u00e4nder raus\u201d, or \u2018Germany for Germans, foreigners out\u2019. The newfound lyrics set to year 2000 rave eurodance hit \u201cL\u2019amour toujours\u201d by Gigi D\u2019Agostino have been experiencing some virality in Germany among border-control enthusiasts, to the abject horror of the political establishment, which has used the state security apparatus to crack down on the trend. German Police Investigate as \u2018Foreigners Out\u2019 EDM Song Spreads Among Young People https://t.co/BYjajuRwPu \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) May 24, 2024 FuPa, a web portal dedicated to regional German football, carries a report on the abandoned Eggersdorf match noting that once the singing began, players of the then-losing \u2018Union 1861 Sch\u00f6nebeck\u2019 team walked off the pitch and refused to keep playing. The site relays that \u201cSome players cried in the dressing room after the game.\u201d The referees declared the game forfeit as without players it could not continue. A spokesman for the Eggersdorf team told FuPa: \u201cThis does not correspond to our ideology in any way, we are politically diverse\u2026 Up until then, it had been a great evening of football for us with a lively atmosphere and lots of spectators. Whoever called that did us a disservice as a team and to the club, where we have done such good work for years.\u201d The football match is just the latest in a steady stream of events where the \u2018Auslander raus\u2019 lyrics are recorded to have been transposed onto Italian DJ Gigi D\u2019Agostino\u2019s record. As reported by Breitbart London last month, German security police were investigating after the song was played at a party on a fashionable party island, with several young people present identified from a video recorded at the event and dismissed from their jobs.", "summary": "<p>Security police investigating after football fans sang along to eurodance rave classic proclaiming \"Germany for Germans, foreigners out\".</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2024/06/09/auslander-raus-controversy-football-game-cancelled-after-fans-sing-foreigners-out-song/\">Auslander Raus Controversy: Football Game Cancelled After Fans Sing &#8216;Foreigners Out&#8217; Song</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breitbart.com\">Breitbart</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2024/06/09/auslander-raus-controversy-football-game-cancelled-after-fans-sing-foreigners-out-song/", "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/06/GettyImages-1558726582-e1717945037670-640x335.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:36:38", "author": "Oliver JJ Lane", "authors": ["Oliver JJ Lane"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.129}

Sadhna Parashar, Senior Director at NTA, confirmed that the exam was reconducted for the 120 affected candidates at the center. NTA sources told news agency PTI that some candidates received question papers in languages other than their chosen medium, prompting them to walk out.\n\nA ruckus occurred, and aspirants staged a protest outside an examination centre in Rajasthan's Sawai Madhopur.\n\nDuring the NEET-UG examination, it came to attention that at one exam centre, the Girls Higher Secondary Model School in Mantown, Sawai Madhopur, there was an incident, where incorrect question papers were distributed by the center superintendent. Despite efforts by invigilators to prevent it, some candidates left the exam center with the question papers, Parashar said, reported PTI.\n\nIn response, the NTA has taken proactive measures to uphold the principles of fairness and equal opportunity for all candidates.\n\n\"The examination of approximately 120 affected candidates at the centre is being conducted today, ensuring that their academic aspirations are not hindered by this incident\", she added.\n\nNTA Denies NEET Paper Leak\n\nSeveral social media posts alleged the question paper was leaked.

Rahul Gandhi, contesting Lok Sabha polls in Raebareli and Waynad as a Congress candidate, further called the Modi government a 'curse for youth' struggling to get into colleges or trying to get jobs.\n\n\"The news of NEET exam paper leak is a betrayal of the dreams of more than 23 lakh students and their families,\" Rahul Gandhi wrote while adding \"Whether it is the students who dream of getting admission in college after passing 12th standard or the promising youth struggling for a government job, Modi government has become a curse for everyone.\"\n\nALSO READ: Prajwal Revanna 'Sex Video': What Is The Obscene Videos Case That Rocked Karnataka | Explained\n\nOn May 5, lakhs of students across the country sat in the NEET-UG medical entrance examination. The row erupted when a few videos started circulating over social media alleging the NEET-UG paper leak. While the exam conducting authority NTA clarified that no such thing had occurred, students and parents remained concerned about the unverified reports.\n\n\"NEET (UG) 2024 has been conducted successfully by the National Testing Agency (NTA) across 4750 centres in 571 cities (including 14 cities abroad) on 5th May 2024. It has been ascertained from NTA's security protocols and Standard Operating Procedures that the Social Media Posts pointing towards any paper leak are completely baseless and without any ground. To put rumours to rest, it is also stated that every single Question Paper (QP) has been accounted for. Further, it is also to be noted that after the gates of the Examination Centres are closed, no one from outside is permitted access inside the Halls which are under CCTV surveillance,\" the National Testing Agency said on May 6.\n\nThe agency further mentioned an isolated incident at a centre in Rajasthan's Sawai Madhopur where some students took away question papers out of the centre before the end of the examination.\n\n\"As mentioned in yesterday's NTA Press Release there was one incident at a Centre in Sawai Madhopur, Rajasthan where some students forcibly took away the QPs before the conclusion of the examination. A picture of this QP is being linked to an alleged incident of the paper leak which is mischievous and preposterous,\" the NTA stated.\n\nHowever, Rahul Gandhi took a jibe at the Modi government, while promising a strict law to punish the offenders of exam leaks.\n\n\"The youth and their families who have been paying the price of the BJP government's inefficiency for the past 10 years by ruining their future have now understood that there is a difference between speaking and running a government. Congress has pledged to free the youth from paper leaks by making strict laws. A healthy and transparent environment for students is our guarantee.\"", "source": {"uri": "english.jagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jagran English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Eligibility_cum_Entrance_Test_(Undergraduate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Undergraduate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Testing_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Testing Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayanad_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wayanad district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wayanad district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raebareli", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raebareli"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Raebareli"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawai_Madhopur", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sawai Madhopur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sawai Madhopur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://imgeng.jagran.com/images/2024/05/06/article/image/Neet ug 2024 paper leak news -1714997411984.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540054", "eventUri": "eng-9540054", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 928, "textEnd": 933}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1966, "textEnd": 1971}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

NTA, Rahul Gandhi react", "body": "An MBBS student who was acting as a 'proxy' candidate in the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) for another aspirant in Maharashtra's Navi Mumbai was detained in Rajasthan's Bharatpur on Sunday. Five other persons, including the NEET aspirant - Rahul Gurjar - were detained along with the MBBS student, who was identified as Abhishek Gupta.\n\nAccording to the police, a preliminary investigation revealed that Abhishek Gupta - a government college student - was part of a racket being run by his collegemate - Ravi Meena, reported news agency PTI.\n\nRavi Meena allegedly took \u20b910 lakh from NEET candidate Rahul Gurjar for sending Abhishek Gupta as his 'proxy' in the examination.\n\nThe incident came to light after an official at the examination centre complained about Abhishek Gupta impersonating the NEET candidate.\n\n\"On suspicion, the invigilator handed him over to the police. During initial interrogation, he told police that he was accompanied by five others,\" assistant superintendent of police (ASP) Aklesh Kumar was quoted as saying by PTI.\n\nThe police further said Abhishek Gupta's associates were found sitting in a car outside the examination centre. A case has been registered against Gupta, the NEET aspirant and the three associates under Indian Penal Code sections 419 (cheating by personation) and 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of a common intention) and other relevant provisions, the police said.\n\nThe NEET exam was conducted in 557 sites across the country and 14 cities abroad in multiple exam centres on Sunday.\n\nThe proxy student incident came to light amid several social media posts claiming that the NEET exam paper was leaked. Along with this, some candidates at a centre in Rajasthan complained that those who opted for English as the choice of medium were given question papers in Hindi and vice versa.\n\nThe National Testing Agency, meanwhile, refuted claims of NEET-UG exam question paper leak. The exam was reportedly held in 557 cities across India and 14 cities abroad.\n\n\"Reports claiming leak of NEET-UG question paper are baseless, without any ground,\" the NTA said.\n\nHowever, Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, reacted to the reports of the NEET paper leak.\n\nCalling the alleged paper leak a \"betrayal of the dreams\" of over 23 lakh student and their families, Rahul Gandhi hit out at the ruling BJP government saying, \"Whether it is the students who dream of getting admission in college after passing 12th standard or the promising youth struggling for a government job, Modi government has become a curse for everyone...The youth and their families who have been paying the price of the BJP government's inefficiency for the past 10 years by ruining their future have now understood that there is a difference between speaking and running a government.\"\n\n\"Congress has pledged to free the youth from paper leaks by making strict laws. A healthy and transparent environment for students is our guarantee,\" he added.\n\nIn a post on X, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra wrote: \"Once again, there are reports of NEET paper leak. The future of 24 lakh youth of the country has been messed up again. This trend that has been going on with crores of promising youth for the last ten years is not stopping. Will the Prime Minister of the country say anything about this?\"\n\nShe further questioned, \"To pacify the youth, a law was passed in the Parliament against paper leak. Where is that law? Why is it not implemented?\"\n\nThe Congress leader added that the grand old party's manifesto assures to stop paper leaks in the country. \"Recruitments will be done according to the calendar. Vacant posts will be filled. This tampering with the future of the youth will stop and we will show it by doing it,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said that just punishing the culprits involved in the paper leak scams is not enough.\n\n\"Our aim is to prevent any paper from leaking. Our laws will ensure the highest standards of integrity and fairness at every stage of the exam process - from paper setting, printing, transportation, administration and supervision - for both paper-based and computer-based exams,\" he wrote on X.\n\nHe added, \"For young people who spend years preparing for these exams, and invest time and money in the hope of a better future, it is important to ensure that the papers are not leaked. Freedom from paper leaks is our commitment to every hard-working candidate.\"", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The police apprehended the MBBS student along with five others, including the candidate he was impersonating, unveiling a racket involving substantial sums of money for securing seats in medical colleges.\n\nThe preliminary investigation pointed towards Abhishek Gupta, a student from a government college, who was caught red-handed at the examination centre. Gupta, found to be impersonating Rahul Gurjar, was part of a scheme orchestrated by his college mate Ravi Meena. Meena had allegedly received Rs 10 lakh from Gurjar to facilitate this deceit. The invigilator's vigilance led to Gupta's detention and subsequent revelation of his accomplices waiting nearby in a vehicle.\n\nAssistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Aklesh Kumar disclosed that Gupta was not acting alone. His associates were apprehended from a car parked outside the examination venue, Master Adityendra School, under the jurisdiction of Mathura Gate police station. The authorities have identified the other individuals involved as Amit, Dayaram, and Suraj Singh. The police are conducting thorough interrogations with all detained parties to decide on further legal actions.\n\nIn a separate but equally troubling incident at a NEET examination centre in Sawai Madhopur, candidates faced an unexpected challenge. Some students who had opted for English as their medium received question papers in Hindi and vice versa. This mix-up led to protests from candidates and their parents, which reportedly resulted in altercations with the police.\n\nThe National Testing Agency (NTA), responsible for conducting the NEET-UG examination, acknowledged the error in question paper distribution. Senior Director Sadhna Parashar announced that measures are being taken to rectify the mistake. Approximately 120 affected candidates are being given another chance to sit for the exam, ensuring their academic pursuits remain unaffected by this oversight.\n\nThis series of events has brought to light significant lapses in the administration and security measures surrounding one of India's most critical entrance examinations.

The NEET aspirants should have been distributed the question papers collected from the State Bank of India (SBI) while they were inadvertently distributed the question papers procured from Canara Bank,\" said Arun Kumar Sahu, the Boys School principal.\n\nThe question papers obtained through the State Bank of India were given to the NEET aspirants, while in Balod, the question papers obtained through Canara Bank were distributed at the mentioned two examination centers.\n\nAfter reports about NEET paper leak in Rajasthan, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi wrote on social media platform X that \"Its a betrayal of dreams of lakhs of NEET aspirants and their parents\". However, NTA rejected the reports of paper leak and claimed that distribution of wrong set of question papers at an exam centre in Rajasthan led to some candidates walking out with papers.\n\nAccording to the rules, two sets of question papers are provided. If the question papers obtained through the SBI cannot be used, the question papers obtained from Canara Bank can be used as an alternative, as stated by the Principal.\n\nThe students were given an extra 15-20 minutes to make up for the time they lost. When questioned about the extra 10-15 minutes, the principal acknowledged that the candidates should have been given the full time they had lost during the process.\n\n\"We have written to the district collector of Balod regarding the development and are also in touch with the NTA, which conducts the exam,\" said the Principal.\n\nMeanwhile, the students appearing for the NEET exam and their parents expressed their disappointment at the lack of proper supervision and called for accountability from the authorities. Numerous students were seen crying, with one visibly seeking comfort from her father, representing the distress and frustration experienced by all families affected.\n\nThe Principal attributed it to an error in obtaining the question papers from the bank. However, this explanation did not calm the upset parents and students, who insisted on specific actions to fix the situation and prevent such mistakes from happening again.\n\nRelatives and parents, who are shocked by the lack of accountability, have requested a comprehensive investigation into the issue and are advocating for the exam to be canceled. They are unwilling to let the authorities ignore this incident and are committed to seeking justice for the students who have been affected.\n\nThe Principal mentioned that they are constantly communicating with Delhi through the district collector when discussing the solution.\n\nThe Balod district collector, however, did not respond despite repeated calls for his comments.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "partha_sarathi_behera@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Partha Sarathi Behera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Eligibility_cum_Entrance_Test_(Undergraduate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Undergraduate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balod_district", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Balod district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canara_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canara Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chhattisgarh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chhattisgarh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chhattisgarh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raipur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raipur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Raipur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District magistrate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Web_Columns", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Web Columns", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109892843,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-14542,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540054", "eventUri": "eng-9540054", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Raipur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

They include Ales Bialiatski, the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and Tsikhanouskaya's husband Siarhei Tsikhanouski.\n\nTsikhanouskaya rose to prominence after her husband was arrested just days after announcing plans to challenge Lukashenko in the 2020 Belarusian presidential elections, four years ago Friday.\n\nShe took her husband's place in the election, but was forced to flee Belarus after Lukashenko claimed a landslide victory.\n\nThe U.S. and many other Western countries considered the 2020 election results to be fraudulent and have supported Tsikhanouskaya as the leader of the pro-democracy movement.\n\nIn 2023, Lukashenko's government sentenced Tsikhanouskaya in absentia to a 15-year prison term on charges of treason and forming an extremist group. She would almost certainly face arrest if she attempted to return to Minsk.\n\nThere are others who weren't included in the swap like Marc Fogel, a U.S. citizen jailed in Russia for marijuana possession; Moscow municipal deputy Alexei Gorinov; and Navalny ally Daniel Kholodny.\n\nMembers of the Belarusian opposition have argued that Tsikhanouskaya could have done more to pressure Western governments to include Belarusian political prisoners in the exchange. She rejected that characterization.\n\n\"I don't think that I'm not working enough on political prisoners,\" she said. \"We need more attention from the democratic world because we, on our own, can't dismantle this regime.\"\n\nRemoving Lukashenko is the priority, Tsikhanouskaya added. \"All political prisoners will not be released until we will dismantle this regime because while the regime is there, it will take new and new hostages,\" she said.\n\nTsikhanouskaya said that the diplomatic efforts with the State Department are ongoing and that she would like to discuss possible deals in the future that would free members of the Belarusian opposition.\n\n\"Of course, we have to remind the American government about Belarusian political prisoners,\" she said. \"We have a stable platform for this and, of course, this will be raised.\"\n\nIn a statement, the State Department said that the dialogue with the Belarusian opposition is ongoing and that it continues to call for the release of political prisoners held in Belarus.\n\nNational Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said in a statement that the U.S. \"remains deeply concerned about the Lukashenko regime's brutal crackdown on its people, including the more than 1,400 detained political prisoners.\"\n\n\"We continue to call for the release of all political prisoners in Belarus,\" Savett added.", "source": {"uri":

These were met by a brutal campaign of repression and a purging of civil society, independent media and the democratic opposition at the hands of the Lukashenko regime, with political prisoners detained in penal colonies. Commanding officers of four of these penal colonies, who have contributed to human rights violations and the repression of civil society, have been hit with UK sanctions today.\n\nBelarus has also provided instrumental support for Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine since it began in 2022.

They include Ales Bialiatski, the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and Tsikhanouskaya's husband Siarhei Tsikhanouski.\n\nTsikhanouskaya rose to prominence after her husband was arrested just days after announcing plans to challenge Lukashenko in the 2020 Belarusian presidential elections, four years ago Friday.\n\nShe took her husband's place in the election, but was forced to flee Belarus after Lukashenko claimed a landslide victory.\n\nThe U.S. and many other Western countries considered the 2020 election results to be fraudulent and have supported Tsikhanouskaya as the leader of the pro-democracy movement.\n\nIn 2023, Lukashenko's government sentenced Tsikhanouskaya in absentia to a 15-year prison term on charges of treason and forming an extremist group. She would almost certainly face arrest if she attempted to return to Minsk.\n\nThere are others who weren't included in the swap like Marc Fogel, a U.S. citizen jailed in Russia for marijuana possession; Moscow municipal deputy Alexei Gorinov; and Navalny ally Daniel Kholodny.\n\nMembers of the Belarusian opposition have argued that Tsikhanouskaya could have done more to pressure Western governments to include Belarusian political prisoners in the exchange. She rejected that characterization.\n\n\"I don't think that I'm not working enough on political prisoners,\" she said. \"We need more attention from the democratic world because we, on our own, can't dismantle this regime.\"\n\nRemoving Lukashenko is the priority, Tsikhanouskaya added. \"All political prisoners will not be released until we will dismantle this regime because while the regime is there, it will take new and new hostages,\" she said.\n\nTsikhanouskaya said that the diplomatic efforts with the State Department are ongoing and that she would like to discuss possible deals in the future that would free members of the Belarusian opposition.\n\n\"Of course, we have to remind the American government about Belarusian political prisoners,\" she said. \"We have a stable platform for this and, of course, this will be raised.\"\n\nIn a statement, the State Department said that the dialogue with the Belarusian opposition is ongoing and that it continues to call for the release of political prisoners held in Belarus.\n\nNational Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said in a statement that the U.S. \"remains deeply concerned about the Lukashenko regime's brutal crackdown on its people, including the more than 1,400 detained political prisoners.\"\n\n\"We continue to call for the release of all political prisoners in Belarus,\" Savett added.", "source": {"uri":

These were met by a brutal campaign of repression and a purging of civil society, independent media and the democratic opposition at the hands of the Lukashenko regime, with political prisoners detained in penal colonies. Commanding officers of four of these penal colonies, who have contributed to human rights violations and the repression of civil society, have been hit with UK sanctions today.\n\nBelarus has also provided instrumental support for Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine since it began in 2022.

OFAC is concurrently designating five of these targets -- three individuals and two entities -- pursuant to Russia-related E.O. 14024.\n\nLukashenka's support for Russia's indefensible war against Ukraine comes at a high cost for Belarus. Lukashenka has traded his country's autonomy and standing in the international community for his and his cronies' own financial and political benefits. Today's action reinforces the United States' commitment to holding the Lukashenka regime accountable for its attacks on the Belarusian democratic movement and its flagrant exploitation of the Belarusian people.\n\n\"As Belarus marks another year under Lukashenka's rule, the regime's blatantly corrupt, destabilizing, and anti-democratic acts -- along with its continued support for Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine -- have only further ostracized Belarus from the global community,\" said Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith. \"The United States, in coordination with our allies and partners, remains committed to holding the regime and its key facilitators accountable.\"\n\nIn the wake of the fraudulent August 2020 Belarusian Presidential election, Lukashenka resorted to brutal crackdowns on peaceful protesters, democratic organizations, and journalists in order to illegitimately retain power. Since then, Lukashenka's actions have eroded Belarusian civil society and enabled Lukashenka, his family, and his inner circle to enrich themselves at the expense of Belarus's citizens and sovereignty. The Lukashenka regime continues to support Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine by hosting Russian military bases and allowing Russian forces to use Belarus as a staging point for military operations.\n\nToday's designations are amplified by actions undertaken by the United States' partners in the European Union (EU) -- who targeted Belarusian authorities involved in human rights abuses earlier this week -- and Canada and the United Kingdom, who today also announced additional sanctions on the Lukashenka regime. Together, these actions signal the international community's continuing solidarity with the Belarusian people in their struggle for a free, democratic, and sovereign Belarus.\n\nThe Department of State also took steps to impose visa restrictions on 19 regime officials and their affiliates for their involvement in undermining democracy in Belarus, pursuant to Presidential Proclamation 8015.\n\nHarris says she's ready to debate Trump and accuses him of 'backpedaling' from Sept. 10 faceoff Biden sidesteps hard truths in rare primetime opportunity Biden calls for ban on gun used to shoot Trump", "source": {"uri": "en.apa.az", "dataType": "news", "title": "Azeri -

The swap also featured the release of German citizen RICO KRIEGER from Belarus, where he had been sentenced to death on terrorism charges.\n\nBut to the dismay of many Belarusian democracy advocates, not a single member of the country's opposition was included in the exchange.\n\nViasna, a human rights group, has estimated there are roughly 1,400 political prisoners that are currently detained by ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO's regime. ALES BIALIATSKI, the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and Tsikhanouskaya's husband SIARHEI TSIKHANOUSKI, are two of the most widely recognized opposition figures who are detained in Belarus.\n\nTsikhanouskaya rose to prominence after her husband was arrested just days after announcing plans to challenge Lukashenko in the 2020 Belarusian presidential elections, which were exactly four years ago from Friday. Tsikhanouskaya took her husband's place in the election, but was forced to flee Belarus after Lukashenko claimed a landslide victory. The U.S. and many other Western countries considered the 2020 election results to be fraudulent and have supported Tsikhanouskaya as the leader of the pro-democracy movement.\n\nIn 2023, Lukashenko's regime sentenced Tsikhanouskaya in absentia to a 15-year prison sentence on charges of treason and forming an extremist group. She would almost certainly face arrest if she attempted to return to Minsk.\n\nThere are others who weren't included in the swap like MARC FOGEL, an American citizen jailed in Russia for marijuana possession, Moscow municipal deputy ALEXEI GORINOV, and Navalny ally DANIEL KHOLODNY.\n\nBut some members of the Belarusian opposition have argued that Tsikhanouskaya could have done more to pressure Western governments to include Belarusian political prisoners in the exchange. She rejected that characterization.\n\n\"I don't think that I'm not working enough on political prisoners,\" she said. \"We need more attention from the democratic world because we, on our own, can't dismantle this regime.\"\n\nIn particular, Tsikhanouskaya pointed to her movement's efforts to highlight the plight of Belarusian political prisoners in its Strategic Dialogue with the U.S. State Department. Tsikhanouskaya and CHRISTOPHER SMITH, the State Department's deputy assistant secretary for Eastern Europe, chaired the first Strategic Dialogue in December 2023, where the discussion of political prisoners was a \"key topic.\"\n\nTsikhanouskaya said that the diplomatic efforts with the State Department are ongoing and that she would like to discuss possible deals in the future that would free members of the Belarusian opposition.\n\n\"Of course, we have to remind the American government about Belarusian political prisoners,\" she said. \"We have a stable platform for this and, of course, this will be raised.\"\n\nIn a statement, the State Department said that the dialogue with the Belarusian opposition is ongoing and that it continues to call for the release of political prisoners held in Belarus.\n\nStill, Tsikhanouskaya said she has not had high-level engagement from the U.S. since the deal took place.\n\nNational Security Council spokesperson SEAN SAVETT said in a statement that the U.S. \"remains deeply concerned about the Lukashenka regime's brutal crackdown on its people, including the more than 1,400 detained political prisoners.\"\n\n\"We continue to call for the release of all political prisoners in Belarus,\" Savett added.\n\nTsikhanouskaya emphasized most of all that a day doesn't go by that she doesn't think about securing the freedom of political prisoners in Belarus. Tsikhanouskaya said that she hasn't heard from her husband in more than a year and doesn't even know if he is still alive.\n\n\"It sounds very strange that people blame me that I don't care about political prisoners. My children are growing up without their daddy,\" she said. \"It's my personal pain.\"\n\n\"But I also want everybody to be released,\" Tsikhanouskaya added.\n\nRead: Even in death, Navalny helped Biden and Scholz get to a 'yes' on the prisoner swap by ERIN BANCO, LENNART PFAHLER, J\u00dcRGEN KL\u00d6CKNER and NAHAL TOOSI\n\nBIBI SPEAKS: Israeli Prime Minister BENJAMIN NETANYAHU is dismissing criticism about his government's decision to strike at Hezbollah targets in Lebanon and throwing cold water on hopes of a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn an extensive interview with Time's ERIC CORTELLESSA, Netanyahu rejected criticisms that he was sabotaging hostage release negotiations by expanding the conflict with strikes into Lebanon. Netanyahu said Israel is \"faced with a noose of death that Iran is trying to place around our neck, and I think the message we're sending, 360 degrees, is that we're not going to be lambs led to the slaughter.\n\n\"Israel is not, is not a sacrificial lamb for the Iranians or for their proxies,\" he continued.\n\nIn the interview, Netanyahu also emphasized he isn't interested in advancing Palestinian statehood. He argued that the optimal solution is for Palestinians to enjoy limited autonomy within the West Bank and other Israeli-controlled territories such that \"they should have their own self-governance. But they should not have the power to threaten us.\" That, he explained, would be achieved by Israel maintaining security control over Palestinian territories.\n\nThe interview comes as worries continue to mount that Israel's strikes against Hezbollah in Lebanon and its assassination of Hamas leader ISMAIL HANIYEH risks expanding the conflict into a full-blown regional war.\n\nAnd while Netanyahu signaled an openness towards the needs of Palestinians in his comments, the interview will disappoint proponents of a normalization agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia. One of the requirements of the elusive deal has been a credible pathway towards Palestinian statehood.\n\nAdvocates for a deal had been trumpeting its benefits earlier this week. Veteran diplomat DENNIS ROSS argued in Foreign Affairs Wednesday that now was the moment to secure a deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia as a way to expedite the end of the war in Gaza. And national security adviser JAKE SULLIVAN said on the Pod Save World podcast Wednesday that \"Israel's normalization with some of its Arab neighbors can actually aid in the cause of helping deliver tangible benefits and a political horizon to the Palestinian people.\"\n\nAIRSTRIKES IN GAZA: Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip killed 25 Palestinians, per Reuters' NIDAL AL-MUGHRABI. The airstrikes, concentrated mostly in central Gaza, targeted houses near some of the densest camps in the territory. The Israel Defense Forces has claimed those camps are strongholds of armed militant groups.\n\nWorld Central Kitchen announced today that NADI SALLOUT, a Palestinian staff member of the humanitarian group, was killed in central Gaza. It is unclear whether Sallout, who was off-duty, was killed in one of the airstrikes.\n\nRUSSIA'S DEFENSIVE STRUGGLES: Russia is struggling to push back Ukrainian columns that crossed the border into Russian territory, Reuters' GUY FAULCONBRIDGE reports.\n\nRussia has called reserves into the Kursk region as it tries to fully repel the advance from 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers, tanks and armored vehicles. Russia's defense ministry claims that it has halted the Ukrainian push, but intense battles continue near nuclear power plants and gas transit points in the border region.\n\nCUTE AND CUDDLY NEWS: Two giant pandas from China made their public debut at the San Diego Zoo today, per CNN's AMANDA MUSA and MARNIE HUNTER.

But the Times also reported that Harris privately met with leaders of the \"uncommitted\" campaign and signaled openness to an arms embargo on Israel, which would represent a major change in policy towards the U.S. ally.\n\nThe public and private dance comes as Harris has tried to navigate competing tensions within the Democratic coalition about Israel's conduct of the Gaza war and the Biden administration's support for Israel. Republicans have sought to use Israel as a cudgel to divide Democrats.\n\nHarris' national security adviser PHIL GORDON took to social media to clarify that Harris \"does not support an arms embargo on Israel.\" He added: \"She will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law.\"\n\nEUROPE WATCHES THE RIOTS: Regulators in Brussels are keeping a close eye on how ELON MUSK and X are navigating the ongoing anti-immigrant riots in the United Kingdom, per Reuters' MARTIN COULTER.\n\nOfficials have been probing X, formerly Twitter, under the auspices of its Digital Services Act. Under that law, social media platforms are required to take more action to curb illegal content and risks to public security, including disinformation and misinformation.\n\nEven though the U.K. left the European Union in 2020, regulators say that misleading or inflammatory content may have been viewed by users on the continent, potentially contributing to additional breaches of the Digital Services Act.\n\n\"What happens outside of the EU is not covered by the DSA, but what happens in the U.K. is visible here. If there are examples of hate speech or incitements to violence, they could be taken into account as part of our proceedings against X,\" a European Commission spokesperson told Reuters.\n\nThe tweaks, which clarified Walz's final rank in the Army National Guard, come as Republicans have sought to poke holes in her running mate's military record, as Jared, MERIDITH MCGRAW and CONNOR O'BRIEN report. Vice presidential nominee Sen. JD VANCE (R-Ohio), who served in the Marines, said Walz \"has not spent a day in a combat zone\" and misrepresented his service. It's worth noting that Vance also did not see combat, as he deployed to Iraq as a combat correspondent.\n\nWalz has also been slammed for retiring before his unit deployed to Iraq. His retirement came shortly after he filed paperwork for his 2006 run for Congress.\n\nRepublicans insist the swipes are fair. \"The two biggest sins in the military are claiming credit for decorations you don't have or claiming combat action that you did not participate in, those are the two biggest sins. And this much is certain: He's guilty of at least one of them,\" said CHRIS LaCIVITA, a top Trump campaign adviser who was instrumental in the effort to discredit then-Sen. JOHN KERRY (D-Mass.)'s military record during the 2004 election campaign.\n\nREED BETWEEN THE LINES: Senate Armed Services Chair JACK REED (D-R.I.) quickly batted down talk that he could serve as defense secretary if Harris wins the election, Connor writes in.\n\nAfter Reed's name was floated as a potential Pentagon pick in a Harris administration, the five-term senator told Rhode Island's WPRI that he's \"not really\" interested in the job. Reed has turned down the job in the past, and argued he's of most use in the Senate.\n\n\"I am in a very critical role, I believe, as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee,\" Reed said. \"I've learned a great deal over the years. I think as a legislator I can do more for the nation and more for Rhode Island, and hopefully I can continue in that role.\"\n\nRELIEF FOR THE FLEET: With Navy destroyers locked in combat against Houthi rebels and more warships to deter Iran from an all-out attack on Israel, Senate appropriators are proposing billions of dollars to relieve the pressure on the U.S. military in the Middle East, where, our friends at Morning Defense (for Pros!) report.\n\nThough Congress's ultimate path on defense spending remains to be seen, Senate appropriators crafted their fiscal 2025 defense bill with $1.8 billion for Central Command to protect its troops, replenish missiles, and continue operations. That money -- part of the bill's global $21 billion emergency funding pool -- would continue some of the spending Congress approved in April through the National Security Supplemental.\n\nMeanwhile, the Biden administration's battle in the Red Sea against the Iran-backed Houthi rebels is draining an ever-growing amount of U.S. resources -- sometimes millions of dollars per attempt to hit Houthi drones and unmanned boats. There may be further strain in store should Iran and its proxies mount another attack on Israel, as has been expected for days, and U.S. military assets are again called on to knock down missiles and drones.\n\n\"We are burning readiness to the tune of tens of billions of dollars for what really amounts to a ragtag bunch of terrorists that are Iran proxies,\" said Rep. MIKE WALTZ (R-Fla.), who chairs the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness. \"Iran is the core of the issue.\"\n\nDuring the USS Eisenhower carrier strike group's twice-extended nine-month deployment to the Red Sea, U.S. forces fired over 135 Tomahawk land attack missiles, weapons that cost upwards of $2 million apiece, at Houthi targets in Yemen. The ships also launched 155 standard missiles of various kinds, which cost between $2 million and $4 million per missile, to destroy the drones. The F-18 aircraft aboard the Eisenhower also fired 60 air-to-air missiles and 420 air-to-surface weapons during the defense strikes at sea and targets on the ground.\n\nRep. JOE COURTNEY (D-Conn.), the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Seapower panel, said extended combat deployments are also \"stressing our Navy.\" It's clear that \"we're going to have to come to grips with either going up higher with the topline,\" Courtney said, adding that lawmakers may need to deliberate on whether a supplemental spending bill \"will be on top of that.\"\n\nICYMI: Cost rising for US as it fights off Houthi drones, via our own PAUL MCLEARY, JOE GOULD and Connor.\n\nNORWAY GETS KNOCKED: Israel took away accreditation for eight Norwegian diplomats representing Oslo before the Palestinian Authority, per Reuters' TERJE SOLSVIK and MAAYAN LUBELL.\n\nThe Israeli government defended the revocation, accusing Norway of \"anti-Israel conduct.\" Norway, which helped broker the Oslo Accords, officially recognized a Palestinian state in May, arguing that the move would help speed up an end to the war in the Gaza Strip. That decision, Israeli Foreign Minister ISRAEL KATZ said, means \"Norway conducts a one-sided policy on the Palestinian issue, and will therefore be removed from the Palestinian issue.\"\n\nOslo and the Palestinian Authority both condemned Israel's actions. Norwegian Foreign Minister ESPEN BARTH EIDE called it \"an extreme act that primarily affects our ability to help the Palestinian population\" and warned it \"will have consequences for our relationship with the Netanyahu government.\" The Palestinian Authority, meanwhile, blasted the decision as a \"violation and breach of international laws.\"\n\n-- FIRST IN NATSEC DAILY -- Retired Vice Adm.

The tune became synonymous with the 2020 protests, along with the lost hopes and dreams of the Belarusian opposition that lived on for decades after the song's release.\n\n\"Our hearts demand changes! Our eyes demand changes!\" the song's chorus repeated - but that change has yet to arrive.\n\n\"Peremen\" and the 2020 presidential elections\n\nIn 2020, the inadequate response to the COVID pandemic by Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko and his regime amplified the existing dissent and threatened his chances of being re-elected that year.\n\nIt also came with stiff competition from with Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, the wife of an imprisoned candidate, announcing her bid for the presidency with widespread support.\n\nBut the Lukashenko regime, often described as \"the last dictatorship in Europe\" by Western media, was not ready to loosen its grip on the country after 26 years in power.\n\nAt a pro-Lukashenko event on Aug. 6, three days before the election, sound engineers Kirill Galanov and Vladislav Sokolovsky put on the song \"Peremen\" without authorization to the surprise of those in attendance.\n\nThe song ended abruptly when security pulled the cable and the two engineers were subsequently arrested, but the song, written in the last days of the Soviet Union, had already made the news and soon became adopted as the anthem of protest against the Lukashenko regime.\n\nClashes on election night\n\nOn election day, the situation remained relatively calm in the Belarusian capital - streets were relatively quiet and an absence of protests, save for the occasional appearance of the oppositions white-red-white flags.\n\n\"I was an observer at one of the polling stations in the city of Minsk. At that time, for some reason, it seemed that we would succeed, and that the system would definitely give in, because so many people were in favor of change,\" \"D,\" an anonymous Belarusian dissident who has since left the country told Kyiv Post.\n\nBut as night fell, everything changed.\n\nWhen the exit polls announced that Lukashenko won - again - allegedly securing more than 80 percent of the votes, the citizens of Minsk took to the streets, hoisting opposition flags, chanting \"Long live Belarus\" - a slogan popular among the Belarusian opposition - and calling for Lukashenko's resignation.\n\nAnticipating the protests, riot police were soon deployed, lined up with shields and began marching towards the protestors forming a human wall, soon joined by military jeeps and water cannon which began chasing protestors into the allies between houses.\n\nExplosions from flashbangs rang through the sleepless night.\n\n\"That evening, everyone was angry at the authorities and dissatisfied with the election results ... The internet was down, there was no news about what was happening, no plan of action either ... The police threw grenades at us and pushed us out of the city streets.\n\n\"Many were detained and subjected to physical abuse. I returned home only in the early morning,\" \"D\" added.\n\nSubsequent protests\n\nWhat followed were protests followed by associated arrests across the nation, centering in Minsk.\n\n\"The following week was also tense. Here and there, in different districts of Minsk, in various cities across the republic, spontaneous, unorganized protests broke out. People were beaten and dispersed everywhere, and the temporary detention centers were overcrowded,\" \"D\" recalled.\n\nPerhaps pressured by the backlash Lukashenko received from the West - whose relations he had managed to thaw just a few years prior - or perhaps in an attempt to ease the social tension, the government made a surprise decision to halt its crackdowns a week or so following the election.\n\n\"On Aug. 13, the authorities began releasing prisoners. It's hard to say what influenced this decision; most likely, they were afraid of the continued escalation of violence and needed a breather,\" \"D\" said.\n\nBut that only persuaded more locals to display their disdain for the regime, marching day after day across Minsk, at times passing through government buildings such as the government headquarters at Lenin Square and the State Security Committee (KGB) headquarters on the Niezalieznasci Prospect - both unguarded.\n\nThere were even instances of riot police embracing protestors.\n\nThe most significant protest - and the largest in Belarusian history - took place on Aug. 16 - two weeks after the election.\n\nOn that day, in response to a pro-government rally organized by the Lukashenko regime, waves of protestors, consisting of tens of thousands of men and women, young and old, filled all corners of Minsk, waving opposition banners and flags that called for Lukashenko's resignation and release of political prisoners.\n\n\"On Aug. 16, we joined the 'March for Freedom,' the largest protest in Belarusian history. On that day, the security forces practically didn't detain anyone. The authorities were on the brink of collapse and facing a severe crisis.\n\n\"I, like many others, did not want bloodshed in the country,\" \"D\" said.\n\n\"We chanted 'The police are with the people!' I don't know what others thought, but personally, I believed that our half-million-strong protests could give someone in the security forces (Army, Police, Special Forces) a carte blanche to arrest the dictator. I hoped that something similar would happen as during the Carnation Revolution in Portugal in 1974.\n\n\"But unfortunately, no truly patriotic officers were found among us. Many years of negative selection in the security forces made it impossible for a decent person to exist in a rank higher than major.\"\n\nBut the peace was short-lived, when Lukashenko, after multiple phone calls with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, suddenly warned the country of the alleged risks from NATO and decided to resume the crackdown in the following months that continued well into the next year, which saw many beaten, arrested, and sometimes killed.\n\n\"The only non-violent measures left were strikes, but again, all the efforts in the following months were disorganized and chaotic, with initiatives coming more from the bottom than the top,\" \"D\" said.\n\nA turning page in modern Belarusian history\n\nThe reverberation of the elections, subsequent protests and exiles can still be felt to this day.\n\nWithin the government and the law enforcement, there came a wave of purges and resignations, with Lukashenko introducing further amendments to the constitution to further solidify his power - that will last even if he's no longer in office.\n\nThe subsequent crackdowns have also led to waves of migration among the Belarusian intelligentsia, mostly those younger with the financial means to seek refuge in neighboring Lithuania, Poland, and beyond.\n\nA report claimed that Belarusians accounted for almost 30 percent of asylum applications made to Poland in 2021.\n\nPolitically, the backlashes and sanctions from the West prompted Lukashenko to deepen his ties with Russia, which eventually led to Minsk's complicit role in Moscow's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine when Putin launched missiles and troops moved into Ukraine through the territories of Belarus, prompting further questions as to the integrity of Belarusian sovereignty.\n\nThat said, the widespread support Tsikhanouskaya received has also led to the creation of the United Transitional Cabinet of Belarus, a transitional government in exile based in Vilnius, Lithuania that is amongst the most influential Belarusian opposition groups in exile since the Belarusian People's Republic was founded in 1918.\n\nThe fierce crackdown on Belarusian opposition has also contributed to the formation of the Kalino\u016dski Regiment, a Belarusian volunteer regiment fighting alongside Ukrainian troops who might one day help liberate Belarus.\n\nWhat could've been\n\n\"D\" believed that things could've been done differently, which might have led to a different outcome, while acknowledging there were also insurmountable systematic issues - a fact that he knew all too well having been conscripted into the Belarusian military.\n\n\"In my view, it was most important to develop the idea of strikes in railway enterprises and then move on to less critical elements, as in Belarus, the railway is the heart of the economy. But unfortunately, our leaders, even when they were already abroad, were afraid to take responsibility and coordinate these processes,\" he said.\n\nHe also highlighted the grassroots nature of the 2020 protests which he feels were both a blessing and a curse.\n\n\"There was a lot of initiative from the grassroots. People organized themselves in neighborhood and district chats, held actions where they lived, got to know each other.\n\n\"Before my eyes, a real, responsible, politically active civil society was being formed. I think that in 2020 we lacked coordination and leadership from above, although it's hard for me to blame our leaders for their indecision. You never know how you would behave in someone else's shoes,\" \"D\" added.\n\nBut unlike Ukraine during Euromaidan in 2014, the Belarusian protests in 2020 lacked the support of the security forces the result of the country's authoritarian nature, which was a potential key to its undoing.\n\n\"I heard some stories that also in the security forces, there were demarches among the police, some units refused to work, there were many middle-ranking officers who broke their contracts, some even recorded video messages. But there was not a single senior officer who had some people under his command and the will to fix it.\n\n\"But after my experience in the army, I understand why,\" he added.\n\n\"There are a lot of KGB agents in the army, as well as in the police, most likely they have some dirt on each senior officer, and if there is no dirt, the person will not be promoted or appointed to command a unit.\"\n\nWith that, just as the song fades into silence as it concludes, along with the changes that Belarusians once anticipated.\n\nBut with another election slated to take place in 2025, perhaps all it takes is to press the replay button to rekindle that call for change, as long as Belarusians have a voice - and a \"heart unconquered,\" as noted in the poem by Belarusian poet Yakub Kolas.",

These persons are sanctioned on the fourth anniversary of the fraudulent presidential elections in Belarus, in response to their involvement in ongoing and systematic human rights abuses in Belarus and support for Russia's illegal war of aggression against Ukraine.\n\nThe list of sanctioned individuals includes judges who, in blatant contravention of human rights obligations, have arbitrarily condemned and sentenced democracy defenders and regular citizens for expressing their opposition to the fraudulent elections of 2020. It also includes individuals who coordinate military production in Belarus and in close coordination with Russia.\n\nThe entities being sanctioned operate as part of the Belarusian defence and military-industrial complex and are involved in the production or repair of military equipment which enables Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Canada is also sanctioning a Belarusian state-owned enterprise which suppressed its employees' right to peaceful protest following the fraudulent elections of August 2020, intimidating and firing employees who joined peaceful protests and strikes.\n\nThese measures, which are imposed in coordination with international partners including the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States, are the latest example of Canada's ongoing efforts to exert further pressure on Belarusian authorities and to pursue accountability for those supporting Putin's brutal war of aggression against Ukraine.\n\n/Public Release.

But with so much going on, and regardless of how busy we all are at Kyiv Post, I think that as the Chief Editor it's time I began sharing my thoughts, observations and views with you again.\n\nWhat I propose is to add a regular Thoughts of the Day column in which I will flag briefly some of the noteworthy news or relevant events in the form of a personal comment from me.\n\nSo here goes with the trial run of this new format.\n\nRussia and Ukraine's Western supporters awed by Kyiv's audacity\n\nWe are witnessing an unannounced diversionary counteroffensive by the Armed Forces of Ukraine that has humiliated Putin and his cronies and spread panic and doubts among the Russian public. And it has also shown Western supporters that passivity will not bring peace any closer.\n\nVery relevant anniversaries this week that should not be overlooked\n\nAugust is replete with dates that remind us of Russia's despotic imperialism carried out directly through military aggression or its vassals. Let's recall the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia on Aug. 20, 1968, the attempted coup in Moscow on Aug. 17-19,1991 by hardliners intent on preserving the Soviet empire, the Russian invasion of Georgia on Aug. 8, 2008, and the fraudulent presidential election held in Belarus on Aug. 9, 2020, after which the pro-Russian local despot Alexander Lukashenko suppressed mass peaceful protests and moved even closer to Moscow.\n\nAug. 9 is the International Day of Solidarity with Belarus\n\nToday marks the fourth anniversary of the start of Belarusian peaceful revolution for freedom and democracy triggered by the Lukashenko regime's rigging of the presidential election. It subsequently resorted to harsh repression to hold on to power, and today, there are still an estimated 1,500 political prisoners in the country. Belarus has been transformed into a staging area for Russia's armed aggression against Ukraine. The heroic example set by the Belarusian patriots was applauded in the West at first, but gradually, their struggle for a democratic European, not despotic Russian, future was overlooked.

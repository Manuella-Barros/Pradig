Thousands of visitors have descended on the city centre over the past four days to marvel at the latest collection of paintings. The curtain closes on the event today, which has fulfilled its promise to create new and inspiring pieces of art throughout the Granite city. Many well-known locations across Aberdeen have been transformed including Shiprow\u2019s Ibis hotel and the old John Lewis building. Further afield, Aberdeen Airport was picked to give tourists arriving in the city a warm and inspiring welcome. A wide variety of events have been held across the four days, from opportunities for children to find their inner artist to walking tours. The tours have been run free of charge for people to learn more about the artists background and their inspiration behind the pieces. Nuart artists got to work in Aberdeen Excitement began to build before the Nuart festival had even begun. Our photographers captured the impressive building murals being painted by crane on June 3. The heavy-duty equipment helped artist Hera bring his Union Point creation to life. We also captured Cbloxx in the middle of his makeover of the John Lewis building. Kids given freedom to create street art Hundreds of youngsters also visited the grounds of Aberdeen\u2019s historic Marischal College to help create one of the world\u2019s biggest chalk murals. Nuart\u2019s \u2018Chalk Don\u2019t Chalk\u2019 event was described as a \u2018public art project\u2019, where children of all ages were given \u201cfreedom of the city\u201d to create their own street art in the quad. It was the third time Nuart Aberdeen hosted the chalk event, with hopes that this year\u2019s installation would be bigger and more ambitious than ever. Acclaimed street artist Molly Hankinson initially oversaw 400 primary and secondary pupils as they kicked off the mural last week. New Inspired Nights location at Shiprow Inspired Nights also returned with a new location at Shiprow this year. The open-air food and drink event acted as the hub for the Nuart Festival, providing a pit-stop for the large swathes of art fans on the busy street. It offered a wide array of street food and beverages, live entertainment and a number of activities for families. \u2018I came to Aberdeen for Nuart\u2019 More than 250 Nuart fans packed out two walking tours this weekend on Saturday and Sunday for the main event. Huge crowds dressed in waterproofs and umbrellas, braving the rain to see the unveiling of the latest Nuart murals. We also went along to gauge reaction from visitors to the city\u2019s makeover. Lihu Yang, from New Jersey, arrived in Aberdeen with his wife as part of his two-week driving tour of Scotland. Speaking to The Press and Journal, Lihu said Nuart was on of the \u201cmain reasons\u201d for visiting the Granite City. He said: \u201cThe paintings are very interesting. It\u2019s impressive how they paint them all the way up there. \u201cBut, so far I really like the city of Aberdeen. \u201cWe only just got here yesterday but the street art is actually one of the main reasons that we came here \u2013 it\u2019s great.\u201d Aberdonian Robert Milton also braved the customary Aberdeen weather to admire new pieces by Bahia Shebab and CBLOXX on Loch Street. Despite the heavens opening up on him and his wife Laura on their first-ever tour, he said the new pieces made Aberdeen stand-out. He said: \u201cThis is our first time coming to Nuart, but we think it is great, it definitely cheers the place up a bit. \u201cI like it I always notice the different things when I go around the city centre. \u201cIt really makes the place special.\u201d", "summary": "Despite some rain, thousands flocked to the city centre for the four-day festival.", "url": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/news/aberdeen-aberdeenshire/6496902/best-pictures-nuart-weekend/", "image": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/MicrosoftTeams-image-129-2eo2licgl.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:13:33", "author": "Graham Fleming", "authors": ["Graham Fleming"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.361}

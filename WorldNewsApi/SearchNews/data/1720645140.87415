The Euro 2024 championship will resume in Germany next weekend after a little break from European club football. Twenty-four teams will look to pip one another for the continental kingship. And Merson is of the opinion that Belgium and current champions, Spain won't be contesting for the trophy. \"I'm going to omit Belgium and Spain from my top five as I believe the teams that I've chosen stand a much better chance of making it through to the business end of Euro 2024,\" the Englishman said, according to Sportskeeda. \"Belgium's golden generation is done and they've disappointed me every time in a major tournament. \"Similarly, this is hardly the best Spain squad we've seen in recent years. He, therefore ranked Italy at number five, saying, \"Italy are always solid at the back but I doubt that will be enough if they are to become a force to be reckoned with in the knockout.\" He put Portugal at number four, saying Portugal are an aging team but they have a lot of experience within the squad. \"There's too much individual quality for them not to gel together as a unit, so I think they'll fare quite well at Euro 2024,\" he added. Germany, the host nation takes the number three spot in Merson's ranking, \"I don't think Germany are a great team but being at home is a massive advantage,\" he said. 2022 World Cup finalists, France are number two and England number one, according to Merson.", "summary": "<img width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Paul-Merson.jpg\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Paul-Merson.jpg 2048w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Paul-Merson-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Paul-Merson-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Paul-Merson-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /><p>Former Arsenal man, Paul Merson has ranked the five teams he believes could win the Euro 2024 championship.

{"id": 231256786, "title": "Giants trusting Deonte Banks to make 'big jump' to true No. 1' cornerback", "text": "Deonte Banks changed his jersey to No. 3 after a solid rookie season. The Giants are trusting Banks to be worthy of No. 1 billing \u2014 their top cornerback \u2014 as an encore. \u201cWe would like to see him grow and be that true No. 1 corner,\u201d defensive backs coach Jerome Henderson said. \u201cThere are some receivers in this league that, against anybody, you are going to want to give a corner help sometimes. \u201cYou hope against those guys he plays a game where you are like, \u2018OK, that\u2019s an even matchup for the Giants.\u2019 You hope he develops into that. He\u2019s working his butt off to get there. I\u2019m pushing him to get there.\u201d The deadline is fewer than 100 days away. The Giants open the season Sept. 8 against the Vikings, who just made Justin Jefferson (four years, $140 million) the league\u2019s highest-paid non-quarterback. Jefferson\u2019s career average of 98.3 receiving yards per game is far and away the most in NFL history, ahead of Calvin Johnson\u2019s 86.1. Not a soft introduction, but Banks isn\u2019t shying away from bigger responsibilities. Jefferson is followed by a murderer\u2019s row of potential matchups against fellow 1,000-yard yard receivers Terry McLaurin, Amari Cooper, CeeDee Lamb, D.K. Metcalf, Ja\u2019Marr Chase and A.J. Brown in the first seven games. \u201cI actually love it,\u201d Banks said. \u201cI take on the challenge, and I face it. I feel good about it. They believe in me.\u201d The Giants decided not to re-sign three-year starter Adoree Jackson and to spend money on other positions in free agency, which combined to form a vote of confidence in Banks. The assessment inside the organization was that Banks surpassed Jackson \u2014 who remains a free agent \u2014 during last season, anyway. \u201cYou see his physical gifts and you are like, \u2018Wow,\u2019 \u201d Henderson said. \u201cBut he has to make those physical gifts work for him every play. He has to grow in his awareness and his NFL 101 knowledge. That\u2019s where he can really make a big jump.\u201d At the same time, Banks is learning a new defensive scheme. The 2023 first-round draft pick was a favorite of former coordinator Wink Martindale because of his ability to play press-man coverage. Banks doesn\u2019t expect that skill to be de-emphasized just because new play-caller Shane Bowen utilizes more zone principles. \u201cIt\u2019s still aggressive, but just not as aggressive,\u201d Banks said. \u201cI really still have the same responsibility. I\u2019m still pressing, still up close on the guy.\u201d Banks allowed 53 catches for 644 yards and four touchdowns across 15 games last season, according to Pro Football Focus. More promisingly, he ranked second in the NFL in fewest receptions over expected allowed (-6.7), according to Next Gen Stats, despite drawing tough midseason assignments like shadowing McLaurin, Lamb (during the second of two Giants-Cowboys games) and Garrett Wilson. \u201cI feel like I had an OK year,\u201d Banks said. \u201cI started a little slow, and towards the middle and end of the season I got better. I got my [field] awareness of what\u2019s coming. I feel really comfortable, really confident.\u201d The 6-foot-2, 200-pound Banks spent the offseason in Florida training to add core body strength. \u201cThe more he plays, the more comfortable he\u2019s gotten,\u201d head coach Brian Daboll said. \u201cHe\u2019s playing some different things here with our new defense, but he\u2019s done a really good job throughout OTAs.\u201d If Banks struggles when the games start, it\u2019s unclear how he could be cut some slack. The Giants practiced in OTAs with converted slot cornerback Cor\u2019Dale Flott as the starter on the other side, versatile special-teams-first Nick McCloud in the slot ahead of rookie Dru Phillips, and Darnay Holmes and Tre Hawkins \u2014 both of whom were benched last season \u2014 as the perimeter backups. Someone will have to defend explosive rookie receiver Malik Nabers in practice \u2014 a challenge that could help Banks. \u201cGuys who become really productive players in the league, at some point in their career start letting their physical gifts help them, but they are also using their mind to help them as well,\u201d Henderson said. \u201cThey are playing a game that\u2019s much more knowledgeable than the eye would guess. They are seeing splits, they are seeing formations, what does down-and-distance tell me, who is this receiver and how does that factor in? Those are the areas where I\u2019m hoping he is growing.\u201d", "summary": "The Giants decided not to re-sign three-year starter Adoree Jackson and to spend money on other positions in free agency, which combined to form a vote of confidence in Deonte Banks.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/08/sports/giants-trusting-deonte-banks-to-be-a-true-no-1-cornerback/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-boxdkag3i-1717853672170.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1717839319&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:46:25", "author": "Ryan Dunleavy", "authors": ["Ryan Dunleavy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.134}

In the eighteen months since OpenAI changed the game with the launch of ChatGPT, Apple has yet to roll out any substantial AI features to the iPhone, iPad, or Mac, even as Microsoft, Google, and Meta have seemed focused on nothing else.\n\nBut if the rumors are to be believed, that's changing this year, as Apple is expected to release new AI features for iOS 18 and macOS 15 at WWDC in June. There have been murmurs about the trillion-dollar company's AI plans for months now, and the hints keep on coming. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who has a reputable track record of reporting on Apple rumors, the company is planning an AI approach that isn't quite as flashy as some of the competition's efforts. Instead, Apple will roll out AI features that integrate with the apps iPhone and Mac users already know and use, such as Photos, Notes, and Safari. The initiative is known as \"Project Greymatter.\"\n\nAs a bit of an AI skeptic, I like this plan. It allows Apple to enter into the AI space while offering AI-powered features people might actually use, rather than wasting resources on \"revolutionary\" AI capabilities that most users will ignore once the novelty wears off.\n\nWhatever Apple ends up announcing this year, its AI features will need to be powered by...something. Your iPhone or Mac likely already has an NPU (neural processing unit), which is a part of the hardware specifically designed for running AI tasks. (Apple already does have some AI features, including Live Text, which uses the NPU to handle processing.) The company made a big deal about the NPU in the M4 chip in the new iPad Pros, which, once added to the new line of Macs, will likely power many of Apple's upcoming AI features.\n\nHowever, not all features are ideal for on-device processing, especially for older iPhones and Macs. Gurman predicts that most of Apple's features will be able to run locally on devices made in roughly the last year. If your iPhone, iPad, or Mac is pretty new, the hardware should keep up. However, for older devices, or any features that are particularly power hungry, Apple is planning to outsource that processing power to the cloud.\n\nApple has reportedly been in talks with both OpenAI and Google to lease those companies' cloud-based AI processing to run some of its new features, but it's not clear whether (or when) those deals will materialize. Gurman says Apple plans to run some cloud-based features from server farms with M2 Ultra chips. If Apple can manage to handle their cloud processing on their own, I'm sure they'd prefer that to signing a deal with a competitor. We'll likely see how Apple's grand AI plan is coming together at WWDC.\n\nSpeaking of plans, here are the AI features Apple is rumored to be revealing in June:\n\nEmojis are a huge part of any iOS or macOS update (we may have already seen a handful of new emojis heading for a future version of iOS 18 and macOS 15). However, Gurman suggests Apple is working on a feature that will create a unique emoji with generative AI based on what you're currently typing. That sounds genuinely fun and useful, if done well. While there are a ton of emoji to choose from already, if nothing fits your particular mood, perhaps an icon created from whatever you're actively talking about with a friend will be a better choice. Over on Android, users have had \"Emoji Kitchen,\" which lets you combine certain emoji to create something brand new, for a few years now. Apple seems poised to offer an effective iteration on that idea.\n\nI don't know about you, but I've never been too thrilled with Siri. The smart assistant frequently fails to follow through on my requests, whether because it misunderstands my query, or just ignores me altogether. For some reason, it's especially bad on macOS, to the point where I don't bother trying to use Siri at all on my MacBook. If Apple can find to supercharge Siri with AI, or at least make it reliable, that sounds great to me.\n\nWe learned about the possibility of Apple integrating AI with Siri earlier this month, based on info leaked to The New York Times by an unnamed source. Gurman's recent report suggests Apple is planning on making interactions with Siri \"more natural-sounding,\" and while it's possible the company will outsource that work to Google or OpenAI, Gurman says the company wants to use its own in-house large language models (LLM). There may even be a specialized AI Siri in the the works for the Apple Watch.\n\nThat doesn't mean Apple is turning Siri into a chatbot -- at least not according to Gurman, who reports that Apple wants to find a partner that can provide a chatbot for the company's platforms in time for WWDC, without Apple having to build one itself. Right now, it appears the company has sided with OpenAI over Google, so we may see ChatGPT on the iPhone this year.\n\nEarlier this month, we learned Apple has at least one AI feature planned for Safari: Intelligent Search. This feature reportedly scans any given web page and highlights keywords and phrases in order to build a generative AI summary of this site. While Gurman says Apple is working on improved Safari web search, we don't know too much more about how Intelligent Search will work just yet.\n\nSpeaking of better search, Apple may use AI to make on-device searched in Spotlight more useful. The feature always gives me mixed results, so I'd love if generative AI could not only speed up my searches, but also return more relevant results.\n\nApple recently announced a handful of new accessibility features coming \"later this year,\" which is almost certainly code for \"coming in iOS 18 and macOS 15.\" While not all of these features are powered by AI, at least two that are seem really interesting. First, Apple is using AI to allow users to control their iPhone and iPad with just their eyes, without the need for external hardware. There's also \"Listen for Atypical Speech,\" which uses on-device AI to learn and identify your particular speech patterns.\n\nAs of last year, iOS and macOS will suggest words and phrases as you type, to help you finish your sentences faster. (This feature is not to be confused with the three predictive text options in Messages that have been around for years now.) With iOS 18 and macOS 15, Apple may roll out automatic replies as well. This means that when you receive an email or a text message, the app may suggest a full reply based on whatever you're responding to. Soon, we may all be communicating with single button taps. (Hmm, do I want to tap the response that says \"Sounds good: I'll meet you there,\" or \"Sorry, I can't. Raincheck!\")\n\nThis one would be a great use of AI: Apple already transcribes voice messages sent in the Messages app (quite quickly, in my experience), so utilizing AI to transcribe recordings you make in Voice Memos only makes sense.\n\nGurman says one of Apple's big focuses is \"smart recaps,\" or AI-generated summaries of information you may have missed while not looking at your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, including notifications, messages, web pages, articles, notes, and more. iOS already has a notification summary feature, but these smart recaps sound more involved.\n\nWe don't know too much about this feature, but Gurman also says Apple is working on ways to use AI for photo retouching. The company has already built an AI image editor that takes in natural language prompts to perform edits; it's possible it will incorporate some of those features into an AI photo \"enhancer\" for the Photos app on iOS and macOS.", "source": {"uri": "lifehacker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lifehacker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MacOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Siri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outsourcing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Icon (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://lifehacker.com/imagery/articles/01HYZRYJQ8G685B6KCFK5FNVX8/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603616", "eventUri": "eng-9603616", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

In the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported that Apple will officially announce a new partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI during the event, which will also focus on new AI features coming to iOS 18 and macOS 15 later this year.\n\nAccording to Gurman, Apple's current generative AI strategy is centered around adding intelligent features to its most-used apps. However, the company reportedly isn't planning to launch its own ChatGPT-like chatbot later this year, even though Apple has already started working on one.\n\nApple often uses the 'Privacy by design' card to differentiate itself from its competitors, and the company's new AI features should be no different. Gurman explained that iOS 18 and macOS 15 will intelligently determine whether an AI feature should run locally (on devices with recent Apple chips) or tap into cloud resources. Apple may also emphasize that unlike its competitors, it's not using user data to build customer profiles. Moreover, Gurman believes that Apple is still pursuing a partnership with Google to use the company's Gemini AI as an alternative to OpenAI's models.\n\n\"Apple is preparing to spend a good portion of its Worldwide Developers Conference laying out its AI-related features,\" Gurman wrote. \"At the heart of the new strategy is Project Greymatter -- a set of AI tools that the company will integrate into core apps like Safari, Photos and Notes.\"\n\nHere are the main AI features Apple is planning to reveal at WWDC according to Gurman:\n\nSiri upgrades: The digital assistant will be able to interact with users in a more natural way thanks to new large language models developed by Apple. An upgraded Siri will also be available on the Apple Watch to help users accomplish the most common tasks.\n\nPhoto editing: Apple's Photos app will help users to intelligently edit pictures. Here, Apple will just be playing catch up with the free AI-powered tools in Google Photos.\n\nSmart recaps: This feature will be able to summarize missed notifications, text messages, web pages, documents, and more.\n\nWrite message and emails: iOS and macOS will be able to suggest what to reply to emails and text messages, just like ChatGPT and other AI chatbots can already do.\n\nCustom emojis: Apple's AI technology will be capable of creating brand new emojis based on the content of messages users wrote.\n\nVoice memo transcription: This is quite self-explanatory, but this feature will use AI to transcribe voice memos in other languages\n\nWhile this isn't related to AI, iOS 18 will also bring major improvements to the Home screen. Gurman previously said that users will be able to rearrange app icons freely, but he's now reporting that Apple will also let them change the color of app icons... which is something some app developers currently charge a premium for. \"For instance, you can make all your social icons blue or finance-related ones green -- and they won't need to be placed in the standard grid that has existed since day one in 2007,\" Gurman wrote.\n\nOverall, iOS 18 and macOS 15 promise to be very important updates considering Apple's massive userbase. \"There will be hundreds of millions of Apple devices around the world that can support the AI features when they debut later this year,\" Gurman said. This could immediately turn Apple into a leader in the generative AI field, even though the company doesn't have the in-house technology to compete with OpenAI and other AI companies yet.", "source": {"uri": "thurrott.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Thurrott.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laurent_giret@thurrott.com", "name": "Laurent Giret", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MacOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Photos", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Photos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Icon (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Web page"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://thurrott-assets.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/web/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/Apple-Devices-AI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603616", "eventUri": "eng-9603616", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 58, "textEnd": 65}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

These are the rumored features I'm most looking forward to seeing revealed at next month's WWDC.\n\nApple is just weeks away from announcing its iOS 18 update at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) -- and iOS 18 could prove to be one of the company's biggest software updates yet.\n\nOver the past several months, rumors have swirled about Apple's plans for the next iteration of its mobile operating system. Many reports suggest that artificial intelligence will play a critical role in the software, helping Apple to reimagine how its mobile software operates and interacts with users. And although Apple hasn't confirmed any of those reports, considering how important AI has become in Samsung's Galaxy UI software and Google's Android, it stands to reason that AI will be fully baked into iOS 18 this year.\n\nAlso: The M4 iPad Pro's true potential will be realized at WWDC, and AI will have a lot to do with it\n\nBut AI may not be Apple's only focus with iOS 18. According to reports, there's a good chance that a new level of customization could come to the operating system, enabling users to do far more than they have previously. And with several outlets suggesting that Siri could become a truly useful tool this year, there's plenty to look forward to in iOS 18.\n\nSo read on for more about Apple's upcoming operating system and the five rumored features I'm most looking forward to seeing in this year's iOS 18.\n\nApple is planning to fully bake AI into iOS 18, according to several reports.\n\nFor one, Apple is planning to offer AI-generated emojis that show up in text messages as users type, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. In addition to custom emojis that respond to what users type, Apple's AI features in iOS 18 could retouch photos automatically, Safari will get an intelligent search feature to help users find websites more easily, and Spotlight will get an AI boost to help you find content on your device. Even Apple Music will get a boost by creating AI-generated playlists automatically based on user song preference.\n\nAlso: Apple builds a slimmed-down AI model using Stanford, Google innovations\n\nHowever, here's the big question: Which AI provider will Apple partner with to power iOS 18's AI features? Some reports have said that Apple is nearing a deal with OpenAI on iOS 18 features; other reports have suggested the iPhone maker is also talking to Google about using Gemini, as well as to Anthropic. Which provider Apple chooses could impact how AI works in iOS 18.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Apple's design philosophy over the years has centered on not allowing users to customize its operating system experience all that much. That's now changing.\n\nAccording to Gurman's sources, Apple will allow full iOS 18 customization this year. The feature would enable users to change the colors of app icons and -- perhaps most remarkably -- allow them to ditch the grid layout of apps in favor of a freeform option of their choosing. Apple's iOS has lagged behind Google's Android in enabling home screen customization, so it's nice to see the company consider opening things up.\n\nAlthough it's already been announced, Apple this year will adopt the Rich Communication Standard (RCS) for messaging. When iOS users have text exchanges with Android users, they'll now all have the same features available in Apple's iMessage, including the ability to send photos and videos, hold group chats without silly green bubbles, and more.\n\nAlso: MacBook Pro vs. MacBook Air: How to decide which Apple laptop to buy\n\nApple said earlier this year that it would launch RCS support for Android communication later in 2024. Chances are, it'll launch on iOS 18, and finally, communicating with Android users will be streamlined for iPhone and iPad users.\n\nAccording to several reports, Apple is planning a pretty big update to Apple Maps in iOS 18, and I'm all for it.\n\nFor one, Apple is reportedly planning to offer users the opportunity to create custom routes, so they can decide for themselves if they want to take the scenic route or try to get to their destination in the fastest time possible. The company also may add a topographical mapping feature, but it's the ability to create a custom route -- a feature Google Maps has long offered -- that could be the most compelling improvement.\n\nTrying to stay on top of everything during the day is extremely difficult. And too often, we're inundated with notifications.\n\nAlso: The best iPhone models of 2024: Expert tested and reviewed\n\nIn iOS 18, Apple is trying to address that with a rumored Smart Recaps feature. According to reports, Smart Recaps will give you a full overview of all the notifications -- emails, texts, app updates, and more -- that you may have missed. Apple's AI smarts will then be used to offer you the option to respond to those notifications with AI's help or ignore them. Either way, you won't need to tap through apps and waste time when AI can give you the updates with ease.

Will Siri start giving us Onion articles as if they're real, or urge us to eat poisonous mushrooms like other large language models are currently doing? The answer appears to be no: Apple's AI is much more focused on streamlining your life, not giving you inaccurate information with great confidence.\n\nThe latest details come via Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, whose Power On newsletter is a reliable source of information Apple hasn't yet made public. And he reckons that among the highlights of iOS 18 we'll see automated email and message replies, improved photo fixing and other improvements to the core iPhone apps.\n\nAccording to Gurman, the new features include:\n\nAs previously reported, Apple is using on-device processing for the tasks that are best done on your iPhone and only using the cloud for the really demanding ones. Apple is expected to make a big deal of what it says are the privacy advantages of this; most other systems make extensive use of the cloud to deliver their AI and large language model features.\n\nAccording to Gurman, Apple is going to make it very clear at WWDC that these features are works in progress: Apple will apparently brand them as \"preview\" tools rather than finished products, at least until iOS 18 is ready for full release in September 2024. That's a notable contrast to the likes of Google, whose roll-out of auto-generated answers in its core search product has created tons of bad publicity: it's reached the point where it's hard to tell if a screenshot of a supposed Google AI fail is the real thing or a fake.

Mark Gurman in his latest Power On newsletter said that the AI-generated emoji will be one of the new features the company will showcase at the event next month. As per Gurman, Apple is working on software that can create custom emojis based on the users' messages.\n\nGurman also reported that more customisation options for apps and the home screen will come with iOS 18. These customisations will enable users to change the colour of app icons and arrange things more freely without getting restricted by grid layout.\n\nReports also suggest that the company will roll out many new AI features with the iOS 18 operating system at WWDC on June 10. Gurman says that Apple will stick to the practical use of technology and is expected to announce a partnership with OpenAI to power its AI-based features. These upcoming features are expected to give AI boost to Apple apps and services such as Safari search, Siri, photo retouching, voice memo transcriptions, and more.\n\nHowever, the company is yet to confirm any of these features so readers are expected to take them with a pinch of salt.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple has not released a budget iPhone since 2022, but reports are suggesting that the company is working on a new one. The upcoming budget iPhone is anticipated to be named the iPhone SE 4 and is expected to be launched in the first half of next year. The price of the iPhone SE 4 has been leaked before its launch. Additionally, Apple's new budget iPhone is expected to have better specifications compared to previous iPhone SE models, including improvements in design and battery.", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Icon (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_SE_(1st_generation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone SE (1st generation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Siri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/05/ios-18-3-1716876224.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603616", "eventUri": "eng-9603616", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 61, "textEnd": 68, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

New features, AI rumors and all sorts of changes to expect from the next version of Apple's mobile operating system. Now Mark Gurman from Bloomberg has revealed a bunch of things we might see in iOS 18, including what kind of AI features we should expect.\n\nAccording to Gurman, Apple's AI strategy is to \"appeal to a user's practical side\" and offer features they will be able to use day to day. The other \"whiz-bang features\" will apparently be left to other companies. That means new features for existing core apps, including Safari, Photos, Notes and Siri.\n\nAI features reportedly on the way include photo retouching, voice memo transcription, suggestions on how to reply to emails and messages, improved search in Safari and Spotlight, auto-generated emojis made with generative AI, recaps of notifications and messages, summaries of documents and web pages, as well as more advanced capabilities for Siri.\n\nSiri's upgrades include the ability to have more natural conversations with the virtual assistant -- something that's been rumored for some time. Gurman also claims that there will be a more advanced version of Siri built for the Apple Watch, which is supposed to have been designed to handle \"on-the-go tasks\".\n\nThe emoji-generation feature sounds the most interesting to me, though. Apparently this will use generative AI to create brand new emojis based on the contents of your message. So you won't be restricted to the confines of the existing emoji catalog.\n\nGurman also revealed that iOS 18 will be letting users change the color of app icons, as part of a revamped home screen. While not related to AI, the idea here is that your apps can be color-coordinated. So finance can be green, social media can be blue and so on. Those apps won't need to be placed into the standard home screen grid either, potentially giving people the option to better personalize their devices.\n\nWe've already heard that Apple will be marketing these AI features as \"previews\" in the iOS 18 beta. While it's unclear whether this label will continue into the public version, it will emphasize the point that this technology isn't completely foolproof just yet.\n\nNo doubt we'll be hearing more about that, and iOS 18's AI capabilities at WWDC in a couple of weeks time.

Tech companies not talking about AI are hard to find. When compared to players leading in this space like OpenAI and Google, Apple is generally seen as being \"behind.\"\n\nBut despite AI being everywhere, in many ways it's also still a fringe technology for the average person. It's not truly mainstream. Sure it's accessible to anyone with access to the web, but the number of people actually using services like ChatGPT is still relatively small compared to the total population of users with a smartphone or computer.\n\nThis is why next month's WWDC presents Apple with tremendous opportunity. iOS 18 has the potential to truly bring AI to the masses.\n\nIf you've followed Apple for long, you know that the company is almost always seen as behind on something.\n\nBefore the Apple Watch debuted and dominated the smartwatch market, Apple was said to be doomed because it was taking too long to launch. When smart speakers were all the rage, Apple took its time launching the HomePod, and was also slow to release the more cost-conscious HomePod mini. VR and AR products, too, existed for years before the Vision Pro's launch.\n\nHave the HomePod and Vision Pro dominated their respective markets like the Apple Watch? No, but they also don't seem to have been hurt by launching later than their competitors. The challenges of those product categories overall seem like the main issue. Smart speakers and headsets make for cool tech demos, but they've yet to prove themselves as essential to daily life.\n\nHeading into WWDC, Apple is once again seen as behind, and this time it's with AI.\n\nWith its WWDC keynote coming at the tail end of the spring, Apple has to follow OpenAI's own spring update where GPT-4o was announced, and Google I/O where a variety of AI features were shared, not to mention Microsoft's Copilot Plus PC keynote.\n\nExpectations are high for Apple to deliver something remarkable at WWDC.\n\nBut what if 'remarkable' isn't the thing that takes AI mainstream?\n\nOther companies have shown truly remarkable demos of how their AI tech can transform lives. But Apple has the product ecosystem and design know-how to create AI use cases that are transformative on a broader scale.\n\nI don't expect to see a ton of 'wow' moments during the WWDC keynote. Instead, I expect Apple to show off a lot of features that are practically very useful and aimed at the masses. The tech should get out of the way and \"just work.\"\n\nWhen Apple launched the iPhone and iPad, it made computing more accessible to a wealth of new people. By reducing complexity and providing intuitive UI and input systems, the company helped create user-friendly experiences that shape billions of people's lives today.\n\nThe same potential is there with AI.\n\niOS 18 will put AI tools in the hands of countless users in a package that's familiar and, if Apple does its job well, not overly complex. Thanks to AI you'll be able to:\n\nThese are just some of the rumored AI features coming to iOS 18, and I suspect there will be a lot more than what has been reported.\n\nBy focusing on AI tools that assist users with real everyday needs, and leveraging its huge customer base, Apple could take AI features to a new level of mainstream popularity.\n\nIf you have friends, family members, or neighbors who don't really know what ChatGPT is, chances are by this fall they will be using AI features in iOS 18 -- whether they know they're using AI or not.\n\nIt's less than two weeks until Apple reveals all the AI features it's been working on for iOS 18 and its other software platforms.\n\nMy expectation is that we won't see anything particularly revolutionary on June 10, but that the way AI is baked into the systems and apps millions use every day will itself be the revolution.\n\nWhen iOS 18 and its sibling platforms launch to the public this fall, AI will start to change more lives than ever before. Users may not even know or care that some useful feature is backed by AI -- all they need to know is that it offers value.\n\nWhat do you expect from Apple's AI strategy? Is there anything you're especially hoping for from WWDC?

This will be led by something called \"Project Greymatter\", which Gurman says will integrate into core apps like Safari, Photos and Notes, as well as iOS itself with enhanced notifications.\n\nMost of this will be done on-device, as long as your iPhone, iPad or Mac is from the last couple of years. Cloud-based AI tricks will be handled via M2 Ultra-powered machines in data centers.\n\nThere's more in the works for this year, including voice memo transcription, AI photo touchups, an improved Siri, summarization, message suggestions and better searching in Spotlight. Gurman says we'll also see generative AI brought to the emoji, with \"software that can create custom emojis on the fly, based on what the user is texting.\"\n\nBut, as Gurman notes, a lot of these features will sound old hat to those who've used recent Samsung or Google Android handsets. Given Apple is already largely playing catch up with established features, is a \"preview\" label a touch worrying?\n\nIf Apple does label its AI features as a preview (and Gurman says this may or may not be just for the beta period), there are a couple of ways to look at it.\n\nFirst there's the pessimistic view: that Apple is so far behind the competition that it feels the need to reassure users that this isn't the finished article.\n\nBy the time the iOS developer preview rolls out this month, it will be over 18 months since ChatGPT blew everyone away in November 2022 and since Google launched the Pixel 6 with its Magic Eraser tool a month earlier. Mobile AI offerings have only gotten more sophisticated in the intervening months, and it's possible that Apple's initial offerings may appear quite underwhelming by comparison.\n\nAlternatively, there's a more Apple-positive way to view it: that a cautious approach is the only responsible way to tackle the introduction of AI.\n\nAt the recent I/O developer conference, Google's message was that AI was sophisticated enough to be front and center of its search offering. Now, the company is frantically trying to get rid of wrong, silly or downright dangerous advice its AI summaries are spitting out.\n\nWith a \"preview\" tag, Apple is basically saying: \"this is unfinished beta software, some things may be a bit wacky, so think critically\" -- which feels like a more sensible way of approaching the seismic changes AI promises to deliver in the next few years.\n\nWe'll have a better idea of which one of these analyses is correct once the developer preview is released, and we can see Apple's AI approach for ourselves. How it's implemented, how useful it seems and how well it performs its tasks will reveal whether Apple is justified in its caution or not.", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alan_martin@tomsguide.com", "name": "Alan Martin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Siri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_6", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pixel 6"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_I/O", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "O"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cj8Zfko4fqnTr4r6uprNsk-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603616", "eventUri": "eng-9603616", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

In his Power On newsletter this week, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports that AI-generated emojis will be among the new features Apple plans to showcase at WWDC next month. As if the current emoji library weren't overwhelming enough, Gurman writes that the company \"is developing software that can create custom emojis on the fly, based on what users are texting.\" I, for one, cannot wait to see the creative and possibly bizarre results that will come from this feature.\n\nRead: Uber offering Election Day discounts on two rides\n\nApple is also reportedly giving iPhone users more customization options for their apps and home screen. This includes the ability to change the color of app icons and arrange them more freely, moving away from the traditional grid layout. This change, especially the ability to freely arrange icons, would be significant for Apple and a welcome feature for users eager to personalize their home screens. However, it's important to remember that these are still rumours, so nothing is confirmed yet.\n\nThere has been a lot of speculation about Apple's AI plans leading up to its annual developers conference, which kicks off on June 10. Instead of debuting anything too flashy at this stage, Gurman suggests Apple will focus on practical applications for AI technology. Apple is expected to announce a partnership with OpenAI and, according to Gurman, may integrate AI enhancements into features like Safari searches, Siri, photo retouching, and voice memo transcriptions. The company might also introduce smart recaps for notifications, web pages, and more.\n\nIn summary, iOS 18 could bring a range of exciting new features to the iPhone, from AI-generated emojis to more home screen customization options.

Here's what to expect from the company during that packed week.\n\nApple has previously announced WWDC will be held from June 10, and has already strongly hinted that it will be an AI-centric event. Weeks away from the event itself, Apple has outlined the schedule for the event.\n\nAccording to a Tuesday announcement, the keynote will happen at 10 a.m. PDT on June 10, which will detail the \"groundbreaking updates\" arriving on Apple's platforms. The address will be streamable via the Apple Developer app, the Apple TV app, Apple.com, and YouTube.\n\nThe Platforms State of the Union will happen a few hours later at 1 p.m. PDT. It will take a deeper dive into the changes in iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS.\n\nApple Developer Program members and Apple Developer Enterprise Program members will be able to take part in online labs throughout the event, and in live forums.\n\nThere will be over 100 technical sessions across the week, covering new technologies and frameworks.\n\nDespite the new information on scheduling, Apple doesn't offer any new hints about content in the announcement. Then again, it's probably already said enough.\n\nApple's chief announcements will be its operating system updates, including iOS 18, iPadOS 18, watchOS 11, tvOS 18, and the next edition of macOS. With the release of the Apple Vision Pro, WWDC can also show off Apple's first major feature updates for visionOS.\n\nThe updates to iOS 18 will arguably be the main focus for users and developers alike. Following on from iOS 17, iOS 18 is rumored to include a big redesign of various UI elements, though it's unlikely that the Apple Vision Pro and visionOS will influence design alterations.\n\nAi improvements to Siri and iOS in general is expected to be a big feature, with the iPhone maker continuing to invest resources into developing generative AI. Aside from expected Siri improvements, the AI changes can also feed into other apps, such as providing automated summarizing functions.\n\nThis is far beyond consumer usage, too, as Apple has been rumored to be including changes to its development tools. Test versions of a future Xcode release apparently include AI tools, such as the automated prediction and completion of blocks of code, and automated code generation for testing applications.\n\nWhile few elements of what Apple will include aside from AI enhancements are reliably rumored, it does seem that Apple will be trying hard to minimize any initial beta bugs.\n\nIn November, development of new features for iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15 had been put on pause in favor of a week of bug stomping. The releases may be more crucial to Apple than usual, due to a general need to catch up with others in the generative AI space.\n\nRead on AppleInsider", "source": {"uri": "forums.appleinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AppleInsider Forums"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Developer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Developer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TvOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TvOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WatchOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WatchOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xcode"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software bug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "User interface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/58726-119698-57973-118097-56912-115755-56062-113816-Apple-Siri-xl-xl-xl-xl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603616", "eventUri": "eng-9603616", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 68, "textEnd": 75, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

There are also ongoing negotiations with Google for similar integration with its Gemini AI, and talks with Anthropic are in progress.\n\nNew 'Smart Recap' Feature\n\nA major new feature expected is the 'smart recap,' which will summarize missed texts, notifications, and various media like web pages, news articles, and documents. This aims to help manage iOS notifications better.\n\nAdditionally, the Voice Memo app will likely get AI-generated transcription capabilities, extending existing features like voicemail transcripts and system-wide captions.\n\nAI Enhancements Across Apps\n\nApple plans to improve on-device Spotlight search, Safari Internet searches, and writing suggestions for emails and texts with AI. AI might also be used to retouch photos and generate emojis based on text, despite past issues other companies have faced with similar features.\n\nSiri Improvements and Other Updates\n\nSiri is expected to get enhancements, including a more natural voice and better functionality on the Apple Watch. Apple aims to perform many AI tasks locally, but more complex operations will be handled on M2 Ultra-based servers.\n\niOS 18 Customization Features\n\nBeyond AI, Apple may introduce an iOS 18 feature allowing users to change app icon colours more easily, moving away from the current iOS Shortcuts app workaround.

The Keynote will be streamed on all the usual platforms, including Apple's website, Apple's official YouTube channel, and the Apple TV app. Developers will also be able to watch it in the Apple Developer app. If you miss it, on-demand playback will be available afterward.\n\nWhile the WWDC Keynote is the highlight for most of us, it's just the start of the excitement for Apple Developers, who will be able to delve deeper into the new features and APIs for third-party apps to take advantage of at the Platforms State of the Union at 1:00 p.m. PT. This will also be streamed, but only on the Apple Developer app.\n\nAs with all WWDC events since the COVID-19 lockdowns, Apple is hosting this one almost entirely virtually. That turned out to be a great change for developers, as it's blown open the doors of WWDC so that anyone can attend from anywhere without the need to enter a lottery and pay a hefty registration fee to get tickets to the live event. Apple is inviting a few developers to a \"viewing party\" at Apple Park, where they'll watch the same recorded video as the rest of us but will be able to partake in a few other activities like a tour of the campus, the Apple Design Awards, and an evening dinner.\n\niOS 18 will almost certainly be the most prominent announcement at this year's event, with Apple expected to add new generative AI features ranging from Siri improvements and intelligent transcription and summarization of voice notes to generative playlists in Apple Music.\n\nMany of these will also find their way into iPadOS 18, which could have a few surprises of its own. This is especially true considering Apple's debut of the M4 chip in the iPad Pro earlier this month, which seems designed to take advantage of powerful new AI features. By comparison, we've heard little about macOS 15 and watchOS 11, but Apple will likely have a few new tidbits there.\n\nWe'll also learn the name Apple has chosen for macOS 15, which will undoubtedly be inspired by the title of another California landmark. Apple has been using this theme since 2013, when it ran out of cat names, but there are still plenty of potential options in California. Apple has trademarked a few of these, including Sequoia, Mammoth, Diablo, Miramar, and Pacific. Still, it's not limited to those, and it's anybody's guess where it will end up this year.\n\nWhile WWDC is primarily about software, Apple occasionally tosses in a few hardware announcements. WWDC is often used for entirely new product categories, such as the Vision Pro in 2023 and, perhaps less significantly, the HomePod in 2017. However, Apple also uses the opportunity to unveil new M-series chips and Macs, such as the first M2 Macs at WWDC22 or the 15-inch MacBook Air last year.\n\nHowever, new hardware doesn't always show up, and considering the past two banner years, this could be a quiet one on that front. WWDC21 had no hardware announcements, and in 2020, Apple only announced its new Apple silicon platform for the Mac, which wasn't a product, per se.\n\nConsidering how little we've heard, a hardware-dry WWDC seems likely this time around. Apple's iPad and Mac lineups are mostly where they need to be, and while some feel that an M3 Ultra should be on deck, there's reason to believe the M3 is primarily an interim chip to fill the gap while it waited for a better chip fabrication process to be ready. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman also believes Apple will skip the M3 versions of the Mac mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro until next year when the M4 equivalent chips are ready.\n\nBesides, it will be hard for Apple to top last year's Vision Pro announcement, and with everything that's supposedly coming in iOS 18, a software focus makes much more sense this year.", "source": {"uri": "idropnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "iDrop News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MacOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Developer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Developer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TvOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TvOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WatchOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WatchOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Design_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Design Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mac Studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoia_Capital", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sequoia Capital"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping/Gifts", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping/Gifts", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.idropnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/WWDC24-Logo-in-Apple-Park-Circle-800x480.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603616", "eventUri": "eng-9603616", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 365, "textEnd": 372}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

The new OS update for iPhones is said to bring the biggest revamp in iOS history, with a range of customisation options, AI, smarter Siri, and a lot more to offer iPhone users greater flexibility than ever before.\n\nLet's take a detailed look at everything we are expecting from the upcoming iOS 18 software upgrade.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the upcoming iOS 18 will introduce a range of customisation options, including the option to change the colour of app icons, providing users with the freedom to curate their home screens to suit their preferences. This feature will provide iPhone users with more options for personalisation.\n\nIn addition to icon customization, iOS 18 is said to revolutionise home screen organisation by enabling users to place apps anywhere on the grid. This departure from the traditional locked grid layout will allow users more control over the arrangement of their apps, akin to the flexibility offered by widgets. With the ability to freely position apps, users will be able to create custom layouts and give their iPhone a personal touch.\n\nThe upcoming release of iOS 18 is also expected to be Apple's entry into AI. The Cupertino giant is said to bring significant artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities with iOS 18 across various native apps. Leveraging AI, iOS 18 will introduce features like photo retouching, voice memo transcription, and auto-generated emojis based on message content. These AI-driven enhancements are said to be aimed at streamlining user interactions and offering users intelligent tools that enhance productivity and creativity.\n\nApple is also said to make its virtual assistant Siri smarter. Siri is rumoured to undergo a transformative overhaul, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to deliver more natural and conversational interactions. With improved proactive intelligence and deeper integration with apps like Messages, Siri is said to offer enhanced capabilities such as auto-completing sentences and automating complex tasks through Shortcuts.\n\niOS 18 is also rumoured to introduce design refinements to elevate the overall user experience. While not adopting a complete overhaul like visionOS, iOS 18 is said to incorporate subtle design changes aimed at modernising the aesthetic and enhancing usability. These design updates, coupled with the customizable home screen and AI-driven features, will further improve the overall user experience.\n\niOS 18 will also bring updates to several native apps, including Safari, Maps, Photos, and more. Safari, in particular, reportedly will receive a significant overhaul with an updated look and new tools to improve browsing, such as an intelligent search feature and a web eraser tool. Similarly, Apple Maps will also gain support for custom routes and topographic maps, catering to outdoor enthusiasts and travellers alike.\n\nMoreover, iOS 18 is also said to introduce new AI-based features to apps like Notes, Calendar, and Reminders, augmenting their capabilities with voice memos transcription, AI-generated summaries, and seamless integration with Siri and Shortcuts.

Now imagine Siri learning your schedule, preferences, and even your personality so it can better communicate with you throughout the day.\n\nGenerative AI -- artificial intelligence that can provide thoughtful, thorough answers to questions and prompts -- could breathe new life into Apple's iPhone lineup at a time when competitors threaten to overtake Apple in the race to shape potentially world-changing technology.\n\nThe company is widely expected to partner with ChatGPT developer OpenAI ahead of its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June, where it will likely show off the first suite of AI tools that will be included in its iOS software.\n\nArtificial intelligence has powered some iPhone experiences for years, like live text and improved autocorrection, but generative AI could enable new levels of interaction and personalization. All this comes at a time when the company is under pressure to catch up with rivals like Google and Samsung, which have already adopted the technology in their smartphones.\n\n\"We see generative AI as a key opportunity across our products and believe it gives us a differentiating advantage,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said during the company's most recent earnings call in early May, noting that news was to be announced in the coming weeks.\n\nApple isn't always the first to adopt new technologies -- it typically aims to spend years researching, developing and perfecting them before incorporating them into new products -- but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI may be accelerating the company's need for smartphones equipped with cutting-edge technology.\n\nThe launch of the AI-enabled iPhone could encourage consumers to upgrade at a time when they are still holding on to older models. Apple reported first-quarter revenue of $90.8 billion, down 4% from the same period a year ago. The tech giant continues to struggle with growth challenges amid a volatile economic environment, especially in China.\n\nNow all attention has shifted to Apple's generative AI efforts, let's see how it plays out on the iPhone.\n\nIt's unclear what the iPhone's place in the world of generative AI will be, but experts widely believe the biggest entry point will be Siri, the company's virtual assistant, which has had a mixed track record.\n\nIntegration with OpenAI's latest ChatGPT-4o model could propel Siri years into the future, essentially turning it into an iPhone chatbot. This could allow Siri to perform specific tasks like recalling photos taken years ago on the device, or answering detailed questions about the weather, news, and trivia. Over time, it could learn the user's preferences and even personality and respond accordingly.\n\nGiven that competitors have already introduced generation tools, it's likely the iPhone will also begin to assist users with other tasks, such as suggesting email summaries or drafts, or initiating the online purchase return process.\n\nSamsung's \"Circle to Search\" feature, which lets users quickly find information on their device screen with a finger movement, has garnered a lot of attention and been featured in marketing campaigns. Multimodal capabilities, which refers to AI systems that can simultaneously interpret and generate different types of data, such as text and images, such as analyzing video footage or detecting spam during a phone call, could also be part of the tools, according to Paul Schell, an industry analyst at technology intelligence firm ABI Research.\n\nSchell said a similar feature would likely appear in Apple's products, given its relative simplicity and appeal beyond simple image search, but verbal interaction with a Siri-like bot would be much more natural and fluid, and its capabilities would go far beyond its traditional narrow confines of news and weather.\n\nThe AI iPhone can also automatically and seamlessly adapt to the user based on voice, audio, natural language, images and contextual hints.\n\nThomas Hasson, an analyst at market research firm Forrester, said generative AI will give the next generation iPhone a sixth sense, allowing us to scan and interact with the world around us.\n\nGenerative AI will also likely change Apple's entire ecosystem by being built into its own apps like Apple Maps, iMovie, and iPhoto, and developer tools will also be released to help brands develop new experiences through their own apps.\n\nApple has reportedly been working behind the scenes to develop on-device generative AI capabilities, acquiring companies like Canadian startup DarwinAI, and also has a machine learning research division dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence.\n\nBut after the launch of ChatGPT ignited the AI arms race in late 2022, followed by companies like Google, Microsoft and Meta dedicating significant resources to developing related tools, Apple has remained relatively silent about its vision for an AI-powered future.\n\nNabila Popal, senior research director at market research firm IDC, said pressure to join the talks likely accelerated the company's timeline.Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that Apple was close to a deal with OpenAI to use its ChatGPT technology in iPhones, after holding similar talks with Google.\n\nApple usually takes its time and doesn't rush the Android competition. [impact its moves]\"Whether it's foldables, 5G, augmented reality or virtual reality, Apple is going to do it better than anyone else,\" Popal said.\n\nBut this time around, she says, things are different when it comes to AI: It's as if Apple is being forced to show its cards early on.\n\nShe said consumers will value AI capabilities above all other features when choosing premium devices, especially in China, where Apple is losing market share.\n\nShe attributes this not just to Huawei's resurgence, but also to the lack of AI in its devices, as Chinese consumers demand more features from their premium phones.\n\nApple reminded audiences at its recent iPad event that it has been employing artificial intelligence in its products for years, including in the neural processing engine that powers its A11 bionic chip, but now it needs to demonstrate its commitment to artificial intelligence to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving industry.\n\nIt is no longer a question of whether Apple will announce anything about generative AI, but that they must if they want to achieve growth in the competitive and innovative smartphone market, especially in China. AI is a trend that Apple cannot afford to miss.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"},

Unlike previous Apple event invites - including the May 7 \"Let Loose\" event - this WWDC invite lacks a tagline and has a simpler design. However, there is a return to classic Apple form as the event kicks off at the often-used 10am PT time.\n\nThe invite features a glowing circle of blue, pink, purple, and yellowish-orange hues. Wondering why a circle? Well, it pretty much matches the overall shape of the main ring building at Apple Park, the company's headquarters in Cupertino, CA. There is a thicker row, then a thinner one, and lastly, a thicker one with the center open, displaying the WWDC 24 logo. The colors match the original logo shared back in March 2024 by Apple.\n\nThis could be a nod to the in-person event for media and developers at Apple Park, but it might hint at an all-encompassing rollout for Apple's rumored AI feature set.\n\nAlongside the next generations of iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS, we expect Apple to debut its overarching approach to AI. We recently saw Apple add AI-infused and -powered features to Logic Pro for iPad and Mac, but WWDC 2024 will be different.\n\nAfter OpenAI debuted ChatGPT-4o, Google showed off Project Astra, and Microsoft unveiled AI PCs, all eyes are now on Apple to deliver and impress on this front. It could be an LLM that runs on-device, with genuinely useful features for all the core applications, such as new photo editing tools or summarization tools across mail, calendar, and even phone. I hope we get transcription built into Voice Memos, at the minimum.\n\nSpecific to iOS 18, we expect more customization options for the home screen, smart summaries across nearly all applications, AI-generated emojis, and vastly improved searches. All of these were detailed in a fresh report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, which sets out the new AI features to expect in iOS 18. We may also see Apple speak to its in-house-developed AI models and potentially LLMs that could integrate with a partner like OpenAI to bake ChatGPT into the operating system.\n\nWhatever route it takes, we can expect the company to highlight the fact that a good portion of this will be processed securely and privately on-device, versus being sent off to the cloud. After all, the Neural Processing Units (NPUs) built into Apple's A-series and M-series silicon chips should be more than capable of handling these tasks.\n\nConsidering Apple refreshed the MacBook Air with the M3 chip in March and just debuted the M4 chip in the new iPad Pro earlier this month (check out our iPad Pro 13 (2024) review for our verdict), it might be too early to see additional hardware. However, there is always the possibility that Apple will revealed souped-up versions of these chips in a Mac, such as the Mac Studio or Mac Pro.\n\nIf you're looking for a new iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, or even a next-generation Vision Pro, those are likely all coming later. We could see Apple use WWDC 2024 as the event to announce the Vision Pro's international rollout, though.\n\nEither route, time will tell on all this, and at least we know when we should all be tuning in - 10am PT / 1pm ET on June 10, 2024, to watch Apple unveil it all from Apple Park. TechRadar will be on the ground, so stay tuned for full coverage.

Thus, we still need to know all the details and have it confirmed in advance. officially, a few are already outlined unreleased features on the iPhone that will arrive with iOS 18.\n\nThere remain some reasonable doubts about Apple's application of AI in iOS 18 and the rest of the systems. Likewise, knowing which part will be processed locally and which in the cloud, something that will also depend on the chosen models. In fact, it has been leaked since Apple has reached an agreement with OpenAI and is pursuing another with Google to complete its functionalities.\n\nAs far as functionalities as such are concerned, Mark Gurman, a Bloomberg analyst, recently published a report in which he detailed What will Apple use its AI for?summarized in these ten points that, we insist, are not yet confirmed and there may be variations.\n\nOf course, This will be transversal to other systems and it will not be all, since other surprises surely await us.

The idea is to appeal to a user's practical side -- and leave some of the more whiz-bang features to other companies.\n\nApple is in a challenging position. It needs to convince consumers and investors that it's doing exciting things in AI. But the company is following major AI announcements from Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and OpenAI, which have stolen the spotlight.\n\nApple is preparing to spend a good portion of its Worldwide Developers Conference laying out its AI-related features. At the heart of the new strategy is Project Greymatter -- a set of AI tools that the company will integrate into core apps like Safari, Photos and Notes. The push also includes operating system features such as enhanced notifications.\n\nThe system will work as follows: Much of the processing for less computing-intensive AI features will run entirely on the device. But if a feature requires more horsepower, the work will be pushed to the cloud.\n\nApple is bringing the new AI features to iOS 18 and macOS 15 -- and both operating systems will include software that determines whether a task should be handled on the device or via the cloud. Most of the on-device features will be supported by iPhone, iPad and Mac chips released in the last year or so. The cloud component, meanwhile, will be powered by M2 Ultra chips located in data centers...\n\nSupport MacDailyNews at no extra cost to you by using this link to shop at Amazon.\n\n\u200e\n\nMacDailyNews Take: Again, these new \"AI features\" for iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS to be revealed at WWDC is mainly a marketing exercise. The pressure is on Apple's marketing team to position the company as an innovator in the space (\"only Apple does so much AI on-device which so enhances users' privacy that it's 'stunning,'\" etc.) that also makes \"smart partnerships\" with other AI companies (OpenAI, for example). Now, more than ever, finding themselves so far behind, Apple needs to sell, sell, sell!\n\nApple was caught flat-footed, due to a lack of vision on the part of leadership... So, the only solution is to partner with a [Google, OpenAI, Baidu, etc.] for the real GenAI stuff while pretending (marketing) really hard that some on-device AI Apple has whipped up in a few months is \"insanely great Apple innovation\" that's at the heart of Apple's 2024's AI announcements when it's really just an adjunct... Watch Apple make a big show of its on-device AI at WWDC and run many ads touting it from June onwards.\n\nApple hopes to buy time for the data center buildouts and investments that will be required for them to someday own their own AI technology and not have to license it from the likes of [Google, OpenAI, Baidu, etc.].\n\nThis is what happens after a decade plus with a caretaker CEO at the helm after he hits the last page of his iteration playbook, yet attempts to stay in the game for too long. - MacDailyNews, April 1, 2024\n\nSee also: Apple is just weeks away from unveiling its big AI marketing effort - May 20, 2024\n\n\u200e\n\nPlease help support MacDailyNews.

Here's what to expect from the company during that packed week.\n\nApple has previously announced WWDC will be held from June 10, and has already strongly hinted that it will be an AI-centric event. Weeks away from the event itself, Apple has outlined the schedule for the event.\n\nAccording to a Tuesday announcement, the keynote will happen at 10 a.m. PDT on June 10, which will detail the \"groundbreaking updates\" arriving on Apple's platforms. The address will be streamable via the Apple Developer app, the Apple TV app, Apple.com, and YouTube.\n\nThe Platforms State of the Union will happen a few hours later at 1 p.m. PDT. It will take a deeper dive into the changes in iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS, and watchOS.\n\nApple Developer Program members and Apple Developer Enterprise Program members will be able to take part in online labs throughout the event, and in live forums.\n\nThere will be over 100 technical sessions across the week, covering new technologies and frameworks.\n\nDespite the new information on scheduling, Apple doesn't offer any new hints about content in the announcement. Then again, it's probably already said enough.\n\nAi improvements to Siri and iOS in general is expected to be a big feature, with the iPhone maker continuing to invest resources into developing generative AI. Aside from expected Siri improvements, the AI changes can also feed into other apps, such as providing automated summarizing functions.\n\nThis is far beyond consumer usage, too, as Apple has been rumored to be including changes to its development tools. Test versions of a future Xcode release apparently include AI tools, such as the automated prediction and completion of blocks of code, and automated code generation for testing applications.\n\nWhile few elements of what Apple will include aside from AI enhancements are reliably rumored, it does seem that Apple will be trying hard to minimize any initial beta bugs.\n\nIn November, development of new features for iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15 had been put on pause in favor of a week of bug stomping. The releases may be more crucial to Apple than usual, due to a general need to catch up with others in the generative AI space.", "source": {"uri": "appleinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AppleInsider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Developer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Developer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TvOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TvOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WatchOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WatchOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xcode"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software bug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Companies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://photos5.appleinsider.com/gallery/58726-120634-Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-10303-PM-xl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603616", "eventUri": "eng-9603616", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 68, "textEnd": 75, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

This project is said to use a hybrid approach, processing tasks locally on the device and sending more demanding tasks to the cloud.\n\nSiri is also getting an upgrade with Apple's own large language models (LLMs) for more natural interactions. They're even developing a more advanced Siri specifically for the Apple Watch, and probably one with the subscription, as rumored previously.\n\nHowever, when it comes to AI, Apple seems to be admitting it needs help, as it's well known in the industry that Apple is said to be running behind its tech rivals Google and Microsoft. Hence, without a homegrown offering, they're looking to partner with Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI.\n\nReports suggest negotiations with Google for access to Gemini were underway. However, Apple, as speculated, sealed the deal with OpenAI. This partnership positions Apple competitively against Samsung devices that rely on Google's offering.\n\nBut there are concerns. OpenAI's CEO has faced recent controversies, and the company itself has a somewhat unstable structure after the co-founder and many other highly-ranked team members left the team. This is why Apple is still pursuing a deal with Google to offer Gemini as an alternative in the future.\n\nDespite playing catch-up, Apple has a significant advantage - its massive user base.

This isn't surprising with Apple expected to announce a partnership with AI leader, OpenAI, potentially bringing AI enhancements to Safari, Siri, and the Photos app.\n\nOne intriguing possibility is custom emoji generation. Similar to the custom emoji launched to Android users at the Google I/O event, iOS 18 might allow users to create unique emoji on the fly, tailored to their messages. This opens a world of possibilities for personalized expression.\n\nAnother rumored change concerns app and home screen customization. The current grid layout might become a thing of the past, with iOS 18 potentially allowing users to change app icon colors and arrange them more freely. This would be a significant shift for Apple, offering users greater control over their iPhone's visual aesthetic.\n\nWhile the flashy AI-generated emoji might grab headlines, reports suggest Apple will prioritize practical applications of the technology. We might see AI enhancements in areas like Safari searches, Siri performance, photo editing tools, and even voice memo transcriptions. Additionally, iOS 18 could introduce \"smart recaps\" that summarize notifications, web pages, and other content, saving you valuable time.\n\nIt's important to remember that these are still rumours.

Here's what to expect", "body": "{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nApple is set to hold its biggest software event of the year: its Worldwide Developers Conference, or WWDC. And there is expected to be one big thing on the schedule.\n\nWWDC is the event where Apple updates every one of its products with new software and features. As such, it will see iOS 18 for the iPhone as well as a range of other new operating system versions.\n\nAll will be revealed on 10 June, when Apple screens its opening keynote live around the world.\n\nBut here is everything we know about WWDC 2024 ahead of the event.\n\nAI is expected to be the central theme of this year's event. Apple doesn't usually give much away about its launches, but has already flagged this in advance, with marketing boss Greg Joswiak treating that the event will be \"Absolutely Incredible\". (The capital letters are his.)\n\nApple had long resisted using the word AI, and though it has been introducing similar technologies in both its hardware and software, it has typically marketed them as being \"proactive\" or based on \"machine learning\". Now - after urging from investors and commentators who feared it was being left behind - it seems ready to use the word and more explicitly announce those updates.\n\nWhile it's nearly certain that there will be a strong AI focus, it is less clear what those AI updates will be. But it appears that Apple will largely keep its approach of focusing on seasoning its operating system with new AI upgrades, rather than adding spectacular but not necessarily useful new features.\n\nThose might include automatically generated Apple Music playlists, automatic assistance with writing and coding, and an improved Siri that is both better at conversing with people and getting things done.\n\nApple might also offer more dramatic generative AI tools, and rumours have suggested that it has been in discussion with both Google and ChatGPT creators OpenAI to build them. That might let people generate an image by asking for one, for instance.\n\nIt's likely that many of Apple's products will get their own AI-infused updates - even if it's just in the form of an improved Siri. But Apple usually focuses on bringing new updates to the iPhone first, and then rolls them out to other platforms such as the iPad.\n\nAI will be the main focus, but probably won't be the sole upgrade.\n\nThe iPhone for instance is rumoured to be getting a more customisable home screen. That would let users place the apps wherever they want them, for instance, rather than being forced to drop them in the existing line-up grid.\n\nApple tends to update every one of its products at WWDC - so expect new features for the Mac, Watch, Apple TV, Apple Vision Pro and HomePod. But rumours have focused on the new AI tools, and it is not yet clear what those upgrades might bring.\n\nApple first introduced its augmented reality headset at WWDC last year, and it arrived in February. Then, it said that it was on its way to other countries, but there has been no sign of it yet.\n\nNumerous reports have suggested that it is finally on its way, however. Tim Cook has said that it is coming to China this year, and job ads suggest that Apple is preparing to offer it in the UK, Australia, Japan and elsewhere.\n\nWWDC would offer a great opportunity to announce the headsets public release.\n\nApple is also expected to offer the new version of VisionOS, the operating system that powers the headset. And the company has been lightly criticised for failing to keep momentum after the release by launching new immersive content for the headset, so it might unveil some of that too.\n\nWWDC is Apple's software event, and that tends to get most of the time during its announcements. But it sometimes uses the spotlight to introduce new hardware as well, and tends to focus on professional tools when it does so.\n\nThere are still a range of products that are yet to be upgraded to Apple's M3 series of chips, including the Mac Studio and Mac Pro, both of which received updates last year. But rumours have suggested that they might skip them entirely, and get the M4 chip that arrived in the new iPad Pro earlier this year.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Joswiak", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greg Joswiak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality headset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playlist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playlist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mac Studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomePod", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HomePod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mac Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/28/16/GettyImages-1695122319.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603616", "eventUri": "eng-9603616", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 525, "textEnd": 532}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Then consider Siri learning your schedule, preferences, even your personality, so it can better communicate with you throughout the day.\n\nGenerative AI, artificial intelligence that can provide thoughtful and thorough responses to questions and prompts, could potentially breathe new life into Apple's iPhone lineup at a time when competitors are threatening to leave the company behind in the race to shape what could be a world-changing technology.\n\nThe company is widely expected to partner with ChatGPT maker OpenAI ahead of its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June, where it will likely show off its first batch of AI tools coming to the iOS software.\n\nAlthough artificial intelligence has powered some of the iPhone's experiences for years, such as Live Text and improved autocorrect, generative AI could unlock new levels of interaction and personalization. All this during a time when the company is under pressure to catch up to rivals such as Google and Samsung, which are already using the technology in its smartphones.\n\n\"We see generative AI as a key opportunity across our products and believe we have advantages that set us apart there,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the company's most recent earnings call in early May, noting there would be news announced in the \"weeks ahead.\"\n\nApple is not always first to adopt to emerging technologies -- it typically researches, develops and aims to perfect them for years before including them in new products -- but the speed at which the world is adopting generative AI is perhaps expediting the company's need to have a smartphone with the most cutting-edge technology.\n\nThe debut of an AI iPhone could also entice consumers to upgrade at a time when they've been holding onto older models longer. Apple reported first-quarter revenue of $90.8 billion, down 4% year over year, as the tech giant continues to struggle with growth challenges, particularly in China, amid an uncertain economic environment.\n\nNow all eyes shift to Apple for its take on generative AI. Here's how that could play out on the iPhone:\n\nA much smarter assissant\n\nAlthough it's unclear what exactly an iPhone in the generative AI world would look like, experts largely believe the biggest entrypoint is through Siri, the company's virtual assistant with a hit-or-miss track record.\n\nIntegration with OpenAI's latest ChatGPT-4o model could catapult Siri years forward, essentially turning the feature into an iPhone chatbot. This would enable Siri to perform specific tasks such as recalling a picture taken years ago on the device or answering detailed questions about the weather, the news or trivia. Over time, it could learn the user's preferences and even personality, and respond accordingly.\n\nLooking at how competitors have already introduced generative tools, the iPhone will also likely assist users with other tasks, such as offering to summarize and draft emails, or starting an online purchase return process.\n\nSamsung's \"circle to search\" feature, which allows users to quickly search for information on a device's screen with a finger gesture, has received a lot of attention and is featured in marketing campaigns. Multimodal features - which refers to an AI system that can interpret and generate different types of data, such as text and images at the same time -- like analysis of video footage and in-call spam detection could also form part of the tools, according to Paul Schell, industry analyst at tech intelligence firm ABI Research.\n\n\"Something similar would likely be included in an Apple offering, given its relative simplicity and appeal that goes beyond simple image search,\" Schell said. \"But verbal interactions with a bot like Siri will be much more natural and fluent, and its capabilities will go far beyond the previous, narrow domains, like news and weather updates.\"\n\nAn AI iPhone could also adapt automatically and seamlessly to users, based on voice, audio and natural language, along with images and contextual cues.\n\n\"Generative AI will allow the next generations of iPhones to become a sixth sense, empowering us to scan and interact with the world around us,\" said Thomas Husson, an analyst with market research firm Forrester.\n\nGenerative AI will also likely change Apple's whole ecosystem by embedding it through its own apps, such as Apple Maps, iMovie and iPhoto, and release tools for developers for brands to develop new experiences through their own apps.\n\nExpediting AI\n\nBehind the scenes, Apple reportedly has been working on its on-device generative AI capabilities and acquiring companies for awhile, such as Canadian startup DarwinAI. It also has a machine learning research division dedicated to advancing artificial intelligence.\n\nBut after the launch of ChatGPT ignited an AI arms race in late 2022, followed by companies such as Google, Microsoft and Meta heavily pouring resources into developing related tools, Apple has remained relatively quiet about its visions for an AI-powered future.\n\nNabila Popal, a senior research director at market research firm IDC, said the pressure to be part of the conversation likely moved up the company's timeline. Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported Apple was closing in on a deal with OpenAI to use its ChatGPT technology on iPhones, after holding similar talks with Google.\n\n\"Apple normally takes their time and doesn't let the Android race rush [impact its moves], be it with foldables or 5G or even augmented and virtual reality,\" Popal said. \"And Apple then comes out and does it better than anyone else.\"\n\n\"However this time, with AI, it is different,\" she said. \"It's almost like Apple is being forced to show its hand early.\"\n\nShe said consumers are considering AI capabilities of greater importance than any other feature when choosing their premium device, especially in China, where Apple is losing its marketshare.\n\n\"It's not just because of the resurgence of Huawei but also because of 'lack of AI' in their devices,\" she said. \"Chinese consumers want more from their premium phones.\"\n\nDuring its most recent iPad event, Apple reminded onlookers that it's been using artificial intelligence in its products for years, including a neural processing engine to support its A11 bionic chip.

The annual developer conference will get underway with a keynote that day, which Apple plans to live stream.\n\nThe WWDC 2024 keynote will begin at 1 p.m. ET / 10 a.m. PT / 6 p.m. BST on Monday, June 10. In the past, Apple has streamed the keynote on its website, though we also imagine you'll be able to watch from the company's YouTube channel.\n\nDon't look for many clues in the invite for the WWDC 2024 keynote. It merely shows a logo for Swift, Apple's programming language, along with the words \"Coming in Swiftly.\" Certainly, that's the sort of thing you'd expect to hear about at a developers conference for Apple products.\n\nHowever, the focus at WWDC 2024 is expected to be centered around AI -- specifically Apple's efforts to play catch-up with the work already going on at Google, Microsoft and other tech giants who are farther along at implementing AI into their products than Apple currently is. WWDC is giving Apple a chance to rectify that, as we're expecting to hear about AI's role in this year's Apple software updates.\n\niOS 18 in particular is supposed to showcase new AI features, with many of those leaking out in a report over the weekend. Among the highlights will be an improved Siri assistant capable of having more natural conversations, an emoji-generation feature and other tools aimed at helping users get started in built-in apps like Keynote and Pages.\n\nIn addition to iOS 18, we're also expecting previews of the latest versions of watchOS, macOS, tvOS, iPadOS and visionOS. Developer betas are usually released during WWDC, with public betas following in the weeks after the event.\n\nWith Apple having recently announced new iPads powered by the M4 chip and an iPhone SE 4 not expected until 2025, there's not much expectation of hardware announcements during the WWDC keynote. It's always possible Apple could surprise us with Mac news of some sort, though most Mac hardware announcements are expected in the latter half of this year.\n\nWe'll find out soon enough what Apple will focus on its WWDC 2024 keynote.

Interestingly, Apple is said to be still in talks with Google to offer Gemini tricks in a more meaningful way.\n\nApple is expected to announce its big AI plans at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2024 in just a couple of weeks.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Safari (web browser)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Photos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Photos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Pixel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Pixel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google Assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nanotechnology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-to-image_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Text-to-image model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative pre-trained transformer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TJLKHuHe.nfcDGFTcwzPfw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/digital_trends_973/ee6166d6efe7a5d6b29840c1ebab6a0c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603616", "eventUri": "eng-9603616", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

(NASDAQ:AAPL) truly kickstarted the personal voice assistant frenzy when it launched Siri with the iPhone 4s, forcing rivals like Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. to launch their own solutions.\n\nHowever, Apple acquired Siri more than a year before it integrated the voice assistant on the iPhone. Siri, which was initially launched as a third-party app in February 2010, was acquired by Apple two months later. It took Cupertino nearly a year and a half to integrate it into iOS.\n\nWhile Siri was launched with a lot of fanfare, the hype around voice assistants has died down over the last few years. Although Google, Samsung, and even Amazon.com Inc. have consistently improved their solutions, Apple's Siri has remained on the back burner.\n\nSubscribe to the Benzinga Tech Trends newsletter to get all the latest tech developments delivered to your inbox.\n\nApple has since launched 14 iPhones, with some offering bigger upgrades than others. While Siri has also gained some new features over this time, its functionality remains limited. The initial novelty of talking to your phone and receiving a semi-human-like response has worn off.\n\nWith that said, here's what would have happened if you invested $1,000 in Apple stock when it acquired Siri 14 years ago.\n\nApple stock price from April 1, 2010, till today\n\nApple's stock, adjusted for stock splits and other corporate actions, was $8.42 on April 1, 2010.\n\nIts stock price today is $189.98, which is an increase of 2,154% during this period.\n\nValue of a $1,000 investment in Apple stock, and the QQQ ETF and S&P 500 index, respectively, from April 1, 2010, till today\n\nIf you had invested $1,000 in Apple stock on April 1, 2010, today, you would have $22,543.\n\nA previous report has suggested that Apple will completely revamp Siri when it launches the iPhone 16 with iOS 18. Some features, like on-device AI processing, are said to be iPhone 16-exclusive, while older iPhones will switch to cloud-based processing.\n\nWhile Tim Cook has not been as vocal about AI as his peers, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Microsoft Corp.'s Satya Nadella, the Cupertino chief is reportedly inching closer to a deal with OpenAI to push out generative AI features to iPhones.\n\nSeparately, Apple is also working on its own suite of AI features as part of \"Project Graymatter.\"\n\nBeyond this, we should know more about Apple's AI efforts at the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference, or WWDC, in June.\n\nCheck out more of Benzinga's Consumer Tech coverage by following this link.\n\nRead Next: Happy 48, Apple: If You Invested $1000 In Apple When It Went Public, Here's How Much You'd Have\n\nPhoto by Omid Armin on Unsplash", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Siri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Electronics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sundar Pichai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEC991F4_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603616", "eventUri": "eng-9603616", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-04-01", "textStart": 1318, "textEnd": 1331, "freq": 4}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-02-", "textStart": 389, "textEnd": 402}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Now, we've got a full look at the entire schedule, as Apple has outlined its plans for the entire event.\n\nApple's WWDC 2024 event takes in the week commencing June 10. Apple confirmed that this first day is when the main keynote will be held, for all of the biggest software announcements. All eyes will be on the iPhone's next major software update, iOS 18, and Apple's AI reveal. The keynote will begin at 10am PDT/1pm EDT/6pm BST and will be live-streamed on Apple's website, the Apple Developer app, the Apple TV app, and the Apple YouTube channel. Some developers and members of the media have been invited to watch the live stream at a special event in Apple Park on the day.\n\nDirectly after the main keynote, at 1pm PDT, Apple will hold its Platforms State of the Union event. This smaller-scale event will give developers a deeper look at all of the new announcements. It will also be live-streamed. Throughout the rest of the week, Apple will hold smaller sessions for developers to give them further insights on the announcements. It will also see the announcement of the Swift Student Design Challenge, Apple Design Awards, and further access to experts.\n\nBeing perhaps one of the most iconic Apple events of the year, WWDC is filled with tonnes of information on all the latest OS' and sometimes even comes with some surprise hardware teases, like the unveiling of Apple Vision Pro last year.\n\nAs well as seeing the announcement of awesome bits of software like iOS 18, macOS 15, iPadOS 18, and watchOS 11, we are expecting to finally see visionOS 2.0, the first major software update to Apple's AR headset. Finally, we might get to finally see a snippet of what Apple AI will look like, and, by extension, what the strategy is for the next few years of Apple devices. Apple's AI plans have been in the dark for a long time, and we might finally see what's in there after all this time.", "source": {"uri": "imore.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "iMore"}, "authors": [{"uri": "connor_jewiss@imore.com", "name": "Connor Jewiss", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Developer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Developer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WatchOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WatchOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality headset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MacOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swift (programming language)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Design_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Design Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augmented reality"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping/Gifts", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping/Gifts", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Shopping", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W28fqxtTqfvXZQsRJJLR8k-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603616", "eventUri": "eng-9603616", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 244, "textEnd": 251}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

The new operating system is anticipated to be unveiled by the Cupertino, California-based tech giant on June 10 at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2024. According to a recent rumor, the company may roll out bespoke emojis driven by artificial intelligence (AI) that appear based on the content of the message the user is sending. Additionally, users could be able to customize app icons by recoloring them to their preference.\n\nAccording to the Power On newsletter by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple is going to introduce multiple new iPhone features with the iOS 18. While many of these features could leverage AI, some of them would also add more customisation to the existing interface. Coming to the AI feature first, Gurman claims that custom emojis could be unveiled at WWDC 24. AI features have become a big talking point for Apple. The company was previously reported to add AI-powered conversational skills to Siri. Now, Gurman claims iPhone users will also see AI features when they type a text in a messaging app. iOS 18 could introduce AI-powered custom emojis, which would be outside of the existing emoji library users get.\n\nExplaining how the feature might work, the report claims custom emojis can be created automatically based on what the user is typing. For example, if a user types \"Happy Diwali\", the AI might be able to understand the text and suggest a unique emoji relating to the Indian festival. The report did not mention whether there will be any guidelines to stop people from abusing the feature and generating obscene emojis.\n\nReportedly, the iPhone Home Screen will also get a big upgrade. Apple could ditch the standard grid for apps that has existed since the first iPhone and allow users to place app icons wherever they want. Further, users might also be able to recolour app icons. The latter could help group similar apps. For example, all social media apps can be changed to the same colour for ease of identification. The ability to place icons anywhere will also let users bring out their creativity and set icons as per their preferences.

Below you'll find details of exactly how to watch the WWDC 2024 keynote, and what we're expecting to be shown off at the event.\n\nApple hasn't yet announced the start time of its June 10 WWDC 2024 keynote, but based on past form it's likely to kick off at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BST, which is 3am AEST on June 11 for those in Australia.\n\nWe'd expect you'll be able to watch the livestream on Apple's YouTube channel or on the Apple website, while if you're using an Apple device you'll probably also be able to tune in on the Apple TV app.\n\nThe stream link isn't live yet, but we'll embed it here once it is.\n\nThere are likely to be a number of major software announcements at WWDC 2024, with iOS 18 expected to be the headliner.\n\nFrom what we've heard so far, iOS 18 could be the biggest overhaul of Apple's smartphone operating system in years, with a wealth of AI features - including an AI-powered upgrade for Siri - along with an AI App Store, an upgraded visual design, new accessibility features, and the ability to more freely customize your iPhone's home screen.\n\nAlongside iOS 18 we're also expecting to see iPadOS 18, which is likely to get a similar assortment of new features and improvements.\n\nFor Apple Watch wearers there will most likely be watchOS 11, but this probably won't get such a big overhaul, with the typically reliable Mark Gurman describing this as a \"fairly minor\" update, albeit one that might still get some AI features of its own.\n\nWe also expect to see new software updates for various other Apple products, such as macOS 15 (which will probably also benefit from some new AI tools), tvOS 18, HomePod Software 18, and visionOS 2, though we haven't heard much about these updates yet.\n\nNote, however, that while new versions of all these operating systems will likely be announced at WWDC, these won't be finished versions. We'd expect betas for at least some of them shortly after the event, but the finished releases won't land until later in the year. iOS 18 for example probably won't be finished until September.\n\nThat's all the software covered, and while WWDC is typically focused on software we do sometimes get hardware announcements too, with the Apple Vision Pro at WWDC 2023 being a recent example. However, it's unclear whether any hardware will be in attendance at WWDC 2024.\n\nNew iPads including the iPad Pro 2024 and iPad Air 6 are expected before WWDC at the next Apple event on May 7, while the iPhone 16 line and Apple Watch 10 won't land until later in the year. However, some new Macs - such as refreshes to the Mac Studio, Mac Mini, and Mac Pro - are due, so we might see those there.\n\nIt's also possible that Apple will announce when the Vision Pro will be available in regions other than the US.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_rogerson@techradar.com", "name": "James Rogerson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WatchOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WatchOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(iOS/iPadOS)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "App Store (iOS/iPadOS)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accessibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mac Studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_(computer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mac (computer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomePod", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HomePod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TvOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TvOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks_and_Watches", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks and Watches", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ci5bKoLeTJrSzahFVeQ8Fo-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603616", "eventUri": "eng-9603616", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 98, "textEnd": 105, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 165, "textEnd": 172}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-11", "textStart": 865, "textEnd": 872}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 2989, "textEnd": 2994}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

It's no surprise that AI will be a big component of the announcements and one of the major new features could be something we all use every day.\n\nAccording to Mark Gurman's latest Power On newsletter, one of the \"standout\" features in iOS 18 \"will bring generative AI to emojis.\" Gurman claims Apple \"is developing software that can create custom emojis on the fly, based on what users are texting. That means you'll suddenly have an all-new emoji for any occasion, beyond the catalog of options that Apple currently offers on the iPhone and other devices.\"\n\nWe reported last week that the Unicode Consortium is considering a handful of new emoji for its next update, including a face with bags under its eyes, a fingerprint, a harp, a leafless tree, and a splatter mark. Apple is certain to include these emojis in one of next year's iOS 18 updates, but if Gurman's report is accurate, we won't need to wait for them -- any emoji to express any emotion will be at our fingertips.\n\nGenerative AI is the same tech behind ChatGPT's conversational chats and Dall-E's image creation. Gurman doesn't get into specifics, but it seems like you'll be able to type a word or phrase into Messages and a unique emoji will generate an emoji to fit what you want to express. Then we wouldn't need to wait for Apple to design its own versions of the Unicode Consortium's annual selections.\n\nAlso on deck for iOS 18, according to Gurman, is a \"revamped\" home screen\" with the ability to \"change the color of app icons and put them wherever they want,\" system-wide \"smart recaps\" that will \"provide users with summaries of their missed notifications and individual text messages, as well as of web pages, news articles, documents, notes and other forms of media,\" and a partnership with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT into the iPhone.", "source": {"uri": "macworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Macworld"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_simon@macworld.com", "name": "Michael Simon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_Consortium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unicode Consortium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fingerprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Icon (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Web page"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emotion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers", "label": "dmoz/Computers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/wwdc2024.png?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603616", "eventUri": "eng-9603616", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

A Sunday report from Bloomberg suggests Apple could bring AI into photo editing, messages, emoji and email. It could also add voice memo transcriptions, faster search and a more conversational Siri.\n\nWe also expect to get updates for other software like MacOS, iPadOS and VisionOS.\n\nRead more: It's Rumored That iOS 18 Will Change Your iPhone in Big Ways. Here's How\n\nEarlier this month, Apple unveiled a lineup of new iPad Airs and Pros, with the Pros sporting the more powerful and efficient M4 chip. Apple said the chips also feature improved machine learning for AI-based tasks. If past WWDC keynotes are any indication, it's possible the company will spend a decent chunk of its keynote touting its in-house chips -- and all their AI capabilities.\n\nApple earlier this month also unveiled some accessibility updates coming to the iPhone, iPad, Vision Pro and CarPlay later this year, like Eye Tracking, Vocal Shortcuts and Live Captions in VisionOS. It's possible the company could share more about the timing of that rollout during WWDC.\n\nApple sent both online and in-person WWDC invites on Tuesday, with the event once again taking place at Apple Park in Cupertino, California.

WWDC is typically a software-centric event, so we might hear some details on the work Apple has been doing around AI over the last year or so. Other reports indicate that Apple will show off a suite of upcoming updates, including iOS 18, iPadOS 18, tvOS 18, macOS 15 and watchOS 11, according to MacRumors. It's also likely the company will reveal the next operating system for the recently-released Apple Vision Pro headset, visionOS 2.\n\nIt's even possible we'll get some new hardware announcements. Though typically software-adjacent, last year's WWDC was chock full of product announcements, from the aforementioned Vision Pro to the 15-inch M2 MacBook Air. The Mac Mini has been missing from recent product refreshes, so maybe the company will announce an M3-based update.\n\nAs for the new software, there have been plenty of rumors regarding iOS 18. It has been reported that Apple might integrate Google's Gemini AI with Siri and various iPhone apps. Check the suspicious capitalization of \"Absolutely Incredible\" in the above post from Apple's VP of worldwide marketing Brad Joswiak for a winking acknowledgement of the move. It's also been suggested that the smartphone software will allow users to place apps anywhere on the home screen grid and will offer RCS support in the Messages app, along with the usual array of design changes.\n\nThe keynote event will be available on the Apple Developer app, the Apple website and YouTube. The company is also inviting 50 winners of its annual Swift Student Challenge to attend WWDC in person.\n\nUpdate, May 28, 1:15PM: This story was updated after its original March 26 publishing to include the time of Apple's WWDC 2024 keynote.", "source": {"uri": "engadget.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "engadget"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Worldwide Developers Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupertino,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cupertino, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_M2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple M2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPadOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TvOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TvOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WatchOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WatchOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality_headset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality headset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacBook_Air", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacBook Air"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacRumors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MacRumors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Mini", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mac Mini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swift (programming language)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Developer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Developer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Siri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Handhelds", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Companies", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/13563ec0-1d16-11ef-b75e-da7f89aa568b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603616", "eventUri": "eng-9603616", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 87, "textEnd": 94}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 221, "textEnd": 228}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 1872, "textEnd": 1878}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-26", "textStart": 1930, "textEnd": 1938}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

As an editor at large at CNET, he wrote about Apple, Microsoft, VR, video games and internet troubles. Aside from writing, he tinkers with tech at home, is a longtime fencer -- the kind with swords -- and began woodworking during the pandemic.\n\nApple has sent out invitations for its Worldwide Developers Conference, and will likely announce its plans around artificial intelligence technology at the event on June 10. One report suggests Apple is playing catchup more than breaking new ground this year. While the new software features will likely include adding AI to emoji, photo editing, messages and emails, the Cupertino company probably won't attempt to announce anything truly revolutionary.\n\nApple's AI plans will reportedly touch many parts of its software, including transcription for voice memos, faster search and a more conversational approach to the Siri voice assistant, according to a report in Bloomberg on Sunday. Many of these improvements, under the internal name of Project Greymatter, will reportedly rely on Apple's version of a mini AI that works on device, independent of an internet connection.\n\nThe new AI capabilities will be arriving in the upcoming iOS 18 and MacOS 15, and the Apple Watch also will reflect the Siri upgrades, Bloomberg reported.\n\nThe report noted that, among other things, Apple's AI will \"create custom emojis on the fly, based on what users are texting.\"\n\nApple representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe new reports about Apple's AI plans add details to what's likely to be a year of the company racing to make up ground on the competition. In the year and a half since the startup OpenAI launched its ChatGPT service, hundreds of millions of people have flocked to it and similar technologies. Though AI hallucinations have made the technology unpredictably untrustworthy, many people have found it helpful for everything from helping to write emails at work to coding and even imagining recipes based on ingredients nearby.\n\nThe resulting boom has led to billions of dollars of aggregated investment in startups and new AI technologies, including at Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook parent company Meta and Google parent Alphabet. (For hands-on CNET reviews of generative AI products including Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, along with AI news, tips and explainers, see our AI Atlas resource page.)\n\nApple so far has been tight-lipped about its AI plans, but previous rumors have suggested the company intends to lean on its history of prioritizing privacy and security. Bloomberg said in its report that one way Apple will use these features to its benefit is by offering users a \"smart recap\" summary of what they've missed in notifications and text messages, as well as easily digestible breakdowns of webpages, news stories and documents.", "source": {"uri": "cnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNET"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

However, users will no longer need to fit one of these emojis into whatever they are trying to convey; they can just create their own custom emoji tailored specifically to what they want.\n\nAI-created emojis aren't an original concept.

Then consider Siri learning your schedule, preferences, even your personality, so it can better communicate with you throughout the day.\n\nGenerative AI, artificial intelligence that can provide thoughtful and thorough responses to questions and prompts, could potentially breathe new life into Apple's iPhone lineup at a time when competitors are threatening to leave the company behind in the race to shape what could be a world-changing technology.\n\nThe company is widely expected to partner with ChatGPT maker OpenAI ahead of its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June, where it will likely show off its first batch of AI tools coming to the iOS software... All this during a time when the company is under pressure to catch up to rivals such as Google and Samsung, which are already using the technology in its smartphones.\n\n\"We see generative AI as a key opportunity across our products and believe we have advantages that set us apart there,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said on the company's most recent earnings call in early May, noting there would be news announced in the \"weeks ahead.\"\n\nIntegration with OpenAI's latest ChatGPT-4o model could catapult Siri years forward, essentially turning the feature into an iPhone chatbot. This would enable Siri to perform specific tasks such as recalling a picture taken years ago on the device or answering detailed questions about the weather, the news or trivia.

Probably not. You probably wouldn't be surprised if the Macalope said it was all AI-generated.\n\nFirst, there was Sam Altman awkwardly trying to coax Scarlett Johansson into being the voice of ChatGPT. Johansson's response was very much \"Who are you again?\" Still, things are going very well in the AI world as Gemini is telling users to eat glue and rocks and Humane is for sale. It's a real mystery why Apple is so late to this awesome party but there are plenty of rumors about what new AI features iOS 18 will have.\n\nAnyway, we're not going to talk about that stuff. Frankly, the Macalope is a little tired of talking about AI. It's like we've spent months talking about someone's wack-a-doodle uncle who went off the deep end into conspiracy theories during the pandemic.\n\n\"You can prevent COVID by taking a tablespoon of battery acid every day! I did my own research! Have some of my glue pizza!\"\n\nYeah, let's talk about iPhone rumors instead.\n\nApple made a big splash with the M4 iPad Pros by making them almost unbelievably thin. Sure, some groused \"Who wants the iPad to be thinner?!\" Well, everyone who wanted it to be lighter, that's who. Now, if the rumors are true, it's set to do the same thing for the iPhone 17, making it thinner and probably lighter by ditching the back glass in favor of aluminum.\n\nAs the world's foremost advocate of smaller iPhones over the last 10 years (doing a bang-up job, thanks very much for asking), the Macalope is at least intrigued by these changes. Maybe the Macalope is just talking himself into this as, despite his letter-writing campaigns, multiple sit-ins, and subliminal propaganda schemes directed at Apple executives, it doesn't look like he's going to get another iPhone mini. What's a mythical beast to do?\n\nThe advantages for those of us who prefer a smaller phone are more related to surface area than thickness or weight. Apple implementing Reachability in iOS was far less a panacea than it was evidence that we were right all along about the problem with larger phones.\n\nStill, there may be a path forward through software. To forge a usable substitute for what you call a small phone and we call a reasonably-sized phone using one of those ridiculous monstrosities you use, we'd need to think about cobbling together a specific set of interactions, using iOS features that already exist and some that are rumored to be coming in iOS 18.\n\niOS widgets currently give you the ability to put larger icons on your home screen that have the added benefit of providing information. iOS 18 is rumored to be bringing even more customization options, including more flexible icon placement and the ability to have blank spaces. If that spot in the upper corner of the screen is just too hard to reach without risking dropping your phone in hot lava (the Macalope is assuming you're a vulcanologist here), put a widget there or, once iOS 18 arrives, leave it blank. You can even just configure your screen with widgets down the far side (whichever side that is for you) and icons you want to interact with down the near side.\n\nThat still leaves Control Center, Apple's annoyingly out-of-reach incredibly useful tool access utility.\n\nApple engineer #1: \"Hmm, where should we put this thing people are going to want to use all the time?\"\n\nApple engineer #2: What's the hardest spot on the phone for most people to reach?\"\n\nApple engineer #1: \"Who hurt you, Jeff?\"\n\nEven on his iPhone 13 mini, which has a relatively easy-to-reach upper right corner, the Macalope has taken to using a triple back tap to trigger Control Center. The Action button also makes it easier to trigger the functions you most often use, but it Control Center could still benefit from easier access.\n\nNow the Macalope has to inform you that he lied a bit at the beginning. We are going to talk about AI, but just a little. Those aforementioned iOS 18 AI features include several enhancements that could make interacting with your phone easier and faster. The Macalope's not holding his breath, but if Siri can make a large phone easier to use, that helps.\n\nStill, none of this addresses what the Macalope calls \"pants feel\" (no, don't close the tab, we're keeping it SFW). Big phones are simply bigger. The amazing thing about AirPods is how they took advantage of that little jeans pocket no one uses anymore. Apple shipped a product a lot of people already had a place to put. Large phones, on the other hand, have forced a proliferation of tactical phone pants, those pants that have a special phone pocket on the thigh, because if your pants aren't saying \"I have a large phone!\" it's such a missed opportunity.\n\nMight as well have been bandoliers.\n\nAt the end of the day, does the Macalope want a thinner iPhone? Yes, please. And he can probably find a way to make it work.\n\nOf course, a thinner and smaller phone would be the real sweet spot. Just saying.", "source": {"uri": "macworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Macworld"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhesive", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adhesive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Icon (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Project Gemini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_widget", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software widget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfuric_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sulfuric acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pizza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scarlett Johansson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_screen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home screen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_13", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone 13"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPods", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AirPods"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Telephony", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Phreaking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Phreaking", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603616", "eventUri": "eng-9603616", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple and OpenAI recently signed a deal to bring AI technology and advances to iPhones via the long-awaited iOS 18 update.\n\nThe official announcement will likely be part of Apple's annual developer conference, WWDC 2024, slated for June 10, 2024. As Siri seemingly becomes dated, Apple is looking to integrate not one but two AI assistants into its sophisticated software.\n\nDespite closing the AI-supercharged deal with OpenAI, Apple is reportedly In deliberations with Google, which could potentially see Gemini make its way to the iPhone as an alternative for ChatGPT.\n\nHowever, Gurman says we might not get the intricate details around this agreement next month. This potentially indicates that both parties might be working through major agreement details, including licensing and more.\n\nLeading up to this revelation, a former OpenAI staffer referred to Sam Altman as \"a genius master-class strategist\" while referring to OpenAI's deal with Apple and iPhone outside of its Microsoft partnership.\n\nDuring OpenAI's Spring Update event, the hot startup debuted the 'magical' GPT-4o model with reasoning capabilities across audio, vision, and text in real-time and an exclusive ChatGPT app for Mac users. Some viewed the move as a Windows snub, despite Microsoft's multi-billion investment and adoption of OpenAI's technology.\n\nOpenAI explained that the exclusive launch prioritized where most of its users are, Mac. This explanation aligns with a recent report by Appfigures which indicated that the new GPT-4o model contributed to the biggest spike ever in ChatGPT's revenue and downloads on mobile (with a huge percentage attributed to iOS users).\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella has openly admitted Google doesn't play fair with Bing in search. He indicated Google's with Apple places Bing at a competitive disadvantage, further stating that he was willing to part with up to $15 billion annually to attract a similar deal that would make Bing the default search engine on iPhones.\n\nInterestingly, Mozilla published a new report detailing the deceitful tactics and harmful designs Microsoft leverages to give Edge browser a competitive advantage in Windows. Elsewhere, Microsoft almost sold its search engine to Apple in 2018, though the deal fell through due to search quality-related issues.\n\nLast year, the European Commission listed Google as a gatekeeper prompting the company to put elaborate measures in compliance with the Digital Markets Act (DMA), including the capability to switch the default browser and search engine on Android phones and more.\n\nDuring Microsoft's earnings call, Microsoft CEO announced that Bing had surpassed 140 million daily active users, and attributed a huge percentage of the success to its AI advances. Google on the other hand has been placed under fire after its AI search feature generated wrong and misleading responses to queries, including recommending eating rocks, glue, and more.\n\nIn the interim, Microsoft recently announced it's slowing down Copilot-themed advances in Windows 11.

Caiqing, which literally means \"picking the green,\" is an important ceremony to \"awaken\" the dragon boats for the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival. At the scene, with gongs, drums, and firecrackers, eight sleeping dragons are \"awakened\". On the Nanyue Dragon Boat of the Shipai Village, the helmsman Chi Shuhao, dressed in a red shirt, stood in the bow, holding the oars, rhythmically blowing the whistle, and directing the \"dragon\" forward.\n\nChi Shuhao is 43 years old this year. He has shown great interest in the dragon boat race since his childhood. \"When I was very young, I watched the adults rowing the dragon boat, and I was especially interested in it. I remember once after school, I sneaked onto a dragon boat and felt very happy for just sitting on it.\"\n\nIn those days, there were no safety facilities like life jackets on the dragon boats, Chi Shuhao said. It was actually very dangerous for small kids to go on the dragon boat. Therefore, when his father learned that he had sneaked onto the boat, he came to look for him in a rage. Chi's father suddenly took out a cane from behind his back to give him a lesson, and he couldn't run away because he was on the dragon boat. \"Now I'm in my 40s. My mom and dad still often tease me about this in front of my children,\" Chi said with a laugh.\n\nEvery year, it is during the ceremonies of Caiqing and Songlong (sending off the dragon) that the children are allowed to board the dragon boat \"openly.\" Chi said, that in the world of the children, rowing a dragon boat is not just for fun, it also brings them a sense of pride. Since there are many dragon boats in Shipai Village, every year when the eight dragon boats all come out to visit other villages at the same time, everyone will praise them, calling them the \"Shipai Fleet.\"\n\nTo Chi Shuhao, the dragon boats represent the story of inheritance. Every time the villagers row the dragon boat to visit their relatives and friends, the older generation will talk about the history and stories of dragon boats in Shipai Village. Chi's father has been a helmsman for more than 40 years, and now that he has reached the age of 70 and \"retired\" with honor. The \"baton\" is now passed on to the son.\n\nFollowing his father for more than ten years, Chi knows that the helmsman is one of the most important roles on the dragon boat. \"You need to make the boat go straight as far as possible, and you can't get off the rudder too often because the resistance will be too much for the boat. Besides, the helmsman needs to feel the wind, and the water flow, and make timely adjustments and adaptations, so that the dragon boat can be more labor-saving. Therefore, the helmsman must have a wealth of experience.\"\n\nChi's son is also a huge fan of the dragon boat race. Whenever he has spare time, Chi teaches his son and nephew how to row the dragon boat. \"The spirit of the dragon boat is about unity, courage, and striving to be the first, and I hope they can learn the spirit little by little.\"\n\nThe spirit of the dragon boat is passed down not only among the villagers but also all people interested in traditional culture.\n\nChi Shuhao is a director of the Guangzhou Dragon Boat Traditional Culture Promotion Association. As a training base for dragon boat sports in Guangzhou, the association undertakes several functions, such as the popularization of dragon-boat tradition, training, and race organization. Its oriented groups include both children and new Guangzhouers. \"To popularize and inherit the dragon-boat tradition, we need to go out the villages, and we hope more people can experience the dragon boat culture firsthand.\"\n\nTo Chi Shuhao, the dragon boat race is a movement in his blood. He spends almost all his time on this love. \"In 12 months of the year, I row the dragon boats for nine months,\" he said. \"Nowadays, many villagers settle outside the village, so it is hard for us to get together. But every year, when the Dragon Boat Festival comes, they will come back and gather together in the ancestral hall and on the dragon boat. That's great.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsgd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guangdong  News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipai,_Dongguan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shipai, Dongguan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shipai, Dongguan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmsman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helmsman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_boat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dragon boat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Boat_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dragon Boat Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowing_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rowing (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanyue", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nanyue"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_and_arrow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bow and arrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firecracker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firecracker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whistle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gong", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_flotation_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal flotation device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianhe_District", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tianhe District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tianhe District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guangzhou"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guangzhou"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rudder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Watercraft", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Dragon_Boating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Dragon Boating", "wgt": 65}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Wooden_Boats", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Wooden Boats", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 48}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630764", "eventUri": "eng-9630764", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Thirty-seven dragon boat teams from the GBA gathered at Maozhou River, engaging in spectacular dragon boat races.\n\nIn preparation for the dragon boat race, Panyu District of Guangzhou established a special inclusive dragon boat team. The team consists of 10 able-bodied individuals who are passionate about dragon boat sports and committed to supporting the cause of disabled people, along with 6 disabled individuals who have a strong enthusiasm for participating in sports. The disabled athletes hail from the Shilou Town Kangyuan Worker Therapy Demonstration Station in Panyu District. A professional coaching team developed a scientific training plan for them.\n\nOn the race day, several special dragon boat teams from the Greater Bay Area, accompanied by the pounding drums and cheers of the audience, swiftly paddled through the waters. After intense competition, the team from Panyu District of Guangzhou emerged victorious, winning first place in the care group.\n\nThis hard-earned championship marks a significant achievement. Zhao Wei, the leader of the team, mentioned that some team members have mental disabilities, which posed communication challenges during training. \"Participating in the competition and winning the championship greatly benefit their personal growth as athletes, and also encourage more people with intellectual disabilities to step out and engage in sports.\"\n\nAt the Shilou Town Kangyuan Worker Therapy Demonstration Station in Panyu District, He Qirong, a disabled member of the team, had just finished a day of handicraft work. This was He Qirong's first time participating in the dragon boat race. Initially, he didn't even know how to hold a paddle. Three days into the training, he considered quitting due to the strenuous effort. However, with the encouragement of his teammates and the patient guidance of the coaches, he persevered and eventually developed a fondness for the sport.\n\nThis was also the first time that Chen Haozhong, president of the Shilou Town Dragon Boat Association, served as a coach for disabled dragon boat athletes. Having dedicated nearly 20 years to dragon boating and engaged in numerous professional dragon boat events both in and out of China, he still faced challenges in coaching athletes with varying levels of ability. For the disabled athletes, basic dragon boat movements - starting, paddling, stroking, recovering, and resetting - and coordinating with teammates were not easy. It took them more than ten days to master these basics and get into the rhythm of training.\n\nMore important than teaching the dragon boat movements was ensuring the safety of the disabled athletes during training and competition. \"We adopted a method where two able-bodied athletes paired with one disabled athlete, and tailored training plans for them. To build physical strength, each person did 20 push-ups daily.

Unlike other central districts, Yuexiu has fewer villages that host dragon boat activities, making Yangji Village's event particularly special. The unearthing of the dragon boat conducted by landlords in Yangji brought excitement to the dragon boat community.\n\nThe ceremony began at 1:00p.m. with members of the Yangji Village dragon boat team gathering at the village's ancestral temple for the initiation. According to the legend, the dragon boats, having \"slept\" for a year, are somewhat \"sluggish.\" Thus, people need to perform the caiqing and trial rowing rituals to awaken the dragon boats and prepare them for the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival.\n\nFollowing the initiation, participants paraded with dragon boat heads, tails, gongs, umbrellas, and religious items toward the Yangji River. Very soon, thousands of cheerful spectators lined up along the river bank. Among the various items brought aboard, pots with green rice seedlings stood out, symbolizing wishes for favorable weather and bountiful harvests in the coming year.\n\nOne of the standout participants was Qin Jinzao, a sprightly 72-year-old who moved with remarkable agility. \"Dragon boating keeps me young,\" he remarked with a smile, admitting to being a dragon boat enthusiast since the village resumed the tradition in 1981. \"I participate every year,\" he added.\n\nQin explained that this year, the village will send out four dragon boats to visit various locales. On the first and third days of the fifth lunar month, the boats will tour the villages of \"Hebei\" (north of the Pearl River), while on the second and fourth days, they will visit villages of \"Henan\" (south of the Pearl River). On the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, Yangji's dragon boats will perform a grand parade along the Yangji River.\n\nWhat gratifies him is that more and more villagers are embracing and participating in dragon boat races, thus preserving this tradition. \"Initially, there were only two boats. Later, it increased to four, and now we have six!\"\n\nCompared to Qin, 38-year-old Li Baolin is more robust. He has extensive experience in dragon boating. He started training on the boat with adults at the age of nine because there was no age limit back then. He is now a key rower and the captain of one of the boats. In his view, safety and camaraderie are paramount. \"As the captain, I must ensure that everyone comes with joy and returns home safely,\" he said.\n\nYangji River, part of the Shahe River, was once believed to be 50 meters wide. However, years of silting, low water levels, and urban changes have left Yangji River narrower and with consistently low water levels compared to other central district waterways. Maintaining the dragon boating tradition despite these unfavorable conditions is a source of pride for the people of Yangji.\n\nIt Is understood that in Yuexiu District, the villages with dragon boat racing customs are Yangji Village in Meihua Village Subdistrict and Siyou Village in Dongshan Subdistrict. Amidst high-rise buildings, the traditional sound of dragon boat drums brings a sense of familiarity to nearby residents. For them, the \"landlord sports event\" is the best opportunity to experience tradition up close.\n\n\u8d8a\u79c0\"\u623f\u4e1c\"\u7533\u8bf7\u51fa\u6218\uff01\u5e7f\u5dde\u6768\u7b95\u6751\u9f99\u821f\u91c7\u9752\"\u63a8\u6c34\"\n\n6\u67085\u65e5\uff0c\u5e7f\u5dde\u5e02\u8d8a\u79c0\u533a\u6768\u7b95\u6751\u4e3e\u884c\u4e86\u9686\u91cd\u7684\u9f99\u821f\u91c7\u9752\u63a8\u6c34\u4eea\u5f0f\u3002\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u4e2d\u5fc3\u533a\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8d8a\u79c0\u533a\u6252\u9f99\u821f\u7684\u6751\u5b50\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u6768\u7b95\"\u623f\u4e1c\"\u8d77\u9f99\uff0c\u8ba9\u9f99\u821f\"\u670b\u53cb\u5708\"\u90fd\u6b22\u547c\u96c0\u8dc3\u3002\n\n\u5f53\u5929\u4e0b\u53481\u65f6\uff0c\u6768\u7b95\u6751\u9f99\u821f\u961f\u7684\u6210\u5458\u4eec\u5728\u6751\u5b50\u7960\u5802\u7fa4\u7389\u865a\u5bab\u4e3e\u529e\u4e86\u542f\u52a8\u4eea\u5f0f\u3002\u76f8\u4f20\u9f99\u821f\u8d77\u6c34\u65f6\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e00\u5e74\u6c89\u7761\uff0c\u96be\u514d\u6709\u70b9\u5934\u660f\u8111\u6da8\uff0c\u91c7\u9752\u63a8\u6c34\u540e\uff0c\u6c89\u7761\u4e00\u5e74\u7684\"\u9f99\"\u624d\u4f1a\u795e\u6e05\u6c14\u723d\uff0c\u5728\u7aef\u5348\u8282\u5927\u5c55\u8eab\u624b\u3002\n\n\u542f\u52a8\u4eea\u5f0f\u540e\uff0c\u4eba\u4eec\u62ac\u7740\u9f99\u5934\u3001\u9f99\u5c3e\u3001\u9523\u67b6\u3001\u7f57\u4f1e\u3001\u795e\u6597\u7b49\u6d69\u6d69\u8361\u8361\u5730\u8d70\u5411\u6768\u7b95\u6d8c\u3002\u6d8c\u8fb9\u77ac\u95f4\u4eba\u58f0\u9f0e\u6cb8\uff0c\u5341\u5206\u70ed\u95f9\u3002\u5728\u4e0a\u8239\u7684\u4f17\u591a\u7269\u54c1\u4e2d\uff0c\u51e0\u4e2a\u683d\u79cd\u7740\u9752\u79be\u82d7\u7684\u82b1\u76d8\u683c\u5916\u5f15\u4eba\u77a9\u76ee\u3002\u6751\u6c11\u4eec\u5c06\u79be\u82d7\u9646\u7eed\u5e26\u4e0a\u8239\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u65b0\u7684\u4e00\u5e74\u98ce\u8c03\u96e8\u987a\uff0c\u4e94\u8c37\u4e30\u767b\u3002\n\n\u5728\u4e00\u4f17\u6861\u624b\u4e2d\uff0c72\u5c81\u7684\u79e6\u9526\u948a\u663e\u5f97\u683c\u5916\u7a81\u51fa\u3002\u4ed6\u6b65\u5c65\u8f7b\u5feb\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u770b\u4e0d\u51fa\u5e74\u9f84\u3002\"\u6252\u9f99\u821f\u8ba9\u6211\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5e74\u8f7b\u3002\"\u4ed6\u7b11\u7740\u8bf4\uff0c\u81ea\u5df1\u6709\"\u9f99\u821f\u763e\"\uff0c\u81ea\u4ece1981\u5e74\u6751\u5b50\u91cd\u65b0\u5f00\u59cb\u6252\u9f99\u821f\u540e\uff0c\"\u6211\u5e74\u5e74\u90fd\u53c2\u52a0\u3002\"\n\n\u4ed6\u4ecb\u7ecd\uff0c\u4eca\u5e74\u6751\u5b50\u5c06\u6709\u56db\u6761\u9f99\u821f\u53bb\u5404\u6751\"\u8d81\u666f\"\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c\u519c\u5386\u4e94\u6708\u521d\u4e00\u3001\u521d\u4e09\uff0c\u6768\u7b95\u9f99\u821f\u5c06\u5728\"\u6cb3\u5317\"\uff08\u73e0\u6c5f\u4ee5\u5317\uff09\u8d70\u8bbf\uff0c\u521d\u4e8c\u521d\u56db\u5219\u5230\"\u6cb3\u5357\"\uff08\u73e0\u6c5f\u4ee5\u5357\uff09\"\u8d81\u666f\"\u3002\u4e94\u6708\u521d\u4e94\uff0c\u6768\u7b95\u9f99\u821f\u5c06\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u6768\u7b95\u6d8c\u8fdb\u884c\u5de1\u6e38\u8868\u6f14\u3002\n\n\u8ba9\u4ed6\u6b23\u6170\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u6751\u5b50\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u4eba\u70ed\u7231\u5e76\u53c2\u4e0e\u5230\u9f99\u821f\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u6765\uff0c\u4f20\u627f\u8fd9\u9879\u4f20\u7edf\uff0c\"\u539f\u6765\u662f\u4e24\u6761\u8239\uff0c\u540e\u6765\u589e\u52a0\u5230\u56db\u6761\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u6709\u516d\u6761\u4e86\uff01\"\n\n\u4e0e\u948a\u54e5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c38\u5c81\u7684\u674e\u4fdd\u6797\u66f4\u663e\u5065\u7855\u3002\u4ed6\u7684\u9f99\u821f\u7ecf\u9a8c\u975e\u5e38\u4e30\u5bcc\u3002\u4ed6\u8bf4\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4ee5\u524d\u6ca1\u6709\u767b\u8239\u5e74\u9f84\u9650\u5236\uff0c9\u5c81\u5c31\u5f00\u59cb\u8ddf\u5927\u4eba\u4e0a\u821f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u4ed6\u662f\u4e3b\u529b\u6861\u624b\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u4e00\u8258\u8239\u7684\"\u8239\u957f\"\u3002\u5728\u4ed6\u770b\u6765\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u7b2c\u4e00\uff0c\u53cb\u8c0a\u7b2c\u4e00\uff0c\"\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8239\u957f\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u8d23\u4efb\u5c31\u662f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5927\u5bb6\u5f00\u5f00\u5fc3\u5fc3\u5730\u6765\uff0c\u5e73\u5e73\u5b89\u5b89\u56de\u5bb6\u3002\"\n\n\u6768\u7b95\u6d8c\u662f\u6c99\u6cb3\u6d8c\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u76f8\u4f20\u5bbd\u5ea6\u66fe\u7ecf\u670950\u7c73\u3002\u4f46\u957f\u5e74\u7684\u6de4\u585e\u3001\u67af\u6c34\u4ee5\u53ca\u57ce\u5e02\u53d8\u8fc1\uff0c\u5982\u4eca\u6768\u7b95\u6d8c\u76f8\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\u5fc3\u533a\u5176\u4ed6\u6cb3\u9053\uff0c\u663e\u5f97\u975e\u5e38\u72ed\u7a84\uff0c\u4e14\u5e38\u5e74\u6c34\u4f4d\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u9f99\u821f\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\uff0c\u662f\u6768\u7b95\u4eba\u7684\u9a84\u50b2\u3002\n\n\u636e\u4e86\u89e3\uff0c\u8d8a\u79c0\u533a\u76ee\u524d\u6709\u6252\u9f99\u821f\u4e60\u4fd7\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u6885\u82b1\u6751\u8857\u7684\u6768\u7b95\u6751\u548c\u4e1c\u5c71\u8857\u7684\u5bfa\u53f3\u6751\u3002\u56db\u5468\u662f\u6797\u7acb\u7684\u9ad8\u697c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9f99\u8239\u9f13\u58f0\u58f0\u54cd\u8d77\uff0c\u8ba9\u9644\u8fd1\u5c45\u6c11\u90fd\u611f\u5230\u975e\u5e38\u4eb2\u5207\u3002\u5bf9\u4ed6\u4eec\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\"\u623f\u4e1c\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f1a\"\u4e5f\u662f\u4ed6\u4eec\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u611f\u53d7\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u673a\u4f1a\u3002",

festival", "body": "NAIROBI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese community in Kenya on Thursday celebrated the upcoming dragon boat festival at the Confucius Institute based at the University of Nairobi, Kenya's oldest university, to help grow Sino-Kenyan ties.\n\nThe event is commemorated on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month according to the Chinese lunar calendar, which falls on June 10 this year, and features the preparation and eating of Zongzi, which is a form of rice dumpling wrapped in plant leaves, as well as watching of dragon boat racing.\n\nZhang Zhizhong, minister counselor and deputy chief of Mission of the Chinese Embassy in Kenya, said that the festival is one of the major traditional festivals from the Asian nation that can help strengthen the bonds between Kenya and China.\n\n\"The dragon boat festival can be used to symbolize the strengthening of the bond between Kenya and China,\" Zhang said.\n\nQin Minxue, a representative of the Chinese community in Kenya, said that the celebration of the dragon boat festival helps overseas Chinese to remain in touch with their culture. \"It is also a time of significance because it provides space for friends and families to gather together and share a meal,\" Qin added.\n\nIris Yu, another representative of the Chinese community in Kenya, said the event provides an opportunity to promote cross-cultural cooperation between Kenya and China, adding that the festival is of cultural significance because it is believed that eating Zongzi helps to bring good luck and ward off evil spirits.\n\nWang Shangxue, director of the Confucius Institute at the University of Nairobi, said that there is a rising popularity of the dragon boat festival in Kenya due to the expanding Sino-Kenyan ties.",

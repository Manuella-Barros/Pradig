Fox, a four-time Olympian who served as one of her country's flag bearers in the opening ceremonies, now has six career medals to her name (three gold, one silver, and two bronze), making her the most accomplished Olympic slalom canoeist of all-time and the only one of her countrymen who's taken home a half-dozen Olympic medals.\n\nIn a career-defining race last Wednesday at Paris' Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium, Fox posted a sparkling time of 1 minute, 1.06 seconds to edge the German silver medalist Elena Lilik by 2.48 seconds. No stranger to attaining glory in the women's canoe single competition, Fox won gold in the event at the last go-round of the Summer Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nGet The AJT Newsletter by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\n\"I don't know how I did that,\" Fox told reporters after her first-place finish last Wednesday. \"The atmosphere was incredible. I looked out, and I saw so much green and yellow, so many Aussie flags, and I think that was the best run I've ever done. I knew once I had got through the hard moves, it was about trying to get to the finish and holding it together and wow!\"\n\nSecond to last to go, Fox zipped down the course with pinpoint precision, brushing off a two-second touch penalty and deftly navigating the upstream and downstream currents to make history.\n\n\"This has been a dream Games,\" Fox exclaimed following the emotionally charged race. \"As an athlete, you put in the blood, sweat and tears, and the team invests in you. For it to come down to one day every four years, and then to actually pull it off, is the best feeling in the world.\n\n\"It does not always go your way, and I have experienced that as well. For it to turn out this way, it has been the perfect Games, and it's so magical to be here in Paris.\"\n\nHer magical Olympic run began on July 28 with a gutsy performance in the women's kayak slalom in which she shook off a subpar semifinal performance to blow past the field in the final round.\n\n\"It means everything to me right now,\" an elated Fox declared after her first gold medal. \"I think it's been years and years of chasing this dream of getting really close and persevering and picking myself back up.\"\n\nA first-place finish in the women's kayak slalom event had eluded Fox for years. As a teen in the London Games in 2012, she notched a silver medal before securing third place finishes in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2016 and during the pandemic-postponed Tokyo Olympics in 2021.\n\nBut there's more to the story than Fox's career-long chase of gold in the whitewater event. Her Jewish mother and coach, Myriam Fox-Jerusalmi, a world-class paddler in her own right, competed in the kayak slalom for France during the 1996 Summer Games in Atlanta. She returned home with a bronze medal that summer, four years after not placing in the 1992 Barcelona Games. Even though the younger Fox's latest triumph added to Australia's mantle, it was also a nod to her French background.\n\n\"It's very special with this French connection,\" noted Fox, whose sister Noemie is also an Olympic paddler and actually bested Jessica in Sunday's kayak cross event. \"I've been chasing this for a few years. And my mom before me was chasing this gold medal in '92 and '96. So, to achieve it in Paris is just very special for our family.\"\n\nLooking ahead to the 2028 Games in Los Angeles when the Summer Olympics return stateside for the first time since '96 in Atlanta, Fox may have an opportunity to build on her Olympic resume - and carve out her mark on the Mount Rushmore of Jewish Olympic legends. With six medals, Fox has already matched gymnast Aly Raisman and is within striking distance of swimmer Dara Torres, who won a total of 12 medals and retired after the 2000 Olympics, and swimmer Mark Spitz, who received 11 Olympic medals throughout the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nBut for now, Fox, the first woman to medal in the kayak event in four consecutive Olympics, can soak up the exhilaration of dominating yet again on the grandest of stages.\n\nAs Fox-Jerusalmi remarked when speaking to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation last week, \"in the sport of canoe slalom, she won't be beaten by anybody any time soon.\"", "source": {"uri": "atlantajewishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Atlanta Jewish Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jillian_gerson@atlantajewishtimes.com", "name":

The medal total of 16 is more than all but 11 countries.\n\nIsrael in particular has racked up a historic medal collection, with six total medals, its most ever in a single Olympics. Israel won three medals on Saturday alone, its most medals in one day. The country now has 19 total Olympic medals, including nine in judo and five in sailing.\n\nAustralian paddler Jessica Fox has added to her legacy, and is considered the greatest canoeist of all time, winning two gold medals in Paris in canoe and kayak races. Her younger sister Noemie also won a gold medal, her first, in the brand-new kayak cross event.\n\nRead on for more about all the Jewish and Israeli medalists, alphabetized and in order of medal type.\n\nThe U.S. women's foil team won gold, giving Jackie Dubrovich and Maia Weintraub their first-ever medals. Dubrovich had narrowly missed a medal in Tokyo, while Weintraub is making her Olympic debut. Weintraub, who deferred her final year at Princeton University to train for the Olympics, was the alternate but subbed in for Dubrovich briefly so that she would be eligible to share in the team medal. Lee Kiefer and Lauren Scruggs, who each won medals in the individual foil competition, rounded out the U.S. team. Out of the 20 total members of the U.S. fencing team, six are Jewish or come from Jewish families.\n\nAmit Elor\n\nU.S. wrestler Amit Elor entered the Paris Olympics, her first Games, on a winning streak dating back to 2019. That undefeated stretch continued this week as she captured the gold medal in the women's 68-kilogram weight class. Elor is 20, making her the all-time youngest U.S. gold medalist in wrestling. The daughter of Israeli immigrants, Elor experienced both online antisemitism and the sudden deaths of both her father and a brother during the years when she broke into the elite ranks of U.S. women's wrestlers.\n\nJessica Fox (two gold medals)\n\nAustralian canoe paddler Jessica Fox entered these Olympis already regarded by many as the best ever in her sport. Fox, 30, added two more gold medals to her collection in Paris, one in the women's kayak slalom and one in the canoe slalom. She now has six career medals: three gold, one silver and two bronze. She is the most decorated Olympic canoe slalom competitor ever, and the only Australian Olympian in history with six individual medals. She had served as one of Australia's flag bearers in the Paris opening ceremony.\n\nNoemie Fox\n\nNoemie Fox, Jessica Fox's younger sister, won her first-ever Olympic medal, a gold in the inaugural kayak cross event. Fox, 27, and her sister join a rare class of Jewish siblings to win medals at the same Olympics. They are likely the first Jewish siblings to each win gold at the same Games since sisters Tamara and Irina Press did so in 1960 and 1964 in track and field events for the Soviet Union.\n\nTom Reuveny\n\nWindsurfer Tom Reuveny won Israel's first, and so far only, gold medal of the Paris Olympics in the men's iQFoil windsurfing final. Reuveny's gold -- Israel's fourth ever -- comes 20 years after his coach, Gal Fridman, won Israel's first-ever gold medal at the 2004 Athens Games in the men's sailboard competition. Reuveny, whose brother is serving in combat in the Israel-Hamas war, said his win brought some much needed celebration during a difficult year. \"It's been so hard and I still had to put my head down and keep training and it's all for this moment,\" he said.\n\nUkrainian-born Israeli gymnast Artem Dolgopyat entered the Paris Olympics as a medal favorite in the floor exercise, the event in which he captured gold in Tokyo. After a difficult showing in the qualifying round, Dolgopyat rebounded to win the silver medal, becoming the first Israeli athlete to medal at consecutive Olympics.\n\nRaz Hershko\n\nIsraeli judoka Raz Hershko claimed the silver medal in the women's over-78-kilogram competition, her second career Olympic medal. She had won bronze with Israel's mixed judo team in Tokyo. Hershko, 26, is the No. 2 ranked judoka in her category in the world, according to the International Judo Federation.\n\nSharon Kantor\n\nOn the same day that Reuveny won gold and Dolgopyat won silver, Sharon Kantor won silver in the women's iQFoil windsurfing competition, her first-ever medal. Kantor, 21, is the first Israeli woman to win a sailing medal.\n\nInbar Lanir\n\nInbar Lanir also won a silver medal in judo for Israel, in the 78-kilogram weight class. The win earned Lanir her first individual medal; she had won bronze in Tokyo with Israel's mixed team. Lanir, 24, wore a yellow scrunchie to signify advocacy for Israeli hostages in Gaza, and had gone viral at home after she babysat for her neighbor -- who did not know she was an Olympian -- in the days after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. \"Instead of training for the Olympics, she's babysitting,\" Sheizaf Tal Meshulam wrote in a Facebook post. \"So just know that behind a well-deserved medal stands a woman with a heart of gold.\"\n\nClaire Weinstein\n\nSwimmer Claire Weinstein won silver as part of the women's 4\u00d7200-meter freestyle relay, alongside U.S. Olympic legend Katie Ledecky. Weinstein, 17, is making her Olympics debut in Paris and is the youngest Jewish medalist. The New York native, who celebrated her bat mitzvah at Reform Congregation Kol Ami in White Plains, swam the first leg of the U.S. team's relay. Erin Gemmell and Paige Madden rounded out the team.\n\nFoil fencer Nick Itkin won bronze early on in the Paris Olympics, improving on his 12th-place finish in the individual competition in Tokyo. He had won bronze with the U.S. men's foil team at the Tokyo Games. Itkin, 24, whose father is a Jewish immigrant from Ukraine, is also a two-time NCAA champion and the No. 2-ranked men's foil fencer in the world. Last year he became the first American man, and third U.S. fencer overall, to win individual medals at back-to-back world championships.\n\nSarah Levy\n\nSan Diego native Sarah Levy earned a bronze medal with the U.S. women's rugby sevens team, which stunned Australia in the final to win its first-ever Olympic medal. Levy, 28, appeared in three of the team's six games as she made her Olympics debut. Levy, who had also competed in the JCC Maccabi Games as a teenager, earned the medal alongside the U.S. team's Jewish assistant coach, former Olympic athlete Zack Test.\n\nJemima Montag (two bronze medals)\n\nRace walker Jemima Montag joins fellow Aussie Jessica Fox as a two-time medalist in Paris. She won her first medal in the 20-kilometer race walk, an event in which she already owned her country's record. Montag won another bronze Wednesday in the inaugural marathon mixed relay event. Montag, 26, is the first Australian woman in 52 years to win two medals in track and field's athletics category at the same Olympics.\n\nPeter Paltchik\n\nIsraeli judoka Peter Paltchik won bronze in the 100-kilogram weight class, his first individual medal. Paltchik also won bronze, alongside Hershko and Lanir, with the Israeli mixed judo team in Tokyo. Paltchik, who had served as one of Israel's flag bearers at the Paris opening ceremony, was born in Ukraine. He won gold at the 2020 European championship.", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SunSentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_gurvis@sun-sentinel.com", "name": "Jacob

These folks have consistently gone above and beyond for years on end to get where they are now, so if they decide to indulge in a cheeky boast here or there, you'd best believe we're going to take it in a humorous spirit.\n\nJessica Fox is one such Olympian, and she's taken to TikTok to satisfy her IOC-mandated boast quota in a most charming manner. Having just woken up and combating a case of puffy eyes, Jessica indulges in the most extra GRYM session yet, using one of the two gold medals she nabbed at the 2024 Paris Olympics to de-puff her left eye. Moments later, her second gold medal enters the fray, dedicating itself to de-puffing her other eye. Jessica, of course, can only hold a straight face for so long before mirthfully giggling at her own joke (or perhaps she's still elated by her achievement; she's valid either way).\n\nA quick glance at Jessica's profile on the official 2024 Paris Olympics homepage offers a small snapshot of her Olympic journey. She represents Australia (though she was born in France), and competes in the slalom canoe events, in which athletes must navigate canoes and kayaks through several courses marked by downstream and upstream gates on intense river rapids. The two gold medals in the video above came courtesy of Fox's first-place finishes in the women's kayak single and the women's canoe single events. She also competed in the women's kayak cross event, in which four kayaks navigate the courses at the same time; she did not qualify for the final, but her sister Noemie took home the gold in that event.\n\nPreviously, Jessica struck gold for canoe singles and a bronze for kayak singles at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, another bronze for kayak singles at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, and a silver for kayak singles at the 2012 London Olympics. And those are just her Olympic medals; across her career, Jessica has nabbed 46 medals in total, 30 of which are golds. In other words, she can indulge in the world's cockiest eye de-puff all she wants.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlotte_simmons@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Charlotte Simmons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Fox_(canoeist)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Fox (canoeist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayak", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kayak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_2016_Summer_Paralympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Athletics at the 2016 Summer Paralympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/tiktok-olympian-eye.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798750", "eventUri": "eng-9798750", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

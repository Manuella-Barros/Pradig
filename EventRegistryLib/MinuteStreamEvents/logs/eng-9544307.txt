I love Motionless in White. I think Chris is adorable, but, I mean, that's it,\" said Bunnie Xo in a new TikTok video\n\nDo Bunnie Xo and Jelly Roll actually have hall passes in their marriage?\n\nAfter the country star's wife shared a TikTok video of herself referring to musician Chris \"Motionless\" Cerulli of the band Motionless in White as her \"hall pass\" last month, she took to the social media platform once again to clarify that her comments were largely a \"joke.\"\n\n\"Good morning guys. So, I am humbly coming to the internet to clear up a few things really quick, because I was having my morning coconut water, and yeah, I got sent a bunch of these,\" said Bunnie, 44, in a new video, displaying screenshots of several articles written about her initial post.\n\nRelated: Bunnie Xo Reveals Her 'Hall Pass' in Jelly Roll Marriage -- and He's Another Musician\n\n\"I had no idea that everybody on the internet was so invested on where I wanna slap my cookie, but this has gone a little too far,\" the Dumb Blonde podcast host added with a laugh.\n\n\"It's a joke, but it's not. I love Motionless in White. I think Chris is adorable, but, I mean, that's it. It's just an inside thing where my husband says he loves Taylor Swift, I say I love Chris 'Motionless,'\" added Bunnie. \"It's super innocent, and this has turned into something that is a media circus.\"\n\nThe internet personality explained she felt her words were taken more seriously than she intended. \"I do a lot of things joking around, and a lot of things I say as satire -- obviously. The caption says, 'I guess you could say we're in love now,'\" she said.\n\nRelated: Bunnie XO Worries She Might Have Gotten Husband Jelly Roll Banned from Houston Rodeo: 'Ya Girl Messed Up'\n\n\"Not all my TikToks are made for news articles, so glad we cleared that up. But Chris Motionless, call me,\" concluded Bunnie.\n\nLast month, Bunnie shared a video of herself meeting Cerulli at Sick New World music festival in Las Vegas, writing in text displayed on the clip, \"When you finally get to meet your hall pass,\" and continuing in the caption, \"You could say we're in love now.\"\n\nJelly, 39, supportively wrote in the comments section, \"Bout time,\" and Bunnie later clarified that the \"Need a Favor\" singer \"made this happen\" after some followers expressed concern with her playful feelings for another man.\n\nRelated: Jelly Roll Reflects on Ups and Downs with Bunnie Xo: 'Ain't Always Been Hallmark Cards and Care Bears' (Exclusive)\n\nLater, Bunnie posted a clip of Jelly meeting Swift and pointed out a double standard in how they were treated. \"Another point I'd like to prove- when my husband met his crush Taylor Swift everyone swooned. But his wife, an outspoken blonde meets hers & omg what a wh---! We feel so bad for Jelly blah blah blah. I didn't even hug dude lmao - I shook his hand & y'all kno [sic] how much I hate shaking hands,\" she wrote.\n\nIn April, the \"Save Me\" artist opened up to PEOPLE about how both blissful moments and difficulties throughout his relationship with Bunnie have ultimately made them a stronger couple.\n\n\"It ain't always been Hallmark cards and Care Bears, and we had to really put in a lot of work to be together, and it was worth it. It was worth every second. It was worth every disagreement. It was worth every split.

Our baby is f-king driving dude. We're going in to pick up her first car ever!\" Bunnie, 44, proudly told fans while in the driver's seat of her car, as her stepdaughter sat in the back cheering.\n\nEven though Jelly Roll - real name Jason Deford - is a country music superstar, the sky wasn't the limit when it came to a price.\n\n\"We told this kid, you can have any car you want in the world but there was a budget,\" Bunnie - real name Alisa DeFord - explained.\n\nBunnie added, \"You can have any car you want in the world that isn't above this budget. And this is what the child picked, this is what her heart desires. So let's go f-king get it baby.\"\n\nThe pair was seen walking through the dealership and filling out paperwork. \"I can't wait until you get in trouble, and I can take your car away from you for the first time,\" The \"Dumb Blonde\" podcast host joked to Bailee, who responded by singing En Vogue's lyrics \"Neva gonna get it\" several times.\n\nThe big reveal came when they walked out of the dealership where a white GMC Sierra 1500 truck with a big yellow bow on the hood was waiting for the duo. \"I'm whipping in every field,\" Bailee joked, as Bunnie pleaded, \"Please don't.\"\n\n\"Take a listen,\" the teenager said before turning on the engine for the first time and hearing it roar as she beamed with joy. \"All right Miss Thing. Love you, see you later,\" Bunnie told Bailee before letting her drive away.\n\n\"I can't believe it! Our baby's growing up, man. We're f-king old man,\" the Nashville, Tennessee, native said as she left the lot, telling viewers, \"I remember when we were teaching her how to ride a f-king bike, guys.\"\n\nBunnie captioned the TikTok video, \"BRB, going to cry\" with a weeping face emoji to show how much the moment meant to her.\n\n\"I love that she picked out a truck!\" one fan wrote in the comments, while Bunnie responded, \"She's our country girl.\" She replied to another follower who commented, \"Wasn't expecting that but I absolutely LOVE it!!!\" about Bailee's vehicle choice, adding, \"I wasn't either lol.\"\n\n\"Bless your heart Bunnie, you are such a great mommy,\" one person gushed, while another wrote, \"Bunnie, I respect you so much. You take care of that child. I love that. Shows what a person is truly on the inside.\"\n\nBunnie became a stepmom to Bailee in 2016 when she and Jelly Roll, 39, married in a Las Vegas ceremony. The \"Wild Ones\" singer shares his daughter with ex-girlfriend Felicia Beckwith but has been her primary parent since Bailee's 2008 birth.\n\nJelly paid tribute to Bunnie and what a great stepmom she was Bailee in a touching May 2020 Facebook post showing a photo of the pair.\n\n\"It takes a special kind of woman to raise a kid that isn't her child and still treat the child as if she was. Bunnie is that special woman, outside of the social media, outside of the podcast, and all the business endeavors she does and helps me with, Bunnie is a beautiful soul,\" Jelly wrote.\n\nHe added, \"She is kind, patient and caring.

I love Motionless in White. I think Chris is adorable, but, I mean, that's it.

The caption says, 'I guess you could say we're in love now,'\" she said.\n\n\"Not all my TikToks are made for news articles, so glad we cleared that up. But Chris Motionless, call me,\" concluded Bunnie.\n\nLast month, Bunnie shared a video of herself meeting Cerulli at Sick New World music festival in Las Vegas, writing in text displayed on the clip, \"When you finally get to meet your hall pass,\" and continuing in the caption, \"You could say we're in love now.\"\n\nJelly, 39, supportively wrote in the comments section, \"Bout time,\" and Bunnie later clarified that the \"Need a Favor\" singer \"made this happen\" after some followers expressed concern with her playful feelings for another man.\n\nLater, Bunnie posted a clip of Jelly meeting Swift and pointed out a double standard in how they were treated. \"Another point I'd like to prove- when my husband met his crush Taylor Swift everyone swooned. But his wife, an outspoken blonde meets hers & omg what a wh---! We feel so bad for Jelly blah blah blah. I didn't even hug dude lmao - I shook his hand & y'all kno [sic] how much I hate shaking hands,\" she wrote.\n\nIn April, the \"Save Me\" artist opened up to PEOPLE about how both blissful moments and difficulties throughout his relationship with Bunnie have ultimately made them a stronger couple.\n\n\"It ain't always been Hallmark cards and Care Bears, and we had to really put in a lot of work to be together, and it was worth it. It was worth every second. It was worth every disagreement. It was worth every split.

So proud of my baby doing the 5k & losing 50 lbs to do it!\" Bunnie captioned a video of her hopping in the cold plunge bath with her husband after the race and planting a kiss on him. She added over top of the video, \"The couples that finish the 5k together cold plunge together.\"\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Bunnie Xo. (@xomgitsbunnie)\n\nJelly Roll told Entertainment Tonight that he felt \"really, really good\" about completing his first race, telling the outlet he \"couldn't walk a mile\" when he first started training back in January. The \"Wild Ones\" singer added that he was feeling \"really motivated\" about his own fitness journey after completing the 5K and that he and Kreischer \"got really emotional at the finish line.\"\n\n\"I feel great, I'm a little tired,\" he continued. \"It was a little bit harder than I thought it was [going to be], but it's awesome, man. ...I feel incredible. I'm surrounded by friends and family.\" The Grammy-nominated musician revealed that one of the most rewarding parts of participating in the 5K was getting to be an inspiration for others. \"I think the coolest thing is how many people stopped to tell us that they were motivated by us, other big guys,\" he shared. \"It was just really cool to see that.\" As for his future fitness goals, Jelly Roll declared, \"Next year, a half marathon! We're saying it now, absolutely!\"\n\nJust last month, Bunnie revealed on her Dumb Blonde podcast that her husband had taken a step back from social media amid all of the bullying about his weight. \"My husband got off the internet because he is so tired of being bullied about his f-king weight, and that makes me want to cry, because he is the sweetest angel baby,\" Bunnie said at the time. \"My husband doesn't show it to you guys, but I'm going to have a very vulnerable moment here. It hurts him.\"\n\nShe continued, \"The internet can say whatever the f-k they want about you and they say, 'You're a celebrity. You're supposed to be able to handle it.' No the f-k we're not. Enough is enough.\" Bunnie then called out online trolls and bullies, saying, \"Don't bully people, because you never know where they are mentally. There are a lot of people who are not as strong as me, that are on the internet, and they don't deserve to f-kin' be bullied.\"\n\n0comments", "source": {"uri": "popculture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebrity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5K_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "5K run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Kreischer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bert Kreischer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Physical fitness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Segura", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Segura"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Bowl_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rose Bowl (stadium)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weight loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasadena,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pasadena, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pasadena, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Ones_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wild Ones (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blond", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Half marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Troll"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2024/05/08/b0bd171b-8b15-4c64-9706-390669562450/jelly-roll-bunnie-xo-copy.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544307", "eventUri": "eng-9544307", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

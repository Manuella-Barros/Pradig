His selection gives Boston three of the 12 players on the U.S. roster; Celtics teammates Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday also are Paris-bound.\n\nWhite is expected to be in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, later this week to join the U.S. squad.

He and the Celtics agreed on a four-year extension worth nearly $126 million after the playoff run, one in which he led Boston with 65 made 3-pointers on a team-best 40.4% shooting from beyond the arc.\n\nLeonard is a two-time NBA champion, six-time All-Star and six-time All-NBA player, but injury issues have been a recurring theme in his career. USA Basketball had monitored him closely in recent weeks, making sure he was doing well enough to be on the court after his season with the Clippers ended prematurely.\n\nHe has missed 256 regular-season games over the last seven years, including all of the 2021-22 season with knee trouble. He appeared in 68 games this past season for the Clippers, his most since playing in 74 for San Antonio during the 2016-17 season.\n\n\"This is just my journey,\" Leonard said earlier this week, discussing his injuries. \"I can't lay out the perfect script for me. Last year I tried to play as much as possible, felt great and at a certain period of time I couldn't go. I tried the best that I could, but it's just my journey. I don't want to be in a situation that (I'm) in, but I've got to take it for what it is. And a lot of people are watching, supporters or doubters. But I motivate a lot of people, so I've got to keep doing what I'm doing.\"\n\nLeonard -- part of a 592-person Olympic team formally named by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee earlier Wednesday -- had said earlier this week that his knee was fine and he was able to resume on-court training about three weeks ago to get ready for the Games.\n\n\"I'm ready to go,\" Leonard said then. \"I'm playing now so, I'm happy.\"\n\nA couple of days later, hours before the first U.S. exhibition game against Canada and one day before the team departs for Abu Dhabi -- the first of two international stops for more games and practices before arriving in France for the Olympics -- Leonard was gone.\n\nLeonard's departure leaves the U.S., at least until White arrives, with 10 available players. Kevin Durant will not play against Canada because of a calf strain and could not compete in the team's four-day training camp in Las Vegas that ended Tuesday. USA Basketball is working under the expectation that Durant will be ready for increasingly more on-court activity in the coming days.\n\nLeonard had been invited to be part of USA Basketball teams in the past and had to decline for various reasons, primarily injury issues or long playoff runs.\n\n\"I always wanted to play against other talent overseas or just other basketball styles and players,\"

USA Basketball said it, along with the Clippers, made the decision on Leonard's status for Paris.\n\n\"Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas,\" USA Basketball said in a statement. \"He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\"\n\nWhite averaged 15.2 points and 5.2 assists for the Celtics this past season. His selection gives Boston three of the 12 players on the U.S. roster; Celtics teammates Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday also are Paris-bound.\n\nWhite is expected to be in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, later this week to join the U.S. squad. The team will fly to Abu Dhabi from Las Vegas on Thursday and is scheduled to practice there Saturday ahead of exhibition games against Australia on July 15 and Serbia on July 17.\n\n\"I am happy to announce that Derrick will compete at his first Olympic Games on the heels of a championship season in Boston,\" USA Basketball Managing Director Grant Hill said. \"We look forward to him joining the team in the coming days as we continue preparations for Paris.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I want to thank Kawhi for his commitment to the USA Men's National Team,\" Hill added. \"He earned the opportunity to represent the United States, but USA Basketball and Clippers leadership felt it's important to allow Kawhi to prepare for the NBA season.\"\n\nWhite - a second-team All-Defensive selection after this past NBA season, meaning he'll clearly take some of the on-ball defending duties that the Olympic team likely envisioned Leonard having - has some USA Basketball experience, including being part of the 2019 World Cup team that finished seventh in China. He and the Celtics agreed on a four-year extension worth nearly $126 million after the playoff run, one in which he led Boston with 65 made 3-pointers on a team-best 40.4% shooting from beyond the arc.\n\nLeonard is a two-time NBA champion, six-time All-Star and six-time All-NBA player, but injury issues have been a recurring theme in his career. USA Basketball had monitored him closely in recent weeks, making sure he was doing well enough to be on the court after his season with the Clippers ended prematurely.\n\nHe has missed 256 regular-season games over the last seven years, including all of the 2021-22 season with knee trouble. He appeared in 68 games this past season for the Clippers, his most since playing in 74 for San Antonio during the 2016-17 season.\n\n\"This is just my journey,\" Leonard said earlier this week, discussing his injuries. \"I can't lay out the perfect script for me.

Kevin Durant will not play against Canada because of a calf strain and could not compete in the team's four-day training camp in Las Vegas that ended Tuesday. USA Basketball is working under the expectation that Durant will be ready for increasingly more on-court activity in the coming days.\n\nLeonard had been invited to be part of USA Basketball teams in the past and had to decline for various reasons, primarily injury issues or long playoff runs.\n\n\"I always wanted to play against other talent overseas or just other basketball styles and players,\"

USA Basketball said it, along with the Clippers, made the decision on Leonard's status for Paris.\n\n\"Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas,\" USA Basketball said in a statement. \"He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\"\n\nWhite averaged 15.2 points and 5.2 assists for the Celtics this past season. His selection gives Boston three of the 12 players on the U.S. roster; Celtics teammates Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday also are Paris-bound.\n\nWhite is expected to be in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, later this week to join the U.S. squad. The team will fly to Abu Dhabi from Las Vegas on Thursday and is scheduled to practice there Saturday ahead of exhibition games against Australia on July 15 and Serbia on July 17.\n\n\"I am happy to announce that Derrick will compete at his first Olympic Games on the heels of a championship season in Boston,\" USA Basketball managing director Grant Hill said. \"We look forward to him joining the team in the coming days as we continue preparations for Paris.\n\n\"I want to thank Kawhi for his commitment to the USA Men's National Team,\" Hill added. \"He earned the opportunity to represent the United States, but USA Basketball and Clippers leadership felt it's important to allow Kawhi to prepare for the NBA season.\"\n\nWhite -- a second-team All-Defensive selection after this past NBA season, meaning he'll clearly take some of the on-ball defending duties that the Olympic team likely envisioned Leonard having -- has some USA Basketball experience, including being part of the 2019 World Cup team that finished seventh in China. He and the Celtics agreed on a four-year extension worth nearly $126 million after the playoff run, one in which he led Boston with 65 made 3-pointers on a team-best 40.4% shooting from beyond the arc.\n\nLeonard is a two-time NBA champion, six-time All-Star and six-time All-NBA player, but injury issues have been a recurring theme in his career. USA Basketball had monitored him closely in recent weeks, making sure he was doing well enough to be on the court after his season with the Clippers ended prematurely.\n\nHe has missed 256 regular-season games over the last seven years, including all of the 2021-22 season with knee trouble. He appeared in 68 games this past season for the Clippers, his most since playing in 74 for San Antonio during the 2016-17 season.\n\n\"This is just my journey,\" Leonard said earlier this week, discussing his injuries. \"I can't lay out the perfect script for me. Last year I tried to play as much as possible, felt great and at a certain period of time I couldn't go. I tried the best that I could, but it's just my journey. I don't want to be in a situation that (I'm) in, but I've got to take it for what it is. And a lot of people are watching, supporters or doubters. But I motivate a lot of people, so I've got to keep doing what I'm doing.\"\n\nLeonard -- part of a 592-person Olympic team formally named by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee earlier Wednesday -- had said earlier this week that his knee was fine and he was able to resume on-court training about three weeks ago to get ready for the Games.\n\n\"I'm ready to go,\" Leonard said then. \"I'm playing now so, I'm happy.\"\n\nA couple of days later, hours before the first U.S. exhibition game against Canada and one day before the team departs for Abu Dhabi -- the first of two international stops for more games and practices before arriving in France for the Olympics -- Leonard was gone.\n\nLeonard's departure leaves the U.S., at least until White arrives, with 10 available players. Kevin Durant will not play against Canada because of a calf strain and could not compete in the team's four-day training camp in Las Vegas that ended Tuesday. USA Basketball is working under the expectation that Durant will be ready for increasingly more on-court activity in the coming days.\n\nLeonard had been invited to be part of USA Basketball teams in the past and had to decline for various reasons, primarily injury issues or long playoff runs.\n\n\"I always wanted to play against other talent overseas or just other basketball styles and players,\" Leonard said. \"It is one of the reasons why I play the game.\"\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "idahostatejournal.com", "dataType": "news",

Leonard has been dealing with knee and leg injuries over the last year, and USA Basketball released an official statement on his decision Wednesday morning.\n\n\"Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas. He felt ready to compete,\" the statement read. \"However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it is in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\"\n\nAs a result of Leonard opting out of the Olympics, Boston Celtics guard Derrick White is the \"strong\" favorite to replace the All-Star on Team USA's roster, according to The Athletic's Shams Charania. White was one of the 41 finalists for USA Basketball in January.\n\nLeonard's departure from Team USA ahead of the Paris Olympics is somewhat surprising, especially considering that he made the trip out to Las Vegas and participated in practices and scrimmages with the team. However, his continued battle with chronic knee soreness and inflammation now results in Leonard being sidelined again, a story that Clippers fans know all too well.\n\nThe superstar forward missed a total of 14 games during the 2023-24 season, the fewest games he has missed since the 2016-17 season. In total, Leonard has missed 161 games since joining the Clippers in 2019, which equates to roughly 41 percent of games.\n\nWith Leonard heading back to Los Angeles in order to prepare his body for the 2024-25 season, White is likely to step in and replace the two-time NBA champion on Team USA's roster. White has been known for his defensive prowess through the years, and he was a big part of the Celtics' recent championship run during the 2023-24 NBA season. He last represented USA Basketball during the 2019 World Cup.\n\nShould White join Team USA as Leonard's replacement, he will be the only player on the roster who has never made an All-Star appearance.\n\nThe departure of Leonard is somewhat concerning for Team USA, especially considering that they are beginning to play Olympic tune-up games. Not to mention, superstar forward Kevin Durant is already sidelined with a calf injury. USA Basketball head coach Steve Kerr has already said that Durant will not play in Tuesday's exhibition game against Canada.\n\nOnce again, Team USA is the resounding favorite to win the gold medal at the Olympics. With LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and hopefully Durant leading the way, anything less than a gold medal would be a major letdown for the Americans. An official announcement on who will replace Leonard, which will likely be White, is expected to come within the next week.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brett_siegel@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Brett Siegel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USA Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_at_the_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States at the Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kawhi-Leonard-Los-Angeles-Clippers-Team-USA-Paris-Olympics.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721890", "eventUri": "eng-9721890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

Kevin Durant will not play against Canada because of a calf strain and could not compete in the team's four-day training camp in Las Vegas that ended Tuesday.\n\nLeonard had been invited to be part of USA Basketball teams in the past and had to decline for various reasons, primarily injury issues or long playoff runs.\n\n\"I always wanted to play against other talent overseas or just other basketball styles and players,\" Leonard said. \"It is one of the reasons why I play the game.\"", "source": {"uri": "beaumontenterprise.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beaumont Enterprise"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_reynolds@beaumontenterprise.com", "name": "Tim Reynolds", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USA Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_basketball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national basketball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_at_the_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States at the Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/40/54/42/25348228/3/rawImage.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721890", "eventUri": "eng-9721890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

He appeared in 68 games this past season for the Clippers, his most since playing in 74 for San Antonio during the 2016-17 season.\n\n\"This is just my journey,\" Leonard said earlier this week, discussing his injuries. \"I can't lay out the perfect script for me.

Kevin Durant will not play against Canada because of a calf strain and could not compete in the team's four-day training camp in Las Vegas that ended Tuesday.\n\nLeonard had been invited to be part of USA Basketball teams in the past and had to decline for various reasons, primarily injury issues or long playoff runs.\n\n\"I always wanted to play against other talent overseas or just other basketball styles and players,\" Leonard said. \"It is one of the reasons why I play the game.\"\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_reynolds@yakimaherald.com", "name": "Tim Reynolds", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USA Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_basketball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national basketball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/yakimaherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/ba/3badd380-bb7b-50d3-a26d-ef53ab0f81fa/668ea7474c8ec.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721890", "eventUri": "eng-9721890", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

USA Basketball said it, along with the Clippers, made the decision on Leonard's status.\n\n\"Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas,\" USA Basketball said in a statement Wednesday. \"He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\"\n\nLeonard is a two-time NBA champion, six-time All-Star and six-time All-NBA player, but injury issues have been a recurring theme in his career.\n\nHe has missed 256 regular-season games over the last seven years, including all of the 2021-22 season with knee trouble. He appeared in 68 games this past season for the Clippers, his most since playing in 74 for San Antonio during the 2016-17 season.\n\n\"This is just my journey,\" Leonard said earlier this week, discussing his injuries. \"I can't lay out the perfect script for me. Last year I tried to play as much as possible, felt great and at a certain period of time I couldn't go. I tried the best that I could, but it's just my journey. I don't want to be in a situation that (I'm) in, but I've got to take it for what it is. And a lot of people are watching, supporters or doubters. But I motivate a lot of people, so I've got to keep doing what I'm doing.\"\n\nLeonard -- part of a 592-person Olympic team formally named by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee earlier Wednesday -- had said earlier this week that his knee was fine and he was able to resume on-court training about three weeks ago to get ready for the Games.\n\n\"I'm ready to go,\" Leonard said then. \"I'm playing now so, I'm happy.\"\n\nA couple of days later, hours before the first U.S. exhibition game against Canada and one day before the team departs for Abu Dhabi -- the first of two international stops for more games and practices before arriving in France for the Olympics -- Leonard was gone.\n\nThat leaves the U.S., at least for the very short term, with 10 available players. Kevin Durant will not play against Canada because of a calf strain and could not compete in the team's four-day training camp in Las Vegas that ended Tuesday.\n\nLeonard had been invited to be part of USA Basketball teams in the past and had to decline for various reasons, primarily injury issues or long playoff runs.\n\n\"I always wanted to play against other talent overseas or just other basketball styles and players,\" Leonard said. \"It is one of the reasons why I play the game.\"", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors":

Leonard, who played only 68 games during the 2023-24 NBA season due to chronic knee soreness and inflammation, had been preparing for the Olympics but ultimately decided to prioritize his health and the upcoming NBA season. In a statement from USA Basketball:\n\n\"Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas. He felt ready to compete.\"\n\n\"However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\"\n\nMarc J. Spears reported that Derrick White of the Boston Celtics will replace Leonard on the roster. White's addition would bring a solid defensive presence and versatility to Team USA as they aim for gold in Paris.\n\nThis decision comes after significant surprise that Leonard had initially agreed to join the Team USA squad, given his injury history and recent playoff absences. Stephen A. Smith had previously argued that Leonard was the worst superstar in sports history regarding availability and had called on Clippers owner Steve Ballmer to use his influence to prevent Leonard from playing in the Olympics.\n\nWhether Ballmer's influence played a role or not, the Clippers' wish for Leonard to focus on the NBA season has been granted.\n\nLeonard's withdrawal underscores the delicate balance athletes must maintain between representing their country and ensuring their long-term health and career sustainability. As the Olympics draw near, Team USA will look to Derrick White and other talents to fill the void left by Leonard and strive for success on the international stage\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

Representatives from the Clippers, including team president Lawrence Frank, have attended practices at UNLV this week.\n\n\"Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the last several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas. He felt ready to compete,\" USA Basketball said. \"However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\"\n\nWhite, who recently signed a four-year extension worth $126 million, played on Team USA at the 2019 World Cup. He averaged 15.2 points and 5.2 assists for the NBA champion Celtics this past season.\n\n\"I am happy to announce that Derrick will compete at his first Olympic Games on the heels of a championship season in Boston,\" USA Basketball managing director Grant Hill said. \"We look forward to him joining the team in the coming days as we continue preparations for Paris.\n\n\"I want to thank Kawhi for his commitment to the USA Men's National Team. He earned the opportunity to represent the United States, but USA Basketball and Clippers leadership felt it's important to allow Kawhi to prepare for the NBA season.\"\n\nLeonard said he'd been rehabbing the knee over the past two months and wasn't sure whether he'd be able to play until two weeks ago, when he showed improvement.\n\n\"I took the time, and I was able to turn around over the last two weeks,\" Leonard said Sunday. \"So I'm out here now and, yeah, I'm having a good time.\"\n\nLeonard said Tuesday that he was planning to play in Team USA's first exhibition game Wednesday night against Team Canada but referred to his knee being in a \"neutral\" state.\n\nWhite will not be with team Wednesday night but is expected to join Team USA this weekend in Abu Dhabi -- the first of two international stops for more games and practices before arriving in France for the Olympics.\n\nNBA teams don't have the ability to prevent players under contract for playing for their national teams, though typically it ends up being a mutual decision. Team Canada general manager Rowan Barrett said two weeks ago that the Golden State Warriors were holding forward Andrew Wiggins out of the Olympics, though the team said it was a mutual decision.\n\nTeam USA also is dealing with an injury to forward Kevin Durant, who hasn't been able to take part in contact practice due to a calf strain and will not play Wednesday night.\n\nLeonard, who is about to start a three-year, $150 million deal with the Clippers, hasn't been able to finish the past two postseasons because of right knee injuries. The two-time NBA champion and six-time All-NBA player has missed 256 regular-season games over the past seven years, including all of the 2021-22 season with knee trouble.

His selection gives Boston three of the 12 players on the U.S. roster; Celtics teammates Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday also are Paris-bound.\n\nWhite is expected to be in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, later this week to join the U.S. squad. The team will fly to Abu Dhabi from Las Vegas on Thursday and is scheduled to practice there Saturday ahead of exhibition games against Australia on July 15 and Serbia on July 17.\n\n\"I am happy to announce that Derrick will compete at his first Olympic Games on the heels of a championship season in Boston,\" USA Basketball managing director Grant Hill said. \"We look forward to him joining the team in the coming days as we continue preparations for Paris.\n\n\"I want to thank Kawhi for his commitment to the USA Men's National Team,\" Hill added. \"He earned the opportunity to represent the United States, but USA Basketball and Clippers leadership felt it's important to allow Kawhi to prepare for the NBA season.\"\n\nWhite -- a second-team All-Defensive selection after this past NBA season, meaning he'll clearly take some of the on-ball defending duties that the Olympic team likely envisioned Leonard having -- has some USA Basketball experience, including being part of the 2019 World Cup team that finished seventh in China. He and the Celtics agreed on a four-year extension worth nearly $126 million after the playoff run, one in which he led Boston with 65 made 3-pointers on a team-best 40.4% shooting from beyond the arc.\n\nLeonard is a two-time NBA champion, six-time All-Star and six-time All-NBA player, but injury issues have been a recurring theme in his career. USA Basketball had monitored him closely in recent weeks, making sure he was doing well enough to be on the court after his season with the Clippers ended prematurely.\n\nHe has missed 256 regular-season games over the last seven years, including all of the 2021-22 season with knee trouble. He appeared in 68 games this past season for the Clippers, his most since playing in 74 for San Antonio during the 2016-17 season.\n\n\"This is just my journey,\" Leonard said earlier this week, discussing his injuries. \"I can't lay out the perfect script for me. Last year I tried to play as much as possible, felt great and at a certain period of time I couldn't go. I tried the best that I could, but it's just my journey. I don't want to be in a situation that (I'm) in, but I've got to take it for what it is. And a lot of people are watching, supporters or doubters. But I motivate a lot of people, so I've got to keep doing what I'm doing.\"\n\nLeonard -- part of a 592-person Olympic team formally named by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee earlier Wednesday -- had said earlier this week that his knee was fine and he was able to resume on-court training about three weeks ago to get ready for the Games.\n\n\"I'm ready to go,\" Leonard said then. \"I'm playing now so, I'm happy.\"\n\nA couple of days later, hours before the first U.S. exhibition game against Canada and one day before the team departs for Abu Dhabi -- the first of two international stops for more games and practices before arriving in France for the Olympics -- Leonard was gone.\n\nLeonard's departure leaves the U.S., at least until White arrives, with 10 available players. Kevin Durant will not play against Canada because of a calf strain and could not compete in the team's four-day training camp in Las Vegas that ended Tuesday. USA Basketball is working under the expectation that Durant will be ready for increasingly more on-court activity in the coming days.\n\nLeonard had been invited to be part of USA Basketball teams in the past and had to decline for various reasons, primarily injury issues or long playoff runs.\n\n\"I always wanted to play against other talent overseas or just other basketball styles and players,\" Leonard said. \"It is one of the reasons why I play the game.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I

His selection gives Boston three of the 12 players on the U.S. roster; Celtics teammates Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday also are Paris-bound.\n\nWhite is expected to be in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, later this week to join the U.S. squad. The team will fly to Abu Dhabi from Las Vegas on Thursday and is scheduled to practice there Saturday ahead of exhibition games against Australia on July 15 and Serbia on July 17.\n\n\"I am happy to announce that Derrick will compete at his first Olympic Games on the heels of a championship season in Boston,\" USA Basketball managing director Grant Hill said. \"We look forward to him joining the team in the coming days as we continue preparations for Paris.\n\n\"I want to thank Kawhi for his commitment to the USA Men's National Team,\" Hill added. \"He earned the opportunity to represent the United States, but USA Basketball and Clippers leadership felt it's important to allow Kawhi to prepare for the NBA season.\"\n\nWhite -- a second-team All-Defensive selection after this past NBA season, meaning he'll clearly take some of the on-ball defending duties that the Olympic team likely envisioned Leonard having -- has some USA Basketball experience, including being part of the 2019 World Cup team that finished seventh in China. He and the Celtics agreed on a four-year extension worth nearly $126 million after the playoff run, one in which he led Boston with 65 made 3-pointers on a team-best 40.4% shooting from beyond the arc.\n\nLeonard is a two-time NBA champion, six-time All-Star and six-time All-NBA player, but injury issues have been a recurring theme in his career. USA Basketball had monitored him closely in recent weeks, making sure he was doing well enough to be on the court after his season with the Clippers ended prematurely.\n\nHe has missed 256 regular-season games over the last seven years, including all of the 2021-22 season with knee trouble. He appeared in 68 games this past season for the Clippers, his most since playing in 74 for San Antonio during the 2016-17 season.\n\n\"This is just my journey,\" Leonard said earlier this week, discussing his injuries. \"I can't lay out the perfect script for me. Last year I tried to play as much as possible, felt great and at a certain period of time I couldn't go. I tried the best that I could, but it's just my journey. I don't want to be in a situation that (I'm) in, but I've got to take it for what it is. And a lot of people are watching, supporters or doubters. But I motivate a lot of people, so I've got to keep doing what I'm doing.\"\n\nLeonard -- part of a 592-person Olympic team formally named by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee earlier Wednesday -- had said earlier this week that his knee was fine and he was able to resume on-court training about three weeks ago to get ready for the Games.\n\n\"I'm ready to go,\" Leonard said then. \"I'm playing now so, I'm happy.\"\n\nA couple of days later, hours before the first U.S. exhibition game against Canada and one day before the team departs for Abu Dhabi -- the first of two international stops for more games and practices before arriving in France for the Olympics -- Leonard was gone.\n\nLeonard's departure leaves the U.S., at least until White arrives, with 10 available players. Kevin Durant will not play against Canada because of a calf strain and could not compete in the team's four-day training camp in Las Vegas that ended Tuesday. USA Basketball is working under the expectation that Durant will be ready for increasingly more on-court activity in the coming days.\n\nLeonard had been invited to be part of USA Basketball teams in the past and had to decline for various reasons, primarily injury issues or long playoff runs.\n\n\"I always wanted to play against other talent overseas or just other basketball styles and players,\" Leonard said. \"It is one of the reasons why I play the game.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and

White signed a four-year contract extension with Boston reportedly worth north of $125 million.\n\nLeonard missed 12 of the Los Angeles Clippers' final 14 games this past season with right knee inflammation. USA Basketball said it, along with the Clippers, made the decision on Leonard's status.\n\n\"Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas,\" USA Basketball said in a statement Wednesday. \"He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\"\n\nLeonard is a two-time NBA champion, six-time All-Star and six-time All-NBA player, but injury issues have been a recurring theme in his career.\n\nWhite is a former CU Buff. See how he's kept strong ties to the Colorado program in the video player below: Celtics guard and Colorado native, Derrick White keeps strong ties with CU Basketball\n\nHe has missed 256 regular-season games over the last seven years, including all of the 2021-22 season with knee trouble. He appeared in 68 games this past season for the Clippers, his most since playing in 74 for San Antonio during the 2016-17 season.\n\n\"This is just my journey,\" Leonard said earlier this week, discussing his injuries. \"I can't lay out the perfect script for me. Last year I tried to play as much as possible, felt great and at a certain period of time I couldn't go. I tried the best that I could, but it's just my journey. I don't want to be in a situation that (I'm) in, but I've got to take it for what it is. And a lot of people are watching, supporters or doubters. But I motivate a lot of people, so I've got to keep doing what I'm doing.\"\n\nLeonard -- part of a 592-person Olympic team formally named by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee earlier Wednesday -- had said earlier this week that his knee was fine and he was able to resume on-court training about three weeks ago to get ready for the Games.\n\n\"I'm ready to go,\" Leonard said then. \"I'm playing now so, I'm happy.\"\n\nA couple of days later, hours before the first U.S. exhibition game against Canada and one day before the team departs for Abu Dhabi -- the first of two international stops for more games and practices before arriving in France for the Olympics -- Leonard was gone.\n\nThat leaves the U.S., at least for the very short term, with 10 available players. Kevin Durant will not play against Canada because of a calf strain and could not compete in the team's four-day training camp in Las Vegas that ended Tuesday.\n\nLeonard had been invited to be part of USA Basketball teams in the past and had to decline for various reasons, primarily injury issues or long playoff runs.\n\n\"I always wanted to play against other talent overseas or just other basketball styles and players,\" Leonard said. \"It is one of the reasons why I play the game.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri":

USA Basketball said it, along with the Clippers, made the decision on Leonard's status.\n\n\"Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas,\" USA Basketball said in a statement Wednesday. \"He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\"\n\nUSA Basketball will be permitted to replace Leonard on the 12-man roster and was working toward bringing in Boston Celtics guard Derrick White to take his place, a person with knowledge of those discussions told The Associated Press. The person spoke to the Press on condition of anonymity because USA Basketball did not reveal that publicly.\n\nALSO READ | Paris Olympics: Greece, Puerto Rico, Brazil and Spain complete men's basketball line-up\n\nLeonard said earlier this week that his knee was fine and that he was able to resume on-court training about three weeks ago to get ready for the Olympics.\n\n\"I'm ready to go,\" Leonard said then. \"I'm playing now so, I'm happy.\"\n\nA couple of days later, hours before the first U.S. exhibition game against Canada and one day before the team departs for Abu Dhabi -- the first of two international stops for more games and practices before arriving in France for the Olympics -- Leonard was gone.\n\nThat leaves the U.S., at least for the very short term, with 10 available players. Kevin Durant will not play against Canada because of a calf strain and could not compete in the team's four-day training camp in Las Vegas that ended Tuesday.\n\nLatest on SportstarIND vs ZIM, 3rd

important to allow Kawhi to prepare for the NBA season.\"\n\nWhile the nature of the concern was not specified, it may have something to do with his robust injury history.\n\nThe 33-year-old Leonard played in 68 regular-season games in 2023-24, marking the first time he reached the 60-game mark since the 2018-19 campaign, which was his only year with the Toronto Raptors.\n\nLeonard missed the entire 2021-22 season due to a torn ACL and returned to appear in 52 contests the following season.\n\nThis past season, Leonard reclaimed his spot as one of the NBA's top players, averaging 23.7 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 2.1 three-pointers made and 1.6 steals per game en route to his sixth career All-Star selection.\n\nHowever, the two-time NBA Finals MVP and two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year missed four of the Clips' six first-round playoff games against the eventual Western Conference champion Dallas Mavericks due to knee inflammation.\n\nAnything knee-related is a concern when it comes to Leonard since he has missed a significant amount of time during his career with knee issues.\n\nLeonard signed a three-year, $149.51 million contract extension with the Clippers in January, and given that Paul George left L.A. for the Philadelphia 76ers in free agency, the Clips can ill afford to have Kawhi risk further injury.\n\nThe Clippers' head coach, Ty Lue, is an assistant coach for Team USA, meaning he had a firsthand look at Leonard during Team USA's practices and scrimmages this week.\n\nIf USA Basketball chooses White as the replacement for Leonard, it will be adding another 2024 NBA champion to the roster alongside his Celtics teammates in Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday.\n\nThe 30-year-old White is coming off the best season of his career, as he averaged 15.2 points, 5.2 assists, 4.2 rebounds, 2.7 three-pointers made and 1.0 steal per game while shooting 46.1 percent from the field and 39.6 percent from beyond the arc.\n\nWhite has been named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team in each of the past two seasons, so he would give Team USA another elite perimeter defender.\n\nDespite losing a player of Leonard's stature, the Americans remain heavy favorites to win a fifth straight Olympic gold medal in men's basketball due to the presence of superstars such as LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Joel Embiid, Tatum and a host of others.\n\nTeam USA's first group game at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris is scheduled for July 28 against Serbia, followed by clashes with South Sudan and Puerto Rico on July 31 and Aug. 3, respectively.",

USA Basketball then announced that Derrick White of the Boston Celtics will replace Leonard on the roster.\n\nHere's the official statement about Leonard from USAB:\n\n\"Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas. He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\"\n\nESPN's Marc Spears reported that Leonard's camp expressed concern to USA Basketball two days prior to this announcement.\n\nLeonard missed the last eight games of the 2023-24 regular season because of a right knee injury. He attempted to come back during the Clippers' first-round series against the Dallas Mavericks, but, after appearing in Games 2 and 3, he was sidelined again.\n\nTeam USA's first exhibition game is Wednesday at 10:30 p.m. ET against Canada at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\n\nAt practice on Tuesday, Leonard told reporters, \"Yeah, I think I'll suit up tomorrow,\" per ESPN. \"Everything's been good so far. [The knee has] been at a neutral state, and I hope it stays that way.\"\n\nClippers coach Tyronn Lue, an assistant coach with Team USA, told ESPN on Tuesday, \"He's been good, the best I've seen him move since he got injured. Moving really good. It's good to see him healthy and trending in the right direction.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Leonard told reporters that he had previously been concerned that he might have to miss the Olympics but he \"took the time, and I was able to turn around over the last two weeks,\" via ESPN. Leonard said that, last season, he \"tried to play as much as possible, felt great. And at a certain period of time I couldn't go. I tried the best that I could, but it's just my journey.\"\n\nThe next step in his journey, he thought, was to play for his national team for the first time and compete for a gold medal. Ideally, this would have been a relatively low-risk situation: On one of the most stacked rosters in the history of the sport, Leonard would not have to shoulder the same kind of minutes or playmaking load that he's used to with the Clippers. Evidently, though, he/the Clippers/USA Basketball decided that he wasn't ready, or that the risk remained too high.\n\nHad he gone to the Olympics, Leonard would have given Steve Kerr's coaching staff the ability to play enormous, interchangeable lineups -- think him next to LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Jayson Tatum -- and an additional bucket-getter for end-of-shot-clock or end-of-game situations. You cannot, however, look at the names on the roster and say that Team USA lacks versatility or shot creation without him. While swapping Leonard for White is a downgrade in terms of size and sheer star power, it might make the team a bit more balanced. White will hardly have to adjust his game at all to fit in on this team, which is precisely why he's the perfect choice to replace Leonard.\n\nWhite, 30, is the only member of Team USA who has never made an All-Star Game. He had a legitimate case this year, though, because of his undeniable two-way impact on the Boston Celtics. He's one of the best defensive guards on the planet, a lights-out shooter and a world-class decision-maker. Even though he won't complain about his minutes or role, I could see Kerr having trouble keeping him off the floor. The one thing Team USA does not have, especially compared to its international opponents, is continuity. White is the kind of guy who ties the room together, and, in theory at least, his presence should help the stars be themselves and the team become more than the sum of its parts. Kerr could even play him next to his Celtics teammates Tatum and Jrue Holiday, if he chooses.\n\nTeam USA's full roster, in alphabetical order: Bam Adebayo, Devin Booker Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis,

USA Basketball said it, along with the Clippers, made the decision on Leonard's status for Paris.\n\n\"Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas,\" USA Basketball said in a statement. \"He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Sattui Winery sued by former employee alleging wage abuse St. Helena postpones Fourth of July fireworks show due to hot, dry conditions\n\nWhite averaged 15.2 points and 5.2 assists for the Celtics this past season. His selection gives Boston three of the 12 players on the U.S. roster; Celtics teammates Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday also are Paris-bound.\n\nWhite is expected to be in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, later this week to join the U.S. squad. The team will fly to Abu Dhabi from Las Vegas on Thursday and is scheduled to practice there Saturday ahead of exhibition games against Australia on July 15 and Serbia on July 17.\n\n\"I am happy to announce that Derrick will compete at his first Olympic Games on the heels of a championship season in Boston,\" USA Basketball managing director Grant Hill said. \"We look forward to him joining the team in the coming days as we continue preparations for Paris.\n\n\"I want to thank Kawhi for his commitment to the USA Men's National Team,\" Hill added. \"He earned the opportunity to represent the United States, but USA Basketball and Clippers leadership felt it's important to allow Kawhi to prepare for the NBA season.\"\n\nWhite -- a second-team All-Defensive selection after this past NBA season, meaning he'll clearly take some of the on-ball defending duties that the Olympic team likely envisioned Leonard having -- has some USA Basketball experience, including being part of the 2019 World Cup team that finished seventh in China. He and the Celtics agreed on a four-year extension worth nearly $126 million after the playoff run, one in which he led Boston with 65 made 3-pointers on a team-best 40.4% shooting from beyond the arc.\n\nLeonard is a two-time NBA champion, six-time All-Star and six-time All-NBA player, but injury issues have been a recurring theme in his career. USA Basketball had monitored him closely in recent weeks, making sure he was doing well enough to be on the court after his season with the Clippers ended prematurely.\n\nHe has missed 256 regular-season games over the last seven years, including all of the 2021-22 season with knee trouble. He appeared in 68 games this past season for the Clippers, his most since playing in 74 for San Antonio during the 2016-17 season.\n\n\"This is just my journey,\" Leonard said earlier this week, discussing his injuries. \"I can't lay out the perfect script for me. Last year I tried to play as much as possible, felt great and at a certain period of time I couldn't go. I tried the best that I could, but it's just my journey. I don't want to be in a situation that (I'm) in, but I've got to take it for what it is. And a lot of people are watching, supporters or doubters. But I motivate a lot of people, so I've got to keep doing what I'm doing.\"\n\nLeonard -- part of a 592-person Olympic team formally named by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee earlier Wednesday -- had said earlier this week that his knee was fine and he was able to resume on-court training about three weeks ago to get ready for the Games.\n\n\"I'm ready to go,\" Leonard said then. \"I'm playing now so, I'm happy.\"\n\nA couple of days later, hours before the first U.S. exhibition game against Canada and one day before the team departs for Abu Dhabi -- the first of two international stops for more games and practices before arriving in France for the Olympics -- Leonard was gone.\n\nLeonard's departure leaves the U.S., at least until White arrives, with 10 available players. Kevin Durant will not play against Canada because of a calf strain and could not compete in the team's four-day training camp in Las Vegas that ended Tuesday. USA Basketball is working under the expectation that Durant will be ready for increasingly more on-court activity in the coming days.\n\nLeonard had been invited to be part of USA Basketball teams in the past and had to decline for various reasons, primarily injury issues or long playoff runs.\n\n\"I always wanted to play against other talent overseas or just other basketball styles and players,\" Leonard said. \"It is one of the reasons why I play the game.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of

He had also stated at one point that the Clippers were \"not really\" worried about him suiting up for Team USA coming off an injury.\n\n\"They were positive about the situation,\" Leonard said. \"So, yeah, they wasn't too worried about it.\"\n\nTeam USA is taking on Canada in Las Vegas on Wednesday evening, and will then head to the United Arab Emirates games against Australia and Serbia. After those couple of games, the team will head to London to play against South Sudan and Germany.\n\nWhoever is Leonard's replacement, Team USA will need to adjust quickly. It is also losing one of the best defenders the NBA has ever seen, which is a major blow to the roster.\n\nRelated: Dillon Brooks Sends Strong Message To Team USA Ahead Of Paris Olympics\n\nRelated:

Spears, Boston Celtics guard Derrick White will take Leonard's place on the roster.\n\nSpears also reported that Leonard's camp reached out to USA Basketball two days ago \"expressing concern,\" which may have played a role in the decision.\n\nWhile the nature of the concern was not specified, it may have something to do with his robust injury history.\n\nThe 33-year-old Leonard played in 68 regular-season games in 2023-24, marking the first time he reached the 60-game mark since the 2018-19 campaign, which was his only year with the Toronto Raptors.\n\nLeonard missed the entire 2021-22 season due to a torn ACL and returned to appear in 52 contests the following season.\n\nThis past season, Leonard reclaimed his spot as one of the NBA's top players, averaging 23.7 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.6 assists, 2.1 three-pointers made and 1.6 steals per game en route to his sixth career All-Star selection.\n\nHowever, the two-time NBA Finals MVP and two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year missed four of the Clips' six first-round playoff games against the eventual Western Conference champion Dallas Mavericks due to knee inflammation.\n\nAnything knee-related is a concern when it comes to Leonard since he has missed a significant amount of time during his career with knee issues.\n\nLeonard signed a three-year, $149.51 million contract extension with the Clippers in January, and given that Paul George left L.A. for the Philadelphia 76ers in free agency, the Clips can ill afford to have Kawhi risk further injury.\n\nThe Clippers' head coach, Ty Lue, is an assistant coach for Team USA, meaning he had a firsthand look at Leonard during Team USA's practices and scrimmages this week.\n\nIf USA Basketball chooses White as the replacement for Leonard, it will be adding another 2024 NBA champion to the roster alongside his Celtics teammates in Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday.\n\nThe 30-year-old White is coming off the best season of his career, as he averaged 15.2 points, 5.2 assists, 4.2 rebounds, 2.7 three-pointers made and 1.0 steal per game while shooting 46.1 percent from the field and 39.6 percent from beyond the arc.\n\nWhite has been named to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team in each of the past two seasons, so he would give Team USA another elite perimeter defender.\n\nDespite losing a player of Leonard's stature, the Americans remain heavy favorites to win a fifth straight Olympic gold medal in men's basketball due to the presence of superstars such as LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Joel Embiid, Tatum and a host of others.\n\nTeam USA's first group game at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris is scheduled for July 28 against Serbia, followed by clashes with South Sudan and Puerto Rico on July 31 and Aug. 3, respectively.", "source":

He grew from 6-foot to 6-foot-4 before his freshman year and became the RMAC Freshman of the Year in 2013 then a two-time Division II All-American in 2014 and 2015.\n\nWhite transferred to the University of Colorado for his final college season, where he was an All-Pac-12 pick and played his way into being a first-round pick by the San Antonio Spurs in 2017.\n\nWhite played five seasons for the Spurs before he was traded to the Celtics midway through the 2022 season and helped them on their run to the NBA Finals. White made the NBA All-Defensive Team the last two seasons and was one of the team's stars on the way to winning the NBA Finals in 2024.\n\nWhite was rewarded in the offseason with a massive payday, signing a 4-year, $125.9 million contract extension with the Celtics on July 1.\n\nAs much as Leonard's career has been defined by his two NBA Finals MVP awards -- one with the Spurs in 2014 and one with the Toronto Raptors in 2019 -- it's also been defined by injury issues.\n\nLeonard only played 9 games in his final season in San Antonio in 2017-2018 and since signing with the Clippers before the 2019-20 season, he's missed 181 regular-season games in the last five seasons, including the entire 2021-22 season.\n\nLeonard signed a 3-year, $149.51 million contract extension with the Clippers in Jan. 2024. When Leonard's current contract runs out in 2026, he will have made approximately $426 million in career earnings, including $192.5 million with the Clippers.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com",

No specific injury was cited, but the team said in a statement that a decision was made for Leonard to focus on the upcoming NBA season rather than competing in Paris.\n\nLeonard has battled chronic knee injuries over the last several seasons. He most most of the Clippers' first-round playoff series against the Dallas Mavericks this year because of inflammation in his right knee. Team USA said Leonard \"had a few strong practices,\" but it would not be a surprise if he experienced issues with his knee again.\n\nThe Clippers might have to lean on Leonard more than ever next season after Paul George signed with the Philadelphia 76ers in free agency.

That includes some of the league's best talent like Steph Curry, LeBron James, and Kevin Durant. At 10:30 p.m. tonight, Team USA has their first exhibition match against Canada ahead of the Olympics.\n\nNBA insider Shams Charania reported today that Kawhi Leonard is withdrawing from Team USA for the Paris Olympics. Leonard had been working to get ready for the Olympics but his knee was giving him problems. Charania noted that the six-time all-star has been suffering from chronic knee soreness and inflation for months. He just wasn't ready to play this summer and it's likely the best for for Team USA and himself.\n\nOver the last seven years of Kawhi Leonard's career, the talented SF has had to deal with several nagging injuries. In his final season with the Spurs in 2017-28, Leonard played in just nine games. He missed the first 27 games of the season with a right quadriceps injury. Team doctors cleared him to play but Leonard did not feel ready. For the last five seasons, Leonard has been with the LA Clippers. He's played in over 60+ games just one time for LA.\n\nAdditionally, he missed the entire 2021-22 season due to an ACL injury. It's been an ongoing struggle for the two-time NBA champion to stay healthy in the later stage of his career. Leonard is only 33 but the injuries have taken a toll on him. The former first-round pick had been working hard this offseason to strengthen his knee. Reports say that his surgically prepared right knee kept him out of the last three games of the Clippers' postseason. It was only until about two weeks ago that his knee finally felt in a \"neutral state.\" While Leonard wanted to represent his country, the Clippers, and Team USA felt it was in his best interest to not play.\n\nNow that Leonard is no longer part of the 12-man roster, Team USA needs to find a replacement. According to ESPN's Marc J. Spears, Boston's Derrick White will be replacing Kawhi Leonard for Team USA this summer. White is coming off an NBA championship with the Celtics in 2024. Additionally, White signed a four-year, $118 million extension this offseason. He'll have the chance to add an Olympic gold medal to his resume.", "source": {"uri": "sportslens.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportslens.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zach_wolpin@sportslens.com", "name": "Zach Wolpin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadriceps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quadriceps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://sportslens.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Kawhi-Leonard-Team-USA-pic.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721890", "eventUri": "eng-9721890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\"\n\nThe U.S. is scheduled to face Canada in an exhibition game Wednesday night, a game Leonard said after practice Tuesday that he was going to play in.\n\n\"Yeah, I think I will suit up tomorrow,\" Leonard said Tuesday. \"Everything has been good so far. It's been at a neutral state and hopefully it stays that way.\"\n\nBut injuries have been a part of Leonard's time with the Clippers during his five seasons in Los Angeles.\n\nHe played in 68 games last season, the most since he played in 74 for the San Antonio Spurs during the 2016-17 season, but he missed the Clippers' final eight regular-season games with right knee inflammation.\n\nLeonard then played in Games 2 and 3 of the Clippers first-round playoff series against the Mavericks, but missed the last three straight with right knee inflammation. His last time playing in an NBA game was April 26.\n\nOut of 410 regular-season games during his time with the Clippers, Leonard has played in just 226.\n\nHe missed the entire 2021-22 season because he tore his anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee during the 2021 playoffs.\n\nHe tore his right meniscus during the 2023 playoffs against the Suns and had a right knee \"clean up\" procedure last summer.\n\nAfter practice Sunday, Leonard talked about his poor health history.\n\n\"Last year, I tried to play as much as possible, felt great and you know at a certain period of time I couldn't go,\" he said. \"I tried the best that I could, but it's just my journey. You know I don't want to be in the situation that I do be in, but I gotta take it for what it is. And you know a lot of people are watching. Supporters or doubters, but I motivate a lot of people. So, I gotta keep doing what I'm doing. I might be the most known at the time right now, like injury (problems) or whatever, but people or players have worse luck than I have.\n\n\"Just being able to keep going is going to motivate the next guy that's watching you. And even if you're not playing, a sport is motivational. Is what I get from other people. So I'm gonna keep going.\"\n\nPeople not authorized to speak publicly on the matter told The Times last week that there was concern about Leonard's knee after Grant Hill, the managing director of Team USA; Steve Kerr, the coach of Team USA; and Lawrence Frank, the Clippers president of basketball operations, watched him workout at the Clippers' practice facility recently.\n\nKerr told The Times after practice Tuesday that Leonard has been \"up and down\" during the practices with Team USA.\n\n\"I thought the first day he was moving well early, not so much later and it makes perfect sense because he's coming off that injury,\" Kerr told The Times. \"The tricky part here is that you have an accelerated timeline for preparation. So, that's what we have to determine and he has to help us determine.

Clippers small forward Kawhi Leonard is quitting Team USA before the club even departs Las Vegas training camp and heads to Paris for the 2024 Olympics, report Shams Charania and Joe Vardon of The Athletic.\n\nPer Charania and Vardon, Boston Celtics All-Defensive guard Derrick White is considered a leader in the clubhouse to replace him on Team USA. White would add some perimeter defense to a starry, older team that could desperately use it. Were the reigning NBA champ to join, he'd be the third Boston player on the 12-man roster, along with All-NBA combo forward Jayson Tatum and All-Defensive guard Jrue Holiday.\n\nThe 33-year-old Leonard would have been playing in his first-ever Olympics.\n\nLeonard has had a busy 2024. In January, amidst one of his healthier seasons in a while, the 6-foot-7 two-time Finals MVP agreed to terms with the Clippers on a three-year, $153 million extension through the 2026-27 season. He missed postseason time due to health for the fourth consecutive season, appearing in just two games for L.A. in its first round matchup against the Dallas Mavericks. The underdog Mavericks would go on to beat the Clippers in six games, and would eventually advance all the way to the NBA Finals, where they would fall to the Celtics.\n\nDuring the offseason, failed contract negotiations would see Leonard's Clippers All-Star teammate Paul George jump ship, signing a maximum contract with the Philadelphia 76ers instead.\n\nHeading into the summer, questions abounded about just how available Leonard would be for Team USA, given that his knee had ultimately precluded him from finishing out the Dallas series.\n\nAs recently as this past weekend, Leonard claimed that the joint had recovered enough for him to be able to partake in the Olympics, on a loaded Team USA club that also boasts future first-ballot Hall of Famers LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis, Tatum, Joel Embiid, plus young All-Stars Bam Adebayo, Devin Booker, Anthony Edwards and Tyrese Haliburton. The 34-year-old Holiday, himself a two-time All-Star, six-time All-Defensive Player, and a starter on two different NBA championship teams, could be carving out a Hall of Fame career himself, though he is more of a fringe case in terms of his individual accolades.\n\n\"But I took the time, and I was able to turn around over the last two weeks,\" Leonard informed gathered media on Sunday, per Tim Bontemps of ESPN. \"So, I'm out here now and, yeah, I'm having a good time.\"\n\nLeonard acknowledged that health issues have been a major problem for his career ever since he reached an All-Star level while still with the San Antonio Spurs, where he won his first title and Finals MVP honor in 2014, in large part for his work locking down James on the Miami Heat. He was also twice named the Defensive Player of the Year with San Antonio. After forcing his way off the Spurs following a dispute over how the team handled an injury, Leonard won his second title and Finals MVP in 2019 on the Toronto Raptors, defeating Durant and Curry's Warriors in six games.\n\n\"Yeah, but this is just my journey, so whatever ... I can't lay out the perfect script for me,\" Leonard said. \"Last year, I tried to play as much as possible, felt great. And at a certain period of time I couldn't go. I tried the best that I could, but it's just my journey. I don't want to be in a situation that I do be in, but I got to take it for what it is. And a lot of people are watching, supporters or doubters, but I motivate a lot of people.\"\n\nFor its part, Team USA did not explicitly blame Leonard's knee injury for his decision to withdraw from competition this summer, when it released its own official press statement about the move.\n\n\"Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas,\" the statement declared. \"He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\"\n\nLast year, Leonard averaged 24.9 points on a .525/.417/.885 slash line, 6.4 rebounds, 3.8 assists, 1.7 steals and 0.9 blocks a night. He played in 68 regular season games, his most since the 2016-17 season, when he was still with the Spurs.\n\nWhite is not the offensive superstar Leonard may be, perhaps, but he could be a more helpful complimentary fit on this All-Star-laden roster, taking on tough defensive assignments while also serving as a supplemental ball handler and release valve three point shooter (he connected on 39.6 percent of his 6.8 triple tries a night last year).", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_kirschenbaum@newsweek.com", "name":

USA Basketball said it, along with the Clippers, made the decision on Leonard's status.\n\n\"Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas,\" USA Basketball said in a statement Wednesday. \"He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\"\n\nLeonard is a two-time NBA champion, six-time All-Star and six-time All-NBA player, but injury issues have been a recurring theme in his career.\n\nHe has missed 256 regular-season games over the last seven years, including all of the 2021-22 season with knee trouble. He appeared in 68 games this past season for the Clippers, his most since playing in 74 for San Antonio during the 2016-17 season.\n\n\"This is just my journey,\" Leonard said earlier this week, discussing his injuries. \"I can't lay out the perfect script for me. Last year I tried to play as much as possible, felt great and at a certain period of time I couldn't go. I tried the best that I could, but it's just my journey. I don't want to be in a situation that (I'm) in, but I've got to take it for what it is. And a lot of people are watching, supporters or doubters. But I motivate a lot of people, so I've got to keep doing what I'm doing.\"\n\nLeonard -- part of a 592-person Olympic team formally named by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee earlier Wednesday -- had said earlier this week that his knee was fine and he was able to resume on-court training about three weeks ago to get ready for the Games.\n\n\"I'm ready to go,\" Leonard said then. \"I'm playing now so, I'm happy.\"\n\nA couple of days later, hours before the first U.S. exhibition game against Canada and one day before the team departs for Abu Dhabi -- the first of two international stops for more games and practices before arriving in France for the Olympics -- Leonard was gone.\n\nThat leaves the U.S., at least for the very short term, with 10 available players. Kevin Durant will not play against Canada because of a calf strain and could not compete in the team's four-day training camp in Las Vegas that ended Tuesday.\n\nLeonard had been invited to be part of USA Basketball teams in the past and had to decline for various reasons, primarily injury issues or long playoff runs.\n\n\"I always wanted to play against other talent overseas or just other basketball styles and players,\" Leonard said. \"It is one of the reasons why I play the game.\"\n\nThe Opening Ceremony of the 2024 Paris Olympics will be held Friday, July 26.\n\nInstead of being held in a traditional stadium, the Opening Ceremony will take the form of a 4-mile-long floating procession down the Seine River.\n\nMike Tirico, Kelly Clarkson and Peyton Manning will serve as hosts of NBC's Opening Ceremony coverage. \"Today\" hosts Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb will also be part of the broadcast team.\n\nSeveral athletic events will be held before the Opening Ceremony.\n\nHandball, rugby and soccer matches are scheduled on Wednesday, July 24, and Thursday, July 25. Archery also gets an early start on July 25.\n\nAfter the Olympic cauldron is lit during the Opening Ceremony, there will be 16 more days of competition featuring about 10,500 athletes from more than 200 nations.\n\nEighty percent of competition venues are within 6.2 miles of the Olympic and Paralympic Village in Paris.\n\nThe Olympics will use historic locations throughout France for competition venues.\n\nSome of the venues include Eiffel Tower Stadium for beach volleyball, the Palace of Versailles for equestrian, Roland-Garros stadium for tennis, and the Grand Palais des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es for taekwondo and fencing.\n\nParis previously hosted the Olympics in 1900 and 1924, and will join London (1908, 1948 and 2012) as the only cities to host the Olympic Games three times.\n\nFor both Apple TV and Fire TV, search for \"9news\" to find the free app to add to your account.

However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\"\n\nLeonard, 33, missed the final eight games of the NBA regular season and most of the Clippers' first-round series against Dallas with what was described as chronic inflammation from multiple surgeries on his right knee. He's had two months off since the Clippers were eliminated, but the knee apparently has not responded like he had hoped.\n\nThere's also this: The Clippers just lost Paul George to free agency and they're opening the $2 billion Intuit Dome in Inglewood. Owner Steve Ballmer, no doubt, was not keen on risking further injury to the face of the franchise from a compressed Olympic tournament with six games in 14 days.\n\nLeonard missed the end of the 2021 playoffs after tearing his ACL, then the entire 2021-22 season, then appeared in only two playoff games in 2023 after tearing meniscus in the same knee. He played in 68 regular-season games last season, his most since 2016-17, then shut it down midway through the playoff series against the Mavericks.\n\nStill, a day earlier he spoke optimistically about the career-long \"dream\" of adding the interlocking rings to his legacy.\n\n\"Just competing with these guys,\" Leonard told media Tuesday about what he looked forward to most. \"Seeing the city of Paris, watching other Olympic Games (events) and rooting for USA.\"\n\nAsked about his knee, he said: \"Yeah, I think I'll suit up tomorrow (against Canada). Everything has been good so far.

However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\"\n\nThe 33-year-old forward has battled through various injuries over the past several years. He had played 60 games or fewer in four straight seasons before suiting up for 68 contests in 2023-24, but he missed the Clippers' final three playoff games due to right knee inflammation.\n\nLeonard, in speaking to reporters earlier this week at Team USA training camp, said that his injury had improved and he felt ready to represent the country in his first Olympics.\n\nAfter Leonard's withdrawal, Team USA has one spot to fill and not a lot of time to do it. The Americans will face Canada in an exhibition on Wednesday night in Las Vegas, with Kevin Durant already set to sit out due to a calf injury.\n\nTeam USA has subsequent tune-ups scheduled for July 15 (vs. Australia in Abu Dhabi), July 17 (vs. Serbia in Abu Dhabi), July 20 (vs. South Sudan in London) and July 22 (vs. Germany in London). The Olympics slate begins on July 28 against three-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokic and Serbia.\n\nThe Athletic's Shams Charania reported Wednesday that Boston Celtics guard Derrick White is considered a \"strong replacement candidate\" for Leonard. Despite playing different positions, the newly-crowned NBA champion is a similarly versatile defender.\n\nWhite, who played for Team USA at the 2019 World Cup, averaged a career-best 15.2 points per game for the Celtics last season. He increased his scoring average to 16.7 over 19 postseason games while shooting 40.4% from deep and making key defensive plays in several moments.", "source": {"uri": "nbcdfw.com", "dataType":

He averaged 15.2 points per game in the 2023-2024 regular season, with 4.2 rebounds, 5.2 assists, and 1.2 blocks.\n\nWhite then notched a career-best performance as his team marched to its 18th championship, racking up 16.7 points per game, 4.3 rebounds, 4.1 assists, and 1.2 blocks in the 2024 postseason.\n\nThe opening ceremonies for the 2024 Summer Olympics are scheduled for July 26.\n\nThe US Men's Basketball Team will play its first game on July 28 when it faces Serbia.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television.

Around the time of Wednesday's announcement, Brown shared a post on X featuring three emojis with magnifying glasses.\n\nThis year's U.S. roster features considerable star power, with LeBron James primed for his first Olympic appearance since 2012; Kevin Durant back for a fourth consecutive trip; and Steph Curry, Joel Embiid, Anthony Edwards and Tyrese Haliburton all set for their Olympic

It affected his playing time in the NBA playoffs and will now keep him out for the Olympics.\n\nAccording to ESPN's senior NBA writer Marc J. Spears, Leonard's replacement has already been decided.\n\nBoston Celtics guard Derrick White will officially be taking Leonard's spot on Team USA. White, the 6-foot-4 guard, will bring a similar defensive tenacity that Leonard has as he led all NBA guards in blocks by a wide margin.\n\nWhite joins his Boston Celtics teammates Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday on Team USA. The three recently won an NBA Title together, so the chemistry will already be there if the three take the court together.\n\nLeonard took part in the first few days of training camp with Team USA in Las Vegas. But the decision not to play should come as no surprise due to his lingering knee issues that have been problematic for a while.\n\nIn 2023-24, White averaged 15.2 points, 4.2 rebounds, 5.2 assists and 1.2 blocks per game. This will be his first run in the Olympics. He did play for Team USA in the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup, but failed to bring home a medal.\n\nRelated: NBA Fans Annoyed By Jayson Tatum Over Latest Kobe Bryant Comments\n\nRelated: A'ja Wilson Triggers Online Buzz After Latest Sighting With NBA All-Star", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_phelps@postandcourier.com", "name": "Chris Phelps", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jrue_Holiday", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jrue Holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIBA Basketball World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A'ja_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A'ja Wilson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/cc/ecc72096-c831-5c30-a548-ea83b6af97db/668eb887b0997.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721890", "eventUri": "eng-9721890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\"\n\nBoston Celtics guard Derrick White has been officially announced as the replacement for Leonard, which is something that had been reported as a possibility if the Clippers star was unable to play.\n\nShortly after this news was announced, White's teammate Jaylen Brown sent out a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) that many believe is a reaction to Team USA's decision.\n\nThe post has been going viral, as many believe Brown should have been chosen over his teammate White as the replacement for Leonard. The reigning Finals MVP, Brown can do a lot of different things on the court, and would have been a good fit for this roster. That said, White is also very versatile, and will help this group a lot.\n\nIt is certainly possible that Brown is not reacting to this news, as it would be strange to publicly question his teammate's spot on this roster, but many have interpreted it that way.\n\nRelated: Bronny James Goes Viral for Getting Ankles Broken in NBA Summer League Debut\n\nRelated: Leaked Footage of NBA Stars Fighting in Bar Goes Viral\n\nRelated: Steph Curry and Ayesha Curry Share Big Announcement From Sonya Curry", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USA Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonya_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sonya Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayesha_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayesha Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Summer_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Summer League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/b7/2b7d63ba-cbe2-5c8c-82a9-b3e3c8c3f528/668ec717e6347.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721890", "eventUri": "eng-9721890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

He replaced Kawhi Leonard, who withdrew from the team due to injury.\n\nWhite's addition meant Boston players now make up one-quarter of the star-studded 12-man squad, as fellow Celtics champions Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday both were selected to the initial Olympic roster.\n\nTatum is coming off three consecutive first-team All-NBA seasons and led the Celtics in points, rebounds and assists during their playoff run before signing the largest contract in NBA history (five years, $314 million) earlier this month.\n\nWhite and Holiday are ultra-versatile veterans who formed the league's best defensive backcourt this past season. Both also shot better than 40% from three during the postseason, ranking fourth and fifth among the 55 playoff participants who averaged at least 4.5 3-point attempts per game.\n\nWhite, who previously represented the U.S. at the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup, recently told the Herald he'd gladly accept an Olympic invite. While he might be the least flashy name on a roster loaded with All-Stars and future Hall of Famers, his unselfishness should make him a valuable depth piece for head coach Steve Kerr.\n\n\"Any chance you can play for your country and just try to win a gold medal, I think that would definitely be something that, if Kawhi (can't play) and they ask me, I'll definitely be looking forward to,\" White said.\n\nLeonard had been participating in Team USA's training camp in Las Vegas -- where it practiced against a select side featuring Celtics backup Payton Pritchard -- and wanted to play in Paris, according to a statement from USA Basketball. But both the federation and Leonard's team, the Los Angeles Clippers, preferred he sit out as he recovers from a lingering knee injury that sidelined him for four of LA's six playoff games.\n\n\"Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas,\" the statement read. \"He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\"\n\nThe U.S. is scheduled to play five exhibition games before departing for France, facing Canada in Vegas on Wednesday night, Australia and Serbia in Abu Dhabi next week, and then South Sudan and Germany in London.\n\nOlympic group play then opens with a game against Serbia on July 28, followed by matchups with South Sudan on July 31 and Puerto Rico on Aug. 3 before the knockout rounds begin. The men's gold and bronze medal games will be played on Saturday, Aug. 10 at Paris's Bercy Arena.\n\nThe Americans enter the Games as heavy favorites after winning gold each of the last four Summer Olympics and seven of the last eight.

Clippers front office officials were in attendance for the early workouts, and it's likely they influenced the decision for Leonard to withdraw.\n\n\"Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas. He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris,\" USA Basketball said in a statement.\n\nAll of this is heightened because of Leonard's injury history, but the visuals were just a small sample. Team USA assistant coach and Clippers head coach Ty Lue seemed to head things off by saying it was good for Leonard to get himself into playing shape by being on the team compared to doing it in training camp.\n\nBut that was just a misdirection, even after Leonard sounded optimistic following practice Tuesday, with an exhibition game against Canada looming Wednesday night in Las Vegas.\n\n\"Yeah, I think I will suit up tomorrow,\" Leonard said Tuesday. \"Everything has been good so far. It's been at a neutral state and hopefully it stays that way.\"\n\nApparently it wasn't, and he'll be replaced by Boston Celtics guard Derrick White, making it three Celtic members who played deep into June during their run to the NBA title. For Leonard, it appears to be yet another setback in a period full of them since becoming a Clipper in 2019.\n\nHe didn't finish the 2021 playoffs, suffering a torn ACL during the second round -- when the Clippers subsequently advanced to within two games of the NBA Finals. He missed the entire 2022 season, and after slow walking the 2022-23 season, he only played two games in the Clippers' first-round series against Phoenix.\n\nAnd this past season he was unable to complete the first-round series against the Dallas Mavericks after playing 68 games -- the most he's played since 2016-17, when he finished third in MVP voting.\n\nMiami's Bam Adebayo has been one of the most affable stars in the NBA, always accommodating, but even he can have rightful moments of frustration. He's made the All-Defensive Team every year since 2019-20, but hasn't won the top award -- finishing third this past year behind Rudy Gobert and rookie Victor Wembanyama.\n\nAntennas were raised when he shrugged off the possibility of going against the French duo in the Olympics, so he spoke about it after his media session with a small group of writers in Las Vegas on Sunday afternoon.\n\n\"I have to do all this and average 20, 10 and 5,\" he said to Yahoo Sports recently, muttering down the hallway at Las Vegas' Bellagio hotel.\n\n\"That's one thing that irks me, it's not my fault I'm versatile,\" Adebayo said. \"I've been top 5 in DPOY voting the last five years, there's been guys y'all (media) been giving it to over me.\"\n\nBecause the CBA stipulates individual awards can escalate contract values, had Adebayo won it one of these years, he would've been eligible for a greater contract extension than the three-year, $166 million deal he agreed to recently. If he'd waited and done a four-year deal, he would've netted over $100 million more.\n\nBut you get the feeling it's less about the money and more the recognition.\n\n\"A point guard (Marcus Smart) got it over me, a center (Rudy Gobert) got it over me, a power forward (Jaren Jackson Jr.) has gotten it over me,\" Adebayo told Yahoo Sports. \"The goalposts move for me, in certain degrees. It's me and a lot of undrafted dudes and we still have a top-five defense.\"\n\n\"These other guys have All-NBA dudes (around them). Some of it is, they don't really care about us and that's fine. I think they should pay attention to consistency because being top 5 DPOY, I think I have the longest streak of All-Defensive teams, so the goalposts move for me.\"\n\nOf those players, he's the only one with an offensive responsibility and is also a hub for offense.\n\nU.S. Olympic assistant coach Erik Spoelstra was amused when it was brought up.\n\n\"We're still talking about that? Good,\" the Miami Heat coach said somewhat sarcastically.\n\n\"It's all how you view it. There's a lot of factors that go into it. It's about having a great defensive team. It's about anchoring a great defense, making players around you better defensively and having extraordinary defensive talent. He checks all those boxes.\"\n\n\"But the argument, we're past that now.\"\n\nMaybe he is, but Adebayo is still unnerved by it -- and maybe plans on taking it out on the French when the time comes.",

After all, the US has put together one of its strongest rosters for international competition in years, and the gold medal seems to be theirs for the taking.\n\nHowever, a Wednesday morning news drop foiled Kawhi's involvement with the Olympic team, with Shams Charania announcing he would withdraw from the competition. According to the insider, Leonard's knee injury that caused him to miss most of the Clippers' first-round series with the Mavericks this year is the primary concern that led to him withdrawing.\n\nThis is an unfortunate development for fans that wanted to see the United States at full strength for the Olympics, but even worse news for Clippers fans. We are all aware of Kawhi's extensive injury history, and the prospect of him playing for the Olympic team this summer was always a bit of an eyebrow-raiser.\n\nAfter Leonard missed the Clippers' final eight regular season games as well as four out of the team's six playoff games against Dallas in the 2023-24 season, there were already very legitimate concerns about his long-term health. Kawhi has missed long stretches of time due to major injuries during his Clippers tenure, and has not finished a playoff series healthy since 2020.\n\nWith him once again exiting the season with his health in question this year, many doubted his ability to be involved with the Olympic team. So it came as a bit of a shock to many when he came forth as a full-time participant for the international competition.\n\nSome saw it as a sign that he had already healed from his knee ailment that kept him out of the playoffs in April and May, while others wondered whether putting more undue stress on his body in the offseason was truly a wise move. As it turns out, Kawhi was not yet ready to be back participating in the kind of hard-fought, high-intensity basketball that will be played at the Olympics.\n\nAs hard as it is to say, this has to raise questions about next season for Kawhi Leonard in the minds of Clippers fans. Based on what we know now, it is entirely possible that his training with Team USA set him back physically, which could very easily affect how healthy he is come October. The entire Clippers organization should be doing everything they can to ensure his health is protected between now and then.", "source": {"uri": "clipperholics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clipperholics"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_at_the_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States at the Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4222,h_2374,x_0,y_25/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/81/01j2en4e0aw0nc6zn0np.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721890", "eventUri": "eng-9721890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

The 2024 USA Basketball Men's National Team released a statement about the decision via a post on X:\n\n\"Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas. He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\"\n\nFresh off winning his first NBA championship, White's inclusion on the team would add a layer of toughness and do-it-all attitude that fits well on the International stage. While Leonard is considered an all-world defender, White is no slouch, having made the NBA All-Defensive Second Team both of the last two seasons.\n\nAt 6-foot-4, White is smaller than Leonard and conventional wisdom would say he might struggle with bigger matchups, especially on the interior. However, according to NBA.com/stats, that's just not the case. During the 2024 NBA Playoffs, White held opponents to 6.9% worse shooting on shots inside six feet. This was a carryover from the 2023-24 regular season, where White held opponents to 5.1% worse shooting from the same distance.\n\nThe ability to pass and space the floor is always important, as Olympic play tends to be more of a team-based attack as opposed to the one or two-man game that the NBA regularly employs. With that in mind, White is a fantastic fit. He's a very good outside shooter, making 39.6% of his 3-pointers last season, and is also a willing passer, at 5.2 assists per game.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that he spent the better part of five seasons playing for long-time USA Basketball coach Gregg Popovich.\n\nAs is tradition, Team USA will embark on an exhibition tour before the Olympics, starting with a matchup against Team Canada on July 10, 2024, in Las Vegas, Nevada. USA National Teams are 34-3 in pre-Olympic contests (h/t USAB.com).\n\nAlthough nobody in their right mind would choose this team over the famed Dream Team of 1992, this year's version has more accolades than any of the previous iterations. According to USAB.com, the 2024 team will feature five players that combined to win 13 NBA Championships (add one player and one title if White is the replacement).", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_dunlap@heavy.com", "name": "Michael Dunlap", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USA Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Defensive_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Defensive Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Popovich", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Popovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_basketball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national basketball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_men's_national_ice_hockey_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada men's national ice hockey team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2152533754-e1715604607169.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721890", "eventUri": "eng-9721890", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-07-", "textStart": 1915, "textEnd": 1922}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Leonard missed the last eight games of the 2023-24 regular season and played in just two of the Clippers' six playoff games. It's one of many injuries he has dealt with throughout his career.\n\nHere's a look at Leonard's injury history across his 12 NBA seasons.\n\nThe forward injures his ankle late in Game 5 of the Spurs vs. Rockets Western Conference Semifinals game.\n\nLeonard sits out Game 6, which the Spurs win to close out the series. He returns for Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals against the Warriors.\n\nMay 14, 2017: Leonard suffers a sprained ankle after landing on Zaza Pachulia's foot. The play is considered to be dirty and unsafe, and the NBA has since implemented rules to prevent this.\n\nThe Warriors sweep the Spurs with Leonard out for the series.\n\nSept. 30, 2017: The Spurs announce that Leonard will be out indefinitely and miss the entire preseason while rehabbing from right thigh tendinopathy.\n\nDec. 12, 2017: Leonard makes his season debut for the Spurs after missing 27 games with his thigh injury. He plays just 16 minutes and is eased back into the lineup over the next couple of games.\n\nLeonard takes multiple rest days during this stretch.\n\nJan. 13, 2018: Leonard plays his final game of the season, which turns out to be his final game in the Spurs uniform.\n\nThe Spurs medical staff clears the forward to play, but he gets a second opinion from personal doctors. It causes strife in the Spurs locker room as the team needs him to seriously compete for another title in the post-Tim Duncan era.\n\nJan. 17, 2018: Leonard is sidelined indefinitely, leading to a statement from Spurs general manager RC Buford.\n\n\"Kawhi has made significant progress and continues to move forward in his rehabilitation,\" Buford says. \"This is the best approach for the next steps in his return to play.\"\n\nJuly 18, 2018: The Spurs trade Leonard and Danny Green to the Raptors in exchange for DeMar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl and a protected first-round pick.\n\nThis is the end of the Leonard-Spurs saga, ending their seven-year partnership.\n\nJune 13, 2019: The Raptors win their first NBA championship in franchise history with Leonard. While the All-Star forward looks hobbled at times in the playoffs, he avoids major injuries and leads Toronto to the title.\n\nHe wins his second Finals MVP as the Raptors defeat the Warriors in six games.\n\nIt is rumored that Leonard won't stay in Toronto after the season.\n\nJuly 6, 2019: Leonard signs with the LA Clippers during the 2019 offseason, ending a quick but successful tenure with the Raptors.\n\nThe Clippers also trade for Paul George, teaming the two All-Star forwards up.\n\nMORE: How Raptors almost landed Kawhi Leonard and Paul George\n\nJune 14, 2021: Leonard partially tears his ACL in his right knee in Game 4 of the Western Conference Semifinals against the Jazz.\n\nLeonard had been injury-free for a couple of years due to the Raptors and Clippers using load management to his favor in the regular season. That changes in the postseason when he bumps into Joe Ingles on a fastbreak, leading to the injury.\n\nLeonard stays in the game but misses the remainder of the series and Western Conference Finals against the Suns.\n\nOct. 20, 2022: Leonard returns to the NBA after missing the entire 2021-22 season. He plays in 52 games in 2022-23 as the Clippers make the postseason again.\n\nApril 16, 2023: Leonard tears his right meniscus in Game 1 of the first round against the Suns. He plays through the injury in Game 2 but sits out the remainder of the series as LA is eliminated in five games.\n\nThis injury is to the same knee that he partially tore his ACL.\n\nMay 3, 2024: Leonard's season ends with a knee injury that sidelined him for the final eight games of the regular season and three of the five playoff games against the Mavericks. The Clippers keep him out with right knee inflammation.\n\nLeonard plays in 68 games during the 2023-24 season, his most since 2016-17.\n\nJuly 10, 2024: Team USA announces that Leonard is withdrawing from the team to focus on the upcoming regular season. He was expected to make his Olympics debut in Paris later in the month.\n\nLeonard has been \"battling chronic knee soreness and inflammation for months,\" The Athletic reports.", "source": {"uri":

Leonard is expected to be replaced by Boston's Derrick White.\n\nIt's an unsurprising decision considering Leonard's injury track record. He hasn't 70 games since the 2016-17 season and has battled ongoing injury issues since joining the Los Angeles Clippers in 2019 following Toronto's championship season.\n\nFor the United States, Leonard's loss shouldn't change much this summer. They'll enter the Olympics with a loaded roster featuring forwards LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Jayson Tatum who should all be able to make up for the loss of Leonard. The trio is joined by Bam Adebayo, Devin Booker, Steph Curry, Anthony Davis, Anthony Edwards, Joel Embiid, Tyrese Haliburton, and Jrue Holiday.\n\nCanada will take on the United States at 10:30 p.m. ET Wednesday night in an international friendly in Las Vegas ahead of the Olympics. The United States will then play friendlies against Australia, Serbia, South Sudan, and Germany before opening the Olympics later this month.\n\nThe United States will be in an Olympic group alongside Serbia, South Sudan, and Puerto Rico, where they'll enter as heavy favorites to win an Olympic gold.\n\nCanada upset the United States at the FIBA World Cup last summer to clinch a bronze medal in

The 33-year-old will opt out and prepare for his fifth season with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nLeonard finished the 2023-24 season with the Clippers, averaging 23.7 points and 6.1 rebounds per game. He played a total of 68 games, which is the most the two-time NBA Champion has played since the 2016-17 season with the San Antonio Spurs.\n\nThe reasoning behind Leonard's decision is unclear, but fans speculate that injuries are involved. He's been struggling with injuries, primarily knee injuries, for years having missed over 20 games in five of the last six seasons.\n\nNBA fans tend to agree on their reaction to Leonard's decision, with many explaining that it's \"Not a surprise.\"\n\n\"This dude can't stay healthy for more than a week. It's insane,\" said one fan.\n\nLeonard will be replaced by Boston Celtics guard and 2024 NBA champion Derrick White. The 6-foot-4 guard averaged 15.2 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 5.2 assists per game last season with the Celtics.\n\n\"Load managing the Olympics is crazyyy,\" said another fan.\n\nTeam USA will play against Team Canada July 10 at 10:30 p.m. ET for its first exhibition game of the summer.\n\nRelated: Kevin Durant's Opinion Of Cooper Flagg Is Unmistakably Clear\n\nRelated: Everyone Shares Same Zach Edey Opinion After NBA Summer League Debut", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_escarpio@postandcourier.com", "name": "Max Escarpio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Edey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Edey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Summer_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Summer League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_men's_national_ice_hockey_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada men's national ice hockey team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/65/465d69a5-d646-59dc-b9e0-14f4d34a5ea0/668eb887174d1.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721890", "eventUri": "eng-9721890", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 1208, "textEnd": 1215}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Unfortunately, Kawhi Leonard had to pull out of the competition recently, days after the practice sessions started on Saturday. After Kawhi's departure, fans were expecting players like Kyrie Irving, Damian Lillard, or Jaylen Brown to fill the empty spot. But to their surprise, 2024 NBA Champion Derrick White was announced as the replacement, which has now made fans lash out in frustration.\n\nKawhi's selection on the team was under scrutiny from the beginning because the Clippers star was reeling from an injury for some time. The two-time NBA Champion missed 12 of the last 14 games for the franchise due to a knee inflammation.\n\nHowever, as he joined the team, he was looking in great shape. \"Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas. He felt ready to compete,\" USA Basketball said in their official statement.\n\nThe decision for Kawhi to opt out of the competition was taken after assessing his injury and the amount of time he needs to recover. He was advised by the franchise and USA Basketball to use the offseason to nurse himself back to health. So, given the sudden turn of events, USA Basketball managing director Grant Hill said, \"I am happy to announce that Derrick will compete at his first Olympic Games on the heels of a championship season in Boston.\"\n\nEven though it's a moment of celebration for White, fans aren't particularly pleased by him replacing Kawhi as they believe that there are several players who deserve this spot. Among the many contenders for this position, one fan chose Paolo Banchero.\n\nAnother fan, in complete shock of this announcement, wrote, \"DERRICK WHITE OVER KYRIE OR DAME????????\"\n\nFans are fuming over White being picked to represent the nation in Paris. One fan said that he can name 10 players who are more worthy of this opportunity.\n\nJaylen Brown's name not being next in line has also surprised many.\n\nIn fact, Brown was also hoping that he will be called up by USA Basketball after Kawhi made a spot available on the roster. The Celtics star posted a cryptic message (monocle emojis) on his X profile.\n\nEven though the fans are annoyed with this selection, it's worth noting that White averaged 15.2 points and 5.2 assists for the Celtics in the last season.

Joel Embiid had knee troubles off and on all season and would be coming off of a playoff run, while Kawhi Leonard was unable to play for the Clippers in the playoffs and would have just a couple months to get ready for an extended summer run with Team USA.\n\nWhile Embiid seems to be ready to go for Paris, the unfortunately unsurprising news broke on Wednesday that Leonard was withdrawing from the team due to continued inflammation in his knee. In his place, USA Basketball turned to the champion Boston Celtics to add a third member from that title team to the roster, but instead of Finals MVP Jaylen Brown, they opted to bolster their point guard rotation with Derrick White.\n\nThat wasn't a shocker for many plugged into Team USA, but it was a bit of a surprise to those on the outside, including Brown himself who posted a bit of a cryptic and curious reaction on Twitter.\n\nLast year, Brown spoke about what playing for Team USA on the Olympic squad would mean to him, saying there's \"no greater honor\" than playing for USA Basketball at the Olympics.\n\nTeam USA certainly needed to bolster its defense, but Brown also played pretty tremendously on that end in the Finals -- his work on Luka Doncic was largely a reason he earned Finals MVP. The biggest thing might've been that White wouldn't be too worried about his minutes load, although it's possible he gets plenty of run, especially if Team USA decides they need more defense than someone like, say, Tyrese Haliburton can provide at the point of attack. In any case, Brown is understandably not happy with the snub and that it's his teammate that got the call makes the news all the more bittersweet.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USA Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Scenario", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jaylen.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721890", "eventUri": "eng-9721890", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Clippers superstar Kawhi Leonard is officially withdrawing from the Team USA roster before the 2024 Olympics in Paris.\n\nIt is a major blow for Team USA to lose Leonard, a two-time NBA Finals MVP and two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year. Leonard, also a six-time NBA All-Star, was going to provide valuable impact on both sides of the ball during the Olympics.\n\nLeonard had completed multiple practices (including a very competitive scrimmage against top 2025 NBA Draft prospect Cooper Flagg and the USA Men's Basketball Select Team) as training camp for the group recently began in Las Vegas.\n\nHowever, even before training camp started, Leonard's status was a question mark. During the 2024 NBA Finals, for example, Adrian Wojnarowski went on the record to say that there was already a frontrunner to replace him if he wasn't ready to go (via ESPN):\n\n\"I'm told Derrick White looms as a real potential candidate for Team USA in the Summer Olympics if Kawhi Leonard is unable to successfully rehab back from that knee inflammation that kept him out of the back end of the playoffs. You have seen White's two-way prowess on display throughout the season and then in the season.\"\n\nOnce news broke that Leonard was officially out of the competition, The Athletic's Shams Charania also reported that White was a \"strong candidate\" to replace him.\n\nLess than an hour later, Andscape's Marc J. Spears reported that the decision was official and that White would join the roster.\n\nOn first glance, White may not make sense as a one-to-one replacement for a player who is as accomplished as Leonard. White has never even made an All-Star team and is now going to play on one of the best basketball teams ever assembled.\n\nBut there are plenty of reasons why he is the correct guy for the job.\n\nAlready in the Pool\n\nThere were several players who did not initially receive invitations for Team USA. Some of those omissions included big names like Trae Young, LaMelo Ball, Zion Williamson, and Tyrese Maxey, and more.\n\nThose players were never going to receive the call that White did.\n\nSome in the player pool but did not make the roster included past All-Stars such as Damian Lillard, Chris Paul, James Harden, Kyrie Irving, Paul George, Jimmy Butler, Donovan Mitchell, Jaylen Brown, De'Aaron Fox, Brandon Ingram, Jaren Jackson Jr. and Jarrett Allen.\n\nOther names were Mikal Bridges, Paolo Banchero, Desmond Bane, Scottie Barnes, Jalen Brunson, Alex Caruso, Aaron Gordon, Josh Hart, Tyler Herro, Chet Holmgren, Cam Johnson, Walker Kessler, Bobby Portis, Austin Reaves, Duncan Robinson, and White.\n\nThe Right Style\n\nAmong the players in the player pool but not on the roster, Team USA would have wanted to find a defensive-first option to replace Leonard.\n\nThat eliminates offensive-oriented players such as Lillard, Paul, Harden, Irving, Fox, Brunson, Herro, and Robinson (among others as well). They also would likely want more of a perimeter defender which would cut names like Jackson, Allen, Banchero, Gordon, Holmgren, Kessler, and Portis.\n\nThat still leaves a few potential candidates, though not very many, and White stands out.\n\nPer dunksandthrees, the Boston guard finished 92nd percentile in Offensive Estimated Plus-Minues (oEPM) and 91st percentile in Defensive Estimated Plus-Minus (dEPM) last season.\n\nIt was the fourth season in a row he ranked in the 90th percentile or better in overall EPM. Yet he has accomplished all this while maintaining a low usage rate, which suggests he is able play well within his role next to ball-dominant teammates.\n\nWhite doesn't need the ball in his hands to make an impact and he can play in various different lineup styles. He also feels unlikely to complain if he has a smaller role or has minimal playing time, which may not be as true for some of the other players above.\n\nPrevious Experience\n\nWhite know what it takes to win at the highest level, especially coming off a title with the Celtics last season.\n\nHe also has previous experience playing for Team USA as well. The guard was on the roster for the senior national team during the 2019 FIBA World Cup, helping earn a berth in the subsequent Summer Olympics as one of the best finishers from the Americas.\n\nThe head coach for the squad was Gregg Popovich and one of the assistants was Steve Kerr, who is currently the head coach for Team USA in 2024. He played alongside his future teammate Jayson Tatum, who projects as one of the lead contributors for the current roster as well.\n\nSee the heartwarming moment Jayson Tatum and A'ja Wilson learned

They already have a pair of players representing the U.S. on the men's team, and that number could jump up to a total of three players.\n\nKawhi Leonard is withdrawing from the Paris Olympics, USA Basketball announced Wednesday. As Leonard's replacement, Derrick White is the \"leader\" to join the 12-man roster, per The Athletic. USA Basketball already features Jayson Tatum and Jrue Holiday, so White's addition would mean three members of the Celtics get to represent their country this summer.\n\nWhite being on the short list as a replacement should come as no surprise. He had his best season as a Celtic, showcasing why he's one of the best role players in the league. White doesn't necessarily need the ball in his hands to make an impact as his two-way play sticks out. White averaged 15.2 points, 4.2 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game for the Celtics, helping them to Banner No. 18. The guard was rewarded with a four-year extension this summer as the team locked him down long-term.\n\nUSA Basketball enters the Olympics as favorites to win the gold medal again. The roster is loaded this year with superstar names and multiple former MVPs suiting up, like Stephen Curry, LeBron James, Kevin Durant and more. Tatum and Holiday were also part of the squad that captured gold at the Tokyo Olympics, which was delayed to 2021 because of the pandemic.

Be sure to tune in to get more info on blockbuster headlines.\n\nPlease note, the latest news will always appear first.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs faithful might have been conflicted about rooting for Kawhi Leonard as he competed for Team USA this summer in Paris \u00e2\u20ac\" not to mention the internal struggle created by Victor Wembanyama playing for France \u00e2\u20ac\" but now, their worries were put to rest.\n\nLeonard is no longer participating in the 2024 Olympic Games, and in his place, former Spur Derrick White will suit up alongside his now-teammate, Jayson Tatum.\n\n\"Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas,\" Team USA wrote via an issued statement. \"He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\"\n\nAs Team USA chases another gold medal with its own version of the NBA All-Star game for a roster, Leonard will have to watch from the sidelines while White \u00e2\u20ac\" fresh off of an NBA title \u00e2\u20ac\" gets in on the action.\n\nSeems like there's no question how Spurs fans will feel seeing him in the Red, White & Blue.\n\nIt was expected entering the 2024 NBA Draft, but when it finally happened, it was still slightly unbelievable.\n\nAfter taking USC guard Bronny James with the No. 55 overall pick, the Los Angeles Lakers were primed to make history by rostering the only father-son duo in league history. And on Wednesday, that history was made. Both James' officially signed contracts with the Lakers to guarantee their spots on the team next season.\n\nLeBron signed a two-year $104 million extension to keep him on the team through the 2025-26 season \u00e2\u20ac\" simultaneously making him the first player in NBA history to eclipse $500 million in career contract earnings \u00e2\u20ac\" while Bronny agreed to a four-year deal paying him just under $8 million.\n\nThe older James' deal includes a no-trade clause and player option, while Bronny's is guaranteed through three years and comes with a team option in Year 4.\n\nAs much talk as there was surrounding that inevitable outcome, Bronny made clear that not only was he aware of it, but he's going to have to learn to \"get through it.\" And that they will.\n\nTogether.\n\n\"I've already seen it on social media and stuff,\" Bronny said. \"Talking about that I might not deserve an opportunity. But I've been dealing with stuff like this my whole life, so it's nothing different.\"\n\n\"Rob has told me that there's a great development system here, so I just want to come in and get my work in and get better every day,\" he added. \"I never really had a thought of me going to play with my dad. But that's always there to take part of.\"\n\nAfter the writing was seemingly on the wall that Golden State Warriors star Klay Thompson would be leaving his former team for the Los Angeles Lakers in free agency, the 34-year-old gave the league a shocking twist.\n\nNext season, Thompson will be a Dallas Maverick, joining Luka Don\u00c4i\u00c4\u2021 and Kyrie Irving in pursuit of an NBA title on a three-year, $50 million deal as part of a sign-and-trade deal with the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nThompson and the Warriors parted ways after 13 seasons, officially ending a dynasty that Steve Kerr built around him and Steph Curry. Now, the sharpshooter will look for a fresh start \u00e2\u20ac\" and some postseason redemption \u00e2\u20ac\" in Dallas.\n\nReportedly, the Los Angeles Lakers offered Thompson a four-year, $80 million deal that superstar LeBron James was willing to take a pay cut for his team to afford, but ultimately, the higher promise of a title with the Mavericks and a difference in state taxes between California and Texas swayed him.\n\nNow, he's set to help Dallas get back to the NBA Finals, where he can add a fifth ring to his resume.\n\nThe LA Clippers are certainly going to look a little bit different next season.\n\nAfter being informed that the star they moved mountains for five years ago, Paul George, would not be returning to the team next season, they began to work on finding replacements. Since his decision, the Clippers inked James Harden to a new two-year, $70 million deal to keep him paired with Kawhi Leonard and added both Derrick Jones Jr. and Kevin Porter Jr.\n\nMeanwhile in the Eastern Conference, the Philadelphia 76ers will also look different. They were the frontrunners to land George, and early Monday morning they made it official, landing the disgruntled Clippers star on a 4-year, $212 million deal to form a new Big 3 between him, Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey.\n\nEarlier this offseason, George addressed the state of the Spurs, stating that they were in need of a point guard who could \"unlock\" Victor Wembanyama's full potential. Sunday evening, San Antonio signed Chris Paul to a one-year, $11+ million deal, seemingly unlocking the potential George had mentioned.\n\nNow, the small forward will look to do same with Embiid, hopefully providing the piece that Philadelphia has been looking for in order to move past the second round and into championship contention.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAnother dimension to Jalen Brunson's Olympic snub was added on Wednesday.\n\nThe New York Knicks' superstar guard was passed over by Team USA in favor of Boston Celtics guard Derrick White, who will replace the injured Kawhi Leonard for the 2024 Summer Games in Paris beginning later this month.\n\nLeonard suffered a knee injury that kept him out of the Los Angeles Clippers' first-round playoff series against the Dallas Mavericks. While he was in attendance at Team USA's camp and recently brushed off injury concerns, the Clippers deemed that \"it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\"\n\nWhen it comes to offensive production, Brunson holds the clear edge over White. Boston's guard averaged 15.2 points with 4.2 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game during the Celtics' championship-winning campaign. Brunson catapulted to superstar status, though, posting a career-high 28.7 points per game to go with 6.7 assists.\n\nTeam USA, obviously, is not short on offensive firepower. This is a roster that already boasts Stephen Curry, Kevin Durant, Anthony Edwards, LeBron James, and Jayson Tatum. It is White's defensive acumen that likely got him the nod for the Olympics.\n\nThe 30-year-old has garnered second-team All-NBA-Defensive team honors for two straight seasons. His defensive rating of 109.9 ranked 13th among players who averaged more than 30 minutes per game this season. At 112.6, Brunson ranked 40th.", "source": {"uri": "amny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "amNewYork"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_pantorno@amny.com", "name": "Joe Pantorno", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.amny.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-05-20T031228Z_817303303_MT1USATODAY23326819_RTRMADP_3_NBA-PLAYOFFS-INDIANA-PACERS-AT-NEW-YORK-KNICKS.jpg?w=1200&p=q", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721890", "eventUri": "eng-9721890", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-05-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

And now, suddenly, he's out, with the sole statement thus far coming from the federation:\n\n\"Kawhi has been ramping up for the Olympics over the past several weeks and had a few strong practices in Las Vegas. He felt ready to compete. However, he respects that USA Basketball and the Clippers determined it's in his best interest to spend the remainder of the summer preparing for the upcoming season rather than participating in the Olympic Games in Paris.\"\n\nMy second thought, while digesting this story: If Kawhi is potentially this fragile that international play poses such a risk, what does that say about the new contract he just signed with the Clippers?\n\nMirjam, you've been around that organization long enough to have a pretty good sense of what's going on. So ... what's going on?\n\nMirjam Swanson: I suppose the nation is getting a taste of what it is to be a Clippers fan.\n\nThe prospect of Kawhi on any team is worth including him. I've seen Kawhi in Terminator mode, when there's no stopping him. When he's just an efficient, clinical, steamrolling monster. Everyone wants to experience that again - including Kawhi. It's pretty clear that he WANTS to play. He wanted to play in the playoffs. He wanted to play in the Olympics. But his health - about which he's been so guarded for so long - simply precludes him from doing it more and more often.\n\nIt's just a bummer.\n\nAnd because he's so private about his health, there's no way for medical experts to weigh in and explain to us what he's likely dealing with - so now we have what we had this morning, which is a ton of handwringing and second-guessing and finger-pointing in every possible direction. Who was lying about what and when and why and now what and whatnot?\n\nBut it's probably pretty simple: He's not healthy enough to go. I don't think there's a conspiracy. I don't think the Clippers dangled it in front of him for all these weeks and then pulled it back right when camp started.\n\nIt's just another gut punch, because the Fun Guy would rather be out there having fun hooping than rehabbing and resting and hoping his knee will cooperate. But that's not anyone's fault. It's just life. It's just sad.\n\nI know some Clippers fans were miffed that he'd play in the Olympics after sitting out most of their first-round playoff series against the Mavericks, but I always saw it as a positive thing: That means he was hurt but he's recovered. Now we know he's not healthy enough for Olympic competition. That should be more concerning for Clippers fans - not that he wanted to give it a shot in the first place.\n\nWhat it means for the team going forward? We'll see how cooperative his knee is when the season begins, I guess. But by now, Clippers fans know what the rest of the nation learned today - not to hold their breath.\n\nJim: Meanwhile, while you were composing all of that, the email tumbled into the inbox - the James Harden signing is now official. A busy morning for the Clippers, even though the Harden signing, reported at $70 million for two years, was basically done a week ago but couldn't be immediately announced.\n\nAnd I'm beginning to think that the NBA has replaced the NFL as the closest thing America has to a 365-day (or 366, in this case) sports obsession. It's been an organic process, but consider: Regular season, playoffs, Finals, draft, free agency, summer league, and in this case the Olympics, lather, rinse, repeat ... and late August and September will provide enough gossip and speculation for ESPN's NBA Today, the social media pundits and our friend Marc Stein's Substack newsletter.\n\nWhich brings me to my next subject. There was a suggestion the other day on the Awful Announcing website summed up with this heading: \"Is Bronny James ESPN's new Tim Tebow, where celebrity coverage dramatically exceeds on-field impact?\"\n\nI guess it's a natural inclination, and it shouldn't have been surprising that Bronny's first appearance in summer league (and his first \"DNP-Injury\" in Game 2 because of swelling in his knee) drew so much attention. Yes, he's the No. 55 pick in the draft, but he's also LeBron's kid. Yes, he's nowhere near ready for the NBA after one fits-and-starts season at USC, but he's also LeBron's kid. You get where I'm going with this.\n\nThe point: Did Rich Paul, the agent, do Bronny a disservice by manipulating things to make sure he went to the Lakers? I'm not suggesting that all of this (to date unwarranted) attention is going to hurt his development, but it's a distraction that at this point does little more than feed the \"engagement farming\" industry. (And now I am to understand that was a thing even before JJ Redick mentioned it at his introductory news conference. Boy, am I out of it!)\n\nMirjam: \"Organic\" in that a certain network leveraged and pumped up interest in transactional, fantasy part of the sport to drive interest and spur debate? It's felt for years now that the general public cares more about the drama and rumors than the basketball, which ... is what it is, I guess. There's no putting the genie back.\n\nAs for Bronny? Yes, there's way more attention focused on this guy than is warranted for sure, but we all understand why.\n\nIs that a disservice? I don't know, a 6-foot-4 player who returned from a health scare to average 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists in fewer than 20 minutes per game during his one season at USC just got a $7.9 million contract to play for the Lakers.\n\nIs it all sorts of intriguing, the idea of one of the game's all-time greats playing with his son? Yes. Is there going to be a ton of pressure and scrutiny? Uh-huh. Will it be weird to play with your dad? With your dad who might be the greatest player of all time? Could be. Could it be great? Could LeBron teach him things first-hand that Bronny couldn't learn from someone else somewhere else? Possibly that too.\n\nWill it be hard for Bronny? Maybe, but that's the job. If he didn't want the gig, he could've become a video game developer. But he's here, let's see - and we're all watching - what he's got.\n\nJim: I will say this: A four-year, $7.9 million contract, with a good bit of guaranteed money for a second-round pick, blows a hole in the whole \"stay in school\" argument. And his attitude about the commotion seems more grounded than those of us observing from afar. He's there to work and to learn, and the rest doesn't matter. Good for him.\n\nToday's last subject? The incredible shrinking Dodgers pitching staff. When they put Tyler Glasnow on the injured list Tuesday with, um, tightness in his back, it seemed little more than a device to give him a few extra days off. But consider: After Bobby Miller was knocked around again by the Phillies on Tuesday night, the starters' ERA since Gavin Stone's complete-game shutout against the White Sox two weeks ago ballooned to 9.20 in 10 games, six of which the Dodgers have lost.\n\nAnd as of this moment, the rotation is Stone (tonight's pitcher in Philly), Landon Knack, James Paxton, Justin Wrobleski and ... I guess Sunday's start in Detroit, the last game before the All-Star break, is either a bullpen game or an opportunity for another Triple-A or Double-A pitcher. The Dodgers have used 30 pitchers already this season, including Kik\u00e9 Hernandez in one of those let's-get-this-over-with position player appearances. Meanwhile, Glasnow, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Walker Buehler, Clayton Kershaw, and Dustin May are all on the injured list, and those are just the pitchers.\n\nLook at it this way: The Dodgers' B team still has a 7\u00bd-game lead in the division. The positive: Just imagine when all the regulars are back. The negative: Will they still have a lead in the division when Betts, Muncy, Kershaw, etc. do return, or are the Padres or Diamondbacks (or both) about to wake up and make a race out of it?\n\nGee, maybe they can re-acquire Tyler Anderson. I'm sure the Angels are listening to all offers for their All-Star pitcher. (Then again, USA Today baseball columnist Bob Nightengale reported the other day that the Angels likely will hang on to Anderson.)\n\nMirjam: All those pitchers and it appears they need more pitching. Appears they're going to need it if they intend to get where they're trying to go, if they're going to do what they invested so immensely in.\n\nBut like you point out: The hits just keep coming. And even though the B Team is doing OK, playing catchup so regularly isn't a recipe for success long term.\n\nNot with stretches like this recent 10-game spell, in which Dodgers starters have allowed 45 runs in 44 innings, and 51 hits and 12 home runs in that span too, as our Dodgers writer Bill Plunkett pointed out in Tuesday's game story, chronicling the Dodgers' sixth loss in 10 games.\n\nHow do the Dodgers' shore up their rotation? The top options - potentially guys like, say, the Chicago White Sox's Garrett Crochet and Erick Fedde, or the Detroit Tigers' Jack Flaherty - will come at a steep price.", "source": {"uri":

The last thing a player -- or their incumbent team -- wants is to jeopardize a full season by risking an untimely injury or reaggravation of the knee. For the Clippers, who can likely sense their championship window closing, they simply have to maximize every opportunity.\n\nGrant Hill, managing director of the USA Men's national team, issued a personal statement on Leonard withdrawing from competition.\n\n\"I want to thank Kawhi for his commitment to the USA Men's National Team,\" Hill said. \"He earned the opportunity to represent the United States, but USA Basketball and Clippers leadership felt it's important to allow Kawhi to prepare for the NBA season.\"\n\nLeonard was participating in most of the contact drills and scrimmages, and he was expected to be available for Team USA's first exhibition game on Wednesday against Canada.\n\nIt didn't take long to fill his spot.\n\nBoston Celtics guard Derrick White was immediately announced as Leonard's replacement. White, fresh off the best season of his career and a championship run, will become one of USA's utility guys off the bench.\n\nThe selection shouldn't be a surprise. White was rumored to be the choice weeks ago when Leonard was forced to miss the final three games of the Clippers' first round series against Dallas.\n\nNevertheless, most of the reaction on social media was negative, with fans wondering why the replacement wasn't another All-NBA level star or high-profile scorer.\n\nBut the reality is, White fills an important role the coaching staff is looking for. Team USA is already stacked with elite scoring talent and players that can easily generate their own shot.\n\nThey are loaded with pick-and-roll creators, dynamic finishers around the basket, and veterans that are overqualified to be second-side scorers when the defense collapses on the first action.\n\nPlus, let's face it -- USA is already heavily favored to win the gold medal. Even if Leonard didn't have a replacement, their talent advantage over the field would still be severe and undeniable.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with welcoming an intelligent, feisty defender that hustles on every possession while also being a 40-plus percent knockdown shooter on spot-ups.\n\nWhite is also a low-maintenance wing that is never concerned about his shot volume or the number of touches he receives -- which is also right up Steve Kerr's alley. He'll be a fantastic plug-and-play option in virtually any lineup USA wants to experiment with. And if his playing time is cut short or non-existent, he's not the type to complain.\n\nAs for Leonard, the Clippers' franchise star now has 11 weeks to rest and completely heal before NBA training camps begin. Assuming he doesn't need surgery this summer, Leonard could certainly use the extra time off to recover for the 2024-25 regular season. He and the Clippers understand they have virtually no margin for error after Paul George's departure in free agency.\n\nLeonard was on the court more frequently last season, playing the most games (68) and minutes (2,330) since his San Antonio days in 2017. It resulted in the most efficient year of his career and, ultimately, an All-NBA Second Team selection.\n\nAll signs pointed to a healthy season until April 1 when Leonard was shut down by the Clippers due to right knee inflammation. He was out for three full weeks before returning for Game 2 of the postseason, but never looked explosive or ready for the speed and intensity that playoff action demands.\n\nThe Clippers are hoping an extended break will have him ready to go in October as Leonard's three-year, $150 million contract kicks in.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grant Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "USA Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pick and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/668ee25e8f60116734c20bb3/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1797,1012,x0,y32,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721890", "eventUri": "eng-9721890", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-01", "textStart": 3746, "textEnd": 3753}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 458347628, "relevance": 2}

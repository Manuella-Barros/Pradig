His sister Hideko, now 91, has tirelessly pleaded for a review of the case.\n\nA district court in Shizuoka granted a retrial in 2014 after a prolonged battle and issued a stay for Hakamada's incarceration and the death penalty.\n\nTokyo's High Court overturned the lower court ruling four years later.\n\nBut the legal back-and-forth wasn't over: in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that the Tokyo High Court must reconsider its decision and the High Court ordered a retrial last year.\n\nHakamada's plight has attracted deep public sympathy, with even national lawmakers forming a special group to offer their support.\n\nHideko took the central role in her sickly brother's defence during the retrial.\n\nOne key piece of evidence used to convict Hakamada was a set of blood-stained clothes that emerged more than a year after the crime.\n\nSupporters say the clothes did not fit him and the bloodstains were too vivid given the time that had elapsed.\n\nJust nine percent of Japanese people were in favour of abolishing the death penalty in a 2019 government survey.\n\nDeath sentences are always carried out by hanging in Japan.

He was arrested in 1966 for allegedly killing the firm's senior managing director, his wife and two of their children. All four were found stabbed to death at their burned-down Shizuoka Prefecture home.\n\nHis retrial began in October after the Tokyo High Court reversed course and ordered the district court to retry him in March 2023, citing the unreliability of the main evidence used.\n\nThe high court said there was a strong possibility the five pieces of blood-stained clothing that Hakamata was alleged to have worn during the incident had been planted by investigators in the tank of miso soybean paste they were found in.\n\nIn their closing statements, prosecutors said the clothes belonged to Hakamata, who was working as a live-in employee at the miso shop. The high court's claim that the prosecution fabricated the evidence has \"no reasonable grounds,\" they said.\n\nA bereaved family member of the victims said in a statement read out by prosecutors on Wednesday, \"I want the truth will be revealed. I hope the fact that four precious lives have been claimed is not forgotten.\"\n\nThe prosecutors' decision to argue for Hakamata's conviction in the retrial angered the defense team, who had called for a swift acquittal in light of his advanced age.\n\nHakamata was exempted from attending the retrial proceedings due to his deteriorated mental state after having been incarcerated for such a long period.\n\nHakamata initially confessed to the killings during intense interrogation but pleaded not guilty at his trial, where he was indicted for murder, robbery and arson. His death sentence was finalized in 1980.\n\nIt is the fifth time in postwar Japan that a retrial has been finalized for a case in which the death penalty had been given.

The actress-musician, 35, is behind the hit musical Suffs, which is up for six Tony Awards after opening on Broadway in April. The women\u2019s suffrage movement musical \u2014 produced by Hillary Clinton and Malala Yousafzai \u2014 was 10 years in the making, largely because Taub had to do her research. \u201cThe idea was brought to me by Rachel Sussman \u2014 one of our lead producers \u2014 [in 2014] and when she asked me what I knew about American women\u2019s suffrage, I realized I knew nothing,\u201d Taub tells PEOPLE. After some reading and research (including a month-long research fellowship at the Schlesinger Library in Cambridge to study the topic), Taub learned just how much she identified with the suffragists. \u201cIt was just a group of driven, hardworking, type-A, organized, stubborn young women who were all really close friends and loved the challenge and found their sense of joy in working together towards a hard goal,\u201d the actress says. She adds, \u201cI recognized myself and my friends in them.\u201d Taub, who plays Alice Paul in the musical, caught the \u201ctheater bug\u201d early on in her life. \u201cI grew up in Waitsfield, Vermont, which is a town of 2,000 people in the Green Mountains, down a dirt road. There\u2019s a great community theater scene \u2014 my mom would drive my sister and me to rehearsal, and I just always loved it,\u201d she says. \u201cThe area has such a rich culture of appreciating the arts.\u201d Suffs, which Taub summarizes as \u201ca group of women getting s--- done and having a good time while doing it,\u201d features songs written both on the piano and, in Taub fashion, the accordion. \u201cTen years ago I was in a show called Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812, and for the role I had to play the accordion,\u201d she says. \"I had to take a one-month crash course and I just fell in love with it. I found it so freeing. I think there's a twisted dark humor the accordion brought out in me in my songwriting, while the piano brings out my emotional side.\u201d Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. When asked her advice for other musicians and artists hoping to make it to Broadway, Taub says simply: \u201cFind your community of friends.\u201d She elaborates, \u201cI just feel like that is part of what's helped me get through, I mean, my whole career, but especially all of writing Suffs, is just having those fellow artist friends that support one another. The artist Brian Eno has a term that I love and that I say all the time, which is scenius \u2014 the genius of the scene. It\u2019s about a whole community and ecology of talent that supports each other. That\u2019s why Suffs is an ensemble show.\u201d With the Tony Awards right around the corner \u2014 and Suffs nominated for six, including best musical and best original score \u2014 Taub can\u2019t help but be grateful for making it this far. \u201cJust making it to Broadway, let alone having a show of my own, is so beyond my wildest dreams,\u201d Taub says. \u201cAnd then to be recognized by the Tonys... I mean, I grew up as a theater kid who would kind of watch the Tonys with stars in my eyes. It is more than I could have ever imagined.\u201d", "summary": "The Broadway musical is nominated for six Tony Awards, including best musical and best original score", "url": "https://people.com/suffs-creator-shaina-taub-musical-about-women-getting-stuff-done-exclusive-8660161", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/6ROtQs-s7PGAMHIUrvpXLCQaBgQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(773x238:775x240)/shaina-taub-suffs-new-york-041824-f63994a157134be19e664a5eb9caada1.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:50:00", "author": "Lizzie Hyman", "authors": ["Lizzie Hyman"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.44}

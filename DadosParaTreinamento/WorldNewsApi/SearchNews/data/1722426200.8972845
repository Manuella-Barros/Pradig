Thieves broke into her 2018 Volkswagen Golf and took the bumper and other parts after she parked in Camden Street in the Jewellery Quarter in March. The 28-year-old driver, who would be named only by her first name of Gurdeep, said police closed her case due to lack of CCTV. She now pays between \u00a3150 to \u00a3200 for a secure parking spot at a location she would not name. Gurdeep, who works as an NHS psychologist, said she had seen around half-a-dozen vehicles targeted on the same road. Birmingham Live journalist Harry Leach, who also lives in the area, recently wrote that the sight of stripped cars was so common \"it's unusual if I don't see shards of glass in the roadside below a car missing its headlights, bonnet and bumper\". He went on: \"Residents who live in Camden Street and Pope Street have for years urged police to take action on this epidemic. \"But I know, as I am one of those residents, that nothing has improved. Car thieves are routinely causing havoc only feet away from our living rooms. In truth, it happens so often - and seemingly without any repercussion or consequence - that I genuinely believe they're laughing at us.\" Gurdeep, who lives with her partner, said: \"In the last six months, I've seen five cars broken into. I've seen new glass shattered on the ground but the cars had been taken away. \"I've seen two which were stripped of parts also on Camden Street on the very end. I had a couple of people contact me through social media saying it had happened to them, it's really common.\" \"Our building doesn't come with parking so I'm paying a monthly fee for a car space. It varies between \u00a3150 to \u00a3200 for a secure space. \"I don't leave my car on the street. I would say buy somewhere with a secure space,\" she added. Following a recent chop shop raid, Pc Joseph Gigli, of West Midlands Police, said: \u201cVehicle crime is a force priority for us. We're committed to disrupting it in our areas and bringing offenders who play a part in it to justice.\u201d", "summary": "She resorted to paying for a secure bay at an undisclosed location after her Volkswagen Golf was stripped earlier this year", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/jewellery-quarter-car-cannibal-victim-29417521", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29417534.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Gurdeeps-stripped-car.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:30:00", "author": "birminghammail.co.uk", "authors": ["birminghammail.co.uk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.627}

He published Economics In One Lesson in 1946. The bet here is that if around today, he would begin his most important book the same way. Nvidia shows why. Consider that the Santa Clara-based company nearly went under in the 1990s. As Ben Cohen wrote in the Wall Street Journal, Nvidia\u2019s \u201cfirst chip was a flop. Its next chip was doomed to fail.\u201d He adds that founder Jensen Huang knew the failures amounted to \u201can existential moment for his nascent company.\u201d This is notable simply because Nvidia nearly died in a stretch of \u201ceasy money\u201d according to economists and pundits. Supposedly the Fed can decree \u201ceasy money\u201d just by fiddling with the Fed funds rate. We know this because economists and pundits have claimed more recently that from 2009 to 2022, credit was \u201ccostless.\u201d Evidently Huang and Nvidia didn\u2019t the get the memo. Neither did Elon Musk as evidenced by the myriad times throughout the 1990s, early 2000s, and 2010s when his various entrepreneurial ventures were on the doorstep of bankruptcy. To this day, Nvidia keeps a sign warning \u201cOur company is thirty days from going out of business\u201d not because money is ever easy, but precisely because it\u2019s always incredibly difficult to access. Entrepreneurs and businesses are routinely in need of capital, but the immense power of compound returns makes accession of the capital incredibly difficult. Nvidia is yet another piece of evidence that \u201ceasy money\u201d is the stuff of economists and theories that are rather distant from reality. Economists also believe near-monolithically that government spending powers growth. Don\u2019t you know, GDP rises the more that government spends? More fallacy. See Nvidia again. Amid the company\u2019s chip failures, \u201cNvidia was running out of money.\u201d Stop and think about that while contemplating the trillions our federal government will spend in 2024, but also the trillions it\u2019s spent over the decades. How many promising businesses have died over those same decades thanks to politicians arrogating to themselves so much of the wealth that is always and everywhere produced in the private sector? The unseen of government spending is staggering. Think countless cancer cures, private jets affordable to the masses, think the Nvidias of the world who didn\u2019t happen upon a rich benefactor and corporation. Oh yes, in Cohen\u2019s latest column about Nvidia, he writes that when Nvidia was running out of money Huang \u201casked one of the top executives at the videogame giant Sega for a $5 million lifeline to keep his company afloat.\u201d Thank goodness Shoichiro Irimajiri came through. Yes, a rich man saved Nvidia. This is crucial. To see why, consider the lefty Keynesians who decry \u201ctax cuts for the rich\u201d or \u201ctax breaks for big corporations.\u201d Not only do they disdain lower rates for rich people and the businesses they form or are part of, they claim there\u2019s no \u201cstimulus\u201d because the rich will be less likely to consume the fruits of their tax cuts. And before Republicans nod their heads about the foolishness of lefty Keynesians, check out the defenses of the much-vaunted \u201cTrump tax cuts\u201d that, by the admission of alleged supply-siders, didn\u2019t reduce tax rates for the rich. No, they didn\u2019t. They raised them. Corporations endured higher taxes amid lower headline rates too.

Yes, the rich. Yes, corporations. Republicans and Democrats might choose reason over politics one of these days and seriously reduce taxes levied on the rich, along with the companies they work for or create. Nvidia instructs. Ultimately Sega directed $5 million to Nvidia, and the near-death company had a lifeline that would keep it afloat for another six months. Think about that. Six months to figure out a way to survive. Nvidia ultimately survived, but as evidenced by the company\u2019s soaring valuation over the past two years (amid rate hikes from the Fed that economists claim against all evidence depress stocks), money never became \u201ceasy\u201d for Nvidia after Shoichiro Irimajiri kept it afloat in the 1990s. Though great for the economy, Nvidia\u2019s success embarrasses an economics profession drowning in theories that its unlikely ascent thoroughly reject. Follow me on Twitter.

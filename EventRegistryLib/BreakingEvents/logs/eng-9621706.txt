According to reports, the alleged sports betting occurred last year while Marcano was on the injured list after sustaining a season-ending ACL injury in July.\n\nOn Tuesday, MLB officials said their investigation found Marcano had placed 387 baseball bets, including 231 MLB-related wagers between Oct. 16, 2022, and Nov. 1, 2023. All wagers totaled over $150,000.\n\nAt the time, the infielder was with the Pittsburgh Pirates.

He has spent much of the season on the injured list.\n\nOf the bets he placed, MLB officials said 25 were wagers on Pirates games while he was injured, but still on the team's roster.

MLB emphasizes the importance of upholding the integrity of the sport, noting no game outcomes were affected by Marcano's bets.\n\nSan Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano received a lifetime ban from Major League Baseball for placing hundreds of bets on baseball, including games involving the Pittsburgh Pirates last season when he was a member of the team, MLB said on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to MLB, Marcano did not appear in any of the games on which he placed bets as his Pirates-related wagers occurred after he suffered a season-ending knee injury last July. \"The strict enforcement of Major League Baseball's rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans,\" MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement.\n\n\"The longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century. \"We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people.\"\n\nAccording to data obtained from a legal sports betting operator, MLB concluded that Marcano placed 387 baseball bets, including 231 MLB-related wagers from Oct. 16-23, 2022 and from July 12, 2023 through Nov. 1, 2023. In total, MLB said the 24-year-old Marcano bet more than $150,000 on baseball, with $87,319 of that on MLB-related bets.\n\nMLB also said there is no evidence to suggest -- and Marcano denies -- that any outcomes in the baseball games on which he placed bets were compromised, influenced, or manipulated in any way. Marcano first signed with San Diego as an amateur out of Venezuela in 2016 and made his MLB debut in 2021, appearing in 25 games for the club that season before being traded in July of that year to the Pirates.\n\nMarcano had surgery to repair a torn right anterior cruciate ligament that he sustained last July when he awkwardly stepped on third base during a game. The Padres selected Marcano off waivers last November but he had not played for the team since being acquired.\n\nOakland Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly was also suspended one year for betting on MLB games while he was playing in the minor leagues. In addition, MLB said minor league players Jay Groome (Padres pitcher), Jose Rodriguez (Philadelphia Phillies infielder) and Andrew Saalfrank (Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher) were each banned one year for betting on MLB games.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucupita_Marcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tucupita Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Manfred", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Manfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner_of_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commissioner of Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_transactions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball transactions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amateur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/16_01_2019_13_01_16_4088895.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621706", "eventUri": "eng-9621706", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-16", "textStart": 1522, "textEnd": 1529}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-07-", "textStart": 1548, "textEnd": 1555}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

Pete Rose was retired when he agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989.\n\nMarcano, 24, has not played since tearing his right ACL last July 24. He was claimed by the Padres off waivers on Nov. 2 and placed on the 10-day injured list March 19.\n\nMLB's investigation was first reported Monday by The Wall Street Journal, which also reported four other players were under investigation for betting on baseball while in the minor leagues.\n\n\"We are aware of an active investigation by Major League Baseball regarding a matter that occurred when the player in question was a member of another organization and not affiliated with the San Diego Padres,\" the team said in a statement. \"We will not have any further comment until the investigative process has been completed.\"\n\n\"We are aware of the matter that's under investigation and are fully cooperating,\" Pirates senior vice president of communications Brian Warecki said in a statement. \"We will refrain from further comment at this time.\"\n\nMarcano's agent, Michel Velasquez of Rimas Sports, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The Major League Baseball Players Association declined to comment.\n\nMajor League Rule 21, posted in every clubhouse, states betting on any baseball game in which a player, umpire, league official or team employee has no duty to perform results in a one-year suspension. Betting on a game in which the person has a duty to perform results in a lifetime ban.\n\nIn addition, betting on other sports with an illegal bookmaker is subject to discipline deemed appropriate by the baseball commissioner.\n\nRose, baseball's career hits leader, agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989 after an MLB investigation concluded he bet on Cincinnati Reds games while managing the team.\n\nThe last active MLB player suspended under the gambling provision appears to be New York Giants outfielder Jimmy O'Connell, banned for life along with coach Cozy Dolan in 1924 for offering a $500 bribe to Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand to throw a game that Sept. 27.\n\nMarcano made his major league debut on April 1, 2021, and has a .217 average with five homers, 34 RBIs and seven stolen bases in 149 games. He has played in both the infield and outfield.\n\nU.S. sports leagues have increased monitoring over gambling since the U.S. Supreme Court in May 2018 struck down a federal law that had barred betting on football, basketball, baseball and other sports in most states. Sports books have opened at stadiums across the country across the major U.S. pro sports.\n\nShohei Ohtani's interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after the season opener on March 21 when a federal gambling investigation became public. Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case in which prosecutors allege he stole nearly $17 million from the two-time AL MVP to pay off debts.\n\nBaseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said last month that the sport's department of investigations deferred to the government probe. He noted that MLB has superior methods of monitoring potentially illicit bets with legal sports books than with illegal bookmakers. It is not clear how Marcano might have made his alleged bets.\n\nMLB's top concern with legal sports betting is on action besides the score or outcome, known as prop bets. For instance, wagers that a certain player would steal at least one base in a given game.\n\n\"There are certain kinds of prop bets that are of concern to us and continue to be of concern to us,\" Manfred said. \"Obviously, the potential for something happening in the game that nobody notices is much higher with a lot of kinds of prop bets and you could see where a player would be more tempted to -- all you need to do is miss three free throws; it doesn't necessarily change the outcome of your game. Your team may pick you up and life moves on. It's just easier to have a problem on a prop bet. I think it's just human nature. So, yeah, we remain concerned about them and have lobbied for certain types of prop bets not to be allowable.\"\n\n------\n\nAP Sports Writers Greg Beacham and Will Graves contributed to this

The league says 25 of those bets included wagers on Pittsburgh Pirates games while he was on the team's major league roster. However, he did not appear in any of those games because he was on the injured list following a season-ending knee injury. He was receiving medical treatment at PNC Park during that time.

San Diego Padres' Marcano is under investigation by Major League Baseball for allegedly betting on baseball and could be subject to a possible lifetime ban, according to a person familiar with the probe who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano is under investigation by Major League Baseball for allegedly betting on baseball and could be subject to a lifetime ban, according to a person familiar with the probe.\n\nMLB is looking into allegations Marcano bet on games involving the Pittsburgh Pirates while on the team's injured list last season, according to the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.\n\nMarcano could be the second pro athlete banned for life over sports betting this year after the NBA punished Toronto Raptors player Jontay Porter in April following a league probe that found he disclosed confidential information to sports bettors and wagered on games.\n\nIt's believed that no active MLB player has been banned for betting on baseball since 1924. Pete Rose was retired when he agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989.\n\nMarcano, 24, has not played since tearing his right ACL last July 24. He was claimed by the Padres off waivers on Nov. 2 and placed on the 10-day injured list March 19.\n\nMLB's investigation was first reported Monday by The Wall Street Journal, which also reported four other players were under investigation for betting on baseball while in the minor leagues.\n\n\"We are aware of an active investigation by Major League Baseball regarding a matter that occurred when the player in question was a member of another organization and not affiliated with the San Diego Padres,\" the team said in a statement. \"We will not have any further comment until the investigative process has been completed.\"\n\n\"We are aware of the matter that's under investigation and are fully cooperating,\" Pirates senior vice president of communications Brian Warecki said in a statement. \"We will refrain from further comment at this time.\"\n\nMarcano's agent, Michel Velasquez of Rimas Sports, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The Major League Baseball Players Association declined to comment.\n\nMajor League Rule 21, posted in every clubhouse, states betting on any baseball game in which a player, umpire, league official or team employee has no duty to perform results in a one-year suspension. Betting on a game in which the person has a duty to perform results in a lifetime ban.\n\nIn addition, betting on other sports with an illegal bookmaker is subject to discipline deemed appropriate by the baseball commissioner.\n\nRose, baseball's career hits leader, agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989 after an MLB investigation concluded he bet on Cincinnati Reds games while managing the team.\n\nThe last active MLB player suspended under the gambling provision appears to be New York Giants outfielder Jimmy O'Connell, banned for life along with coach Cozy Dolan in 1924 for offering a $500 bribe to Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand to throw a game that Sept. 27.\n\nMarcano made his major league debut on April 1, 2021, and has a .217 average with five homers, 34 RBIs and seven stolen bases in 149 games. He has played in both the infield and outfield.\n\nU.S. sports leagues have increased monitoring over gambling since the U.S. Supreme Court in May 2018 struck down a federal law that had barred betting on football, basketball, baseball and other sports in most states. Sports books have opened at stadiums across the country across the major U.S. pro sports.\n\nShohei Ohtani's interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after the season opener on March 21 when a federal gambling investigation became public. Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case in which prosecutors allege he stole nearly $17 million from the two-time AL MVP to pay off debts.\n\nBaseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said last month that the sport's department of investigations deferred to the government probe. He noted that MLB has superior methods of monitoring potentially illicit bets with legal sports books than with illegal bookmakers. It is not clear how Marcano might have made his alleged bets.\n\nMLB's top concern with legal sports betting is on action besides the score or outcome, known as prop bets. For instance, wagers that a certain player would steal at least one base in a given game.\n\n\"There are certain kinds of prop bets that are of concern to us and continue to be of concern to us,\" Manfred said. \"Obviously, the potential for something happening in the game that nobody notices is much higher with a lot of kinds of prop bets and you could see where a player would be more tempted to -- all you need to do is miss three free throws; it doesn't necessarily change the outcome of your game. Your team may pick you up and life moves on. It's just easier to have a problem on a prop bet. I think it's just human nature.

Marcano did not play in any of those games due to a season-ending knee injury, but was at the Pirates' home PNC Park receiving treatment during the games.\n\nMarcano won 4.3% of his MLB-related bets, according to MLB. He bet almost exclusively on the outcomes of games and lost all of his parlay wagers involving the Pirates.\n\nHe is banned under Major League Rule 21, which is posted in each team's clubhouse and states: \"Any player, umpire, or Club or League official or employee, who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform, shall be declared permanently ineligible.\"\n\nWith his lifetime suspension, Marcano becomes the first player to be banned under MLB's gambling policy since New York Giants infielder Jimmy O'Connell in 1924. Former Cincinnati Reds star Pete Rose, MLB's leader in career hits, agreed to a lifetime ban from the league in 1989 after an investigation concluded he wagered on Reds games while managing the team from 1984 to 1989.\n\n\"The strict enforcement of Major League Baseball's rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans,\" MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"The longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century. We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people.\"\n\nMarcano, a native of Tucupita, Venezuela, made his MLB debut for the Padres in 2021, appearing in 25 games for the team. He played for the Pirates in 2022 and 2023, hitting .221 in 124 games, before re-signing with the Padres in November 2023.

Pete Rose, baseball's active career hits leader, famously agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on Cincinnati Reds games while managing the team.\n\nOne other big leaguer, Oakland Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly, was declared ineligible for one year on Tuesday for betting on baseball while he was in the minor leagues. Additionally, minor leaguers Jay Groome of San Diego, Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez of Philadelphia and Saalfrank were banned for one year for betting on major league games.\n\nSaalfrank has only appeared in two games for Arizona this year and is pitching in the minors. He played in 10 regular season games and 11 playoff outings last year, posting a 1.94 WHIP across 5.2 postseason innings, including three World Series games.\n\nThe league said it was tipped off about the betting activity by a legal sports betting operator. None of the players punished played in any games on which they wagered, and all players denied to MLB they had inside information relevant to their bets or the games they bet on - testimonies that MLB says align with the data received from the sportsbook.\n\n\"The strict enforcement of Major League Baseball's rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans,\" Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"The longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century. We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people.\"\n\nMarcano was found to have placed 387 baseball bets, including 231 MLB-related wagers, between Oct. 16, 2022, and Nov. 1, 2023, totaling over $150,000. The league says 25 of those bets included wagers on Pittsburgh Pirates games while he was on the team's major league roster.\n\nHowever, he did not appear in any of those games because he was on the injured list following a season-ending knee injury. He was receiving medical treatment at PNC Park during that time. Marcano bet almost exclusively on the outcomes of games and lost all of his parlay bets involving the Pirates, winning just 4.3% of all of his MLB-related bets.\n\nMajor League Rule 21, posted in every clubhouse, states betting on any baseball game in which a player, umpire, league official or team employee has no duty to perform results in a one-year suspension. Betting on a game in which the person has a duty to perform results in a lifetime ban.", "source": {"uri": "arizonasports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arizona Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Major League Baseball has permanently banned Marcano Tuesday, June 4, 2024, for betting on baseball and suspended the four other players for one year after finding the players placed unrelated bets [...]\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano was banned from baseball for life for betting on the sport and four others were suspended for one year by Major League Baseball on Tuesday in the game's biggest gambling scandal in decades.\n\nMLB said Marcano placed 387 baseball bets totaling more than $150,000 in October 2022 and from last July through November with a legal sportsbook. He became the first active player in a century banned for life because of gambling.\n\nOakland Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly was suspended for one year for betting on baseball while in the minor leagues and a three minor leaguers also were banned for one year for betting on big league games: pitchers Jay Groome of San Diego and Andrew Saalfrank of Arizona, and infielder Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez of Philadelphia. Each of those four players wagered under $1,000.\n\n\"The strict enforcement of Major League Baseball's rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans,\" baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"The longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century. We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people.\"\n\nMarcano was the first active major leaguer banned for life under the sport's gambling provision since New York Giants outfielder Jimmy O'Connell in 1924. Pete Rose, baseball's career hits leader, agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on Cincinnati Reds games while managing the team.\n\nMajor League Rule 21, posted in every clubhouse, states betting on any baseball game in which a player, umpire, league official or team employee has no duty to perform results in a one-year suspension. Betting on a game in which the person has a duty to perform results in a lifetime ban.\n\nMarcano became the second North American athlete banned for gambling in recent months. The NBA gave Toronto's Jontay Porter a lifetime ban in April after concluding he disclosed confidential information to bettors and wagered on games, including on the Raptors to lose.\n\nMLB said it was tipped off about the betting activity by a legal sports betting operator. None of the players punished played in any games on which they wagered, and all players denied to MLB they had inside information relevant to their bets or the games they gambled on - testimonies that MLB says align with the data received from the sportsbook.\n\nIn its announcement, MLB detailed the bets alleged for each player,\n\nMarcano's 387 baseball bets included 231 MLB-related wagers for $87,319 between Oct. 16, 2022, and last Nov. 1. Twenty-five of those bets included wagers on Pirates games while he was on the team's major league roster. Now 24, Marcano, has not played since tearing his right ACL last July 24 and was receiving medical treatment at PNC Park last year.\n\nMarcano bet almost exclusively on the outcomes of games and lost all of his parlay bets involving the Pirates, winning just 4.3% of all of his MLB-related bets.\n\nMarcano made his major league debut on April 1, 2021, and has a .217 average with five homers, 34 RBIs and seven stolen bases in 149 games. He has played in both the infield and outfield.\n\nThe other four players did not bet on games involving their assigned teams.\n\nKelly placed 10 bets on nine major league games from Oct. 5-17, 2021, while a minor league player assigned to Houston's Triple-A Sugar Land farm team. The bets included wagers on outcomes, over/under on runs and an individual pitcher's strikeout total. Three of the nine games involved the major league Astros. His wagers totaled $99.22 and resulted in $28.30 of winnings.\n\nKelly, 31, was 3-2 with a 2.59 ERA in 28 games this season, last pitching on Saturday at Atlanta. The former first-round draft pick appeared in 46 games over the past three seasons.\n\nGroome, a 25-year-old who had been on a minor league injured list since mid-April, placed 32 MLB-related bets from July 22, 2020, through July 24, 2021, including 24 on the Boston Red Sox major league team while he was assigned to Boston's High-A team in Greenville, South Carolina. The sport detailed he wagered $453.74 on 30 MLB games and had a net loss of $433.54, receiving payouts on only two wagers. His betting included parlays.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, 23, has been at Double-A Reading this season. He placed 31 bets on baseball on Sept. 30, 2021, and from June 5 through July 30 in 2022, including 28 on MLB and three on college baseball. The total included seven involving the Chicago White Sox at the time he was assigned to their Double-A team in Birmingham, Alabama. Two of the White Sox bets involved outcomes and the others were on runs scored. He bet $749.09 on baseball, of which $724.09 was on MLB-related bets that included parlays.\n\nSaalfrank, 26, pitched in 21 games for Arizona last year between the regular season and postseason, including three World Series games, and two this year before he was optioned to Triple-A Reno on May 1. He placed 29 baseball bets from Sept. 9 through Oct. 29 in 2021 and on March 9, 2022, including 28 on MLB and one parlay on college baseball. He placed four bets on the big league Diamondbacks while on the injured list of their Low A farm team. His baseball bets totaled $445.87 on baseball, including $444.07 on MLB, and lost $272.64 on MLB bets and $1.80 on the college wager. He won just five of 28 MLB bets, which included outcomes, runs and pitcher strikeouts.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Wall Street Journal was the first to report on MLB's latest gambling scandal.\n\nAccording to MLB's press release, Marcano, 24, placed 387 baseball-related bets from Oct. 16, 2022 to Nov. 1, 2023, totaling over $150,000. 231 of those bets were placed on MLB games (for a total of $87,319), and 25 of those 231 bets involved the Pittsburg Pirates, the team he was on at the time, though he was on the injured list and not playing due to a season-ending injury (from which he is still recovering). The vast majority of Marcano's bets were placed after he was injured.\n\nMLB's investigation found that Marcano lost every parlay involving the Pirates, and won only 4.3% of his MLB bets. Marcano denies that he compromised or manipulated the Pirates games he bet on, and MLB found no evidence to contradict that.\n\nMarcano and the Players Association have yet to comment. The Padres released a statement on Monday when the Wall Street Journal published their report.\n\nMLB also announced that four other players have been suspended one year for gambling on baseball: Oakland Athletics reliever Michael Kelly, and three minor leaugers: Padres pitcher Jay Groome, Philadelphia Phillies infielder Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez, and Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Andrew Saalfrank.\n\nMarcano held a career-high .233 batting average last season with the Pirates. He had 18 RBI, 47 hits and three home runs in 75 games. He tore his ACL in late July, and missed the rest of the season as a result.\n\nThe gambling allegations against Marcano are just the latest in the league and the sports world in general in recent months. Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter pleaded guilty to charges after he reportedly stole nearly $17 million from Ohtani to cover his illegal gambling losses. Ohtani was not involved in that scandal, which dominated the sport in the lead-up to the season.\n\nToronto Raptors player Jontay Porter was given a lifetime ban from the NBA earlier this year, too, after the league said he purposely limited his participation in games for betting purposes and for betting on games. Porter, who is the brother of Denver Nuggets star Michael Porter Jr., was on a two-way deal with the franchise.\n\nWest Ham midfielder Lucas Paquet\u00e1 was charged by the English Football Association for allegedly breaching their betting rules last month. Former Alabama baseball coach Brad Bohannon was fired after a friend of his tried to make a $100,000 bet on the team. The NFL has cracked down on gambling, too, as several players have been hit with suspensions for violating gambling rules either while in the league or while in college.\n\nLike in the NFL, Major League Baseball's gambling policy prohibits players from placing any bets on baseball. They are allowed to bet on other sports legally. Any player who places a wager on a baseball game involving a team other than their own receives a one-year suspension, but betting on your own team leads to a lifetime ban.", "source": {"uri":

Pete Rose was retired when he agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989.\n\nMarcano, 24, has not played since tearing his right ACL last July 24. He was claimed by the Padres off waivers on Nov. 2 and placed on the 10-day injured list March 19.\n\nMLB's investigation was first reported Monday by The Wall Street Journal, which also reported four other players were under investigation for betting on baseball while in the minor leagues.\n\n\"We are aware of an active investigation by Major League Baseball regarding a matter that occurred when the player in question was a member of another organization and not affiliated with the San Diego Padres,\" the team said in a statement. \"We will not have any further comment until the investigative process has been completed.\"\n\n\"We are aware of the matter that's under investigation and are fully cooperating,\" Pirates senior vice president of communications Brian Warecki said in a statement. \"We will refrain from further comment at this time.\"\n\nMarcano's agent, Michel Velasquez of Rimas Sports, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The Major League Baseball Players Association declined to comment.\n\nMajor League Rule 21, posted in every clubhouse, states betting on any baseball game in which a player, umpire, league official or team employee has no duty to perform results in a one-year suspension. Betting on a game in which the person has a duty to perform results in a lifetime ban.\n\nIn addition, betting on other sports with an illegal bookmaker is subject to discipline deemed appropriate by the baseball commissioner.\n\nRose, baseball's career hits leader, agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989 after an MLB investigation concluded he bet on Cincinnati Reds games while managing the team.\n\nThe last active MLB player suspended under the gambling provision appears to be New York Giants outfielder Jimmy O'Connell, banned for life along with coach Cozy Dolan in 1924 for offering a $500 bribe to Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand to throw a game that Sept. 27.\n\nMarcano made his major league debut on April 1, 2021, and has a .217 average with five homers, 34 RBIs and seven stolen bases in 149 games. He has played in both the infield and outfield.\n\nU.S. sports leagues have increased monitoring over gambling since the U.S. Supreme Court in May 2018 struck down a federal law that had barred betting on football, basketball, baseball and other sports in most states. Sports books have opened at stadiums across the country across the major U.S. pro sports.\n\nShohei Ohtani's interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after the season opener on March 21 when a federal gambling investigation became public. Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case in which prosecutors allege he stole nearly $17 million from the two-time AL MVP to pay off debts.\n\nBaseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said last month that the sport's department of investigations deferred to the government probe. He noted that MLB has superior methods of monitoring potentially illicit bets with legal sports books than with illegal bookmakers. It is not clear how Marcano might have made his alleged bets.\n\nMLB's top concern with legal sports betting is on action besides the score or outcome, known as prop bets. For instance, wagers that a certain player would steal at least one base in a given game.\n\n\"There are certain kinds of prop bets that are of concern to us and continue to be of concern to us,\" Manfred said. \"Obviously, the potential for something happening in the game that nobody notices is much higher with a lot of kinds of prop bets and you could see where a player would be more tempted to -- all you need to do is miss three free throws; it doesn't necessarily change the outcome of your game. Your team may pick you up and life moves on. It's just easier to have a problem on a prop bet. I think it's just human nature. So, yeah, we remain concerned about them and have lobbied for certain types of prop bets not to be allowable.\"", "source": {"uri": "wgxa.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "WGXA"}, "authors": [],

However, he did not appear in any of those games because he was on the injured list following a season-ending knee injury. He was receiving medical treatment at PNC Park during that time.

Kelly bet on MLB (not involving the A's) when he was in the minor leagues, while the other three players, all of whom are in the minors, bet on major league games.\n\nMarcano's possible banishment comes at a time when professional sports are reckoning with the effects of legalized betting and an increase in betting-related incidents. In April, the NBA banned Raptors forward Jontay Porter for life after he bet on games and gave confidential information to gamblers. His banishment came weeks after Ippei Mizuhara, the former interpreter for Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani, was revealed to have stolen more than $16 million from the two-way star to pay illegal gambling debts. Coincidentally, Marcano's banishment comes on the day Mizuhara is expected to enter a guilty plea.\n\nMLB said it was alerted about the betting activity by a legal sports operator. None of the impacted players participated in the games they wagered on, and all of them told MLB they had no inside information related to the games they bet on, which correlated with the information the league received from the sportsbook.\n\nMarcano was found to have placed 387 bets on baseball, including 231 on MLB-related wagers between October 2022 and November '23, which totaled over $150,000. MLB found 25 of those bets were on the Pirates while Marcano was on the team's roster. He didn't play in those games because he was on the injured list after tearing his ACL while running the bases. However, he was at PNC Park, the Pirates' stadium, while placing the bets.

Players who wager on baseball games that don't involve their team results in a one-year suspension, while betting on games involving their team results in a lifetime ban, made famous by Pete Rose, the game's all-time hits leader, in 1989, when he was managing the Reds. Marcano appears to be the first active player banned due to gambling since New York Giants outfielder Jimmy O'Connell in 1924.\n\nMarcano was originally signed by the Padres as a teenager out of Venezuela in 2016 and made his major league debut five years later. He was traded to the Pirates in '21 and was claimed off waivers by the team that signed him this past fall.

Pete Rose was retired when he agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989.\n\nMarcano, 24, has not played since tearing his right ACL last July 24. He was claimed by the Padres off waivers on Nov. 2 and placed on the 10-day injured list March 19.\n\nMLB's investigation was first reported Monday by The Wall Street Journal, which also reported four other players were under investigation for betting on baseball while in the minor leagues.\n\n\"We are aware of an active investigation by Major League Baseball regarding a matter that occurred when the player in question was a member of another organization and not affiliated with the San Diego Padres,\" the team said in a statement. \"We will not have any further comment until the investigative process has been completed.\"\n\n\"We are aware of the matter that's under investigation and are fully cooperating,\" Pirates senior vice president of communications Brian Warecki said in a statement. \"We will refrain from further comment at this time.\"\n\nMarcano's agent, Michel Velasquez of Rimas Sports, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The Major League Baseball Players Association declined to comment.\n\nMajor League Rule 21, posted in every clubhouse, states betting on any baseball game in which a player, umpire, league official or team employee has no duty to perform results in a one-year suspension. Betting on a game in which the person has a duty to perform results in a lifetime ban.\n\nIn addition, betting on other sports with an illegal bookmaker is subject to discipline deemed appropriate by the baseball commissioner.\n\nRose, baseball's career hits leader, agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989 after an MLB investigation concluded he bet on Cincinnati Reds games while managing the team.\n\nThe last active MLB player suspended under the gambling provision appears to be New York Giants outfielder Jimmy O'Connell, banned for life along with coach Cozy Dolan in 1924 for offering a $500 bribe to Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand to throw a game that Sept. 27.\n\nMarcano made his major league debut on April 1, 2021, and has a .217 average with five homers, 34 RBIs and seven stolen bases in 149 games. He has played in both the infield and outfield.\n\nU.S. sports leagues have increased monitoring over gambling since the U.S. Supreme Court in May 2018 struck down a federal law that had barred betting on football, basketball, baseball and other sports in most states. Sports books have opened at stadiums across the country across the major U.S. pro sports.\n\nShohei Ohtani's interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after the season opener on March 21 when a federal gambling investigation became public. Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case in which prosecutors allege he stole nearly $17 million from the two-time AL MVP to pay off debts.\n\nBaseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said last month that the sport's department of investigations deferred to the government probe. He noted that MLB has superior methods of monitoring potentially illicit bets with legal sports books than with illegal bookmakers. It is not clear how Marcano might have made his alleged bets.\n\nMLB's top concern with legal sports betting is on action besides the score or outcome, known as prop bets. For instance, wagers that a certain player would steal at least one base in a given game.\n\n\"There are certain kinds of prop bets that are of concern to us and continue to be of concern to us,\" Manfred said. \"Obviously, the potential for something happening in the game that nobody notices is much higher with a lot of kinds of prop bets and you could see where a player would be more tempted to -- all you need to do is miss three free throws; it doesn't necessarily change the outcome of your game. Your team may pick you up and life moves on. It's just easier to have a problem on a prop bet. I think it's just human nature. So, yeah, we remain concerned about them and have lobbied for certain types of prop bets not to be allowable.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Greg Beacham and Will Graves contributed to this report.",

Betting on a game in which the person has a duty to perform results in a lifetime ban.\n\nMarcano became the second North American athlete banned for gambling in recent months. The NBA gave Toronto's Jontay Porter a lifetime ban in April after concluding he disclosed confidential information to bettors and wagered on games, including on the Raptors to lose.\n\nMLB said it was tipped off in March about the betting activity by a legal sports betting operator. None of the players punished played in any games on which they wagered, and all players denied to MLB they had inside information relevant to their bets or the games they gambled on - testimonies that MLB says align with the data received from the sportsbook.\n\nMarcano's 387 baseball bets included international games and 231 MLB-related wagers for $87,319 between Oct. 16, 2022, and last Nov. 1. Twenty-five were wagers on Pirates games while he was on the major league roster. Marcano, 24, has not played since tearing his right ACL July 24 and was receiving medical treatment at PNC Park last year.\n\nMarcano bet almost exclusively on the outcomes of games and lost all of his parlay bets involving the Pirates, winning just 4.3% of all of his MLB-related bets.\n\nMarcano made his major league debut on April 1, 2021, and has a .217 average with five homers, 34 RBIs and seven stolen bases in 149 games. He has played in both the infield and outfield.\n\n\"While the thorough investigation revealed no evidence of any games being compromised, influenced or manipulated in any way in this case, protecting the integrity of our game is paramount,\" the Pirates said in a statement.\n\nThe other four players did not bet on games involving their assigned teams.\n\nKelly placed 10 bets on nine major league games from Oct. 5-17, 2021, while a minor league player assigned to Houston's Triple-A Sugar Land farm team. The bets included wagers on outcomes, over/under on runs and an individual pitcher's strikeout total. Three of the nine games involved the major league Astros. His wagers totaled $99.22 and resulted in $28.30 of winnings.\n\nKelly, 31, was 3-2 with a 2.59 ERA in 28 games this season, last pitching on Saturday at Atlanta. The former first-round draft pick appeared in 46 games over the past three seasons.\n\nGroome, a 25-year-old who had been on a minor league injured list since mid-April, placed 32 MLB-related bets from July 22, 2020, through July 24, 2021, including 24 on the Boston Red Sox major league team while he was assigned to Boston's High-A team in Greenville, South Carolina. The sport detailed he wagered $453.74 on 30 MLB games and had a net loss of $433.54, receiving payouts on only two wagers. His betting included parlays.\n\nSaalfrank, 26, pitched in 21 games for Arizona last year between the regular season and postseason, including three World Series games, and two this year before he was optioned to Triple-A Reno on May 1. He placed 29 baseball bets from Sept. 9 through Oct. 29 in 2021 and on March 9, 2022, including 28 on MLB and one parlay on college baseball. He placed four bets on the big league Diamondbacks while on the injured list of their Low A farm team. His baseball bets totaled $445.87 on baseball, including $444.07 on MLB, and lost $272.64 on MLB bets and $1.80 on the college wager. He won just five of 28 MLB bets, which included outcomes, runs and pitcher strikeouts.", "source": {"uri": "delcotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Delaware County Daily Times"}, "authors":

He gambled more than $150,000 on baseball, with $87,319 of that on MLB-related bets.\n\nThe MLB investigation found that 25 of those bets included Pirates games while Marcano was assigned to the Major League club.\n\nThe MLB probe found that \"almost all of Marcano's Pirates bets were on which club (the Pirates or their opponent) would win the game or whether there would be more or less than a certain number of runs scored in the game.\"\n\nThe MLB investigation said that \"there is no evidence to suggest -- and Marcano denies -- that any outcomes in the baseball games on which he placed bets were compromised, influenced, or manipulated in any way.\"\n\nThe four other players were banned for one year for betting on baseball games while in the minor leagues.\n\nThose players are Oakland Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly, Padres minor league pitcher Jay Groome, Philadelphia Phillies minor league infielder Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez and Arizona Diamondbacks minor league pitcher Andrew Saalfrank.\n\nThe MLB said that none of the players are appealing their discipline.\n\nAccording to MLB rules, a player found guilty of betting on baseball games involving teams other than their own are subject to a one-year suspension.

He became the first active player in a century banned for life because of gambling.\n\nOakland Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly was suspended for one year for betting on baseball while in the minor leagues and a three minor leaguers also were banned for one year for betting on big league games: pitchers Jay Groome of San Diego and Andrew Saalfrank of Arizona, and infielder Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez of Philadelphia.

We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people.\"\n\nMarcano was the first active major leaguer banned for life under the sport's gambling provision since New York Giants outfielder Jimmy O'Connell in 1924. Pete Rose, baseball's career hits leader, agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on Cincinnati Reds games while managing the team.\n\nMajor League Rule 21, posted in every clubhouse, states betting on any baseball game in which a player, umpire, league official or team employee has no duty to perform results in a one-year suspension. Betting on a game in which the person has a duty to perform results in a lifetime ban.\n\nMarcano became the second North American athlete banned for gambling in recent months. The NBA gave Toronto's Jontay Porter a lifetime ban in April after concluding he disclosed confidential information to bettors and wagered on games, including on the Raptors to lose.\n\nMLB said it was tipped off about the betting activity by a legal sports betting operator. None of the players punished played in any games on which they wagered, and all players denied to MLB they had inside information relevant to their bets or the games they gambled on - testimonies that MLB says align with the data received from the sportsbook.\n\nIn its announcement, MLB detailed the bets alleged for each player,\n\nMarcano's 387 baseball bets included 231 MLB-related wagers for $87,319 between Oct. 16, 2022, and last Nov. 1. Twenty-five of those bets included wagers on Pirates games while he was on the team's major league roster. Now 24, Marcano, has not played since tearing his right ACL last July 24 and was receiving medical treatment at PNC Park last year.\n\nMarcano bet almost exclusively on the outcomes of games and lost all of his parlay bets involving the Pirates, winning just 4.3% of all of his MLB-related bets.\n\nMarcano made his major league debut on April 1, 2021, and has a .217 average with five homers, 34 RBIs and seven stolen bases in 149 games. He has played in both the infield and outfield.\n\nThe other four players did not bet on games involving their assigned teams.\n\nKelly placed 10 bets on nine major league games from Oct. 5-17, 2021, while a minor league player assigned to Houston's Triple-A Sugar Land farm team. The bets included wagers on outcomes, over/under on runs and an individual pitcher's strikeout total. Three of the nine games involved the major league Astros. His wagers totaled $99.22 and resulted in $28.30 of winnings.\n\nKelly, 31, was 3-2 with a 2.59 ERA in 28 games this season, last pitching on Saturday at Atlanta. The former first-round draft pick appeared in 46 games over the past three seasons.\n\nGroome, a 25-year-old who had been on a minor league injured list since mid-April, placed 32 MLB-related bets from July 22, 2020, through July 24, 2021, including 24 on the Boston Red Sox major league team while he was assigned to Boston's High-A team in Greenville, South Carolina. The sport detailed he wagered $453.74 on 30 MLB games and had a net loss of $433.54, receiving payouts on only two wagers. His betting included parlays.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, 23, has been at Double-A Reading this season. He placed 31 bets on baseball on Sept. 30, 2021, and from June 5 through July 30 in 2022, including 28 on MLB and three on college baseball. The total included seven involving the Chicago White Sox at the time he was assigned to their Double-A team in Birmingham, Alabama. Two of the White Sox bets involved outcomes and the others were on runs scored. He bet $749.09 on baseball, of which $724.09 was on MLB-related bets that included parlays.\n\nSaalfrank, 26, pitched in 21 games for Arizona last year between the regular season and postseason, including three World Series games, and two this year before he was optioned to Triple-A Reno on May 1. He placed 29 baseball bets from Sept. 9 through Oct. 29 in 2021 and on March 9, 2022, including 28 on MLB and one parlay on college baseball. He placed four bets on the big league Diamondbacks while on the injured list of their Low A farm team. His baseball bets totaled $445.87 on baseball, including $444.07 on MLB, and lost $272.64 on MLB bets and $1.80 on the college wager. He won just five of 28 MLB bets, which included outcomes, runs and pitcher strikeouts.\n\nREAD ALSO: Raptor Jontay Porter banned for life after NBA gambling investigation\n\nREAD ALSO: Ottawa's Pinto

He became the first active player in a century banned for life because of gambling.\n\nOakland Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly was suspended for one year for betting on baseball while in the minor leagues and a three minor leaguers also were banned for one year for betting on big league games: pitchers Jay Groome of San Diego and Andrew Saalfrank of Arizona, and infielder Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez of Philadelphia. Each of those four players wagered under $1,000.\n\n\"The strict enforcement of Major League Baseball's rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans,\" baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"The longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century. We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people.\"\n\nMarcano was the first active major leaguer banned for life under the sport's gambling provision since New York Giants outfielder Jimmy O'Connell in 1924. Pete Rose, baseball's career hits leader, agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on Cincinnati Reds games while managing the team.\n\nMajor League Rule 21, posted in every clubhouse, states betting on any baseball game in which a player, umpire, league official or team employee has no duty to perform results in a one-year suspension. Betting on a game in which the person has a duty to perform results in a lifetime ban.\n\nMarcano became the second North American athlete banned for gambling in recent months. The NBA gave Toronto's Jontay Porter a lifetime ban in April after concluding he disclosed confidential information to bettors and wagered on games, including on the Raptors to lose.\n\nMLB said it was tipped off about the betting activity by a legal sports betting operator. None of the players punished played in any games on which they wagered, and all players denied to MLB they had inside information relevant to their bets or the games they gambled on - testimonies that MLB says align with the data received from the sportsbook.\n\nIn its announcement, MLB detailed the bets alleged for each player,\n\nMarcano's 387 baseball bets included 231 MLB-related wagers for $87,319 between Oct. 16, 2022, and last Nov. 1. Twenty-five of those bets included wagers on Pirates games while he was on the team's major league roster. Now 24, Marcano, has not played since tearing his right ACL last July 24 and was receiving medical treatment at PNC Park last year.\n\nMarcano bet almost exclusively on the outcomes of games and lost all of his parlay bets involving the Pirates, winning just 4.3% of all of his MLB-related bets.\n\nMarcano made his major league debut on April 1, 2021, and has a .217 average with five homers, 34 RBIs and seven stolen bases in 149 games. He has played in both the infield and outfield.\n\nThe other four players did not bet on games involving their assigned teams.\n\nKelly placed 10 bets on nine major league games from Oct. 5-17, 2021, while a minor league player assigned to Houston's Triple-A Sugar Land farm team. The bets included wagers on outcomes, over/under on runs and an individual pitcher's strikeout total. Three of the nine games involved the major league Astros. His wagers totaled $99.22 and resulted in $28.30 of winnings.\n\nKelly, 31, was 3-2 with a 2.59 ERA in 28 games this season, last pitching on Saturday at Atlanta. The former first-round draft pick appeared in 46 games over the past three seasons.\n\nGroome, a 25-year-old who had been on a minor league injured list since mid-April, placed 32 MLB-related bets from July 22, 2020, through July 24, 2021, including 24 on the Boston Red Sox major league team while he was assigned to Boston's High-A team in Greenville, South Carolina. The sport detailed he wagered $453.74 on 30 MLB games and had a net loss of $433.54, receiving payouts on only two wagers. His betting included parlays.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, 23, has been at Double-A Reading this season. He placed 31 bets on baseball on Sept. 30, 2021, and from June 5 through July 30 in 2022, including 28 on MLB and three on college baseball. The total included seven involving the Chicago White Sox at the time he was assigned to their Double-A team in Birmingham, Alabama. Two of the White Sox bets involved outcomes and the others were on runs scored. He bet $749.09 on baseball, of which $724.09 was on MLB-related bets that included parlays.\n\nSaalfrank, 26, pitched in 21 games for Arizona last year between the regular season and postseason, including three World Series games, and two this year before he was optioned to Triple-A Reno on May 1. He placed 29 baseball bets from Sept. 9 through Oct. 29 in 2021 and on March 9, 2022, including 28 on MLB and one parlay on college baseball. He placed four bets on the big league Diamondbacks while on the injured list of their Low A farm team. His baseball bets totaled $445.87 on baseball, including $444.07 on MLB, and lost $272.64 on MLB bets and $1.80 on the college wager. He won just five of 28 MLB bets, which included outcomes, runs and pitcher strikeouts.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Marcano is being investigated for betting on Pittsburgh Pirates games while he was on the major-league injured list for them last season, per the source. The MLB penalty for players betting on their own teams is a lifetime ban.\n\nIn addition, four other players face potential discipline for betting on baseball while playing in the minor leagues, per the source. The names of the four other players are not known at this time. The Wall Street Journal was the first to report the news of the investigations.\n\n\"We are aware of an active investigation by Major League Baseball regarding a matter that occurred when the player in question was a member of another organization and not affiliated with the San Diego Padres,\" the Padres said in a statement. \"We will not have any further comment until the investigative process has been completed.\"\n\nMLB and the MLBPA declined to comment.\n\nBaseball's rules forbid players from betting on MLB and minor-league games. Per Rule 21, any player who bets on baseball that doesn't involve his team is suspended for one year and any player who bets on their own team faces a lifetime ban from MLB.\n\nMLB's investigation into Marcano is the latest example of gambling's invasion of pro sports. Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter and manager, Ippei Mizuhara, agreed to plead guilty in May to charges of bank fraud for stealing almost $17 million from Ohtani's accounts to cover gambling debts. In April, the NBA banned Toronto Raptors forward Jontay Porter from the league for betting on the league's games and sharing inside information.\n\nThe most notable example of a lifetime ban from MLB was career-hits leader Pete Rose. An MLB investigation found he bet on games as a player and manager for the Cincinnati Reds from 1985 to 1987.\n\nMarcano, 24, hasn't played since July 24, 2023, due to a torn right ACL.

Marcano tore an ACL last year and was on the injured list when he allegedly placed the bets, which were flagged by a sportsbook and reported to the league, according to sources.\n\nThe potential ban of Marcano comes in the wake of the NBA handing down a ban to Toronto Raptors forward Jontay Porter for disclosing confidential information to bettors, limiting his participation in at least one game and betting on NBA games while playing in the G League.\n\nFour other minor league players are facing potential discipline for betting as well, sources told ESPN. Even if a player in the minor leagues is on a team's 40-man roster, he would face a one-year suspension for betting on major league games, according to Rule 21.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the looming discipline for all five players.\n\nAs pervasive as betting in sports has become, it is particularly sensitive in baseball, a sport whose hit king, Pete Rose, remains banned for betting, and whose championship series was thrown in 1919 by the Chicago White Sox. Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, has indicated he plans to plead guilty to federal felony charges after admitting he had stolen money from Ohtani to pay off gambling debts.\n\nMLB continues to investigate Ohtani's former teammate with the Los Angeles Angels, David Fletcher, for betting on sports with the same illegal bookmaker who took wagers from Mizuhara, according to ESPN's Tisha Thompson.\n\nMarcano's case, about which MLB and the MLB Players Association continue to discuss the ultimate discipline, would represent the first direct penalty for a player betting on baseball since Rose. In 2015, Miami Marlins right-hander Jarred Cosart was fined for placing bets not on baseball but with an illegal bookmaker.\n\nSince the Supreme Court's 2018 ruling that began the spread of legal betting in the U.S., 12 NFL players, an assistant coach and an undisclosed number of league personnel have been suspended for violating the gambling policy, in addition to Porter's banishment from the NBA.\n\nMLB and the MLBPA declined comment, as did Marcano through his agent. Pirates senior vice president of communications Brian Warecki told ESPN: \"We are aware of the matter that's under investigation and are fully cooperating. We will refrain from further comment at this time.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Padres said: \"We are aware of an active investigation by Major League Baseball regarding a matter that occurred when the player in question was a member of another organization and not affiliated with the San Diego Padres. We will not have any further comment until the investigative process has been completed.\"\n\nMarcano rejoined the Padres this winter as a waiver claim after they had sent him to Pittsburgh at the 2021 trade deadline in a deal for infielder Adam Frazier. In 149 career games, Marcano hit .217/.269/.320 with five home runs and seven stolen bases in 447 plate appearances.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucupita_Marcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucupita Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fletcher_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Fletcher (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_rosters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball rosters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Players_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Players Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_G_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA G League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Frazier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Frazier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarred_Cosart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarred Cosart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plate appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_transactions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball transactions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ktbb.com/post/wp-content/media/2022/12/facebook-og-1200630.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621706", "eventUri": "eng-9621706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

He became the first active player in a century banned for life because of gambling.\n\nOakland Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly was suspended for one year for betting on baseball while in the minor leagues and three minor leaguers also were banned for one year for betting on big league games: pitchers Jay Groome of San Diego and Andrew Saalfrank of Arizona, and infielder Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez of Philadelphia. Each of those four players wagered under $1,000. Saalfrank and Rodr\u00edguez played previously in the majors.\n\nRead More: MLB Expands Aid Programs to Support Living Negro Leagues Players\n\n\"The strict enforcement of Major League Baseball's rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans,\" baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"The longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century. We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people.\"\n\nMarcano is the first active major leaguer banned for life under the sport's gambling provision since New York Giants outfielder Jimmy O'Connell in 1924. Pete Rose, baseball's career hits leader, agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on Cincinnati Reds games while managing the team.\n\nMajor League Rule 21, posted in every clubhouse, states betting on any baseball game in which a player, umpire, league official or team employee has no duty to perform results in a one-year suspension. Betting on a game in which the person has a duty to perform results in a lifetime ban.\n\nMarcano became the second North American athlete banned for gambling in recent months. The NBA gave Toronto's Jontay Porter a lifetime ban in April after concluding he disclosed confidential information to bettors and wagered on games, including on the Raptors to lose.\n\nMLB said it was tipped off in March about the betting activity by a legal sports betting operator. None of the players punished played in any games on which they wagered, and all players denied to MLB they had inside information relevant to their bets or the games they gambled on - testimonies that MLB says align with the data received from the sportsbook.\n\nRead More: 3 Australian League Soccer Players Arrested Over Alleged Yellow Card-Fixing Scheme\n\nIn its announcement, MLB detailed the bets alleged for each player.\n\nMarcano's 387 baseball bets included international games and 231 MLB-related wagers for $87,319 between Oct. 16, 2022, and last Nov. 1. Twenty-five of those bets included wagers on Pirates games while he was on the team's major league roster. Now 24, Marcano, has not played since tearing his right ACL last July 24 and was receiving medical treatment at PNC Park last year.\n\nMarcano bet almost exclusively on the outcomes of games and lost all of his parlay bets involving the Pirates, winning just 4.3% of all of his MLB-related bets.\n\nMarcano made his major league debut on April 1, 2021, and has a .217 average with five homers, 34 RBIs and seven stolen bases in 149 games. He has played in both the infield and outfield.\n\n\"While the thorough investigation revealed no evidence of any games being compromised, influenced or manipulated in any way in this case, protecting the integrity of our game is paramount,\" the Pirates said in a statement.\n\nThe other four players did not bet on games involving their assigned teams.\n\nKelly placed 10 bets on nine major league games from Oct. 5-17, 2021, while a minor league player assigned to Houston's Triple-A Sugar Land farm team. The bets included wagers on outcomes, over/under on runs and an individual pitcher's strikeout total. Three of the nine games involved the major league Astros. His wagers totaled $99.22 and resulted in $28.30 of winnings.\n\nKelly, 31, was 3-2 with a 2.59 ERA in 28 games this season, last pitching on Saturday at Atlanta. The former first-round draft pick appeared in 46 games over the past three seasons.\n\nGroome, a 25-year-old who had been on a minor league injured list since mid-April, placed 32 MLB-related bets from July 22, 2020, through July 24, 2021, including 24 on the Boston Red Sox major league team while he was assigned to Boston's High-A team in Greenville, South Carolina. The sport detailed he wagered $453.74 on 30 MLB games and had a net loss of $433.54, receiving payouts on only two wagers. His betting included parlays.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, 23, has been at Double-A Reading this season. He placed 31 bets on baseball on Sept. 30, 2021, and from June 5 through July 30 in 2022, including 28 on MLB and three on college baseball. The total included seven involving the Chicago White Sox at the time he was assigned to their Double-A team in Birmingham, Alabama. Two of the White Sox bets involved outcomes and the others were on runs scored. He bet $749.09 on baseball, of which $724.09 was on MLB-related bets that included parlays.\n\nSaalfrank, 26, pitched in 21 games for Arizona last year between the regular season and postseason, including three World Series games, and two this year before he was optioned to Triple-A Reno on May 1. He placed 29 baseball bets from Sept. 9 through Oct. 29 in 2021 and on March 9, 2022, including 28 on MLB and one parlay on college baseball. He placed four bets on the big league Diamondbacks while on the injured list of their Low A farm team. His baseball bets totaled $445.87 on baseball, including $444.07 on MLB, and lost $272.64 on MLB bets and $1.80 on the college wager. He won just five of 28 MLB bets, which included outcomes, runs and pitcher strikeouts.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri":

infielder Tucupita Marcano has been banned for life from Major League Baseball for betting on games, the league announced on Tuesday.\n\nMichael Kelly, a pitcher for the Oakland Athletics, and three minor league players were also suspended for a year for gambling on baseball games, MLB said.\n\n\"The strict enforcement of Major League Baseball's rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans,\" MLB commissioner Robert Manfred said in a statement.\n\n\"The longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century,\" Manfred said. \"We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people.\"\n\nMLB said Marcano, who has been on the injured list this season recovering from ACL surgery, has been declared \"permanently ineligible\" for violating the league's sports betting rules and policies.\n\nIt said the 24-year-old Venezuelan-born Padres player placed 387 bets on baseball in 2022 and 2023, including 231 bets on MLB games through a legal sportsbook.\n\n\"In total, Marcano bet more than $150,000 on baseball, with $87,319 of that on MLB-related bets,\" it said.\n\nMarcano, who was playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates at the time, \"did not appear in any of the games on which he placed bets,\" the league said.\n\n\"There is no evidence to suggest -- - and Marcano denies -- - that any outcomes in the baseball games on which he placed bets were compromised, influenced, or manipulated in any way.\"\n\nKelly, 31, the Oakland Athletics pitcher suspended for a year, placed 10 bets totaling $99.22 on MLB games in 2021 while he was with a minor league affiliate of the Houston Astros, MLB said.\n\n\"Kelly did not appear in any of the games on which he bet, and he did not make any bets involving his assigned team,\" the league said.\n\nKelly has appeared in 28 games for the A's this year, pitching 31.1 innings and sporting a 2.59 ERA.\n\n- Ohtani interpreter -\n\nThe other three players suspended for a year are Jay Groome, a pitcher for a Padres minor league affiliate, Jose Rodriguez, an infielder in the Philadelphia Phillies organization, and Andrew Saalfrank, a pitcher for an Arizona Diamondbacks minor league team.\n\nGroome, 25, made 32 MLB-related bets in 2020 and 2021 totaling around $450, the league said, none of which involved his team.\n\nRodriguez, 23, bet around $750 in 2021 and 2022 on 28 MLB and three college baseball games -- none of which involved him as a player, MLB said.\n\nAs for Saalfrank, 26, he bet $445 on 28 MLB games and one college game, and did not appear in any of the games on which he placed wagers.\n\nMLB was rocked earlier this year by revelations that the former interpreter of Shohei Ohtani had stolen nearly $17 million from the Los Angeles Dodgers star's bank account to pay off gambling debts.\n\nAccording to federal prosecutors, Ippei Mizuhara -- Ohtani's long-time friend and confidant -- plundered the Japanese player's bank account to fund an \"insatiable appetite\" for gambling.\n\nThe life ban for Marcano comes nearly two months after the National Basketball

Pete Rose, baseball's career hits leader, agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on Cincinnati Reds games while managing the team.\n\nMajor League Rule 21, posted in every clubhouse, states betting on any baseball game in which a player, umpire, league official or team employee has no duty to perform results in a one-year suspension. Betting on a game in which the person has a duty to perform results in a lifetime ban.\n\nMarcano became the second North American athlete banned for gambling in recent months. The NBA gave Toronto's Jontay Porter a lifetime ban in April after concluding he disclosed confidential information to bettors and wagered on games, including on the Raptors to lose.\n\nMLB said it was tipped off about the betting activity by a legal sports betting operator. None of the players punished played in any games on which they wagered, and all players denied to MLB they had inside information relevant to their bets or the games they gambled on - testimonies that MLB says align with the data received from the sportsbook.\n\nIn its announcement, MLB detailed the bets alleged for each player,\n\nMarcano's 387 baseball bets included 231 MLB-related wagers for $87,319 between Oct. 16, 2022, and last Nov. 1. Twenty-five of those bets included wagers on Pirates games while he was on the team's major league roster. Now 24, Marcano, has not played since tearing his right ACL last July 24 and was receiving medical treatment at PNC Park last year.\n\nMarcano bet almost exclusively on the outcomes of games and lost all of his parlay bets involving the Pirates, winning just 4.3% of all of his MLB-related bets.\n\nMarcano made his major league debut on April 1, 2021, and has a .217 average with five homers, 34 RBIs and seven stolen bases in 149 games. He has played in both the infield and outfield.\n\nThe other four players did not bet on games involving their assigned teams.\n\nKelly placed 10 bets on nine major league games from Oct. 5-17, 2021, while a minor league player assigned to Houston's Triple-A Sugar Land farm team. The bets included wagers on outcomes, over/under on runs and an individual pitcher's strikeout total. Three of the nine games involved the major league Astros. His wagers totaled $99.22 and resulted in $28.30 of winnings.\n\nKelly, 31, was 3-2 with a 2.59 ERA in 28 games this season, last pitching on Saturday at Atlanta. The former first-round draft pick appeared in 46 games over the past three seasons.\n\nGroome, a 25-year-old who had been on a minor league injured list since mid-April, placed 32 MLB-related bets from July 22, 2020, through July 24, 2021, including 24 on the Boston Red Sox major league team while he was assigned to Boston's High-A team in Greenville, South Carolina. The sport detailed he wagered $453.74 on 30 MLB games and had a net loss of $433.54, receiving payouts on only two wagers. His betting included parlays.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, 23, has been at Double-A Reading this season. He placed 31 bets on baseball on Sept. 30, 2021, and from June 5 through July 30 in 2022, including 28 on MLB and three on college baseball. The total included seven involving the Chicago White Sox at the time he was assigned to their Double-A team in Birmingham, Alabama. Two of the White Sox bets involved outcomes and the others were on runs scored. He bet $749.09 on baseball, of which $724.09 was on MLB-related bets that included parlays.\n\nSaalfrank, 26, pitched in 21 games for Arizona last year between the regular season and postseason, including three World Series games, and two this year before he was optioned to Triple-A Reno on May 1. He placed 29 baseball bets from Sept. 9 through Oct. 29 in 2021 and on March 9, 2022, including 28 on MLB and one parlay on college baseball. He placed four bets on the big league Diamondbacks while on the injured list of their Low A farm team. His baseball bets totaled $445.87 on baseball, including $444.07 on MLB, and lost $272.64 on MLB bets and $1.80 on the college wager.

The total included seven involving the Chicago White Sox at the time he was assigned to their Double-A team in Birmingham, Alabama.

Major League Rule 21, posted in every clubhouse, states betting on any baseball game in which a player, umpire, league official or team employee has no duty to perform results in a one-year suspension. Betting on a game in which the person has a duty to perform results in a lifetime ban.\n\nMarcano became the second North American athlete banned for gambling in recent months.

"Major League Baseball handed San Diego Padres shortstop Tucupita Marcano a lifetime ban on Tuesday after he was found to have violated the league's policy on gambling.\n\nThe announcement followed an investigation into the 24-year-old that found he wagered on more than 200 MLB games, including some that involved the Pittsburgh Pirates during the 2022 and 2023 seasons when he was on the team, ESPN reported.\n\nMarcano was acquired by San Diego last fall.\n\nIn total, the league said Marcano placed 387 bets related to baseball, with 231 of them on MLB games.\n\nMarcano wagered a total of $150,000 on the contests between October 2022 and November 2023.\n\nTwenty-five of the bets involved his own team -- the Pirates -- while he was on the roster but was recovering from surgery for a torn ACL.\n\nHe did not play in any of the games in which he had placed bets and lost each parlay wager that included his own team.\n\nMarcano was said to have ultimately won on 4.3 percent of all bets he placed on the outcomes of MLB games.\n\nHis decision to wager on the games cost him much more than the money he lost as he will never suit up for another team again.\n\nIn a statement, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said that banning Marcano was crucial to protecting the integrity of the game.\n\n\"The strict enforcement of Major League Baseball's rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans,\" Manfred stated.\n\n\"The longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century,\" the commissioner concluded. \"We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people.\"\n\nBaseball clubs are clear with players that gambling on the sport they play is strictly prohibited and what the outcome will be.\n\nPer ESPN, it is believed Marcano is the first active player in 100 years to be handed a lifetime ban.\n\nIn 1924, then-New York Giants outfielder Jimmy O'Connell was also banned for life after he was found to have wagered on games.\n\nPete Rose was given a lifetime ban for gambling in 1989, but it was three years after he retired while he was managing the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nMarcano's bets were reportedly discovered when a \"legal sports betting operator\" reached out to the league to alert MLB officials.\n\nThe Venezuelan national was not the only player punished on Tuesday, but he was the only one to be given a lifetime ban.\n\nOakland Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly was handed a one-year suspension for placing bets on MLB games while he was in the minors.\n\nAdditionally, minor leaguers Jay Groome, Jose Rodriguez and Andrew Saalfrank were all suspended for one year.\n\nEvery player punished on Tuesday denied betting on any games they played in and all denied having wagered with inside information.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He became the first active player in a century banned for life because of gambling.\n\nOakland Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly was suspended for one year for betting on baseball while in the minor leagues and a three minor leaguers also were banned for one year for betting on big league games: pitchers Jay Groome of San Diego and Andrew Saalfrank of Arizona, and infielder Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez of Philadelphia. Each of those four players wagered under $1,000.\n\n\"The strict enforcement of Major League Baseball's rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans,\" baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"The longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century. We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people.\"\n\nMarcano was the first active major leaguer banned for life under the sport's gambling provision since New York Giants outfielder Jimmy O'Connell in 1924. Pete Rose, baseball's career hits leader, agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on Cincinnati Reds games while managing the team.\n\nMajor League Rule 21, posted in every clubhouse, states betting on any baseball game in which a player, umpire, league official or team employee has no duty to perform results in a one-year suspension. Betting on a game in which the person has a duty to perform results in a lifetime ban.\n\nMarcano became the second North American athlete banned for gambling in recent months. The NBA gave Toronto's Jontay Porter a lifetime ban in April after concluding he disclosed confidential information to bettors and wagered on games, including on the Raptors to lose.\n\nMLB said it was tipped off about the betting activity by a legal sports betting operator. None of the players punished played in any games on which they wagered, and all players denied to MLB they had inside information relevant to their bets or the games they gambled on - testimonies that MLB says align with the data received from the sportsbook.\n\nIn its announcement, MLB detailed the bets alleged for each player,\n\nMarcano's 387 baseball bets included 231 MLB-related wagers for $87,319 between Oct. 16, 2022, and last Nov. 1. Twenty-five of those bets included wagers on Pirates games while he was on the team's major league roster. Now 24, Marcano, has not played since tearing his right ACL last July 24 and was receiving medical treatment at PNC Park last year.\n\nMarcano bet almost exclusively on the outcomes of games and lost all of his parlay bets involving the Pirates, winning just 4.3% of all of his MLB-related bets.\n\nMarcano made his major league debut on April 1, 2021, and has a .217 average with five homers, 34 RBIs and seven stolen bases in 149 games. He has played in both the infield and outfield.\n\nThe other four players did not bet on games involving their assigned teams.\n\nKelly placed 10 bets on nine major league games from Oct. 5-17, 2021, while a minor league player assigned to Houston's Triple-A Sugar Land farm team. The bets included wagers on outcomes, over/under on runs and an individual pitcher's strikeout total. Three of the nine games involved the major league Astros. His wagers totaled $99.22 and resulted in $28.30 of winnings.\n\nKelly, 31, was 3-2 with a 2.59 ERA in 28 games this season, last pitching on Saturday at Atlanta. The former first-round draft pick appeared in 46 games over the past three seasons.\n\nGroome, a 25-year-old who had been on a minor league injured list since mid-April, placed 32 MLB-related bets from July 22, 2020, through July 24, 2021, including 24 on the Boston Red Sox major league team while he was assigned to Boston's High-A team in Greenville, South Carolina. The sport detailed he wagered $453.74 on 30 MLB games and had a net loss of $433.54, receiving payouts on only two wagers. His betting included parlays.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, 23, has been at Double-A Reading this season. He placed 31 bets on baseball on Sept. 30, 2021, and from June 5 through July 30 in 2022, including 28 on MLB and three on college baseball. The total included seven involving the Chicago White Sox at the time he was assigned to their Double-A team in Birmingham, Alabama. Two of the White Sox bets involved outcomes and the others were on runs scored. He bet $749.09 on baseball, of which $724.09 was on MLB-related bets that included parlays.\n\nSaalfrank, 26, pitched in 21 games for Arizona last year between the regular season and postseason, including three World Series games, and two this year before he was optioned to Triple-A Reno on May 1. He placed 29 baseball bets from Sept. 9 through Oct. 29 in 2021 and on March 9, 2022, including 28 on MLB and one parlay on college baseball. He placed four bets on the big league Diamondbacks while on the injured list of their Low A farm team. His baseball bets totaled $445.87 on baseball, including $444.07 on MLB, and lost $272.64 on MLB bets and $1.80 on the college wager.

He became the first active player in a century banned for life because of gambling.\n\nOakland Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly was suspended for one year for betting on baseball while in the minor leagues and a three minor leaguers also were banned for one year for betting on big league games: pitchers Jay Groome of San Diego and Andrew Saalfrank of Arizona, and infielder Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez of Philadelphia. Each of those four players wagered under $1,000.\n\n\"The strict enforcement of Major League Baseball's rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans,\" baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"The longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century. We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nMarcano was the first active major leaguer banned for life under the sport's gambling provision since New York Giants outfielder Jimmy O'Connell in 1924. Pete Rose, baseball's career hits leader, agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on Cincinnati Reds games while managing the team.\n\nMajor League Rule 21, posted in every clubhouse, states betting on any baseball game in which a player, umpire, league official or team employee has no duty to perform results in a one-year suspension. Betting on a game in which the person has a duty to perform results in a lifetime ban.\n\nMarcano became the second North American athlete banned for gambling in recent months. The NBA gave Toronto's Jontay Porter a lifetime ban in April after concluding he disclosed confidential information to bettors and wagered on games, including on the Raptors to lose.\n\nMLB said it was tipped off about the betting activity by a legal sports betting operator. None of the players punished played in any games on which they wagered, and all players denied to MLB they had inside information relevant to their bets or the games they gambled on - testimonies that MLB says align with the data received from the sportsbook.\n\nIn its announcement, MLB detailed the bets alleged for each player,\n\nMarcano's 387 baseball bets included 231 MLB-related wagers for $87,319 between Oct. 16, 2022, and last Nov. 1. Twenty-five of those bets included wagers on Pirates games while he was on the team's major league roster. Now 24, Marcano, has not played since tearing his right ACL last July 24 and was receiving medical treatment at PNC Park last year.\n\nMarcano bet almost exclusively on the outcomes of games and lost all of his parlay bets involving the Pirates, winning just 4.3% of all of his MLB-related bets.\n\nMarcano made his major league debut on April 1, 2021, and has a .217 average with five homers, 34 RBIs and seven stolen bases in 149 games. He has played in both the infield and outfield.\n\nThe other four players did not bet on games involving their assigned teams.\n\nKelly placed 10 bets on nine major league games from Oct. 5-17, 2021, while a minor league player assigned to Houston's Triple-A Sugar Land farm team. The bets included wagers on outcomes, over/under on runs and an individual pitcher's strikeout total. Three of the nine games involved the major league Astros. His wagers totaled $99.22 and resulted in $28.30 of winnings.\n\nKelly, 31, was 3-2 with a 2.59 ERA in 28 games this season, last pitching on Saturday at Atlanta. The former first-round draft pick appeared in 46 games over the past three seasons.\n\nGroome, a 25-year-old who had been on a minor league injured list since mid-April, placed 32 MLB-related bets from July 22, 2020, through July 24, 2021, including 24 on the Boston Red Sox major league team while he was assigned to Boston's High-A team in Greenville, South Carolina. The sport detailed he wagered $453.74 on 30 MLB games and had a net loss of $433.54, receiving payouts on only two wagers. His betting included parlays.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, 23, has been at Double-A Reading this season. He placed 31 bets on baseball on Sept. 30, 2021, and from June 5 through July 30 in 2022, including 28 on MLB and three on college baseball. The total included seven involving the Chicago White Sox at the time he was assigned to their Double-A team in Birmingham, Alabama. Two of the White Sox bets involved outcomes and the others were on runs scored. He bet $749.09 on baseball, of which $724.09 was on MLB-related bets that included parlays.\n\nSaalfrank, 26, pitched in 21 games for Arizona last year between the regular season and postseason, including three World Series games, and two this year before he was optioned to Triple-A Reno on May 1. He placed 29 baseball bets from Sept. 9 through Oct. 29 in 2021 and on March 9, 2022, including 28 on MLB and one parlay on college baseball. He placed four bets on the big league Diamondbacks while on the injured list of their Low A farm team. His baseball bets totaled $445.87 on baseball, including $444.07 on MLB, and lost $272.64 on MLB bets and $1.80 on the college wager. He won just five of 28 MLB bets, which included outcomes, runs and pitcher strikeouts.\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures: International soccer, tennis, baseball and more!\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He has played in both the infield and outfield.\n\nU.S. sports leagues have increased monitoring over gambling since the U.S. Supreme Court in May 2018 struck down a federal law that had barred betting on football, basketball, baseball and other sports in most states. Sports books have opened at stadiums across the country across the major U.S. pro sports.\n\nShohei Ohtani's interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after the season opener on March 21 when a federal gambling investigation became public. Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case in which prosecutors allege he stole nearly $17 million from the two-time AL MVP to pay off debts.\n\nBaseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said last month that the sport's department of investigations deferred to the government probe. He noted that MLB has superior methods of monitoring potentially illicit bets with legal sports books than with illegal bookmakers. It is not clear how Marcano might have made his alleged bets.\n\nMLB's top concern with legal sports betting is on action besides the score or outcome, known as prop bets. For instance, wagers that a certain player would steal at least one base in a given game.\n\n\"There are certain kinds of prop bets that are of concern to us and continue to be of concern to us,\" Manfred said. \"Obviously, the potential for something happening in the game that nobody notices is much higher with a lot of kinds of prop bets and you could see where a player would be more tempted to -- all you need to do is miss three free throws; it doesn't necessarily change the outcome of your game.

Pete Rose, baseball's active career hits leader, famously agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on Cincinnati Reds games while managing the team.\n\nOne other big leaguer, Oakland Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly, was declared ineligible for one year on Tuesday for betting on baseball while he was in the minor leagues.

However, he did not appear in any of those games because he was on the injured list following a season-ending knee injury. He was receiving medical treatment at PNC Park during that time.

Mandatory Credit: Gregory Fisher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMajor League Baseball announced on Tuesday that San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano has been permanently banned from the league for gambling on baseball.\n\nIn a press release, MLB revealed that an investigation determined that Marcano bet more than $150,000 on baseball, with $87,319 worth of the wagers involving MLB games. Marcano placed the bets over a period of a week in October 2022 and a roughly four-month span from July 2023 to November 2023.\n\nMarcano placed more than 200 bets involving MLB games, with 25 of the bets involving the Pittsburgh Pirates when Marcano was on the team's Major League roster. According to investigators, \"almost all\" of Marcano's bets on the Pirates involved Pittsburgh winning or the over/under run total in his team's games. There is no evidence to suggest that the outcome of any of the games on which Marcano placed bets was influenced.\n\nIn total, MLB determined that Marcano placed 231 MLB-related wagers and won just 4.3% of them.\n\nMLB also announced that four other players -- Oakland Athletics reliever Michael Kelly, Padres minor-league pitcher Jay Groome, Philadelphia Phillies minor-league infielder Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez, and Arizona Diamondbacks minor-league pitcher Andrew Saalfrank -- have each been banned one year for unrelated violations of the league's gambling policy.\n\nBetting on baseball is strictly prohibited by MLB rules. Players found to have bet on their own team face a lifetime ban, while those who bet on other teams can be suspended for up to a year. Betting on sports other than baseball is permitted as long as the bets are placed legally.

Specifics of those bets aren't yet known. Four other players are also reportedly under investigation for allegedly betting on games in the minor leagues, too.\n\nThough the investigation into Marcano is still ongoing, a decision on the potential lifetime ban \"could be imminent,\" according to ESPN's Jeff Passan:\n\nMarcano, 24, has not played for the Padres this season. He went down with a right ACL injury in 2023 when he was with the Pirates, and he's been recovering ever since. According to the report, Marcano bet on Pirates games only after he went down with the injury.\n\nThe Padres, who first signed him out of Venezuela and gave him his major league start in 2021, then signed him to a one-year deal this past offseason.\n\nMarcano, the league and the Players Association all declined to comment to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMarcano held a career-high .233 batting average last season with the Pirates. He had 18 RBI, 47 hits and three home runs in 75 games. He tore his ACL in late July, and missed the rest of the season as a result.\n\nThe gambling allegations against Marcano are just the latest in the league and the sports world in general in recent months. Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter pleaded guilty to charges after he reportedly stole nearly $17 million from Ohtani to cover his illegal gambling losses. Ohtani was not involved in that scandal, which dominated the sport in the lead-up to the season.\n\nToronto Raptors player Jontay Porter was given a lifetime ban from the NBA earlier this year, too, after the league said he purposely limited his participation in games for betting purposes and for betting on games. Porter, who is the brother of Denver Nuggets star Michael Porter Jr., was on a two-way deal with the franchise.\n\nWest Ham midfielder Lucas Paquet\u00e1 was charged by the English Football Association for allegedly breaching their betting rules last month. Former Alabama baseball coach Brad Bohannon was fired after a friend of his tried to make a $100,000 bet on the team. The NFL has cracked down on gambling, too, as several players have been hit with suspensions for violating gambling rules either while in the league or while in college.\n\nLike in the NFL, Major League Baseball's gambling policy prohibits players from placing any bets on baseball. They are allowed to bet on other sports legally. Any player who places a wager on a baseball game involving a team other than their own receives a one-year suspension, but betting on your own team leads to a lifetime ban.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iv\u00e1n_Marcano", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iv\u00e1n Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucupita_Marcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucupita Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Passan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Passan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Paquet\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Paquet\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Porter_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Porter Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eYL5XPEiTlhsgw6rpg.GoA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-06/63bf7800-21e3-11ef-9f3a-c492549200d3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621706", "eventUri": "eng-9621706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

MLB is looking into allegations Marcano bet on games involving the Pittsburgh Pirates while on the team's injured list last season, according to the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing. Marcano, 24, has not played since tearing his right ACL last July 24. He was claimed by the Padres off waivers on Nov. 2 and placed on the 10-day injured list March 19. MLB's investigation was first reported Monday by The Wall Street Journal. \"We are aware of an active investigation by Major League Baseball regarding a matter that occurred when the player in question was a member of another organization and not affiliated with the San Diego Padres,\"\u009d the team said in a statement. \"We will not have any further comment until the investigative process has been completed.\"\u009d Marcano's agent, Michel Velasquez of Rimas Sports, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

In addition, betting on other sports with an illegal bookmaker is subject to discipline deemed appropriate by the baseball commissioner. Career hits leader Pete Rose agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989 after an MLB investigation concluded he bet on Cincinnati Reds games while managing the team. The last active MLB player suspended under the gambling provision appears to be New York Giants outfielder Jimmy O'Connell, banned for life along with coach Cozy Dolan in 1924 for offering a $500 bribe to Philadelphia Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand to throw a game that Sept. 27. Marcano made his major league debut on April 1, 2021, and has a .217 average with five homers, 34 RBIs and seven stolen bases in 149 games.

Sports books have opened at stadiums across the country across the major U.S. pro sports.\n\nShohei Ohtani's interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after the season opener on March 21 when a federal gambling investigation became public. Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case in which prosecutors allege he stole nearly $17 million from the two-time AL MVP to pay off debts.\n\nBaseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said last month that the sport's department of investigations deferred to the government probe. He noted that MLB has superior methods of monitoring potentially illicit bets with legal sports books than with illegal bookmakers. It is not clear how Marcano might have made his alleged bets.\n\nMLB's top concern with legal sports betting is on action besides the score or outcome, known as prop bets. For instance, wagers that a certain player would steal at least one base in a given game.\n\n\"There are certain kinds of prop bets that are of concern to us and continue to be of concern to us,\" Manfred said. \"Obviously, the potential for something happening in the game that nobody notices is much higher with a lot of kinds of prop bets and you could see where a player would be more tempted to -- all you need to do is miss three free throws; it doesn't necessarily change the outcome of your game. Your team may pick you up and life moves on. It's just easier to have a problem on a prop bet. I think it's just human nature. So, yeah, we remain concerned about them and have lobbied for certain types of prop bets not to be allowable.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Greg Beacham and Will Graves contributed to this

Those players are Tucupita Marcano of the San Diego Padres (a lifetime ban), Michael Kelly of the Oakland Athletics, Jay Groome (Padres), Andrew Saalfrank (Arizona Diamondbacks) and Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez (Philadelphia Phillies).\n\nThe league has permanently banned Marcano after discovering that he placed a whopping 231 MLB bets from Oct. 16, 2022, to Nov. 1, 2023. According to MLB, Marcano wagered over $150,000 on MLB games, including 25 wagers when he was with the Pittsburgh Pirates:\n\n\"Consistent with Marcano's overall baseball betting activity, almost all of Marcano's Pirates bets were on which Club (the Pirates or their opponent) would win the game or whether there would be more or less than a certain number of runs scored in the game. Ultimately, Marcano lost all of his parlays involving the Pirates and only won 4.3% of all of his MLB-related bets overall.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest -- and Marcano denies -- that any outcomes in the baseball games on which he placed bets were compromised, influenced, or manipulated in any way.\"\n\nAlso Read: National League Powerhouse Lands Blue Jays Superstar Bo Bichette In Massive Trade Proposal That Would Make Them Overwhelming World Series Favorites\n\nSadly, these five MLB players aren't the only professional athletes to land in hot water for gambling violations.

He spent the next two seasons with the Pirates, posting a career MLB batting average of .217 with a .589 OPS, five homers and 34 RBI.\n\nThe Padres brought back Marcano on a new deal last year. He never played a game during the 2024 regular season as he recovered from surgery on a torn ACL.\n\nUnfortunately, Marcano's gambling habits have taken away the dream of growing into a full-time MLB starter.

been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people.\"\n\nAccording to data obtained from a legal sports betting operator, MLB concluded that Marcano placed 387 baseball bets, including 231 MLB-related wagers from Oct. 16-23, 2022 and from July 12, 2023 through Nov. 1, 2023.\n\nIn

outcomes in the baseball games on which he placed bets were compromised, influenced, or manipulated in any way.\n\nMarcano first signed with San Diego as an amateur out of Venezuela in 2016 and made his MLB debut in 2021, appearing in 25 games for the club that season before being traded in July of that year to the Pirates.\n\nMarcano had surgery to repair a torn right anterior cruciate ligament that he sustained last July when he awkwardly stepped on third base during a game.\n\nThe Padres selected Marcano off waivers last November but he had not played for the team since being acquired.\n\nOakland Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly was also suspended one year for betting on MLB games while he was playing in the minor leagues.\n\nIn addition, MLB said minor league players Jay Groome (Padres pitcher), Jose Rodriguez (Philadelphia Phillies infielder) and Andrew Saalfrank (Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher) were each banned one year for betting on MLB games.\n\n(Reporting by Frank

He has played in both the infield and outfield.\n\nU.S. sports leagues have increased monitoring over gambling since the U.S. Supreme Court in May 2018 struck down a federal law that had barred betting on football, basketball, baseball and other sports in most states. Sports books have opened at stadiums across the country across the major U.S. pro sports.\n\nShohei Ohtani's interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after the season opener on March 21 when a federal gambling investigation became public. Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case in which prosecutors allege he stole nearly $17 million from the two-time AL MVP to pay off debts.\n\nBaseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said last month that the sport's department of investigations deferred to the government probe. He noted that MLB has superior methods of monitoring potentially illicit bets with legal sports books than with illegal bookmakers. It is not clear how Marcano might have made his alleged bets.\n\nMLB's top concern with legal sports betting is on action besides the score or outcome, known as prop bets. For instance, wagers that a certain player would steal at least one base in a given game.\n\n\"There are certain kinds of prop bets that are of concern to us and continue to be of concern to us,\" Manfred said. \"Obviously, the potential for something happening in the game that nobody notices is much higher with a lot of kinds of prop bets and you could see where a player would be more tempted to -- all you need to do is miss three free throws; it doesn't necessarily change the outcome of your game. Your team may pick you up and life moves on. It's just easier to have a problem on a prop bet. I think it's just human nature. So, yeah, we remain concerned about them and have lobbied for certain types of prop bets not to be allowable.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writers Greg Beacham and Will Graves contributed to this report.",

While The Journal does not have the specifics of those bets, the report states four other players are also under investigation for betting on minor-league contests.\n\nESPN added that the league's investigation into Marcano remains ongoing, though a lifetime ban from the league \"could be imminent.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\n\"We are aware of an active investigation by Major League Baseball regarding a matter that occurred when the player in question was a member of another organization and not affiliated with the San Diego Padres,\" the Padres told The Wall Street Journal in a statement. \"We will not have any further comment until the investigation process has been completed.\"\n\nMarcano, a Venezuela native, suffered a right ACL tear last season with the Pirates, ending his campaign after 75 games. He hit .233/.276/.356 with three homers, 12 doubles, two triples and 18 RBI over 202 at-bats.\n\nSHOHEI OHTANI'S FORMER INTERPRETER IPPEI MIZUHARA AGREES TO PLEAD GUILTY TO FEDERAL BANK, TAX FRAUD CHARGES\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Marcano's bets only came after he was injured.\n\nMarcano has not played with the Padres at any level this season, as he continues to recover from his injury.\n\nMarcano's betting allegations come as MLB dealt with Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani's now-former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, reportedly stealing nearly $17 million from the ballplayer to cover gambling losses. Mizuhara pled guilty to federal bank and tax fraud charges following an investigation.\n\nA lifetime ban was also seen in the NBA this past regular season, as Toronto Raptors forward Jontay Porter was found to be purposefully limiting his availability in games for betting purposes, while also betting on games.\n\nEvery professional sports league in the country has similar gambling policies, which prohibit players from placing any bets on their own sport. MLB allows bets to be made on other sports legally.\n\nPer the league's gambling policy, betting on a baseball game involving a team other than the player's own would be a one-year suspension. However, betting on your own team leads to a lifetime ban from the league.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMarcano started his career with the Padres, making his debut in 2021 when he slashed .182/.280/.205 over 25 games.

MLB is making sure there is no confusion with its decision to ban Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano for life over gambling violations.\n\nAn investigation into Marcano was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Monday, with the revelation that four other players are also under investigation by the league. MLB announced Marcano's ban on Tuesday, June 4.\n\nThe NBA faced a similar situation in April when Raptors forward Jontay Porter was permanently banned from the league after it was found that he bet against himself a month earlier.\n\nWhile each league might be fortunate that the subjects of the ban were largely low-profile talents, both situations are a reminder of the potential crisis professional sports would face if larger violations came to light.\n\nHere's a look at why Marcano was banned for life, plus a dive into his background.\n\nMORE: Which players benefit most from MLB-Negro Leagues stats integration?\n\nMarcano was under investigation for betting on Pirates games while on the injured list with the Pirates in 2023. His bets were flagged by a sportsbook and reported to MLB, according to ESPN.\n\nWhile that means Marcano wasn't betting in games he could directly impact, as he was recovering from a torn ACL at the time, betting on baseball is strictly against MLB rules for players and triggered a lifetime ban.\n\nFive players, including Marcano, are the subject of MLB's investigation into gambling violations, the Wall Street Journal reported. A's Michael Kelly, Padres' Jay Groome, Phillies Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez and Diamondbacks' Andrew Saalfrank each face a one-year ban.\n\nMarcano's ban marks the second major gambling scandal of the year for MLB, though the first wasn't centered on a player. Shohei Ohtani's interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was fired by the Dodgers in March after the revelation that he bet on sports with an illegal bookmaker and stole millions from Ohtani to cover his gambling debts. Mizuhara faced federal charges and agreed to a plea deal in May, though the deal hasn't yet been finalized.\n\nNo evidence connects Ohtani to the bookmaker, but Braves minor-leaguer and former Angels infielder David Fletcher is reportedly under investigation for placing bets with the same bookmaker.\n\nMarcano was claimed by the Padres this past offseason after spending two seasons in Pittsburgh. Here's a closer look at his career.\n\nMarcano made his MLB debut with the Padres at only 21 in 2021. He was traded to the Pirates in a midseason deal that sent Adam Frazier to San Diego.\n\nMarcano found an opportunity for playing time in Pittsburgh, appearing in 49 games in 2022 but batting just .206 with two home runs and a .562 OPS. Marcano hit .233 with a .633 OPS across 75 games in 2023 before suffering a torn ACL.\n\nIt was at that point that Marcano reportedly bet on baseball, doing so while he was out on the injured list with the Pirates.\n\nMarcano was claimed by the Padres on Nov. 2 and remained on the major-league IL while continuing his recovery from a torn ACL before the lifetime ban.\n\nMORE: How Luis Gil became surprise Cy Young candidate\n\nMarcano's MLB future was uncertain before his gambling violations came to light, as he struggled through parts of three seasons to start his career.\n\nWhile he's still just 24 and was capable of playing both middle infield positions as well as the outfield, Marcano had just a .589 OPS across 149 games and didn't show signs of hitting for much power.", "source":

Marcano's ban was accompanied by one-year suspensions for four other players: Oakland Athletics reliever Michael Kelly and minor-league players Jay Groome (Padres pitcher), Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez (Philadelphia Phillies infielder) and Andrew Saalfrank (Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher).\n\nMLB received data from a legal sports betting operator concerning baseball gambling activity from accounts that belonged to the above players, the league announced. Under MLB's rules, personnel are allowed to partake in sports gambling provided that it is legal in their jurisdiction and that they do not bet on diamond sports -- that is, baseball or softball. Each player violated the second part of that.\n\nNone of the players are appealing their suspension.\n\n\"The strict enforcement of Major League Baseball's rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans,\" commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"The longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century. We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people. Since the Supreme Court decision opened the door to legalized sports betting, we have worked with licensed sports betting operators and other third parties to put ourselves in a better position from an integrity perspective through the transparency that a regulated sports betting system can provide. MLB will continue to invest heavily in integrity monitoring, educational programming and awareness initiatives with the goal of ensuring strict adherence to this fundamental rule of our game.\"\n\nHere's what you need to know about Marcano, the other players, and MLB's history of gambling penalties.\n\nMarcano banned for life\n\nMarcano, 24, was signed by the Padres as an amateur free agent out of Venezuela in 2016. He was traded to the Pirates in 2021 with Jack Suwinski for Adam Frazier and last November went back to the Padres on waivers. He hasn't played a game since last July after tearing his ACL.\n\nMLB's investigation found that Marcano didn't just bet on baseball frequently -- he's claimed to have gambled more than $150,000 across nearly 400 baseball bets, including on MLB and international contests -- but that he even bet on his own team, then the Pirates. \"[Almost] all of Marcano's Pirates bets were on which club (the Pirates or their opponent) would win the game or whether there would be more or less than a certain number of runs scored in the game,\" MLB said in a press release.\n\nIt's notable that Marcano did not appear in any of the games that he bet on because of his injury. He also denied having inside information that influenced his bets. MLB estimates that he won just 4.3% of his MLB-related gambles.\n\nOther players didn't bet on own games\n\nAs for the other players -- Kelly, Groome, Rodr\u00edguez, and Saalfrank -- they all placed bets on MLB games that they were not part of themselves. They did, however, bet on games played by their organization's major-league team while they were in the minors. None of them bet on baseball with the frequency that Marcano, either.\n\nHere's a complete breakdown of the data MLB provided on the four players' bets:\n\nPlayerMLB betsAverage $ per betNet\n\nKelly\n\n10\n\n$9.92\n\n$28.30\n\nGroome\n\n32\n\n$15.12\n\n-$433.54\n\nRodr\u00edguez\n\n28\n\n$25.86\n\nN/A\n\nSaalfrank\n\n28\n\n$15.86\n\n-$272.64\n\nKelly, 31, is the most notable of the bunch given that he was a member of the Athletics' active roster. In 28 games this season, he had amassed a 2.59 ERA (151 ERA+) and a 2.20 strikeout-to-walk ratio. Kelly, then with the Astros' Triple-A team, placed 10 bets on nine MLB games (including three Houston games) between Oct. 5, 2021 through Oct. 17, 2021. In total, he bet $99.22 and won five of the bets, putting him at a net win of $28.30.\n\nGroome, assigned to the Red Sox's High-A team, made 32 bets on MLB games between July 22, 2020 through July 24, 2021, including 24 on Boston games. He bet $453.74 and lost $433.54. He received payouts on just two bets.\n\nRodr\u00edguez, who was playing for the White Sox's Double-A team, made 31 baseball bets on Sept. 30, 2021, and from June 5, 2022 through July 30, 2022, including on several college baseball games. In total, he bet $749.09 on baseball, $724.09 of which went to MLB-related bets.\n\nSaalfrank, who was on the injured list in the Diamondbacks' Low-A affiliate, made 28 MLB-related bets and one on college baseball games between Sept. 9, 2021 and Oct. 29, 2021 and on March 9, 2022. He bet $445.87 on baseball, with $444.07 of that on MLB-related bets. He had a net loss of $272.64 on MLB bets, losing all but five of his bets. He also lost his $1.80 college bet. Saalfrank pitched in two games in the majors for the Diamondbacks this year and in the 2023 playoffs for Arizona, including three games in the World Series.\n\nMLB's gambling policy\n\nAs noted in the introduction, MLB allows personnel to gamble on sports provided that it's legal in their territory and that it's on non-diamond sports. The individuals suspended on Tuesday were found to have violated Rule 21, which features two notable points.\n\nThe first, violated by the non-Marcano players, states: \"Any player, umpire, or Club or League official or employee, who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has no duty to perform, shall be declared ineligible for one year.\"\n\nThe other, violated specifically by Marcano, states: \"Any player, umpire, or Club or League official or employee, who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform, shall be declared permanently ineligible.\"\n\nOther MLB gambling scandals\n\nEarlier this season, Ippei Mizuhara -- Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter -- was charged with stealing more than $16 million from Ohtani to pay off gambling debts to an illegal bookie. He faces a maximum of 33 years in prison. Braves minor-leaguer David Fletcher is also being investigated by MLB for placing bets with the same illegal bookmaker that Mizuhara used. Neither Mizuhara nor Fletcher is alleged to have gambled on baseball, but betting on any sport through illegal channels is also forbidden by MLB. Earlier this year, CBS Sports delved into more detail on other historical baseball gambling scandals.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors":

He has not appeared in a Padres game this season as he recovers from knee surgery.\n\nFour more players, including Andrew Saalfrank, a member of the National League pennant-winning Arizona Diamondbacks, received one-year bans for betting on MLB games, occurring in a period spanning July 2020 and July 2022. Jay Groome, a former top Red Sox prospect now in the Padres system, placed 24 of his 32 bets on the Red Sox while he was in their minor league system.\n\nOakland Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly, who has appeared in 46 major league games for Cleveland, Philadelphia and the A's since 2022, placed 10 bets on MLB games in October 2021 when he was a member of the Astros organization.\n\nPhillies minor league infielder Jose Rodriguez placed three bets on college baseball games and 28 bets on MLB games on Sept. 30, 2021 and between June 5 and June 30, 2022, when he was in the White Sox organization.\n\nAnd Saalfrank, who did not give up an earned run in 10 appearances for the Diamondbacks in 2023, placed 28 bets on MLB games and one college baseball parlay in September and October 2021, and on March 9, 2022.\n\nBut the most startling finding by MLB's Department of Investigations - working in collaboration with MLB's betting partners, the league said - involved Marcano.\n\nHe bet $87,319 on MLB games, averaging $378 per bet, largely parlays or multi-sport parlays in which an MLB game was a leg of the bet. His longest period of betting occurred between July 12 and Nov. 1, 2023; he suffered his season-ending knee injury on July 24, 2023.\n\nMLB reports that Marcano lost all of his bets involving the Pirates, and lost 95.7% of his bets involving MLB games.\n\n\"There is no evidence to suggest -- and Marcano denies -- that any outcomes in the baseball games on which he placed bets were compromised, influenced, or manipulated in any way,\" MLB said in its statement.\n\nMLB's permanently ineligible list dates to the 19 century, when players were banned for game-fixing and other improprieties. Most notably, eight players from the Chicago White Sox were banned in 1921 after MLB ruled they conspired to fix the 1919 World Series.\n\nAnd all-time hits leader Pete Rose remains banned for life after he gambled on Cincinnati Reds games that he managed.\n\nYet after the widespread acceptance of legalized sports gambling following a 2018 Supreme Court decision - it's now legal in 38 states and the District of Columbia - the calculus has significantly changed. It leaves MLB in a position to welcome the revenue of online sports books - it has official partnerships with FanDuel, DraftKings and MGM - while aiming to maintain the integrity of its games.\n\n\"The strict enforcement of Major League Baseball's rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans,\" commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \" The longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century. We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people.\n\n\"Since the Supreme Court decision opened the door to legalized sports betting, we have worked with licensed sports betting operators and other third parties to put ourselves in a better position from an integrity perspective through the transparency that a regulated sports betting system can provide. MLB will continue to invest heavily in integrity monitoring, educational programming and awareness initiatives with the goal of ensuring strict adherence to this fundamental rule of our game.\"",

After starting his career with the Padres in 2021, he played in Pittsburgh the last two years before returning to San Diego on a waiver claim last November.\n\nHe hasn't played a game since tearing his ACL with the Pirates last July, but he was hitting .233 with three HR, 18 RBI and five stolen bases before the injury.\n\nWhat did he do?\n\nMarcano is being investigated for betting on games involving the Pirates while he was on the injured list for the team, WSJ's Jared Diamond and Lindsey Adler have reported.\n\nThough he declined to comment, as well as MLB and the MLBPA, the Padres said they were aware of an active investigation.\n\n\"We are aware of an active investigation by Major League Baseball regarding a matter that occurred when the player in question was a member of another organization and not affiliated with the San Diego Padres. We will not have any further comment until the investigative process has been completed.\"\n\nWhat will the punishment be?\n\nIf Marcano did bet on games involving his own team, the punishment could be a lifetime ban from baseball.\n\nWSJ is reporting the punishment hasn't been finalized, pending negotiations between the league and players association. However, MLB only allows for players to bet on sports other than baseball. Players who bet on MLB games not involving than their own teams face a one-year ban, and players who bet on games involving their teams face a lifetime suspension.\n\nMarcano isn't alone\n\nFour other players also face potential discipline for betting on baseball while in the minor leagues, according to the WSJ. Though the names of those players weren't reported.\n\nThis news comes after ESPN reported in May that former Angles infielder and current Braves minor leaguer David Fletcher bet on sports with the same illegal bookmaker as Shohei Ohtani's ex-interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara.

He finally reached the big leagues in 2021 with the Padres, recording his first MLB hit in a game against the San Francisco Giants that April. He also hit his first MLB home run that season in a game for the Pittsburgh Pirates, as he was traded to the NL Central team ahead of the trade deadline that year.\n\nBut any dreams of further MLB success are now over.\n\nMarcano was one of five players suspended by the league on Tuesday for betting on baseball. Along with Marcano, Michael Kelly of the Oakland A's was the other MLB player hit with disciplinary action by the league. Three Minor League players -- Jay Groome, Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez, and Andrew Saalfrank -- were also disciplined.\n\nWhile the other four players were all given one-year suspensions, Marcano has been banned from the game for life.\n\nHere is why.\n\nAccording to the league, in March of 2024 MLB \"... learned from a legal sports betting operator that it had identified past baseball betting activity from accounts connected to multiple Major and Minor League players.\" This information touched off a lengthy investigation by the league that \" ... included interviews, thorough review of the available information in each matter, and significant cooperation from MLB's legal sportsbook partners.\"\n\nOver the course of their investigation, the league found that:\n\n\"None of these players played in any game on which they placed a bet. Further, all of the players denied that they had any inside information relevant to the bets or that any of the baseball games they bet on were compromised or manipulated, and the betting data does not suggest that any outcomes in the baseball games on which they placed bets were compromised, influenced, or manipulated in any way. None of the players are appealing their discipline.\"\n\nHowever Rule 21(d), which governs sports betting, reads as follows:\n\n(1) Any player, umpire, or Club or League official or employee, who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has no duty to perform, shall be declared ineligible for one year.\n\n(2) Any player, umpire, or Club or League official or employee, who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform, shall be declared permanently ineligible.\n\nRegarding Marcano, the investigation found that he placed a staggering number of bets on MLB games, including during a period of time he was rehabbing for a knee injury with the Pirates.\n\nAccording to the league's investigation, \"[b]etting data shows that from October 16, 2022 through October 23, 2022, and from July 12, 2023 through November 1, 2023, Marcano placed 387 baseball bets, including 231 MLB-related bets among other bets on international baseball games through a legal sportsbook. Marcano's MLB bets were generally parlays, which would sometimes include multiple MLB-related legs, and they would sometimes include MLB-related legs and non-MLB legs.\"\n\nThe league's investigation uncovered that the infielder \" ... bet more than $150,000 on baseball, with $87,319 of that on MLB-related bets (an average of approximately $378 per bet). Of the over 200 MLB bets Marcano placed over this period, 25 of those bets included Pirates games while he was assigned to the Pirates' Major League Club. Marcano did not appear in any of the games on which he placed bets, however, because all of Marcano's Pirates-related bets, and the vast majority of his bets overall, occurred during the period after he suffered a season-ending knee injury on July 24, 2023 and was receiving medical treatment at PNC Park.\"\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that Marcano \"compromised, influenced, or manipulated\" games in any way.\n\nOf those bets he made, Marcano \"only won 4.3% of all of his MLB-related bets overall,\" and lost every parlay bet he made involving the Pirates.\n\nGiven that some of those bets were made while Marcano was undergoing treatment from the Pirates at PNC Park for his knee injury, Marcano's activity fell under Rule 21(d)(2) of the MLB Rules, which outlines that players cannot place bets on games involving their own team.\n\nAs such, his conduct necessitated a permanent ban from major league baseball.\n\nThe other four players -- Kelly, Groome, Rodr\u00edguez, Saalfrank -- were all found to have bet on MLB games, but according to the league's investigation none of their bets involved their own team. For example, Saalfrank \"... placed 29 baseball bets, including 28 MLB-related bets and one parlay bet on college baseball games, while he was on a Minor League contract with the Diamondbacks. Saalfrank placed all of his MLB-related bets, including four bets involving the Diamondbacks' Major League team, while he was assigned to and on the Injured List of the Diamondbacks' Low-A affiliate.\"\n\nThe investigation found that Saalfrank \" ... bet $445.87 on baseball, with $444.07 of that on MLB-related bets (an average of approximately $15.86 per bet) and with a net loss of $272.64 on MLB bets.\"\n\nHe won only five of his 28 MLB bets, and lost the single college bet, where he wagered $1.80.\n\nIn the announcement from the league Tuesday, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred issued this statement:\n\n\"The strict enforcement of Major League Baseball's rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans. The longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century.

Sports books have opened at stadiums across the country across the major U.S. pro sports.\n\nShohei Ohtani's interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after the season opener on March 21 when a federal gambling investigation became public. Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case in which prosecutors allege he stole nearly $17 million from the two-time AL MVP to pay off debts.\n\nBaseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said last month that the sport's department of investigations deferred to the government probe. He noted that MLB has superior methods of monitoring potentially illicit bets with legal sports books than with illegal bookmakers. It is not clear how Marcano might have made his alleged bets.\n\nMLB's top concern with legal sports betting is on action besides the score or outcome, known as prop bets. For instance, wagers that a certain player would steal at least one base in a given game.\n\n\"There are certain kinds of prop bets that are of concern to us and continue to be of concern to us,\" Manfred said. \"Obviously, the potential for something happening in the game that nobody notices is much higher with a lot of kinds of prop bets and you could see where a player would be more tempted to -- all you need to do is miss three free throws; it doesn't necessarily change the outcome of your game. Your team may pick you up and life moves on. It's just easier to have a problem on a prop bet. I think it's just human nature. So, yeah, we remain concerned about them and have lobbied for certain types of prop bets not to be allowable.\"\n\nAP Sports Writers Greg Beacham and Will Graves contributed to this report.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Pete Rose, baseball's active career hits leader, famously agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on Cincinnati Reds games while managing the team.\n\nOne other big leaguer, Oakland Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly, was declared ineligible for one year on Tuesday for betting on baseball while he was in the minor leagues. Additionally, minor leaguers Jay Groome of San Diego, Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez of Philadelphia and Andrew Saalfrank of Arizona were banned for one year for betting on major league games.\n\nMasyn Winn's hit streak halts with strategic decision Cardinals manager 'didn't want to make' Girl found dead in Jefferson County was aspiring softball pitcher, 'loved everybody' Battlehawks employ UFL rulebook to earn win, capture home field for playoffs Sultan: How much longer will the cicadas be here?

None of the players punished played in any games on which they wagered, and all players denied to MLB they had inside information relevant to their bets or the games they bet on - testimonies that MLB says align with the data received from the sportsbook.\n\n\"The strict enforcement of Major League Baseball's rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans,\" Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"The longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century. We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people.\"\n\nMarcano was found to have placed 387 baseball bets, including 231 MLB-related wagers, between Oct. 16, 2022 and Nov. 1, 2023, totaling over $150,000. The league says 25 of those bets included wagers on Pittsburgh Pirates games while he was on the team's major league roster. However, he did not appear in any of those games because he was on the injured list following a season-ending knee injury. He was receiving medical treatment at PNC Park during that time. Marcano bet almost exclusively on the outcomes of games and lost all of his parlay bets involving the Pirates, winning just 4.3% of all of his MLB-related bets.\n\nMajor League Rule 21, posted in every clubhouse, states betting on any baseball game in which a player, umpire, league official or team employee has no duty to perform results in a one-year suspension. Betting on a game in which the person has a duty to perform results in a lifetime ban.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Marcano, a 24-year-old native of Venezuela, reportedly placed the bets in 2023, when he was a member of the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\nThe Pirates, in a statement to USA TODAY Sports, said they are \"fully cooperating\" with the MLB probe.\n\nMarcano suffered a torn ACL in his right knee in July 2023 and has been on the injured list since. The Padres, who originally signed him out of Venezuela in 2016, claimed him off waivers from Pittsburgh in November.\n\nUnder MLB's gambling policy, players face a one-year ban for betting on a major league game and a lifetime ban if they placed bets on games involving their own team. The Journal reported that he placed bets on games involving the Pirates.\n\n\"We are aware of an active investigation by Major League Baseball regarding a matter that occurred when the player in question was a member of another organization and not affiliated with the San Diego Padres,\" the Padres said in a statement released to news outlets, including USA TODAY Sports. \"We will not have any further comment until the investigative process has been completed.\"\n\nSaid the Pirates in a statement: \"We are aware of the matter that's under investigation and are fully cooperating. We will refrain from further comment at this time.\"\n\nMLB's relationship with illegal gambling - dating to the 1919 World Series infamously thrown by the Chicago White Sox, through the shame of all-time hits leader Pete Rose earning a lifetime ban for betting on games he managed for the Cincinnati Reds - has given way to an uneasy embrace, since the 2018 Supreme Court decision that left legalized gambling up to the states.\n\nThe league - and virtually every team - has signed multiple official agreements with online and physical casinos, while maintaining a ban on baseball betting for its players.\n\n\"DO NOT BET ON BASEBALL,\" reads a placard in major league clubhouses, with a QR code sending them to a web site that spells out baseball's gambling policy. It states that players may not bet on baseball at any level, nor can they ask others to place bets on their behalf.\n\nYet the Marcano investigation is the league's second high-profile scandal just two months into the season. Ippei Mizuhara, the longtime interpreter for dual-threat superstar Shohei Ohtani, was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers and has reached a plea agreement with federal prosecutors after he allegedly stole nearly $17 million from Ohtani.\n\nMizuhara has said he has an online account with DraftKings and assumed the bets with the alleged bookmaker were legal.\n\nThat federal probe also sparked an investigation into longtime major league infielder David Fletcher, who introduced Mizuhara to the alleged bookmaker and, ESPN reported, placed bets on sports other than baseball with the bookie. Fletcher is currently with the Atlanta Braves' Class AAA team.\n\nSince the 2018 Supreme Court decision, 38 states, including Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia have legalized sports gambling. MLB has official partnerships with online casinos FanDuel, DraftKings and MGM.\n\nMarcano made his major league debut for the Padres in 2021 and has played in 149 career games, with a .217 average, five home runs and a .589 OPS. He was traded along with outfielder Jack Suwinski to Pittsburgh in July 2021 in exchange for infielder Adam Frazier.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"},

Notable offenders most famously include the all-time hits leader Pete Rose.\n\nBetween Oct. 16, 2022 and Nov. 1, 2023, Marcano was found to have bet a total of $150,000, including $87,319 on MLB. The averaged amount of money placed on each bet included $378. Then the total amount of MLB bets were 231 and of those 25 were bets on Pirates games.\n\nIf you are curious how much Marcano won, he had a winning percentage of 4.3%. That is to say, unlike Rose, Marcano reportedly did not appear in any games that he bet on, which is because his season ended early when he underwent surgery.\n\nNow for the specifics of the regulations involving Rule 21, a player, or coach or umpire, is not allowed to bet on baseball, but if they do bet on a team they are not affiliated with, then it is only a one-year suspension. Then on the other hand, if a player bets on a game in which they are subject to participate in, it is indeed a lifetime ban.\n\nThere were a list of minor league players that were investigated by the MLB for sports betting, and they all were suspended for one year. However in Marcano's case it was more serious and violated the part of the rule that says no betting on your own organization, for there could be insider information that one could use to their advantage.", "source": {"uri": "fanbuzz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FanBuzz - Sports News - NFL | NCAA | NBA |  WWE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brandon_santomauro@fanbuzz.com", "name": "Brandon Santomauro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucupita_Marcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucupita Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winning percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://fanbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/06/IMG_0442.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621706", "eventUri": "eng-9621706", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-10-", "textStart": 515, "textEnd": 522}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Four other players are also reportedly under investigation for allegedly betting on games in the minor leagues, too.\n\nThough the investigation into Marcano is still ongoing, a decision on the potential lifetime ban \"could be imminent,\" according to ESPN's Jeff Passan.\n\nMarcano, 24, has not played for the Padres this season. He went down with a right ACL injury late last season when he was with the Pirates, and he's been recovering ever since. According to the report, Marcano bet on Pirates games after he went down with the injury.\n\nThe Padres, who first signed him out of Venezuela and gave him his major league start in 2021, then signed him to a one-year deal this past offseason.\n\nMarcano, the league and the players association all declined to comment to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nMarcano held a career-high .233 batting average last season with the Pirates. He had 18 RBI, 47 hits and three home runs in 75 games. He tore his ACL in late July, and missed the rest of the season as a result.\n\nThe allegations against Marcano are just the latest in the league and the sports world in general in recent months. Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter pleaded guilty to charges after he reportedly stole nearly $17 million from him to cover up illegal gambling losses. Ohtani was not involved in that scandal, which dominated the sport in the lead up to the season.\n\nToronto Raptors player Jontay Porter was given a lifetime ban from the NBA earlier this year, too, after the league said he purposely limited his participation in games for betting purposes and for betting on games.

We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people.\"\n\nMarcano was found to have placed 387 baseball bets, including 231 MLB-related wagers, between Oct. 16, 2022 and Nov. 1, 2023, totaling over $150,000. The league says 25 of those bets included wagers on Pittsburgh Pirates games while he was on the team's major league roster. However, he did not appear in any of those games because he was on the injured list following a season-ending knee injury. He was receiving medical treatment at PNC Park during that time.

Marcano's ban was accompanied by one-year suspensions for four other players.\n\nMLB's press release revealed the following as part of its investigation into Marcano's gambling:\n\nIn total, Marcano bet more than $150,000 on baseball, with $87,319 of that on MLB-related bets (an average of approximately $378 per bet). Of the over 200 MLB bets Marcano placed over this period, 25 of those bets included Pirates games while he was assigned to the Pirates' Major League Club. Marcano did not appear in any of the games on which he placed bets, however, because all of Marcano's Pirates-related bets, and the vast majority of his bets overall, occurred during the period after he suffered a season-ending knee injury on July 24, 2023 and was receiving medical treatment at PNC Park.\n\nMarcano, 24, was signed by the Padres as an amateur free agent out of Venezuela in 2016. He was traded to the Pirates in 2021 with Jack Suwinski for Adam Frazier and last November went back to the Padres on waivers. He hasn't played a game in 2024 due to a torn ACL.\n\nMLB rules stipulate that players are permitted to legally gamble on non-diamond sports, but they cannot gamble on baseball or softball at any level. A player caught gambling on teams other than his own faces a one-year suspension for a first offense and a lifetime ban if he's found having gambled on his own team, as Marcano has been accused of.\n\nEarlier this season, Ippei Mizuhara -- Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter -- was charged with stealing more than $16 million from Ohtani to pay off gambling debts to an illegal bookie. He faces a maximum of 33 years in prison. Braves minor-leaguer David Fletcher is also being investigated by MLB for placing bets with the same illegal bookmaker that Mizuhara used. Neither Mizuhara nor Fletcher is alleged to have gambled on baseball, but betting on any sport through illegal channels is also forbidden by MLB.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_snyder@cbssports.com", "name": "Matt Snyder", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iv\u00e1n_Marcano", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iv\u00e1n Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucupita_Marcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucupita Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Suwinski", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Suwinski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Frazier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Frazier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PNC Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amateur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fletcher_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Fletcher (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_transactions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball transactions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Softball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/06/03/979bf9fc-9bc7-4cad-a207-b61f0ee84f68/thumbnail/1200x675/4b675c90a7d408f8bdb1430597bc5c2d/marcano-getty.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621706", "eventUri": "eng-9621706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Marcano is facing a lifetime ban. Four other players are under investigation for betting on baseball while in the minor leagues as well, though the identities of those others are not known. The report adds that there's no evidence at this point of games being manipulated.\n\nMarcano, 24, was placed on the injured list by the Pirates in July of last year and eventually underwent surgery to repair the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. The Padres claimed him off waivers in November and he has been on the injured list for all of 2024 so far, still recovering from that surgery.\n\nPer the report from Diamond and Adler, Marcano \"has been accused of betting on games involving the Pittsburgh Pirates last season while he was on the injured list for that team.\" Per the report, the league and the MLB Players' Association are still discussing Marcano's ultimate punishment but, as mentioned, a lifetime ban is on the table. Marcano, the league and the union all declined to comment for the piece, though the Padres released a statement:\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are aware of an active investigation by Major League Baseball regarding a matter that occurred when the player in question was a member of another organization and not affiliated with the San Diego Padres. We will not have any further comment until the investigative process has been completed.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nBrian Warecki, Pirates' senior vice president of Communications, also issued a statement, relayed by Noah Hiles of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on X. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are aware of the matter that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s under investigation and are fully cooperating. We will refrain from further comment at this time.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nAs relayed by the WSJ piece, the league's gambling policy is prominently displayed in all clubhouses. Baseball players are legally allowed to bet on other sports but not on baseball. A player betting on teams other than his own faces a one-year suspension but betting on a game involving his own team results in a lifetime ban.\n\nGambling scandals have been around almost as long as baseball itself. Most famously, the \"Black Sox Scandal\" saw eight members of the 1919 White Sox were banned for life after being accused of taking bribes from gamblers to throw that year's World Series. MLB's all-time hits leader Pete Rose also received a lifetime ban in 1989 after accusations that he gambled on the Reds during his time as a player and manager.\n\nMore recently, gambling scandals have come back into the spotlight, thanks to a 2018 Supreme Court decision that opened the door for states to legalize the practice. Ippei Mizuhara, the former interpreter for Shohei Ohtani, is in the process of pleading guilty to bank fraud and subscribing to a false tax return in relation to a gambling scandal. To this point, the evidence of that case suggests he didn't bet on baseball. However, he did make bets with an illegal bookmaker in California, where sports betting is still illegal. He is alleged to have stolen millions of dollars from an account in Ohtani's name in order to pay off his debts. David Fletcher of the Braves is also under investigation for placing bets with the same bookmaker as Mizuhara, though Fletcher isn't accused of placing bets on baseball either. Gambling has also been an issue in other sports, with Jontay Porter receiving a ban from the NBA for gambling violations while playing for the Raptors.\n\nMizuhara and Fletcher both bet on other sports in a state where it's illegal, while Mizuhara is also alleged to have committed several financial crimes. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred discussed those situations last month and said the league would be taking a hands-off approach until the legal process played out.\n\nThe Marcano situation would appear to be a different matter.

Pete Rose, baseball's active career hits leader, famously agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on Cincinnati Reds games while managing the team.\n\nOne other big leaguer, Oakland Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly, was declared ineligible for one year on Tuesday for betting on baseball while he was in the minor leagues. Additionally, minor leaguers Jay Groome of San Diego, Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez of Philadelphia and Andrew Saalfrank of Arizona were banned for one year for betting on major league games.\n\nPeople are also reading...

None of the players punished played in any games on which they wagered, and all players denied to MLB they had inside information relevant to their bets or the games they bet on - testimonies that MLB says align with the data received from the sportsbook.\n\n\"The strict enforcement of Major League Baseball's rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans,\" Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"The longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century. We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people.\"\n\nMarcano was found to have placed 387 baseball bets, including 231 MLB-related wagers, between Oct. 16, 2022 and Nov. 1, 2023, totaling over $150,000. The league says 25 of those bets included wagers on Pittsburgh Pirates games while he was on the team's major league roster. However, he did not appear in any of those games because he was on the injured list following a season-ending knee injury. He was receiving medical treatment at PNC Park during that time. Marcano bet almost exclusively on the outcomes of games and lost all of his parlay bets involving the Pirates, winning just 4.3% of all of his MLB-related bets.\n\nMajor League Rule 21, posted in every clubhouse, states betting on any baseball game in which a player, umpire, league official or team employee has no duty to perform results in a one-year suspension. Betting on a game in which the person has a duty to perform results in a lifetime ban.\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures: Stanley Cup and NBA playoffs, baseball, soccer and more!\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The league says 25 of those bets included wagers on Pittsburgh Pirates games while he was on the team's major league roster. However, he did not appear in any of those games because he was on the injured list following a season-ending knee injury. He was receiving medical treatment at PNC Park during that time. Marcano bet almost exclusively on the outcomes of games and lost all of his parlay bets involving the Pirates, winning just 4.3% of all of his MLB-related bets.\n\nMajor League Rule 21, posted in every clubhouse, states betting on any baseball game in which a player, umpire, league official or team employee has no duty to perform results in a one-year suspension.

According to the report, Marcano has been accused of gambling on Pirates games while he was on Pittsburgh's injured list last year. If Marcano is found to have broken the rules, he faces a lifetime ban.\n\nA spokesperson for MLB confirmed to CBS Sports Monday that Marcano is under investigation.\n\n\"We are aware of an active investigation by Major League Baseball regarding a matter that occurred when the player in question was a member of another organization and not affiliated with the San Diego Padres,\" the Padres said in a statement to the WSJ. \"We will not have any further comment until the investigative process has been completed.\"\n\nFour minor-league players have also been accused of gambling on MLB games, according to the Journal, which did not name them.\n\nMarcano, 24, was signed by the Padres as an amateur free agent out of Venezuela in 2016. He was traded to the Pirates in 2021 with Jack Suwinski for Adam Frazier and last November went back to the Padres on waivers. He hasn't played a game in 2024 due to a torn ACL.\n\nMLB rules stipulate that players are permitted to legally gamble on non-diamond sports, but they cannot gamble on baseball or softball at any level. A player caught gambling on teams other than his own faces a one-year suspension for a first offense and a lifetime ban if he's found having gambled on his own team, as Marcano has been accused of.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_snyder@cbssports.com", "name": "Matt Snyder", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iv\u00e1n_Marcano", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iv\u00e1n Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucupita_Marcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucupita Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Suwinski", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Suwinski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Frazier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Frazier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_transactions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball transactions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Softball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/06/03/979bf9fc-9bc7-4cad-a207-b61f0ee84f68/thumbnail/1200x675/4b675c90a7d408f8bdb1430597bc5c2d/marcano-getty.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621706", "eventUri": "eng-9621706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Four other players were suspended for one year for also betting on baseball.\n\nIn March 2024, MLB learned from a licensed sports betting operator that it identified baseball betting activity from accounts connected to a major league player and several minor league players. None of the players played in any game on which they placed a bet.\n\nIn a released statement, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred explained the strict enforcement of baseball's rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding the integrity of the game.\n\n\"We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people. Since the Supreme Court decision opened the door to legalized sports betting, we have worked with licensed sports betting operators and other third parties to put ourselves in a better position from an integrity perspective through the transparency that a regulated sports betting system can provide. MLB will continue to invest heavily in integrity monitoring, educational programming and awareness initiatives with the goal of ensuring strict adherence to this fundamental rule of our game,\" he said.\n\nMarcano was banned for violating Major League Rule 21, which disallows any player, umpire club or league official or employee from betting any sum whatsoever upon a baseball game. Those found betting on baseball where they have \"no duty to perform\" will be declared ineligible for one year, while a bettor that \"has a duty to perform\" will be declared permanently ineligible.\n\nBetting data showed Marcano placed 387 baseball bets from Oct. 16, 2022, through Nov. 1, 2023. In total, Marcano placed more than $150,000 on baseball, with $87,319 of that total on MLB-related bets. Of these bets, 25 in total involved the Pittsburgh Pirates while Marcano was assigned to the team.\n\nHowever, Marcano did not appear in any of the games he bet on, as he was on the injured list for a season-ending knee injury on July 24, 2023.\n\nAccording to betting data, Marcano only won 4.3% of his MLB-related bets and lost all of his parlays involving the Pirates.\n\nMajor league player Michael Kelly (Oakland Athletics pitcher) and Minor League players Jay Groome (Padres pitcher), Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez (Philadelphia Phillies infielder) and Andrew Saalfrank (Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher), have all been suspended for one year by MLB.\n\nKelly was found to have bet $99.22 on 10 MLB games from Oct. 5, 2021, through Oct. 17, 2021, while he was a minor league player assigned to the Houston Astros' Triple-A affiliate in Sugar Land, Texas.\n\nHe won five MLB game bets and netted $28.30.\n\nGroome was found to have bet $453.74 on 30 MLB game-related bets and had a net loss of $433.54 on these bets. He placed the bets between July 22, 2020, through July 24, 2021. Of the bets, 24 included the Red Sox, all of which Groome placed while he was assigned to the Red Sox High-A affiliate in Greenville, South Carolina.\n\nRodriguez bet $749.09 on baseball, with $724.09 of that on MLB-related bets. He placed 31 baseball bets in total, three on college and 28 on MLB. His MLB bets included seven bets involving the Chicago White Sox while he was assigned to the White Sox Double-A affiliate in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nSaalfrank placed 29 baseball bets, including 28 MLB related bets and one parlay bet on college baseball. He bet $445.87 on baseball, with $444.07 on MLB bets. He had a net loss of $272.64 on MLB bets.\n\nHe placed the bets from Sept. 9, 2021, through March 9, 2022.

We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people.\"\n\nMLB's investigations into the matter included interviews and cooperation from the league's legal sportsbook partners. In March, a legal sports betting operator informed MLB that it \"identified past baseball betting activity from accounts connected to multiple Major and Minor League players.\"\n\nData obtained from the operator and other sportsbooks showed that none of the players played in any of the games of which they had bet on. The players also denied they had inside information relevant to the bets.\n\nNone of the players is appealing the disciplinary measures.\n\nMLB rules specify that any player or club or league official or employee who bets on a baseball game that they are not involved in shall be declared ineligible for one year. Those parties who bet on baseball games that are involved in will be deemed permanently ineligible.\n\n\"Since the Supreme Court decision opened the door to legalized sports betting, we have worked with licensed sports betting operators and other third parties to put ourselves in a better position from an integrity perspective through the transparency that a regulated sports betting system can provide,\" Manfred said.\n\n\"MLB will continue to invest heavily in integrity monitoring, educational programming and awareness initiatives with the goal of ensuring strict adherence to this fundamental rule of our game.\"\n\nBetting data evaluated by MLB showed that Marcano placed 387 baseball bets, including 231 related to MLB, through a legal sportsbook from Oct. 16 to 23, 2022, and from July 12 to Nov. 1. Of those 231 MLB bets, 25 involved Pittsburgh Pirates games while he was a member of the team, but he did not play in those contests.\n\nThe majority of his overall bets were placed after he sustained a season-ending knee injury in 2023.\n\nOverall, Marcano bet more than $150,000 on baseball, with $87,319 of those wagers related to MLB. MLB stated that Marcano lost all of his parlay wagers involving the Pirates and \"only won 4.3%\" of his MLB-related bets.\n\nKelly, Groome, Rodriguez and Saalfrank each were declared ineligible for one year. Kelly bet $99.22 on MLB games. Groome placed $453.74 in wagers on MLB-related events. Rodriguez bet $724.09 on MLB-related events. Data provided to MLB showed Saalfrank's MLB-related wagers totaled $444.07.\n\nMarcano, 24, made his MLB debut in 2021 for the Padres. The Padres traded the utility man to the Pirates in 2021. He rejoined the Padres off waivers in November. Marcano hit .217 with five home runs and 34 RBIs through 149 MLB appearances.\n\nKelly, 31, went 3-2 with a 2.59 ERA over 28 appearances last season for the Athletics. The former Cleveland Guardians and Philadelphia Phillies pitcher has a career 4-2 record with a 2.94 ERA over 46 appearances.\n\nGroome, 25, posted a 19-34 record with a 5.54 ERA over 103 minor league appearances. Rodriguez, 23, went 0 for 1 with an RBI in one appearance last season for the Chicago White Sox.\n\nHe hit .265 with four homers, 18 RBIs and 12 steals over 38 appearances for the Class-AA Reading Fightin Phils. The infielder owns a .282 average with 61 homers over 465 career minor league appearances.\n\nSaalfrank, 26, allowed two hits and four runs in two appearances this season for the Diamondbacks. He posted a 1.74 ERA over 10 appearances last season for the MLB franchise. Saalfrank has a 2.97 ERA and 16-7 record over 108 career minor league appearances.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_butler@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Alex Butler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucupita_Marcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tucupita Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsbook", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sportsbook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Manfred", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Manfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner_of_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commissioner of Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_Fightin_Phils", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reading Fightin Phils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_player", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utility player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/in17z0/picture288997729/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/1b02d276-3329-4759-aa8d-1666e5d5bc5b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621706", "eventUri": "eng-9621706", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "dateEnd": "-11-01", "textStart": 2514, "textEnd": 2531}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-16", "textStart": 2484, "textEnd": 2491}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

It's being called the worst betting scandal in baseball in 100 years.\n\nMarcano made 387 legal bets on baseball with a sports book totaling more than $150,000 in October 2022 and from last July through November.\n\nHe wasn't very good at it. He bet almost exclusively on the outcome of Pirates games, which was the team he was playing for at the time. He won only 4.3% of his bets \"and lost all of his parlay bets involving the Pirates, winning just 4.3% of all of his MLB-related bets,\" according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"The strict enforcement of Major League Baseball's rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans,\" baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"The longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century. We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people.\"\n\nAlong with Marcano, four other players were banned for one year for betting on baseball.\n\nOakland Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly was suspended for one year for betting on baseball while in the minor leagues and a three minor leaguers also were banned for one year for betting on big league games: pitchers Jay Groome of San Diego and Andrew Saalfrank of Arizona, and infielder Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez of Philadelphia. Each of those four players wagered under $1,000.\n\nIn 1924, New York Giants outfielder Jimmy O'Connell was banned for life for betting on baseball. And Pete Rose, one of the best players in Major League history, agreed to a lifetime ban after it was proved he bet on his Cincinnati Reds team while managing.\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, gambling was as much an attraction in baseball as the game itself. It was always a question if a player's bad performance was bad play or the result of tanking to make the bettors rich.\n\nGambling was nearly driven out of the game after the 1919 Black Sox scandal, in which eight members of the Chicago White Sox allegedly threw some games in the World Series and were banned for life. Defenders of some of the players, especially Buck Weaver and Joe Jackson, insisted that they played up to their full potential and should not have been punished.\n\nThe integrity of the game had been destroyed. The team owners brought in a retired judge, Kenesaw Mountain Landis, to save the game. He banned the players for life even though they had been acquitted of accepting bribes. He put in the rule that Marcano is now paying the price for. He cracked down with an iron fist on other players as well. In hindsight, it was necessary to bring integrity back to the game.\n\nUnder rule 21, \"Any player, umpire or club or league official or employee, who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform, shall be declared permanently ineligible.\" There's not much wriggle room there. There wasn't supposed to be. But the players believed Landis was arrogant and high-handed and complained bitterly about his actions.\n\nThis was a scandal waiting to happen. And it's not going to be the last one, I guarantee it.", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rick_moran@pjmedia.com", "name": "Rick Moran",

Pete Rose, baseball's active career hits leader, famously agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on Cincinnati Reds games while managing the team.\n\nOne other big leaguer, Oakland Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly, was declared ineligible for one year on Tuesday for betting on baseball while he was in the minor leagues. Additionally, minor leaguers Jay Groome of San Diego, Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez of Philadelphia and Andrew Saalfrank of Arizona were banned for one year for betting on major league games.\n\nPeople are also reading...

None of the players punished played in any games on which they wagered, and all players denied to MLB they had inside information relevant to their bets or the games they bet on - testimonies that MLB says align with the data received from the sportsbook.\n\n\"The strict enforcement of Major League Baseball's rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans,\" Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"The longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century. We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people.\"\n\nMarcano was found to have placed 387 baseball bets, including 231 MLB-related wagers, between Oct. 16, 2022 and Nov. 1, 2023, totaling over $150,000. The league says 25 of those bets included wagers on Pittsburgh Pirates games while he was on the team's major league roster. However, he did not appear in any of those games because he was on the injured list following a season-ending knee injury. He was receiving medical treatment at PNC Park during that time. Marcano bet almost exclusively on the outcomes of games and lost all of his parlay bets involving the Pirates, winning just 4.3% of all of his MLB-related bets.\n\nMajor League Rule 21, posted in every clubhouse, states betting on any baseball game in which a player, umpire, league official or team employee has no duty to perform results in a one-year suspension. Betting on a game in which the person has a duty to perform results in a lifetime ban.\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures: Stanley Cup and NBA playoffs, baseball, soccer and more!\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people. Since the Supreme Court decision opened the door to legalized sports betting, we have worked with licensed sports betting operators and other third parties to put ourselves in a better position from an integrity perspective through the transparency that a regulated sports betting system can provide. MLB will continue to invest heavily in integrity monitoring, educational programming and awareness initiatives with the goal of ensuring strict adherence to this fundamental rule of our game.\"\n\nThe minor league players named in Tuesday's report are pitcher Jay Groome of the Padres, infielder Jose Rodriguez of the Philadelphia Phillies and pitcher Andrew Saalfrank of the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nMarcano, 24, has yet to play this season as he rehabs a torn ACL. According to MLB, he placed 387 bets on baseball (including 231 MLB-related wagers) totaling more than $150,000 in 2022 and 2023. Twenty-five of those bets were on Pittsburgh games while he was assigned to the Pirates' major league club, although he did not appear in any of those games.\n\n\"There is no evidence to suggest -- and Marcano denies -- that any outcomes in the baseball games on which he placed bets were compromised, influenced, or manipulated in any way,\" read the MLB press release.\n\nMarcano is a career .217 hitter with five home runs and 34 RBIs in 149 games with the Padres (2021) and Pirates (2022-23).\n\nKelly, 31, is 3-2 with a 2.59 ERA in 28 relief appearances this season, his first with the A's. A first-round pick by San Diego in 2011, he is 4-2 with a 2.94 ERA in 46 career games (no starts) with the Phillies (2022), Cleveland Guardians (2023) and Oakland.\n\nAccording to the MLB probe, Kelly placed 10 bets involving nine MLB games in October 2021 when he was with the Houston Astros' Triple-A affiliate in Sugar Land, Texas. He wagered a total of just under $100 and did not appear in any of the games he wagered on.\n\nGroome, 25, has been in the minors since the Boston Red Sox drafted him in the first round in 2016. The left-hander has no decisions and a 3.60 ERA in three starts this season for Triple-A El Paso.\n\nBetting data acquired during the investigation shows that Groome placed 32 MLB-related bets totaling about $450 from 2020-21, with 24 of those wagers involving the Red Sox while he was assigned to their High-A affiliate in Greenville, S.C.\n\nRodriguez, 23, appeared in one game for the Chicago White Sox in 2023 and scored a run. This season, the Phillies prospect is hitting .265 with four homers and 18 RBIs in 38 games at Double-A Reading.\n\nRodriguez reportedly wagered about $750 on 31 baseball bets (28 MLB-related bets) from 2021-22 while he was on a minor league contract with the White Sox.\n\nSaalfrank, 26, made two relief appearances for the Diamondbacks in April and allowed four runs in one inning of work. In 2023, the left-hander made 10 scoreless relief appearances in the regular season and posted a 3.18 ERA in 11 postseason appearances, including three scoreless outings against the Texas Rangers in the World Series.\n\nThe MLB betting data shows that Saalfrank placed 28 MLB-related bets totaling about $445 from 2021-22.

Marcano wagered more than $150,000 on baseball games, including $87,319 on MLB games.\n\nNone of the five players competed in games they wagered on, and there isn't any evidence to suggest game outcomes were compromised, according to MLB's release.\n\n\"The strict enforcement of Major League Baseball's rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans,\" MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a press release. \"The longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century.\"\n\nIn addition to Marcano's lifetime ban from Major League Baseball, Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly, Padres pitcher Jay Groome, Phillies infielder Jose Rodriguez, and Diamondbacks pitcher Andrew Saalfrank all received one-year suspensions. None of those four players wagered more than $1,000 on MLB games.\n\nMarcano's wagering habits were by far the most extensive of the group, and he's the only one of the five players to bet on games involving his assigned team.\n\nBetting data reflects that Marcano placed 387 bets on baseball, including 231 MLB bets, from the periods Oct. 16, 2022 through Oct. 23, 2022 and July 12, 2023 through Nov. 1, 2023.\n\nThe wagers were placed via a legal sports betting app, which allowed the sportsbook and integrity monitoring services to flag the past wagers in March of this year.\n\nManfred credited Major League Baseball's work with regulated sportsbooks and integrity monitoring services in helping catch the wagering violations.\n\n\"Since the Supreme Court decision opened the door to legalized sports betting, we have worked with licensed sports betting operators and other third parties to put ourselves in a better position from an integrity perspective through the transparency that a regulated sports betting system can provide,\" Manfred said. \"MLB will continue to invest heavily in integrity monitoring, educational programming and awareness initiatives with the goal of ensuring strict adherence to this fundamental rule of our game.\"\n\nA review of Marcano's betting history found that he placed 25 wagers on Pirates games while assigned to Pittsburgh. He didn't play in any of those games, as he missed the contests with injury.\n\nMarcano's primary bets on Pirates games were moneyline and total bets. He lost every parlay he bet on the Pirates and won just 4.3% of his MLB bets overall.\n\nNews of Marcano's lifetime ban comes on the heels of another MLB betting scandal, with Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, facing criminal charges for stealing $16 million from Ohtani to wager on sports.

The NBA gave Jontay Porter of the Toronto Raptors a lifetime ban for placing bets on basketball earlier this year.\n\nMarcano, 24, had yet to play this season after tearing his ACL last season with the Pirates.

The penalties closely follow a similar lifetime suspension levied by the NBA on Raptors center Jontay Porter, and federal bank and tax fraud charges on Ippei Mizuhara, the former interpreter for Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani -- with both of those incidents also happening just in the last two months.\n\nThe latest cases continue to show the uneasy relationship between the growth of legal sports betting and leagues working to maintain competitive integrity.\n\nSports betting overall continues to soar to unprecedented heights, reaching record levels of revenue and total handle in 2023. As nearly every major sports league, including MLB, has built an extensive portfolio of gambling-related business relationships -- sparking accusations of hypocrisy among some fans -- those leagues have also sought to create a bright line marking what is and isn't permissible for players.\n\nIn the case of MLB, that line includes sacrificing some broader societal rights.\n\n\"We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people,\" said MLB commissioner Rob Manfred.\n\nMLB learned of the players' wagering activities primarily from an unnamed, but legal, sportsbook operator.\n\nA further tragedy of the five MLB players damaging or throwing away entirely their pro baseball careers to gambling was how poorly they performed in their baseball-related wagers and, in some cases, how small the involved bets were.\n\nMarcano bet more than $150,000 on baseball, with an average of about $378 per bet, and won only 4.3% of those, including losses in all of his parlays involving the Pirates, his former team. Padres minor league pitcher Jay Groome, suspended for a year, bet $453.74 on MLB games and posted a net loss of $433.54, and received payouts for only two of 32 MLB-related bets.\n\nDiamondbacks minor league pitcher Andrew Saalfrank, also suspended for a year, posted a net loss of $272.64 on $444.07 of MLB-related bets and won just five of 28 wagers. A's pitcher Michael Kelly also received a yearlong suspension for conduct involving just $99.22 worth of bets involving MLB games.\n\nIn the end, though, the level of activity was far less of an issue compared to the betting on MLB games at all by these players. Marcano is believed to be the first major leaguer to receive a permanent ban for gambling since Pete Rose agreed to a similar penalty in 1989 for wagering on games as a Reds player and manager from '85 to '87.\n\n\"The longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century,\" Manfred said.\n\nMizuhara, meanwhile, pled guilty Tuesday to the federal charges, and now faces as much as 33 years in prison, and also must pay restitution to Ohtani and the IRS.

The newspaper reported that the league was probing whether Marcano bet on games during the 2023 season when he was with the Pirates.\n\nNBC News has not independently confirmed that the probe is related to alleged bets during the 2023 season.\n\nThe MLB gambling policy states that players who bet on any baseball game \"in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform\" will be permanently ineligible to play.\n\nRimas Sports, the agency that represents Marcano, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Monday. Through a representative, Marcano declined to comment to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Major League Baseball Players Association, which represents athletes in labor negotiations and other matters, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA phone call seeking comment to MLB's communications line was not immediately returned Monday evening.\n\n\"We are aware of an active investigation by Major League Baseball regarding a matter that occurred when the player in question was a member of another organization and not affiliated with the San Diego Padres,\" the team said in a statement, adding that it would have no further comment until the investigation is complete.\n\nIn their own statement, the Pirates said: \"We are aware of the matter that's under investigation and are fully cooperating. We will refrain from further comment at this time.\"\n\nMarcano was first signed by the Padres as an international prospect in 2016.

He has played in both the infield and outfield.\n\nU.S. sports leagues have increased monitoring over gambling since the U.S. Supreme Court in May 2018 struck down a federal law that had barred betting on football, basketball, baseball and other sports in most states. Sports books have opened at stadiums across the country across the major U.S. pro sports.\n\nShohei Ohtani's interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was fired by the Los Angeles Dodgers after the season opener on March 21 when a federal gambling investigation became public. Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case in which prosecutors allege he stole nearly $17 million from the two-time AL MVP to pay off debts.\n\nBaseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said last month that the sport's department of investigations deferred to the government probe. He noted that MLB has superior methods of monitoring potentially illicit bets with legal sports books than with illegal bookmakers. It is not clear how Marcano might have made his alleged bets.\n\nMLB's top concern with legal sports betting is on action besides the score or outcome, known as prop bets. For instance, wagers that a certain player would steal at least one base in a given game.\n\n\"There are certain kinds of prop bets that are of concern to us and continue to be of concern to us,\" Manfred said. \"Obviously, the potential for something happening in the game that nobody notices is much higher with a lot of kinds of prop bets and you could see where a player would be more tempted to -- all you need to do is miss three free throws; it doesn't necessarily change the outcome of your game. Your team may pick you up and life moves on. It's just easier to have a problem on a prop bet. I think it's just human nature. So, yeah, we remain concerned about them and have lobbied for certain types of prop bets not to be allowable.\"\n\nAP Sports Writers Greg Beacham and Will Graves contributed to this report.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Included in those bets were 25 bets involving the Pirates, although all of those bets came while he was rehabbing a knee injury.\n\nAs expected, MLB announced a lifetime ban for Marcano, along with one-year suspensions for four other players who violated the league's gambling policy for lesser violations. What makes Marcano's ban even more incredible is that he was a terrible baseball bettor. According to MLB's investigation, Marcano lost all 25 bets he placed involving the Pirates (the team he played for), and overall he won just 4.3 percent of his 231 bets on Major League Baseball.\n\nMarcano was never great at hitting for average, boasting a career .217 mark over his three seasons in Pittsburgh, and unfortunately that translated to the sporstbooks as well. Parlay hit rate is always low (and the sportsbooks clean up on them because of it), but 4.3 percent is a truly astounding figure across a pretty large sample size. Losing every bet you placed on the team you play for and ostensibly know better than most is also extremely funny. Even Ippei Mizuhara thinks Marcano should've just called it quits from gambling long before baseball ever got involved.\n\nMajor League Baseball will hope the message is sent by this lifetime ban, but the allure of the same game parlay is likely too strong and someone else will eventually think they're smart enough to get away with it.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derrick_rossignol@uproxx.com", "name": "Derrick Rossignol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "steven_hyden@uproxx.com", "name": "Steven Hyden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "aaron_williams@uproxx.com", "name": "Aaron Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "wongo_okon@uproxx.com", "name": "Wongo Okon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iv\u00e1n_Marcano", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iv\u00e1n Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucupita_Marcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucupita Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Women", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/marcano.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621706", "eventUri": "eng-9621706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Gregory Fisher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nA San Diego Padres infielder is facing a lifetime ban for placing bets on baseball, according to a report.\n\nBackup infielder Tucupita Marcano is under investigation for betting on games involving the Pittsburgh Pirates last season while he was a member of the team, according to Jared Diamond and Lindsey Adler of the Wall Street Journal. Marcano was on the injured list at the time of his alleged betting.\n\nNo punishment has been determined yet, but a lifetime ban is very much on the table pending negotiations between MLB and the MLBPA. The report also notes that four other players are being investigated for potentially betting on baseball, all of whom did so while playing in the minor leagues.\n\nBetting on baseball is strictly prohibited by the league's rules. Players found to have bet on their own team face a lifetime ban, while those who bet on other teams can be suspended for up to a year. Betting on sports other than baseball is permitted as long as the bets are placed legally. At least one player is being investigated for involvement with the same illegal bookie that ensnared Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter.\n\nThe 24-year-old Marcano has played parts of three seasons in MLB with the Padres and Pirates. He is a career .217 hitter and has generally been used as a backup utility infielder since making his debut in 2021. He has yet to play at any level in 2024 as he recovers from an ACL injury he suffered last year.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grey_papke@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Grey Papke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucupita_Marcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tucupita Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PNC Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Players_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Players Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_player_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utility player (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tucupita-marcano.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621706", "eventUri": "eng-9621706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

He becomes the first MLB player since Pete Rose in 1989 to be banned under the league's rules and policies. As sports leagues have become tightly integrated with the gaming industry, betting scandals are going to become the norm.\n\nAccording to MLB, Marcano placed 387 baseball bets, including 231 MLB-related bets, as well as bets on international baseball play over the course of a week in October of 2022 and from July 12, 2023 through November 1, 2023. All told, he wagered more than $150,000 on baseball, with $87,319 of that on MLB-related bets. During that time he was with the Pittsburgh Pirates. According to the league, he consistently wagered on parlays, some of which were the Pirates. Marcano lost all of his parlays involving the Pirates and only won 4.3% of all of his MLB-related bets overall.\n\nThe league states that - and Marcano denies - that he influenced play to alter game outcomes.\n\nOn top of Marcano, MLB announced that other players, Michael Kelly (Oakland Athletics pitcher); and Minor League players Jay Groome (Padres pitcher), Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez (Philadelphia Phillies infielder) and Andrew Saalfrank (Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher) declared ineligible for one year for violating MLB's sports betting rules and policies.\n\nAll bets were made through a legal sports betting operator.\n\nMajor League Baseball has had strict rules and policies around players wagering on baseball and other sports since the 1919 \"Black Sox\" scandal that centered on eight players that, to one level or another, were deemed to be altering game outcomes by an investigation by the first commissioner for Major League Baseball, Kennesaw \"Mountain\" Landis. Since then, Rule 21 has been in place which states that any MLB player found to have gambled on baseball can face lifetime banishment from the sport.\n\nIn 2018, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck down federal law that prohibited sports betting, it opened the floodgates for all the major sports leagues to reach lucrative partnerships with the gaming industry. With media outlets becoming integrated, the stage was set for sports betting scandals to flourish.\n\nAs part of Major League Baseball's statement on Marcano and the other players involved in betting, they placed the onus on the players saying \"requires its personnel to participate annually in sports betting education programs that reiterate the policies applicable to respective groups\" and went onto to say that players must attend in-person sessions that are in both English and Spanish that specify the requirements of Major League Rule 21 and MLB's Sports Betting Policy as well as other best practices.\n\nWith players being often young and impressionable, the ease of wagering via smartphones, and the bombardment of sports wagering opportunities across all forms of media, the sports leagues have opened Pandora's Box. Beyond today's MLB discipline, the following has either occurred or is in the midst of investigation within roughly the past year:\n\nThe first professional player in North American sports to be banned permanently for sports betting since the U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2018 was Josh Shaw of the Arizona Cardinals. While he was the first in this new era of making sports betting so vastly available, he is just the beginning of what will be more scandals.\n\nWhile today's news of Tucupita Marcano banishment is the latest, at what point will the 1919 Black Sox scandal be revisited? Could the Super Bowl, or NBA Finals, or the Stanley Cup Finals be jeopardized in the future due to sports wagering becoming foisted on not just fans, but the players? When the major sports leagues opted to take the revenues from the sports wagering industry, the dance with the devil was part of that calculus. That dance appears to have the tempo increasing.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iv\u00e1n_Marcano", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iv\u00e1n Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucupita_Marcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucupita Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sox_Scandal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Sox Scandal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Rodr\u00edguez_(Venezuelan_pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Rodr\u00edguez (Venezuelan pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Phillies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennesaw,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kennesaw, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kennesaw, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Sports", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/665f40cb0d5bc8c47c94f452/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621706", "eventUri": "eng-9621706", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-07-", "textStart": 543, "textEnd": 550}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

He was traded to the Pirates in 2021 and returned to the Padres on waivers last November.\n\nShould he be found guilty of betting on baseball, Marcano could face a lifetime ban. According to the Wall Street Journal, who first reported on the ongoing investigation Monday afternoon, a penalty could be imminent.\n\nThe betting allegations against Marcano come in a season where gambling has loomed large.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani's longtime interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was accused of stealing more than $16 million from the designated hitter to pay off debts with an illegal bookmarker. The accusations escalated to federal charges of bank and tax fraud last month, which Mizuhara pleaded guilty to after reaching a deal with prosecutors.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, MLB officials are also investigating Ohtani's teammate from the Los Angeles Angels, David Fletcher, who is accused of using the same illegal bookmarker to bet on sports.\n\nFour other minor league players are also under investigation for baseball betting, the report added, but names and affiliation were not disclosed. However, the report noted that there is no evidence this alleged betting led to game manipulation.\n\nNexstar's KSWB/KUSI has reached out to MLB for further comment on the investigation.", "source": {"uri": "fox5sandiego.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSWB 5/69"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danielle_dawson@fox5sandiego.com", "name": "Danielle Dawson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucupita_Marcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucupita Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KUSI-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KUSI-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_transactions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball transactions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fletcher_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Fletcher (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KSWB-TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KSWB-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexstar_Media_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nexstar Media Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://fox5sandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2024/06/AP23196743483437.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621706", "eventUri": "eng-9621706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Pete Rose, baseball's active career hits leader, famously agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989 after an investigation concluded he bet on Cincinnati Reds games while managing the team.\n\nOne other big leaguer, Oakland Athletics pitcher Michael Kelly, was declared ineligible for one year on Tuesday for betting on baseball while he was in the minor leagues.

None of the players punished played in any games on which they wagered, and all players denied to MLB they had inside information relevant to their bets or the games they bet on - testimonies that MLB says align with the data received from the sportsbook.\n\n\"The strict enforcement of Major League Baseball's rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans,\" Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \"The longstanding prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century. We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people.\"\n\nMarcano was found to have placed 387 baseball bets, including 231 MLB-related wagers, between Oct. 16, 2022 and Nov. 1, 2023, totaling over $150,000. The league says 25 of those bets included wagers on Pittsburgh Pirates games while he was on the team's major league roster. However, he did not appear in any of those games because he was on the injured list following a season-ending knee injury. He was receiving medical treatment at PNC Park during that time. Marcano bet almost exclusively on the outcomes of games and lost all of his parlay bets involving the Pirates, winning just 4.3% of all of his MLB-related bets.\n\nMajor League Rule 21, posted in every clubhouse, states betting on any baseball game in which a player, umpire, league official or team employee has no duty to perform results in a one-year suspension. Betting on a game in which the person has a duty to perform results in a lifetime ban.\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures: Stanley Cup and NBA playoffs, baseball, soccer and more!\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The accusations escalated to federal charges of bank and tax fraud last month, which Mizuhara pleaded guilty to after reaching a deal with prosecutors.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, MLB officials are also investigating Ohtani's teammate from the Los Angeles Angels, David Fletcher, who is accused of using the same illegal bookmarker to bet on sports.\n\nFour other minor league players are also under investigation for baseball betting, the report added, but names and affiliations were not disclosed. However, the report noted that there is no evidence this alleged betting led to game manipulation.\n\nNexstar's KSWB/KUSI has reached out to MLB for further comment on the investigation.", "source": {"uri": "whnt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WHNT.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucupita_Marcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucupita Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KUSI-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KUSI-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KSWB-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KSWB-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_transactions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball transactions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fletcher_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Fletcher (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexstar_Media_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nexstar Media Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://whnt.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2024/06/AP23196743483437-e1717449104697.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621706", "eventUri": "eng-9621706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano found himself on the receiving end of the ban hammer, courtesy of MLB's zero-tolerance policy on gambling shenanigans.\n\nThe saga began with a whisper and escalated into a roar when the Wall Street Journal spilled the beans on an investigation into Marcano's gambling escapades. Hot on the trail, MLB didn't waste any time in dropping the hammer, announcing Marcano's lifetime ban faster than you can say \"strike three.\"\n\nBut Marcano isn't the lone ranger in this high-stakes drama; oh no, he's just the tip of the iceberg. Rumor has it that four other players are feeling the heat of MLB's probing gaze, their own futures hanging in the balance like a knuckleball in the wind.\n\nAnd let's not forget the NBA's brush with the dark side of gambling, a cautionary tale starring Raptors forward Jontay Porter. Permanently banned from the league for betting against himself, Porter's fall from grace serves as a chilling reminder of the stakes involved in this high-stakes game.\n\nWhile Marcano and Porter may not be household names, their tales serve as a sobering reality check for the world of professional sports. Imagine the chaos if a bigger fish were caught in the net of gambling violations - a crisis of epic proportions, the likes of which would make the Black Sox scandal look like child's play.\n\nBut why Marcano? What led MLB to wield the ban hammer with such gusto? Let's peel back the layers of this mystery and delve into the enigmatic world of Tucupita Marcano.\n\nIn the fast-paced realm of sports gambling, where fair competition can quickly turn into cheating, Major League Baseball is taking strong measures to address the issue. Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano was banned by MLB for involvement in gambling activities due to their strict policy.\n\nThe story started quietly but quickly grew louder when the Wall Street Journal exposed an inquiry into Marcano's gambling activities. MLB wasted no time in announcing Marcano's lifetime ban, taking swift action on the matter.\n\nHowever, Marcano is not the only person involved in this intense situation; he is just the beginning of a bigger issue. Rumor has it that four additional players are under scrutiny by MLB, their futures uncertain like a knuckleball swirling in the wind. And we must also remember the NBA's encounter with the negative aspect of betting, a warning story featuring Raptors player Jontay Porter. Banned from the league for life for betting against himself, Porter's downfall is a stark reminder of the risks in this high-stakes game.\n\nThough not well-known, Marcano and Porter's stories offer a stark reminder of the harsh realities present in the professional sports industry. Picture the pandemonium if a larger fish was ensnared in the web of gambling infractions - a huge crisis that would dwarf the Black Sox scandal in comparison.\n\nMarcano made his first appearance in the MLB with the Padres at the young age of 21 in the year 2021. He was exchanged to the Pirates in a trade during the middle of the season which included sending Adam Frazier to San Diego.\n\nMarcano seized a chance to get some playing time in Pittsburgh, featuring in 49 games in 2022. However, he only managed to hit .206 with two home runs and a .562 OPS. Marcano batted .233 and had a .633 OPS in 75 games during the 2023 season before tearing his ACL. Reportedly, Marcano bet on baseball while on the injured list with the Pirates.\n\nMarcano was picked up by the Padres on Nov. 2 and stayed on the major-league IL as he recovered from a torn ACL until his lifetime ban.", "source": {"uri": "businessupturn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Upturn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucupita_Marcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tucupita Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iv\u00e1n_Marcano", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iv\u00e1n Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jontay_Porter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jontay Porter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuckleball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knuckleball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsmanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sportsmanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sox_Scandal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Sox Scandal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Frazier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Frazier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://images.businessupturn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1570428340.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621706", "eventUri": "eng-9621706", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-02", "textStart": 3651, "textEnd": 3657}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Four other players -- A's P Michael Kelly and three minor leaguers -- were suspended for one year after it was found they \"placed unrelated bets with a legal sportsbook.\" MLB indicated that it was \"tipped off about the betting activity by a legal sports betting operator.\" None of the players \"played in any games on which they wagered, and all players denied to MLB they had inside information relevant to their bets or the games they bet on.\" Marcano was found to have \"placed 387 baseball bets, including 231 MLB-related wagers,\" between Oct. 16, 2022 and Nov. 1, 2023, totaling over $150,000.

Though MLB \"plasters clubhouse doors with warnings against betting on baseball and ensures teams spend spring training mornings drilling that rule into the players' heads,\" it has \"never been easier to bet on a game\" (WASHINGTON POST, 6/3).", "source": {"uri": "sportsbusinessjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "sportsbusinessjournal.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucupita_Marcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucupita Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsbook", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sportsbook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jontay_Porter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jontay Porter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621706", "eventUri": "eng-9621706", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-10-", "textStart": 767, "textEnd": 774}], "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

That rule states:\n\n\"Any player, umpire, or Club or League official or employee, who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has no duty to perform, shall be declared ineligible for one year.\" Whereas, \"Any player, umpire, or Club or League official or employee, who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform, shall be declared permanently ineligible.\"\n\nToday, the league did announce that lifetime ban for Marcano and also disciplined four other players, including Michael Kelly, a righthanded reliever currently on the Oakland Athletics' MLB roster, for betting on baseball. MLB's press release states:\n\nIn March 2024, MLB learned from a legal sports betting operator that it had identified past baseball betting activity from accounts connected to multiple Major and Minor League players. MLB obtained data from that operator and other sportsbooks, including authentication data for bets. None of these players played in any game on which they placed a bet. Further, all of the players denied that they had any inside information relevant to the bets or that any of the baseball games they bet on were compromised or manipulated, and the betting data does not suggest that any outcomes in the baseball games on which they placed bets were compromised, influenced, or manipulated in any way. None of the players are appealing their discipline.\n\nHere are MLB's official statements about Marcano and the other four players.\n\nSan Diego Padres Major League infielder/outfielder Tucupita Marcano has been declared permanently ineligible for violating MLB's sports betting rules and policies, including Rule 21(d)(2).\n\nBetting data shows that from October 16, 2022 through October 23, 2022, and from July 12, 2023 through November 1, 2023, Marcano placed 387 baseball bets, including 231 MLB-related bets among other bets on international baseball games through a legal sportsbook. Marcano's MLB bets were generally parlays, which would sometimes include multiple MLB-related legs, and they would sometimes include MLB-related legs and non-MLB legs.\n\nIn total, Marcano bet more than $150,000 on baseball, with $87,319 of that on MLB-related bets (an average of approximately $378 per bet). Of the over 200 MLB bets Marcano placed over this period, 25 of those bets included Pirates games while he was assigned to the Pirates' Major League Club. Marcano did not appear in any of the games on which he placed bets, however, because all of Marcano's Pirates-related bets, and the vast majority of his bets overall, occurred during the period after he suffered a season-ending knee injury on July 24, 2023 and was receiving medical treatment at PNC Park.\n\nConsistent with Marcano's overall baseball betting activity, almost all of Marcano's Pirates bets were on which Club (the Pirates or their opponent) would win the game or whether there would be more or less than a certain number of runs scored in the game. Ultimately, Marcano lost all of his parlays involving the Pirates and only won 4.3% of all of his MLB-related bets overall.\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest -- and Marcano denies -- that any outcomes in the baseball games on which he placed bets were compromised, influenced, or manipulated in any way.\n\nOakland Athletics Major League pitcher Michael Kelly has been declared ineligible for one year for violating MLB's sports betting rules and policies, including Rule 21(d)(1).\n\nBetting data shows that from October 5, 2021 through October 17, 2021, Kelly, who at the time was a Minor League player assigned to the Houston Astros' Triple-A affiliate in Sugar Land, Texas, placed 10 bets involving nine MLB games, including bets on the outcomes, over/under bets on the number of runs scored, and on an individual pitcher's strikeout total. Three of the nine games on which Kelly placed bets involved the Houston Astros Major League Club.\n\nKelly's account bet $99.22 on MLB games (an average of $9.92 per bet). Overall, Kelly won five of the MLB game bets and had a net win of $28.30 on the bets.\n\nKelly did not appear in any of the games on which he bet, and he did not make any bets involving his assigned team. There is no evidence to suggest -- and Kelly denies -- that any outcomes in the baseball games on which he placed bets were compromised, influenced, or manipulated in any way.\n\nArizona Diamondbacks Minor League pitcher Andrew Saalfrank has been declared ineligible for one year for violating MLB's sports betting rules and policies, including Rule 21(d)(1).\n\nBetting data shows that from September 9, 2021 through October 29, 2021, and on March 9, 2022, Saalfrank placed 29 baseball bets, including 28 MLB-related bets and one parlay bet on college baseball games, while he was on a Minor League contract with the Diamondbacks. Saalfrank placed all of his MLB-related bets, including four bets involving the Diamondbacks' Major League team, while he was assigned to and on the Injured List of the Diamondbacks' Low-A affiliate.\n\nIn total, Saalfrank bet $445.87 on baseball, with $444.07 of that on MLB-related bets (an average of approximately $15.86 per bet) and with a net loss of $272.64 on MLB bets. Ultimately, Saalfrank only won five of his 28 MLB-related bets and lost his $1.80 college bet.\n\nSaalfrank's MLB bets included parlays, which sometimes included multiple MLB-related legs and would sometimes include MLB-related legs and non-MLB legs. Saalfrank's bets varied, including who would win the game, the over/under of strikeouts by a pitcher, or whether there would be more or less than a certain number of runs scored in the game.\n\nSaalfrank did not appear in any of the games on which he bet, and he did not make any bets involving his assigned team. There is no evidence to suggest -- and Saalfrank denies -- that any outcomes in the baseball games on which he placed bets were compromised, influenced, or manipulated in any way.\n\nSaalfrank pitched in 10 games for the Diamondbacks last year, including four against the Cubs, and also in the postseason for Arizona, including the World Series. He pitched in two games for the D-backs this year.\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies Minor League infielder Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez has been declared ineligible for one year for violating MLB's sports betting rules and policies, including Rule 21(d)(1).\n\nBetting data shows that on September 30, 2021, and from June 5, 2022 through July 30, 2022, Rodr\u00edguez placed 31 baseball bets, comprised of three bets on college baseball games and 28 MLB-related bets while he was on a Minor League contract with the Chicago White Sox. His MLB bets included seven bets involving the White Sox' Major League team while he was assigned to the White Sox' Double-A affiliate in Birmingham, Alabama. Two Club-related bets involved the outcomes and his other Club-related bets were on whether there would be more or less than a certain number of runs scored in the game.\n\nIn total, Rodr\u00edguez bet $749.09 on baseball, with $724.09 of that on MLB-related bets (an average of approximately $25.86 per bet). His MLB bets included parlays, which sometimes included multiple MLB-related legs and would sometimes include MLB-related legs and non-MLB legs.\n\nRodr\u00edguez did not appear in any of the games on which he bet, and he did not make any bets involving his assigned team. There is no evidence to suggest -- and Rodr\u00edguez denies -- that any outcomes in the baseball games on which he placed bets were compromised, influenced, or manipulated in any way.\n\nAs noted above, Rodriguez was in the White Sox organization at the time he placed these bets. He played in one MLB game for the Sox last June, and this April was acquired by the Phillies for cash considerations.\n\nPadres Minor League pitcher Jay Groome has been declared ineligible for one year for violating MLB's sports betting rules and policies, including Rule 21(d)(1).\n\nBetting data shows that from July 22, 2020 through July 24, 2021, Groome placed 32 MLB-related bets. Of those, 24 bets involved the Red Sox Major League Club, all of which Groome placed while he was assigned to the Red Sox' High-A affiliate in Greenville, South Carolina. All 24 of Groome's Red Sox bets were on the final outcome.\n\nIn total, Groome bet $453.74 on 30 MLB game-related bets (an average of approximately $15.12 per bet) and had a net loss of $433.54 on these bets. Ultimately, Groome only received payouts on two of his MLB bets.\n\nGroome's MLB bets included parlays, which sometimes included multiple MLB-related legs and would sometimes include MLB-related legs and non-MLB legs.\n\nGroome did not appear in any of the games on which he bet, and he did not make any bets involving his assigned team. There is no evidence to suggest -- and Groome denies -- that any outcomes in the baseball games on which he placed bets were compromised, influenced, or manipulated in any way.\n\nGroome was the Red Sox' No. 1 pick (12th overall) in the 2016 Draft out of high school in New Jersey. He has played several years in the Red Sox and Padres organizations but has never played in the major leagues.\n\nObviously, none of this is any good, and the hope is that these moves by MLB will discourage other players from betting on baseball. In recent years, since sports gambling was legalized by a 2018 Supreme Court ruling, Major League Baseball has made quite a number of deals with gambling entities, including some teams (the Cubs, for one) opening sports books in or near their ballparks. The explosion of sports gambling was apparently too much temptation for these players. I certainly hope this doesn't continue going forward. MLB said in its release:\n\nMLB requires its personnel to participate annually in sports betting education programs that reiterate the policies applicable to respective groups. Each Spring Training, all Major League and Minor League players must attend in-person sessions that specify the requirements of Major League Rule 21 and MLB's Sports Betting Policy as well as other best practices. MLB hosts a wide array of other English and Spanish awareness programing that reaches players as they begin their professional baseball careers, as they near the Major Leagues, and as they begin each new season. MLB's efforts also include in-person sessions for Minor League players and other baseball employees on avoiding gambling-related harms in their professional and personal lives.", "source": {"uri":

Marcano was found to have placed a bet on the Pirates while he was listed as injured.\n\nPitchers Michael Kelly of the A's, Andrew Saalfrank of the Diamondbacks, Jay Groome of the Padres, and infielder Jose Rodriguez of the Phillies were handed a one-year suspension each for their involvement in betting on other teams. Marcano, 24, who according to Spotrac has made over $2.7 million in his baseball career, has played in 149 games and has a lifetime.217 average and.589 OPS.\n\nBanned for Life\n\nKelly, 31, pitched for the Phillies in 2022 and the Guardians in 2022 before joining the Athletics for the first time. After 28 outings this season, his ERA is 2.59.\n\nThe 26-year-old Saalfrank played with the Diamondbacks for a portion of the previous two seasons. On April 29, he gave up four runs in a half-inning before being sent to Triple-A Reno on May 1.\n\nIn his 11 appearances, including Games 2, 3, and 4 of the World Series, the left-handed specialist gave up three runs (two earned) in 5 \u2154 innings, playing a major role in the team's unexpected World Series run last autumn.\n\nAccording to Spotrac, Saalfrank earned $361,341 during his playing career until now. However, this past summer, he inked a $740,000 one-year contract that was fully guaranteed.\n\nAs for the two minor leaguers, Spotrac projects that neither Jay Groome nor Jose Rodriguez ever made it to the major leagues, and it appears that neither player's career earnings were disclosed.\n\nEnd of the Road\n\nThe Padres signed Marcano in 2016 when he was 16 years old out of Venezuela and in 2021, he was traded to the Pirates. When he was jogging the bases in July 2023, he tore his ACL, ending his career as a major league player.\n\nBaseball, which has been marred by gambling scandals this season, has suffered yet another severe setback.\n\nIppei Mizuhara, the former interpreter for Shohei Ohtani, was accused in April of robbing the Dodgers star of almost $16 million in order to settle debts from wagers placed through an unauthorized bookmaker.\n\nMLB is also investigating David Fletcher, Ohtani's former teammate with the Angels, for allegedly using the same illicit bookmaker to place bets.\n\nAccording to Rule 21.(d) in the MLB official handbook regarding misconduct: \"Any player, umpire, or Club or League official or employee, who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform, shall be declared permanently ineligible.\"\n\nThey also set the foundation for lawful vs unlawful betting.\n\nFletcher was living in California, a state without legal sports betting, and was a member of the Los Angeles Angels the previous season.\n\n\"Betting on any sport illegally is forbidden,\" the MLB handbook regarding misconduct continues. \"But players are allowed to bet legally on every sport except for baseball. Betting on a baseball game involving teams other than the player's own team results in a one-year suspension, while betting on a game involving the player's own team results in a lifetime ban.\"\n\nIn April, the NBA permanently banned Raptors forward Jontay Porter for giving insider information to gamblers and tampering with his playing time to influence wagers.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times, Singapore Edition"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_ghosh@ibtimes.sg", "name": "R.

Due to the unusual betting activity and actions of the player, the $80,000 proposition bet was frozen and was not paid out.\n\nWith sports gambling becoming more and more prominent, issues like this will probably only get more widespread.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_holleran@postandcourier.com", "name": "Andrew Holleran", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucupita_Marcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tucupita Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Passan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Passan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_played", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Games played"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/df/7df191a0-60cb-5c50-89a3-75383342db16/665e338427665.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621706", "eventUri": "eng-9621706", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-20", "textStart": 817, "textEnd": 825, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

He has seen time at five different positions and stolen seven bases in his career.\n\nThe Pirates placed Marcano on waivers after last season and he was claimed by the Padres on Nov. 2, 2023, reuniting him with the organization that signed him to a minor league contract out of Venezuela in 2016.\n\nThe history of baseball's gambling-related controversies dates to the early 20th century, when it was common for players to wager on games with bookmakers outside of the ballpark. The American and National Leagues attempted to crack down on the practice under Kennesaw Mountain Landis, the former federal judge who was appointed baseball's first commissioner in 1920.\n\nAmong Landis' first acts: banning for life eight members of the 1919 Chicago White Sox team who were accused of throwing that year's World Series to the Cincinnati Reds. The so-called \"Black Sox Scandal\" cast a pall over the sport and sent a warning to future players who sought to profit off their own performance through side bets: do it again, and you're out.\n\nBaseball's strict no-gambling policy has claimed several players over the years. In 1947, MLB suspended the manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, Leo Durocher, for a year for his relationships with gamblers.\n\nIn 1970, the league suspended Detroit Tigers pitcher Denny McLain for his gambling ties. Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle were later banned from baseball for earning money from Atlantic City Casinos in jobs that essentially amounted to \"greeter.\" Their bans were later revoked.\n\nThe most famous player banned under baseball's policy is Pete Rose, the game's all-time hits leader who remains under a lifetime ban at the age of 83. Rose was the manager of the Cincinnati Reds when he was accused of wagering on major league games; he only confessed to the crime more than a decade later. Rose has applied for reinstatement on multiple occasions but has been denied each time.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the outlook for Marcano is fairly cut and dried. If he is found guilty of gambling on baseball, his road back into the sport is all but nonexistent.\n\nIf he is cleared of any wrongdoing, Marcano will serve as yet another warning shot across the bow for a sport who has loosened its relationship with professional gambling operations in recent years. MLB (and some teams individually) have official business relationships with DraftKings and MGM, among others.\n\nIn March, the interpreter for Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani, Ippei Mizuhara, confessed to wagering millions of Ohtani's money through an illegal bookmaker over a span of years. Mizuhara is expected to plead guilty in court this year.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_paul_hoornstra@newsweek.com", "name":

However, the paper added that four other players face potential penalties for betting on baseball while still in the minors. There is no evidence at this point that the five fixed games, according to the WSJ report.\n\nBetting in baseball is a particularly touchy subject given the game's historical trouble with gambling, which includes Rose's ban. But, like other professional sports leagues, MLB has a black-and-white policy prohibiting players from betting on games involving their team. A printed copy of MLB's Rule 21 is even supposed to be posted in both English and Spanish in each team clubhouse.\n\nThe rule bars, players, umpires, and team and league officials from betting on baseball in general, with the penalty for doing so a one-year suspension. It also states that any MLB player who wagers on any game they're involved in will be banned permanently.\n\nBut MLB, again, like other leagues, is finding recently that having rules against gambling is not stopping players from violating those policies in the age of widespread legal sports betting. The \"Big Four\" leagues have all imposed discipline on players since the 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision that paved the way for legal wagering to expand in the country.\n\nThat discipline is made all the more awkward given the business relationships leagues have formed with sportsbook operators since 2018, MLB included. So, as leagues are earning more revenue through the partnerships and the added advertising sports betting can help generate, they are also dealing with the headaches of players running afoul of gambling policies.\n\nMLB is still dealing with the fallout from another gambling-related controversy from earlier this year. The former interpreter for Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani agreed only last month to plead guilty to federal criminal charges in connection to debts owed to an illegal bookmaking operation.\n\nAlthough that incident involves illegal betting, gambling-related controversies have prompted some sports governing bodies to reconsider what they think bettors should be legally wagering on.\n\nMost notably, the NCAA has been lobbying state lawmakers to ban college player props over concerns about student-athlete harassment.\n\nThe NBA, meanwhile, is reportedly interested in tweaks to betting markets as well after former Toronto Raptor Jontay Porter was banned for gambling on league games, among other things.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucupita_Marcano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucupita Marcano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Players_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Players Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_governing_body", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports governing body"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jontay_Porter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jontay Porter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsbook", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sportsbook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_professional_sports_leagues_in_the_United_States_and_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/3e497146-79e2-4d9a-9a93-149fc0e56d48.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621706", "eventUri": "eng-9621706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

MLB said he placed 387 baseball bets totaling more than $150,000 in October 2022 and from last July through November with a legal sportsbook.\n\nIn addition to Rodr\u00edguez, three other players received one-year suspensions for betting on baseball: pitchers Jay Groome of the San Diego organization, a native of Barnegat, N.J., the Oakland Athletics' Michael Kelly, and Arizona's Andrew Saalfrank.\n\nCommissioner Rob Manfred said the following in a statement released by MLB:\n\n\"The strict enforcement of Major League Baseball's rules and policies governing gambling conduct is a critical component of upholding our most important priority: protecting the integrity of our games for the fans. The long-standing prohibition against betting on Major League Baseball games by those in the sport has been a bedrock principle for over a century. We have been clear that the privilege of playing in baseball comes with a responsibility to refrain from engaging in certain types of behavior that are legal for other people.\n\n\"Since the Supreme Court decision opened the door to legalized sports betting, we have worked with licensed sports betting operators and other third parties to put ourselves in a better position from an integrity perspective through the transparency that a regulated sports betting system can provide.

The conduct has barred him from entering the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\nMarcano's ban is the latest in a list of high-profile sports-betting scandals.\n\nIn April, Toronto Raptors player Jontay Porter was permanently banned from the NBA for leaking health information to a sports bettor, among other violations.\n\nSeparately, the former interpreter for Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani was charged in April with stealing $16 million from the pitcher in order to pay off his gambling debts.\n\nAnd in the UK, Premiere League star Lucas Paqueta is facing a lifetime ban from soccer over allegations he purposefully got himself punished during games in order to help friends win their bets.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "geoff_weiss@businessinsider.com", "name": "Geoff Weiss", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Manfred", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Manfred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jontay_Porter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jontay Porter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/665f45ddd0b8e1c832cbccf5?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621706", "eventUri": "eng-9621706", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}
{"uri": "8161458089", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-06-04", "time": "16:21:46", "dateTime": "2024-06-04T16:21:46Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-06-04T16:19:53Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5411764979362488, "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlbs-ineligible-list-tucupita-marcano-becomes-latest-to-get-lifetime-ban-from-commissioner-rob-manfred/", "title": "MLB's ineligible list: Tucupita Marcano becomes latest to get lifetime ban from commissioner Rob Manfred - CBSSports.com", "body": "Marcano has been permanently banned for gambling on his own team's games USATSI\n\nMajor League Baseball announced on Tuesday that injured San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano has been permanently banned after violating the league's gambling policy. (Marcano was one of five players disciplined for gambling-related violations.) A league investigation found that Marcano had placed nearly 400 bets on baseball games, including MLB and international contests, and that he had gambled on games involving his team, then the Pittsburgh Pirates, while he was on the IL.\n\nMLB allows uniform personnel to partake in sports gambling, provided that it is legal in their territory and that the personnel do not place bets on the diamond sports (baseball and softball). The other four players suspended on Tuesday were given year-long banishments since they did not gamble on games played by their own team -- a line that Marcano crossed with his Pirates bets. Although Marcano was not active at the time (he suffered a torn ACL last July), betting on games that he had a direct tie to violated MLB Rule 21, which states that \"any player, umpire, or club or League official or employee, who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform, shall be declared permanently ineligible.\"\n\nMarcano, 24, appeared in 149 big-league games during his career. He hit .217/.269/.320 (63 OPS+) with five home runs, seven stolen bases, and 34 runs batted in. Far more notable than what he did on the field is what he signifies off it: the latest individual to be placed on the restricted list by MLB commissioner Rob Manfred. Indeed, Manfred has made full use of the restricted list during his tenure, policing the league by preventing at least eight individuals from having any involvement in MLB.\n\nIn light of Marcano's inclusion in that group, we here at CBS Sports felt this would be a fitting occasion to recap those individuals and how they ended up on the list.\n\nJenrry Mej\u00eda\n\nMej\u00eda became the first player in MLB history to be suspended for life over performance-enhancing drug use in 2016, when he recorded his third positive test. Mej\u00eda had, to that point, appeared in 113 big-league games and had amassed a 3.68 ERA and 28 saves. He would have his lifetime ban lifted in summer 2018, and he would go on to make minor-league appearances for the Mets and Red Sox. He would, however, never again pitch in the majors because of performance reasons. He remains active to this day, pitching for the Saraperos de Saltillo of the Mexican League.\n\nChris Correa\n\nIn what will serve as a common theme in this piece, Correa was not a player but an executive. During his time as the Cardinals scouting director, he improperly accessed an Astros internal database, believing that former Cardinals executive Jeff Luhnow (then the Astros general manager) had stolen proprietary information. Correa was not only banned for life by MLB, he was sentenced to 46 months in prison, having violated federal laws in the process. There's no indication that Correa has been reinstated or sought to be allowed back.\n\nJohn Coppolella\n\nMLB banished Coppolella, then the Braves general manager, in November 2017 after it was found that he had circumvented the league's rules on international signing limits. (The Braves were also forced to release 12 players, including hyped shortstops Kevin Mait\u00e1n and Ji Hwan Bae, the latter of whom subsequently rose to the majors as a member of the Pirates. Coppolella was officially reinstated by MLB back in January 2023, but he's yet to rejoin an organization.\n\nBrandon Taubman\n\nTaubman is yet another executive. Formerly an assistant general manager with the Astros, he was fired in October 2019 after making inappropriate remarks toward female reporters following a Houston playoff victory. Taubman was said to have yelled \"Thank God we got Osuna! I'm so [expletive] glad we got Osuna!\" in reference to closer Roberto Osuna, who the Astros had acquired in controversial fashion following his 75-game suspension for violating MLB's domestic violence policy. Taubman was reportedly reinstated by MLB in 2020, though he's yet to publicly resurface in a front office.\n\nRoberto Alomar\n\nAlomar, a Hall of Fame second baseman, was placed on the restricted list in May 2021 after a league investigation into alleged sexual misconduct toward an industry employee in 2014. Although Alomar remained enshrined in Cooperstown, he was removed from the Blue Jays' \"Level of Excellence\" and resigned from the Hall of Fame's Board of Directors. There's no indication that Alomar has sought or been granted reinstatement.\n\nMickey Callaway\n\nCallaway was also placed on the ineligible list in May 2021 following a league investigation into alleged lewd conduct toward women that included inappropriate text messages and comments. Callaway, who had previously managed the Mets, was at the time serving as the pitching coach for the Angels. As with Alomar, there's no indication that Callaway has attempted to be reinstated by MLB.\n\nJared Porter\n\nPorter was placed on the ineligible list in July 2021 after it was reported that he had sent a woman reporter 62 consecutive unanswered text messages. Porter, who had served as the Mets general manager, was to be ineligible through the 2022 season, at which point he could apply to be reinstated. It's unclear if he has applied for reinstatement in the year and a half since.\n\nTucupita Marcano\n\nWe conclude with where we started. At present, there's no way of knowing if Marcano will ever be reinstated by Manfred, or if his banishment from the game over gambling violations will stand the test of time, the way that Pete Rose's (among others) have throughout baseball history. If nothing else, Marcano has assured himself a place in baseball lore, albeit for the wrong reasons.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_j_anderson@cbssports.com", "name": "R.J.

MLB Rule 21 states that \"any player or person connected with a club\" who bets on games involving their own team is subject to a lifetime ban, as was the case for MLB hit king Pete Rose, who remains banned from the game and the Baseball Hall of Fame for gambling during his tenure as the Cincinnati Reds' manager.\n\nFour minor league players are also reported to be facing potential discipline for gambling pending an ongoing investigation, sources confirmed to ESPN.

The investigation is ongoing, and representatives for Marcano, the MLBPA, and MLB are for the moment staying tight-lipped in public, but the widespread expectation seems to be that Marcano will be lucky to escape with any eligibility to return to professional baseball at all.\n\nMarcano, however, is just the latest in an alarming string of athletes who have been implicated in professional gambling scandals. Nor is the problem limited to baseball. In April, the NBA announced a lifetime ban for Toronto Raptors reserve player Jontay Porter, who not only was alleged to have bet on games, but also allegedly provided illegal inside information to gamblers in exchange for money and on at least one occasion allegedly faked an illness to limit his own participation in a game in order to ensure that a particular proposition bet paid off.\n\nAnd of course, most embarrassingly, the most exciting player in recent baseball memory, Shohei Ohtani, was caught up in a gambling scandal when his interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, was allegedly busted by the feds for stealing millions of dollars from Ohtani to pay off debts he incurred by wagering on sports with an illegal bookie. Although that investigation also remains ongoing, the likelihood that a person in Mizuhara's situation may have provided inside information to gamblers that he was privy to only because of his position as Ohtani's interpreter seems quite high.\n\nThe biggest threat to the future of professional sports is not woke politics or the specter of people who were born biologically male dominating female athletes. It's gambling and the insidious effect that the industry plainly has on the integrity of sports competition.\n\nSports, at its core, is watchable solely because the audience believes that the athletes involved in the competition are playing an honest game that involves both sides' best efforts to win. If fans don't believe that games are on the level, sports cannot survive.\n\nGambling, at its core, is enjoyable to gamblers because it combines the adrenaline of vicarious fan participation in sport with the allure of a potentially large payday without doing work.\n\nIt should be obvious to all that the incentives created by gambling inherently threaten the basis for sport itself.\n\nThere is a reason that, in 2018, all four major sports in America petitioned the Supreme Court to keep the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, which effectively banned gambling on single sporting events outside Las Vegas. The leagues knew that sports gambling is a nightmare to police, and from the leagues' perspective, the more they could outsource that job to the feds, the better.\n\nHowever, when the Supreme Court struck down PASPA in 2018 on fairly narrow technical grounds, Congress had no appetite to pass a law that fixed the flaws that invalidated PASPA. There was not even a serious discussion to bring a bill to that effect to the floor.\n\nAnd with shocking speed, the sports leagues and the sports-consuming public embraced the reality of a world in which sports betting could be done anywhere, on anything. Las Vegas, which had long been shunned by the leagues due to the danger of having a team so close to the seat of organized gambling, suddenly got an NFL team to keep its NHL team company. DraftKings and other companies became some of the most prominent sports advertisers. ESPN opened a vertical called ESPN BET that not only covered gambling but allowed people to gamble online in its portal.\n\nAnd somehow, when news broke that millions of dollars had been siphoned from the bank account of the most famous baseball player since at least Barry Bonds to cover gambling debts, we were all surprised.\n\nIt is comforting to believe that the leagues have the situation under control and that Marcano, Porter, and Mizuhara were isolated cases. The leagues have even pointed to their cases as evidence that their control mechanisms are working.\n\nBut the Mizuhara case in particular puts the lie to that contention. Here was an individual who was, effectively, the mouthpiece of the most prominent player in baseball. According to investigators, he placed an astonishing number of bets -- estimated to be over 19,000 -- over a period that lasted three years.\n\nAs the story goes, he began siphoning money in the form of public wire transfers that were for huge dollar amounts in September 2023. A total of at least nine of these transactions were authorized and executed over the intervening months. None of this was discovered until January 2024, and even then it was not discovered by the league, it was discovered by the feds. If the feds had not raided the home of Mizuhara's alleged bookie, who knows how long it would have taken baseball to catch on to what was happening?\n\nThe problem does not admit of easy answers. There is little or no appetite for a legislative solution because, perversely, the public at large enjoys betting on sports, as evidenced by the massive growth in the sports betting industry that has occurred since 2018. Additionally, the industry is greasing the wheels of both the media that covers sports and the teams themselves with copious amounts of advertising money. Sports fans and media may well be unwittingly sowing the seeds of destruction for sports with their own desires.\n\nBut even if all this were not true, a legislative fix would likely still not be the answer. Trusting the federal government to deal with the problem by making it illegal is a lazy approach that was ineffective while it lasted. Gambling was largely illegal when Tim Donaghy bet on games for two years as an NBA referee before he got caught. Gambling was largely illegal when Pete Rose reportedly bet on baseball in 1987 -- something he was not caught doing until 1989.\n\nThis problem is not one that the feds could or should solve. But it's one that the leagues themselves need to wrestle with, and quickly. The steady stream of stories about people who have been caught does and should cause sports fans to question how many more compromised athletes are out there who have not been caught, or at least not caught yet. And it's only a matter of time before those questions turn to cynicism about the legitimacy of sports' on-field product.\n\nAnd when that happens, sports as we know them will be over.", "source":

Pete Rose was retired when he agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989.\n\nMarcano, 24, has not played since tearing his right ACL last July 24.

Bochy told Venable on Sunday that he would be out, and made out the lineup for the game he is missing.\n\nThe outcome will count toward Bochy's managerial record, which was 2,122-2,131 going into the game. He is 10th on the career wins list, with the most wins among active managers.\n\nIt was the first game Bochy missed since taking over as the Rangers' manager before last season, when they won their first World Series title. It was the fourth for Bochy, who won three championships with San Francisco, which will visit Texas next weekend.\n\nPHILLIES: The team placed outfielder Brandon Marsh on the 10-day injured list with a strained right hamstring.\n\nThe NL East leaders also put infielder Kody Clemens on the 10-day IL with low back spasms. Outfielder David Dahl and utilityman Weston Wilson were promoted from Triple-A Lehigh Valley, and right-hander Michael Rucker was transferred to the 60-day IL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDahl, 30, was in the starting lineup for the opener of a three-game series against NL Central-leading Milwaukee. It was Dahl's first major league game since April 4, 2023, for San Diego against Arizona.\n\nDahl was selected by Colorado in the first round of the 2012 amateur draft.

Pete Rose was retired when he agreed to a lifetime ban in 1989.\n\nMarcano, 24, has not played since tearing his right ACL last July 24. He was claimed by the Padres off waivers on Nov. 2 and placed on the 10-day injured list March 19.\n\nRANGERS: Texas Manager Bruce Bochy is dealing with a \"scheduled personal matter\" and missed Monday night's game against Detroit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe team didn't elaborate on his absence, but said he was expected to return for Tuesday's game.\n\nWill Venable, the team's associate manager, ran the Rangers for the series opener against the Tigers. Bochy told Venable on Sunday that he would be out, and made out the lineup for the game he is missing.\n\nThe outcome will count toward Bochy's managerial record, which was 2,122-2,131 going into the game. He is 10th on the career wins list, with the most wins among active managers.\n\nIt was the first game Bochy missed since taking over as the Rangers' manager before last season, when they won their first World Series title. It was the fourth for Bochy, who won three championships with San Francisco, which will visit Texas next weekend.\n\nPHILLIES: The team placed outfielder Brandon Marsh on the 10-day injured list with a strained right hamstring.\n\nThe NL East leaders also put infielder Kody Clemens on the 10-day IL with low back spasms. Outfielder David Dahl and utilityman Weston Wilson were promoted from Triple-A Lehigh Valley, and right-hander Michael Rucker was transferred to the 60-day IL.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDahl, 30, was in the starting lineup for the opener of a three-game series against NL Central-leading Milwaukee. It was Dahl's first major league game since April 4, 2023, for San Diego against Arizona.\n\nDahl was selected by Colorado in the first round of the 2012 amateur draft. He agreed to a minor league contract with Philadelphia in February.\n\nORIOLES: Baltimore prospect Connor Norby made his major league debut Monday night against Toronto.\n\nNorby and left-hander Nick Vespi were brought up from Triple-A Norfolk before the opener of a four-game series against the Blue Jays.\n\nNorby played second base and batted ninth against former Orioles right-hander Kevin Gausman.\n\nA second-round pick in the 2022 draft, Norby hit .286 with nine homers and 36 RBI in 51 games at Triple-A.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nASTROS: The team wasn't ready to say whether starter Jos\u00e9 Urquidy is done for the season amid reports that a second Tommy John surgery is possible.\n\nUrquidy hasn't pitched this season after straining his right forearm in spring training. He appeared close to coming off the injured list before leaving a rehabilitation start for Triple-A Sugar Land with right elbow inflammation on May 24.\n\nGIANTS: Left-hander Blake Snell was placed on the 15-day injured list, one day after leaving a game against the New York Yankees with a left groin strain.\n\nVeteran outfielder Michael Conforto will take Snell's place on the roster. Conforto has been out since May 11 because of a hamstring injury. He's hitting .280 with seven homers and 20 RBI this season.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Justin Jefferson agreed to a four-year, $140-million extension that includes $110 million guaranteed and over $88 million at signing.\n\nYou shouldn't need the stats to prove Jefferson's incredible career, but just in case, here they are:\n\nThe production: Jefferson's 98.3 yards receiving per game is on pace for most in a career in NFL history. The current mark belongs to Calvin Johnson at 86.1.No empty stats: Since entering the NFL in 2020, Jefferson's 0.43 expected points added per target ranks third in the NFL (min. 100 targets) behind only Brandon Aiyuk and Tee Higgins.Quarterback's best friend: According to NFL Next Gen Stats, Jefferson has 40 more catches than expected (based on several factors, like defenders' positioning, depth of target, etc.), most in the NFL since 2020.\n\nThat last point means a lot considering Minnesota is transitioning from Kirk Cousins to first-round rookie J.J. McCarthy and/or Sam Darnold. Wrapping up Jefferson, 24, through 2028 is just one of many reasons the Vikings have crushed this offseason, Cody Benjamin writes.\n\nWide receivers as a whole are happy, too. Jefferson ($35 million per year) is one of five wide receivers making over $28 million per year. Four of those five signed their contracts this offseason.

If he is found to have broken the rules, he faces a lifetime ban.\n\nMarcano joined the Padres as an amateur free agent in 2016 and debuted for San Diego in 2021. He was traded to Pittsburgh in 2021 and played for the Pirates in 2022 and 2023.He rejoined the Padres in November 2023 but has not played in a game this season due to a torn ACL.Four minor-league players have also been accused of gambling on MLB games.\n\nMLB players can legally gamble on non-diamond sports but cannot gamble on any level of baseball or softball. Those who gamble on diamond sports face a one-year ban on first offense and a lifetime ban if they gamble on their own team.\n\nGambling scandals have marred the still-young MLB season. In March, Ippei Mizuhara -- Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter -- was charged with stealing more than $16 million from Ohtani to pay off gambling debts to an illegal bookie. Mizuhara faces up to 33 years in prison. David Fletcher, currently a Braves minor leaguer, is being investigated for placing bets with that same bookie. Neither Mizuhara nor Fletcher are accused of betting on baseball.\n\nR.J. Anderson has a full history of baseball betting scandals.\n\nGambling scandals aren't limited to baseball, of course, and they have become more prevalent recently, with legalized gambling on the rise. Since the start of 2023, in addition to the scandals above ...\n\nJontay Porter received a lifetime ban from the NBA after he disclosed confidential information to bettors and placed bets.Several NFL players were suspended for parts or all of last season, one year after Calvin Ridley missed the entire season for gambling.There have been betting scandals involving athletes at Iowa and Iowa State and a separate case involving former Alabama baseball coach Brad Bohannon.\n\nThe Supreme Court struck down prohibitions on sports gambling in 2018.\n\n\ud83d\ude14 Not so honorable mentions Brandon Marsh (hamstring) landed on the IL.Mbappe isn't on France's Olympic roster. \ud83c\udfc6 NBA Finals expert picks: Our staff is split\n\nIt may not be the NBA Finals matchup we expected -- at least on one side of the bracket -- but it's setting up to be a thrilling one.\n\nOut of the West, we have an offensive supernova, an absolute force, a superstar of the highest order taking to the biggest stage for the first time in Luka Doncic. His Mavericks supporting cast, led by a rejuvenated Kyrie Irving, trade deadline acquisitions P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford and rookie surprise (even to himself) Dereck Lively II is nothing to sneeze at. Dallas is in its first Finals since 2011.\n\nOut of the East, we have the Celtics, who are no stranger to postseason success. Over the past eight seasons, Boston has won more playoff games than anyone, but they're still looking for their first title since a Doc Rivers-led squad featuring Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and an emerging Rajon Rondo beat the Lakers in 2008. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, the mainstays of this era of Boston hoops, still lead the charge, but Kristaps Porzingis, Jrue Holiday and Derrick White supplement one of the best teams we've seen in a long time.\n\nDoncic can stake another claim to best-in-the-world status. Brown and Tatum can finally complete the biggest task from a successful-yet-incomplete era and answer all lingering questions. There's plenty of intrigue, drama and great basketball to come.\n\nThat's why our experts are exactly split on their picks. Sam Quinn likes Dallas.\n\nQuinn: \"If the Thunder and Timberwolves struggled to get to the rim against Dallas, I think Boston will too, and I'm not going to bet on them to make enough contested triples to win this series that way. A healthy Porzingis might offer their offense enough space and enough versatility to swing this thing, but until I see how he looks on the floor in a high-leverage moment, I'm just not going to believe he's in the kind of shape he'd need to be for Boston to win this series.\"\n\nColin Ward-Henninger, meanwhile, took Boston.\n\nWard-Henninger: \"So, to me, this series comes down to which team will more consistently sustain excellence. Despite having a path to the Finals paved in gold, the Celtics have given us no reason to believe that they won't continue to be the juggernaut we've seen all season long. Most importantly, they have a versatile defensive roster seemingly created to make life hell for players like Doncic and Irving.\"\n\nWe'll have plenty more in the coming days, so stay tuned!\n\n\ud83c\udfc0 WNBA Power Rankings: Sun's suffocating defense has them No. 1\n\nLet's look at some numbers from the Sun's 8-0 start to the season:\n\nSeventh WNBA team to start 8-0Five games from tying the best start to a season (2016 Lynx started 13-0)Best defensive rating in the WNBA this season (89.1)\n\nBut here's my favorite: The Sun already have two games allowing 50 points or fewer this season, the first team with multiple such games in a season since 2008. They're the first team to do it multiple times within their first eight games since the 2001 Cleveland Rockers.\n\nSo, yeah, it's not fun to play the Sun. Add five double-digit scorers to the mix, and Connecticut is an easy call atop Jack Maloney's WNBA Power Rankings.\n\nSunLibertyAcesLynxStorm Cowboys legend, NFL Hall of Famer Larry Allen dies at 52\n\nHall-of-Fame offensive lineman Larry Allen, a longtime stalwart for the Cowboys and one of the most decorated linemen ever, died suddenly on Sunday while on vacation in Mexico with his family. He was 52 years old.\n\nAllen, drafted by Dallas in the second round in 1994, played a dozen seasons with the Cowboys and the final two years of his career with the 49ers.The career accolades are astonishing: 11 Pro Bowl selections, six first-team All-Pro selections, one Super Bowl ring and selections to both the All-1990s and All-2000s Pro Football Hall of Fame All-Decade teams.He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2013, two years after he was inducted into the Cowboys Ring of Honor.\n\nAt 6'3\" and 335 pounds, Allen was an incredible athlete who played every offensive line position except center throughout his marvelous career, opening up gaping holes for the NFL's all-time leading rusher, Emmitt Smith. Offensive linemen rarely make highlights, but Allen was an exception, bulldozing defenders, running alongside or faster than players much smaller than him and lifting jaw-dropping amounts of weight.\n\nBryan DeArdo ranks Allen as a top-10 player -- and the top offensive lineman -- in Cowboys history.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa What we're watching Tuesday\n\n\u26be Twins at Yankees, 7:05 p.m. on

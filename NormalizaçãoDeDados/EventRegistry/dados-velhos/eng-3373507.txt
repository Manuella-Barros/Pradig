He struck out six and walked one while getting his first win since July 29.\n\nTrailing 2-1, the Rockies took the lead with a three-run third. Marquez legged out a double with one out and Blackmon singled to put runners at the corners. Arenado got his two-run triple off the right-field wall with two outs, and Parra followed with a run-scoring single that zipped off the outstretched glove of Milwaukee shortstop Orlando Arcia to put Colorado ahead 4-2.\n\nParra added a solo homer and Gonzalez's two-run shot a batter later chased Brewers starter Matt Garza (6-7) in the fifth.\n\nThe Rockies scored more than four runs for just the third time in their last 13 games.\n\nDomingo Santana homered for Milwaukee, and Keon Broxton and Arcia hit consecutive solo shots, the sixth time the Brewers have had back-to-back homers this year.\n\nEric Thames added a double and triple for the Brewers, who snapped a four-game winning streak.\n\nGarza allowed eight runs in 4 1/3 innings. He is now 2-6 with a 6.90 ERA in his career against the Rockies and 0-4 with a 10.02 mark at Coors Field.\n\nBlackmon drove a slider over the left field wall on Garza's fourth pitch of the game.\n\nHOFFMAN GETS A BREATHER\n\nThe Rockies optioned RHP Jeff Hoffman to Triple-A Albuquerque after he surrendered four home runs in 4 1/3 innings against Atlanta on Thursday. Colorado manager Bud Black said Hoffman won't pitch for at least five to six days to give his arm a break. The 24-year-old went 0-4 with a 7.36 ERA in last six outings.\n\nINF Ryan McMahon was also optioned to the minors. To fill the roster spots, the Rockies recalled RHP Scott Oberg and OF Mike Tauchman.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nBrewers: C Stephen Vogt (knee) was reinstated from the 10-day disabled list and C Andrew Susac was placed on the 10-day DL.\n\nRockies: Arenado was back in the lineup after a sharply hit ball hit his left hand on Thursday. The ball hit the same spot where Arenado was hit by a fastball from Miami pitcher Vance Worley four days earlier. \"It doesn't feel good,\" Arenado said. \"But I can still swing. I can still play defense.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBrewers: Brandon Woodruff (1-1, 1.50 ERA) had his turn in the rotation skipped on Tuesday. Over his first two starts in the majors, the 24-year-old has given up two runs in 12 innings.\n\nRockies: RHP Chad Bettis (0-0, 0.00) made an emotional return to the mound Monday, tossing seven shutout innings against Atlanta. Bettis was diagnosed with testicular cancer in November and underwent chemotherapy over the season.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T04:53:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 569, "textStart": 562, "imp":

Gerardo Parra hit his 10th homer in the fifth, and two batters later Carlos Gonzalez hit a two-run homer that gave the Rockies an 8-2 lead and finished Garza's outing. He has failed to pitch six innings in six straight starts.\n\nGarza (6-7) is 2-6 with a 6.90 ERA in eight starts against the Rockies and is 0-4 with a 10.02 ERA in four starts at Coors Field.\n\nThe win was the fourth in 11 games for the Rockies, who moved one game ahead of Arizona in the National League wild-card race.\n\nThe Brewers, whose four-game winning streak ended, fell into fourth place, a half game behind St. Louis in the chase for second wild-card spot.\n\nRockies starter German Marquez (10-5) gave up a career-high three home runs but all came with the bases empty.\n\nAfter giving up single runs in the third and fourth, Marquez yielded back-to-back homers in the sixth to Keon Broxton and Orlando Arica, both long drives over the fence in center.\n\nThose homers trimmed Colorado's lead to 8-4 and ended Marquez's start after 5 2/3 innings. He gave up seven hits and four runs with one walk and six strikeouts and surrendered a career-high three home runs.\n\nFour Rockies relievers combined to hold the Brewers scoreless for the final 3 1/3 innings. Closer Greg Holland, who had gone three days without pitching, finished in a non-save situation.\n\nGerardo Parra extended the Rockies' lead to 6-2 when he led off the fifth with his 10th home run and just his second since July 17. Garza then struck out Mark Reynolds, who reached first base on a wild pitch thrown on the third strike, and Carlos Gonzalez followed with an opposite-field two-run homer that increased the lead to 8-2 and finished Garza.\n\nIt was the third homer off Garza, who gave up nine hits and eight runs (seven earned) in 4 1/3 innings.\n\nBrewers third baseman Travis Shaw made a sprawling stop of Trevor Story's hard grounder in the fourth, tried for a forceout but threw wide of second base. And Gonzalez, who was on second, continued home to make it 5-2.\n\nBut Garza escaped a big inning. He intentionally walked Blackmon with one out and first base open and got DJ LeMahieu to ground into an inning-ending double play.\n\nNolan Arenado tripled home two runs in the third and scored to give the Rockies a 4-2 lead when Parra followed with a single, lining a ball that went off the glove of leaping shortstop Orlando Arcia. Arenado's drive hit off the right-field wall\n\nMarquez began the inning by hustling a single into a double before Charlie singled.\n\nDomingo Santana tied the score at 1 when he hit his 20th homer in the second, and the Brewers went ahead 2-1 in the third when Eric Thames led off with a triple and Neil Walker followed with a single.\n\nBlackmon hit his 29th homer to open the first. It was his sixth leadoff homer of the season and the 28th of his career.\n\nNOTES: Rockies RHP Jeff Hoffman and INF Ryan McMahon were optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque and RHP Scott Oberg and OF Mike Tauchman were recalled. ... Rockies RHP Antonio Senzatela will take Hoffman's place in the rotation. ... Rockies 3B Nolan Arenado was in the lineup. He left in the seventh inning Thursday with a bone bruise on his left hand where he was hit with a hard grounder. ... Brewers C Stephen Vogt (left knee sprain) was reinstated and C Andrew Susac (right trapezius strain) was placed on the 10-day disabled list retroactive to Aug. 15. ... The Brewers hit back-to-back homers for the sixth time this season and first time since July 25 at Washington.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T06:07:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 263, "textStart":

The Rockies entered the series with a 4.5 game lead on the Brewers for a National League Wild Card spot.\n\nFriday's win set the tone for the series, as the Rockies showed balance both at the plate and on the mound. It was a complete win for a Rockies club that has been hit or miss of late.\n\nColorado's offense rediscovered their stride following a sluggish performance Thursday, tallying eight runs on nine hits. Charlie Blackmon continued his prolonged offensive tear this season, recording two hits, including a leadoff home run to start the ballgame. Carlos Gonzalez also had a two-hit performance and blasted his eighth home run of the season, a two-run, opposite-field shot. Gerardo Parra stayed hot with a pair of hits, raising his batting average to .344 on the season and completing the home run trifecta from the Rockies' outfielders.\n\nStarting pitcher German Marquez (10-5, 4.24 ERA) helped his own cause with a double and a run scored, a nice bonus to an overall solid outing for the 22-year-old. Marquez was on point for a majority of his 5.2 innings of work. Towards the end, the Brewers jumped on him for a pair of home runs, but in the end, he pitched well enough to get the Rockies the win.\n\nMarquez logged 5.2 innings, allowing four runs on seven hits while striking out six hitters and became the third Rockies rookie this season to earn 10 wins.\n\nMarquez is now 6-0 with a 3.12 ERA over his past eight starts at Coors Field since May 10, per Rockies PR. Colorado has won each of those games.\n\nThe Rockies and Brewers continue the series tomorrow night with Chad Bettis scheduled to make his second start of the season for the Rockies. He will oppose Brewers right-hander Brandon Woodruff.

He struck out six and walked one while getting his first win since July 29.\n\nTrailing 2-1, the Rockies took the lead with a three-run third.

Colorado manager Bud Black said Hoffman won't pitch for at least five to six days to give his arm a break. The 24-year-old went 0-4 with a 7.36 ERA in last six outings.\n\nINF Ryan McMahon was also optioned to the minors. To fill the roster spots, the Rockies recalled RHP Scott Oberg and OF Mike Tauchman.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nBrewers: C Stephen Vogt (knee) was reinstated from the 10-day disabled list and C Andrew Susac was placed on the 10-day DL.\n\nRockies: Arenado was back in the lineup after a sharply hit ball hit his left hand on Thursday. The ball hit the same spot where Arenado was hit by a fastball from Miami pitcher Vance Worley four days earlier. \"It doesn't feel good,\" Arenado said. \"But I can still swing. I can still play defense.\"\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBrewers: Brandon Woodruff (1-1, 1.50 ERA) had his turn in the rotation skipped on Tuesday. Over his first two starts in the majors, the 24-year-old has given up two runs in 12 innings.\n\nRockies: RHP Chad Bettis (0-0, 0.00) made an emotional return to the mound Monday, tossing seven shutout innings against Atlanta.

In the midst of a four-game winning streak - their longest since winning five in a row from July 3-7 - the Brewers came to Denver already playing some solid baseball.\n\nMLB: Live scoreboard, box scores, standings, schedules\n\nFolding three more key veterans into the mix figures to only help the cause.\n\n\"Coming off those two games against Pittsburgh, those were some really, really good games,\" said Anderson, referencing the two-game sweep of the Pirates at Miller Park that preceded this trip.\n\n\"Getting Stephen back and myself and adding Neil Walker - it's a boost. The guys that we have now, we're looking forward to playing meaningful games deep into September.\"\n\nManager Craig Counsell was even more straightforward.\n\n\"Yeah, we feel like we're upgrading the roster,\" he said.\n\nVogt, who was claimed off waivers from the Oakland A's on June 25, made a significant offensive impact in his three-plus weeks before being injured. He hit .250 with four home runs and nine runs batted in, providing a nice left-handed-hitting complement to Manny Pi\u00f1a behind the plate in addition to another veteran presence in a largely inexperienced clubhouse.\n\nHe was injured in a home-plate collision in Pittsburgh on July 17 and was placed on the DL a day later with a sprained left knee. It was the first major-league DL stint of Vogt's career, and after six minor-league rehab games split between Class A Wisconsin and Class AAA Colorado Springs he's now back in the mix behind the plate.\n\n\"I got close to 20 plate appearances, caught three games and played first for one,\" said Vogt, who will play with the same sort of protective knee brace that football linemen typically use.\n\n\"I tested the knee in all ways and got one of every play you can really think of. It felt good. It definitely progressed along over the week. The first game didn't feel great and then the second game felt a lot better and then yesterday felt as normal as it can. I feel good.\n\n\"I'm ready to go. I feel like it's Christmas morning.\"\n\nWhile Pi\u00f1a has performed admirably in Vogt's absence - he entered Friday hitting .290 with nine homers and 39 RBI to go with some tremendous defense - Counsell said he envisions a platoon somewhat similar to what he was employing before Vogt was injured.\n\nPi\u00f1a, whose eighth-inning homer Wednesday clinched the Brewers' sweep of the Pirates, started Friday.\n\n\"I think Manny and him will share time,\" he said. \"Manny has been playing wonderfully, and I certainly acknowledge that and keep that in mind. But the purpose of getting Stephen out to play six games in a row was that, hopefully, he can be in a place where he can contribute pretty good with the bat.\n\n\"We still like the balance he provides the lineup. I anticipate kind of going back to when we acquired Stephen.

He also provided some much-needed stability to a rotation that was largely inconsistent early in the season.\n\nThe good news is that with Anderson out, Zach Davies and Jimmy Nelson stepped up their games and are performing at a high level. Matt Garza also has been holding his own, and youngsters Brent Suter and Brandon Woodruff have largely delivered when given the opportunity.\n\nNow Anderson gets thrown back into the mix, with the hope he'll be able to hit the ground running.\n\n\"I think the most exciting part about it is I get to do my job again and perform in a big-league game,\" said Anderson. \"You never take that for granted. It's a blessing every time you get to go out there. I know this game doesn't last real long; you play 10 years and it's a long career.\n\n\"I'm just thankful to get another chance to go back out there and do my thing. I'm looking forward to Sunday, and I just hope I can pick up where I left off.\"\n\nWalker, meanwhile, was making his fourth start Friday in as many games with the Brewers since being acquired with cash for a player to be named. He's hitting .500 with a homer and two RBI and has been a perfect fit in the lineup because of his ability to switch hit.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T01:23:00Z",

The upstart Milwaukee Brewers, winners of four in a row, had climbed close enough to whisper a threat at Colorado's standing in a wild-card chase.\n\nCarlos Gonzalez knows the score. He is the lone remaining player from the Rockies' last trip to the postseason, in 2009. And when the veteran slugger looked out from the batters box at a wide-open lane to left field in the fifth inning, where a simple bunt would put him on base, Gonzalez chose instead a bolder swing.\n\nGonzalez's line drive home run to left field in the Rockies' 8-4 victory over the Brewers helped kick off a critical weekend series for a team bearing down for an extended fight. The best record in club history will ultimately fall hollow if Colorado crumbles before October.\n\nThe Rockies (68-54) moved back atop the wild-card standings, one game ahead of the Arizona Diamondbacks (67-55) and 5 1/2 ahead of the Brewers (63-60), as Charlie Blackmon and Gerardo Parra also homered in front of 32,385 fans in LoDo.\n\nA split four-game series with the Atlanta Braves through Thursday somehow felt worrisome at Coors Field, as if the Rockies' stride toward September is on wobbly footing. But as they bounced Milwaukee's Matt Garza for eight runs (seven earned) into the fifth inning, Colorado found a stride. The best-hitting home team in baseball has scored 29 runs in their past three games.\n\nBlackmon's homer spoke of impatience. He pushed Garza's fourth pitch of the first inning to the left-field bleachers, Blackmon's team-leading 29th homer this season. It was his second homer the opposite direction in two days.\n\nDomingo Santana's solo homer off Rockies rookie right-hander German Marquez in the second only momentarily evened the score. Marquez doubled in the third inning and scored, trailed by Blackmon, on Nolan Arenado's triple off the right-field scoreboard. Parra then knocked in Arenado and the Rockies were comfortably ahead the rest of the way.\n\nParra pointed at a 440-foot homer off the back of the bullpen wall in the fifth. But Gonzalez's homer two batters later was an indication of something larger. First, Mark Reynolds swung at strike three but lumbered safely to first when the ball blubbered away. Then as the Brewers shifted heavy to the right side, leaving third base and shortstop wide open, Gonzalez nailed just his second homer since June 21.\n\nGonzalez's ability to hit for power has eluded him for most of the season. He hit 65 home runs over the past two seasons, but his high-stepping sweet swing lost its timing. But the Rockies have decided to wait for Gonzalez to find his form. If his lot is a No. 6 hitter, a slugger's stroke would transform the Rockies' lineup.\n\nMarquez (10-5, 4.24 ERA) held Milwaukee to two runs on five hits through five innings. But Keon Broxton and Orlando Arcia hammered consecutive homers off the 22-year-old in the sixth, both to the deep part of the park into the forest beyond center field. Marquez gave up four runs in total, including three homers, on seven hits in 5 2/3 innings.\n\nBut the Rockies bullpen held and Greg Holland struck out Arcia and Eric Thames in a hitless ninth.",

He moved to second on a groundout by Orlando Arcia which brought Aguilar to the plate batting in the pitcher's spot.\n\nAguilar worked a full count from Holland before sending an 86-mph slider 449 feet out to straightaway center field to make it 5-3. It was the 12th homer of the season for Aguilar.\n\nThe Brewers weren't finished, however. Eric Thames followed by walking, then he stole second and came around to score a big insurance run on a Neil Walker single.\n\nCorey Knebel delivered his 25th save with a scoreless ninth.\n\nRookie starter Brandon Woodruff was given a 3-0 lead with which to work in the third, and it was he who started the inning off with his first major-league hit - a single to center.\n\nBOX SCORE: Brewers 6, Rockies 3\n\nRELATED: Lots of changes for ex-Brewers catcher Lucroy\n\nMLB: Live scoreboard, box scores, standings, schedules\n\nThames, up next, lined a perfectly placed shot to the gap in right-center that split centerfielder Charlie Blackmon and rightfielder Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez and rolled to the wall.

That made it 3-1.\n\nWoodruff buckled down at that point and struck out Trevor Story and Bettis to keep the Rockies from building any more momentum.\n\nIt wound up being a two-out walk to Nolan Arenado in the fifth that ended Woodruff's night at just 81 pitches. With Parra due up, manager Craig Counsell went to left-hander Josh Hader, and he ultimately needed only two pitches to get Parra to foul out to end the fifth.\n\nIn 4 2/3 innings, Woodruff allowed five hits and three walks while striking out four. The right-hander threw a total of 81 pitches.\n\nHAUDRICOURT: Pina solidifies Brewers' catching spot after Lucroy trade\n\nRELATED: This week in MLB\n\nRELATED: This week's MLB power rankings\n\nMilwaukee's bats went silent after the three-run third, managing only a pair of singles from the fourth through the seventh against Bettis.\n\nHader, meanwhile, got a 1-6-3 double-play grounder from Lucroy - the second twin killing he'd grounded into - to close the sixth but quickly ran into trouble in the seventh when Trevor Story led off with a double to left.\n\nA strikeout got Hader back on track briefly, only to see Blackmon inside-out a single to left field to score Story and cut the lead to 3-2. That brought on Jacob Barnes, who was greeted by a game-tying single by D.J. LeMahieu.\n\nNolan Arenado followed with another single before Barnes buckled down to strike out Parra and get a third ex-Brewer, Mark Reynolds to fly out to left.\n\nAll-star Pat Neshek and Anthony Swarzak (2-0) then traded scoreless eighth innings.\n\nBEHIND THE BOX SCORE\n\n\" With Domingo Santana and Broxton each hitting their 20th homer of the season Friday, the Brewers now have four players with at least 20 for the first time since 2012 when Braun (41), Corey Hart (30), Aramis Ramirez (27) and Rickie Weeks (21) accomplished the feat.\n\nSantana and Broxton are tied for third on the team behind Thames and Shaw, who have 27 apiece. The 20 homers for Broxton are especially noteworthy considering the extreme peaks and valleys he's experienced this season, culminating in his seven-game demotion to Class AAA Colorado Springs late last month.\n\n\"It's very satisfying,\" said Broxton, who'd hit four homers in three games coming into Saturday. \"If you would have asked me in April if I thought I was going to have 20 home runs, I probably would have said, 'No way.'\n\n\"But that's the nature of the game. You keep battling and grind it out, and sometimes you come out on top.\"\n\nThe Brewers have had five players hit 20 or more homers five times in franchise history, most recently in 2010. They currently have eight players with double-digit homers, tying a franchise record.\n\nSTAT SHEET\n\n\" With a combined 3 2/3 scoreless innings of work from Jeremy Jeffress and Carlos Torres on Friday, the Brewers' bullpen dropped its collective ERA to 0.61 over its previous eight games. It had also held opponents to a .158 average.\n\n\" Through his first four games with the Brewers, Neil Walker was hitting .467 with a homer and three RBI. He headed into Saturday on a six-game hitting streak overall, putting together a .542 average with two homers and five RBI in that span.\n\nTAKEAWAY\n\nThese were the kinds of games the Brewers weren't able to pull out during their post all-star break slump. Aguilar delivered a huge at-bat when it was needed, Walker padded the lead and Milwaukee tied the series as a result.\n\nRECORD\n\nThis year: 64-60 (34-30 home; 29-30 away)\n\nLast year: 54-70\n\nNEXT GAME\n\nSunday: Brewers at Rockies, 2:10 p.m. Milwaukee RHP Chase Anderson (6-2, 2.89) vs. Colorado LHP Kyle Freeland (11-7, 3.74) TV: FS Wisconsin.

The Brewers are now two games back.\n\nColorado jumped out to a quick 1-0 lead when Charlie Blackmon lifted Garza's fourth pitch out to left, but Milwaukee got the run back in the second on a Domingo Santana homer to right-center off German M\u00e1rquez.\n\nEric Thames led off the third with a standup triple and Neil Walker singled him in one pitch later to put the Brewers in front for the first time, 2-1. But it didn't last long, as the Rockies jumped right back on Garza in the bottom half.\n\nThe trouble started when Marquez blooped a one-out hit to left-center then stretched it into a hustle double. Blackmon singled and Nolan Arenado followed by lifting a long fly ball to right field that caromed off the wall.\n\nBOX SCORE: Rockies 8, Brewers 4\n\nRELATED: Brewers nearing full strength at critical time\n\nMLB: Live scoreboard, box scores, standings, schedules\n\nSantana got into position to make the play but leaped too early, and both runners scored as a result. Arenado wound up with a triple, and one batter later former Parra singled off Orlando Arcia's glove to drive him in and make it a 4-2 game.\n\nThere was a strange moment in the fourth when, with two outs and Arcia at the plate, a review was called for because home-plate umpire Jim Wolf lost track of the count. After a delay of 1 minute 5 seconds, it was determined Arcia had drawn a walk and he was sent to first base.\n\nGarza followed up by striking out.\n\nThe Rockies added onto their lead in the bottom of the fourth, with some questionable Brewers defense helping them. Gonz\u00e1lez started with a single to right that Santana failed to charge in on and ex-Brewer Jonathan Lucroy walked, with Trevor Story next sending a hot shot to third.\n\nLike Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Sports on Facebook for the latest Wisconsin sports updates right in your news feed.Visit JS Sports on FacebookLike Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Sports on Facebook for the latest Wisconsin sports updates right in your news feed.Visit on Facebook\n\nShaw gloved it, but in attempting to throw from his knees to second base instead wound up firing the ball into right field as the deficit grew to 5-2. Garza eventually got his second ground-ball out of the night with the bases loaded to limit the damage to the one run.\n\nParra homered with one out in the fifth. Then after another ex-Brewer, Mark Reynolds, reached on a strikeout-wild pitch, Gonz\u00e1lez lifted a two-run homer just over the wall in left field to up Colorado's lead to 8-2 and end Garza's night.\n\nThe final line on Garza was ugly: 4 1/3 innings, nine hits, eight runs (seven earned) and two walks with a pair of strikeouts. It was also the second blowup outing in the last three for the right-hander, who fell to 6-7 while his ERA rose to 4.81.\n\nKeon Broxton and Arcia went deep in consecutive at-bats to chase Marquez in the sixth, but that wound up capping the scoring for Milwaukee.\n\nBEHIND THE BOX SCORE\n\n\" Corey Knebel tied the club record for strikeouts by a reliever with 98 with one in his previous outing on Wednesday. Julio Machado set the record of 98 in 1991 but needed 88 2/3 innings compared to Knebel's 57 1/3.\n\nKnebel, who earned his first career all-star nod last month, has registered a strikeout in 56 of his 57 appearances this season.\n\n\"It's exciting,\" Knebel said. \"A club record is great. I'm pumped.\"\n\n\" To be able to reinstate catcher Stephen Vogt from the disabled list on Friday, the Brewers placed catcher Andrew Susac on the DL with a right trapezius strain. He was on the DL with the same injury from March 31-April 15.\n\n\"Took a funky swing in the cage the other day and it kind of locked up on me,\" he said. \"We'd been treating it the last couple days and it's still kind of locked up.\n\n\"Definitely not to the extent it was in spring training, but enough to make it uncomfortable.\"\n\nSTAT SHEET\n\n\" Both Santana and Broxton joined the 20-homer club, giving the Brewers four with 20 or more. Thames leads the team with 27, while Shaw is one behind at 26.\n\n\" Milwaukee relievers entered Friday having posted a 0.70 ERA in their last seven games while limiting opponents to a .174 batting average.\n\nTAKEAWAY\n\nKeeping in mind the defense behind him wasn't the strongest, Garza's outing was still disappointing.

The injury occurred just as Vogt, a two-time All-Star for the A's acquired off waivers, was bringing some left-handed pop to the bottom half of the Brewers' batting order.\n\nVogt hit four home runs in 28 Brewers at-bats before suffering a left knee injury in a home-plate collision on July 17 at Pittsburgh. The injury forced his first career trip to the Major League DL.\n\n\"I'm ready to go. I feel like it's Christmas morning to me,\" Vogt said Friday.\n\nVogt will resume a timeshare with regular catcher Manny Pina. To make room for Vogt on the roster, the Brewers placed their other catcher, Andrew Susac, on the 10-day DL with a right trapezius strain, the same injury that knocked him out of the team's catching competition in Spring Training.\n\nVogt was active just in time for the start of the Brewers' important trip.\n\n\"Getting Chase back this weekend is going to be a big boost, as well,\" Vogt said. \"We're playing well, guys did a great job this past weekend at home and I'm excited to be joining it now. Every game's crucial from here on out, and especially on this road trip.\"\n\nSeeing red\n\nYes, there is a story behind the red batting gloves Brewers third baseman Travis Shaw has sported over the past week.\n\n\"It started off as a joke to make somebody mad,\" said Shaw with a smile.\n\nThat somebody was Brewers equipment manager Jason Shawger, a stickler for detail, who had fought off Shaw's attempts to wear the gloves from Shaw's Red Sox days after he homered in them on July 4. On that day, with the Brewers in red, white and blue uniforms, they matched. Once the team returned to wearing its usual blues, they clashed.\n\nBut when the Brewers wore black and white throwback uniforms for a Negro Leagues tribute on Saturday, Shaw saw an opportunity. So he wore them again, and homered again.\n\nAfter that, clashing color or not, the baseball gods had spoken. When he went deep in them again on Wednesday against the Pirates and cleared a gauntlet of high-fiving teammates, Shaw went straight for the television camera at the end of the dugout and held up the gloves.\n\nThat was for Shawger.\n\n\"They're doing well, so I don't care [if they clash].

At the time, there was much gnashing of teeth among Milwaukee fans who didn't want to part with Lucroy, and figured the team's catching would go to hell afterward.\n\nThe void grew larger after the season when Martin Maldonado, the longtime backup to Lucroy, was traded to the Los Angeles Angels for Jett Bandy in a swap of catchers. Just like that, the Brewers went from having perhaps the most stable 1-2 catching combination in the majors to one completely unsettled.\n\nRELATED:This week in MLB\n\nRELATED:This week's MLB power rankings\n\nBut, with no offense whatsoever to Lucroy, who was a two-time all-star with the Brewers and a stand-up player in every way, do you hear anyone complaining these days that the Brewers traded him?\n\nThe answer is no.\n\nRather than becoming a weakness in the aftermath of the trades of Lucroy and Maldonado, catching has been an area of stability for the Brewers. And that's despite injuries that landed Bandy and Stephen Vogt - a key in-season acquisition - on the disabled list.\n\nMuch of the credit goes to Manny Pi\u00f1a, an unheralded journeyman who finally got the chance to prove he could play in the majors and didn't let it slip away. When Pi\u00f1a was acquired in December 2015 as the player to be named later from Detroit in the Frankie Rodriguez trade, nobody thought much of it. He had played Class AAA ball for more than three years, and Class AA ball for five seasons before that.\n\nThe Brewers sent Pi\u00f1a to Class AAA Colorado Springs last year, and he prospered as hitters often do there, batting .329 in 63 games with five homers, 43 RBI and .877 OPS. The day Lucroy was traded, the Brewers called up Pi\u00f1a and had him share time afterward with Maldonado. He held his own, batting .254 in 33 games with two homers, 12 RBI and .346 OBP.\n\nThat same day, catcher Andrew Susac was acquired from San Francisco in the Will Smith trade. General manager David Stearns and manager Craig Counsell agreed that Pi\u00f1a, Bandy and Susac would compete in spring training for the two catching spots on the big-league roster, and some wondered if they were rolling the dice in a big way.\n\nWhen Susac suffered a shoulder/neck issue in camp and opened on the DL (he is back on the DL with the same issue), the two spots went to Pi\u00f1a and Bandy. They each broke out of the gate swinging hot bats, and the catching platoon became the least of the rebuilding Brewers' problems.\n\nBandy eventually fell into a deep slump, prompting the Brewers to send him down and claim the 32-year-old Vogt off waivers from Oakland on June 25. A two-time all-star, Vogt was having a down year with the Athletics, who were looking to get younger, but the Brewers thought he'd be a nice fit on their relatively inexperienced roster.\n\nBefore getting the worst of a home-plate collision in Pittsburgh in late July and suffering a sprained knee, Vogt made an impact with the Brewers, compiling a .991 OPS with four home runs in 12 games. Bandy was recalled when Vogt went on the DL, and when Bandy was hit by a pitch that cracked a rib, Susac got the call from Colorado Springs. This weekend, Vogt returned to the active roster.\n\nThe one constant through all that shuffling has been Pi\u00f1a, who is having a solid year at the plate as well as behind it. Entering Saturday, the 30-year-old Venezuelan was batting .287 with nine home runs, 39 RBI, .330 OBP and .782 OPS.\n\nPi\u00f1a also has been a force in terms of run prevention, thanks to a strong throwing arm that makes it a risk to run on him or stray too far off base. He leads all major-league catchers with six pickoffs, including four at second base, and has nabbed 14 of 46 runners (30.4%) attempting steals.\n\nPi\u00f1a's 1.7 defensive WAR (wins above replacement) ranks second in the NL behind Cincinnati's Tucker Barnhart (2.0) and ahead of perennial gold glove winner Yadier Molina (1.2) of St. Louis. His overall WAR of 2.6 ranks fourth among NL catchers.\n\n\"Offensively, he has been a very consistent player for us,\" Counsell said. \"Defensively, he has thrown out runners at a good rate; he has picked off some guys.\n\n\"The other part of his game is knowing the league and helping the pitchers has really improved as the season went on. That's because he has worked at it, and I give him credit for it.\"\n\nIn Vogt's absence, Counsell played Pi\u00f1a more to take advantage of his production on both sides of the ball. His offense has suffered some (.696 OPS in August) but he still delivers big hits, including the decisive two-run homer in the 7-6 comeback victory over Pittsburgh on Thursday.\n\n\"This is his first (full) year in the big leagues,\" Counsell said. \"He has been asked to do a lot. With some injuries behind the plate, he's carried the load the last couple of weeks. In a role in which he has split time, he has continued to have a big impact.\"\n\nPina is a favorite in the clubhouse because of his easy-going personality and determination. His teammates know how hard he worked to finally make his first big-league roster out of spring camp and how diligent he is in preparing for every game.\n\nAccordingly, it has been a long time since anyone associated with the Brewers has thought much about Lucroy. He mostly spun his wheels with Texas, failed to get the contract extension he wanted and recently was traded to Colorado, where being in a playoff race is bringing out his best (.964 OPS in his first 13 games).\n\nI'm guessing some Brewers fans didn't realize Lucroy was with the Rockies until they saw him on the television broadcasts this weekend. But those who thought the Brewers' catching would be a major issue in his absence were wrong.\n\nManny Pi\u00f1a deserves a lot of credit for that out-of-sight, out-of-mind development.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T16:19:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 373, "textStart": 367, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-01", "amb": false},

Even his long home run to center field was not enough to soothe the trouble.\n\n\"I was just trying to hit the ball hard and I got one out,\" said Arenado, the Rockies' all-star third baseman. \"But the rest of my at-bats weren't very good. Not a very good day.\"\n\nHe is not alone. In the first half of August, the Rockies struggled through one of their worst hitting stretches this season. They were trending for the slightest-hitting month this year, on pace for fewer runs, RBIs and home runs.\n\nIn their past eight games before Wednesday, the Rockies averaged just 2.7 runs per game, and never scored more than three in winning just twice.\n\n\"We're definitely not putting up the run support we're capable of,\" shortstop Trevor Story said. \"They're really close games. They've been well-pitched games, on both sides. We just haven't been doing enough lately.\"\n\nStory and Mark Reynolds joined Arenado by also hitting solo home runs. But the team scored just those three runs in a 4-3 loss to the Braves. The club is hitting .263 in August, with a .343 on-base percentage, the worst monthly numbers since April. But their 180 total bases are on pace for their worst mark this season.\n\n\"It's a little weird,\" Story said. \"We'd like to have guys on base when we hit those home runs. Our pitchers have been keeping the games close. We need to help them out better.\"\n\nManager Bud Black has noticed. The pitching staff has allowed just 3.5 runs per game this month through Tuesday, with their highest strikeout-to-walk ratio this season (2.54 Ks per walk) and their lowest ERA (4.01) since May.\n\n\"We haven't bunched hits together,\" Black said. \"Some guys are getting hits but they're not coming in the same inning. To score runs, you have to get two or three hits in a inning. And we're getting a hit here and a hit there. We're just not getting the one big hit when we have some baserunners. Those guys who are getting hits aren't doing it at the same time. We're spreading it out.\"\n\nFootnotes. In their past 18 games, before Wednesday, the Rockies went 8-10, and 15 games were decided by three runs or fewer, including the past 11 through Tuesday. ... Arenado's 66 extra-base hits ranked second in baseball, one spot higher than Charlie Blackmon's 65. They are racing Miami's Giancarlo Stanton, who has 69. Teammates ranked 1-2 in extra-base hits in only three other seasons, according to Elias: Tony Armas and Dwight Evans for the Red Sox in 1985, and Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig for the Yankees in 1926 and '27.\n\nBraves RHP Lucas Sims (0-3, 5.25 ERA) at Rockies RHP Jeff Hoffman (6-4, 5.15), Thursday 1:10 p.m., no TV, 850-AM\n\nHoffman, in his first start against the Braves, will not face the towering threat he did in his previous start.

Aguilar hit his 12th homer, and Milwaukee added another run as Eric Thames walked, stole second and Neil Walker's RBI single chased Holland.\n\nTravis Shaw also homered for the Brewers.\n\nDJ LeMahieu got three hits and Trevor Story had two doubles for Colorado. The Rockies remained a game ahead of Arizona for the NL's first wild card and 4 1-2 up on Milwaukee.\n\nAnthony Swarzak (2-0) tossed one inning and Corey Knebel got the last three outs for his 25th save.\n\nThe Rockies lost for the first time in 12 home games that Chad Bettis has started. Bettis, who pitched seven scoreless innings Monday in his first start since undergoing cancer treatment, went seven innings again and gave up three runs -- all in the third.\n\nMilwaukee starter Brad Woodruff got his first career hit to lead off and came around on Thames' triple. Thames scored on Ryan Braun's sacrifice fly and Shaw homered into the Colorado bullpen to make it 3-0.\n\nThe Rockies got one back on Jonathan Lucroy's RBI single in the fourth, and then tied it in the seventh off Milwaukee's bullpen. Charlie Blackmon had an RBI single, stole second and scored on LeMahieu's single.\n\nWoodruff retired the first two batters in the fifth but was pulled after walking Nolan Arenado. Josh Hader got Gerardo Parra to pop out to end the inning.\n\nTWO TIMES\n\nLeMahieu helped Bettis to a clean inning in the fifth with his Gold Glove defense at second base. First, he ranged up the middle to field Braun's grounder, and then threw across his body to get him by half a step. Shaw then lofted a soft liner into right and LeMahieu made a running, leaping catch to end the inning.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBrewers: RHP Chase Anderson (6-2, 2.89) is expected to be activated from the 10-day disabled list to make his 17th start. Anderson has been out since suffering an oblique strain June 28.\n\nRockies: LHP Kyle Freeland (11-7, 3.74) returned from the DL (left groin strain) and tossed six innings in a no-decision against

The Rockies exploded to defeat the Atlanta Braves by a final score of 17-2 in the third game of a four-game set.\n\nEntering the ballgame, the Rockies' offense was struggling, having scored no more than three runs in each of their previous eight games. It was an unfamiliar place, as they currently rank second in the National League in runs scored this season.\n\nWednesday the Rockies returned to form, compiling 18 hits on the night with every starting position player, with the exception of Carlos Gonzalez, recording at least one. From top to bottom the Rockies lineup was a machine, but Trevor Story, Gerardo Parra and Mark Reynolds did most of the heavy lifting, accounting for 14 of the Rockies 17 RBIs between them. Story had two home runs; Reynolds also homered.\n\nThat production from the trio was just the second time in Rockies history that at least three players have recorded four RBIs, per Rockies PR.The last time it happened was back on August 11, 1998, vs. the Montreal Expos.\n\nRockies starter Jon Gray (5-2, 4.74 ERA) was sharp for a majority of the night as Wednesday's outing marked his 50th career start at the Major League level. Gray was perfect through his first three innings, eventually surrendering just two runs in the sixth inning to earn the win. It was one of Gray's more complete performances this year, with his final line sitting at 6.0 IP, 5 H, 2 ER, 2 BB, 6 SO.\n\nColorado will wrap up their series with Atlanta tomorrow afternoon.

The left-handed outfielders both homered to the opposite field against Garza in the early innings, with Gonzalez's home run knocking Garza out of the game in the fifth.\n\nThe Rockies have a one-game lead over the D-backs, who lost to the Twins on Friday, for the top NL Wild Card spot. The Brewers fell to two games behind the Cubs -- and to third place -- in the NL Central race, as the Cubs defeated the Blue Jays.\n\nThe long ball plagued each side, as Garza and Rockies starter German Marquez combined to give up six home runs. Blackmon homered leading off for the 28th time in his career, leading the franchise. It was his 29th homer of the season.\n\nMOMENTS THAT MATTERED\n\nGotta hand it to him: Nolan Arenado has been hit on his left hand twice this week -- first by a Vance Worley fastball Sunday in Miami and then on a short-hop grounder Thursday against the Braves. But Arenado hasn't missed a start and his bat hasn't suffered. Each of Arenado's hits since he first got injured has gone for extra bases, including a two-run triple over Domingo Santana's head to give the Rockies a 3-2 lead in the third. Later, he hit a foul ball 448 feet, per Statcast\u2122, which would have been his eighth-deepest home run since Statcast\u2122 was introduced.\n\nOff his Marq: Keon Broxton and Orlando Arcia did most of the Brewers' home run damage, cranking back-to-back shots in the sixth. The home runs knocked Marquez out of the game and cut the Rockies' lead to 8-4. Broxton's homer was his 20th and Arcia's was his 12th, both increasing their career highs.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T04:30:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373507", "time": "04:30:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373507", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "302624", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "305021", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 5}, {"id": "305796", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "score": 3}, {"id": "307686", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Triple (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "310507", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "score": 4}, {"id": "310538", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "score": 4}, {"id": "310548", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "score": 2}, {"id": "310551", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "score": 2}, {"id": "310901", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "score": 2}, {"id": "334746", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "score": 3}, {"id": "339168", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "score": 3}, {"id": "341692", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Extra base hit"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_base_hit", "score": 2}, {"id": "354188", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Nolan Arenado"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Arenado", "score": 2}, {"id": "354195", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Adrian Gonzalez"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Gonzalez", "score": 3}, {"id": "384243", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Foul ball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foul_ball", "score": 2}, {"id": "386938", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Blackmon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Blackmon", "score": 4}, {"id": "393823", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Domingo Santana"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domingo_Santana", "score": 2}, {"id": "407866", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of National League Wild Card winners"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_National_League_Wild_Card_winners", "score": 3}, {"id": "424636", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Glossary of baseball (E)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_(E)", "score": 3}, {"id": "553210", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Vance Worley"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vance_Worley", "score": 2}, {"id": "1320671", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Orlando Arcia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Arcia", "score": 1}], "image": "http://m.mlb.com/assets/images/8/3/4/249313834/cuts/1280x720/cut.jpg", "timeCrawl": "04:30:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Three homers carry Rockies over Brewers", "originalArticle": null}

Nolan Arenado, Mark Reynolds and Trevor Story homered, but a big inning was again missing.\n\nThe downturn is not totally painful. The Rockies remain tied with the D-backs at the top of the National League Wild Card standings, five games ahead of the Cardinals and Brewers.\n\n\"We just haven't bunched hits together,\" manager Bud Black said. \"Some guys are getting hits, but they're not coming in the same inning. To score runs, you've got to get two or three hits an inning. We have a hit here, hit there; walk here, hit there.\n\n\"We're just not getting the one big hit in the inning or two when we've had some baserunners.\"\n\nThe Rockies opened a seven-game homestand on Monday, after a 1-4 road trip during which they went 5-for-39 with runners in scoring position. Being back at Coors Field, conventional wisdom had it, would bring back offensive production.\n\nOn Monday, they went 2-for-10 with runners in scoring position. Both hits, Gerardo Parra's RBI single and Carlos Gonzalez's two-run single, came in the eighth inning of a 3-0 victory remembered most for starting pitcher Chad Bettis' inspiring seven innings in his first game this season after a bout with testicular cancer.\n\nThe best that could be said about Tuesday was that hitting with runners in scoring position wasn't as big of a problem, mainly because they were just 0-for-3. In the fifth, Arenado popped out with runners at first and third and one out. It was a result reminiscent of the road trip.\n\n\"Men on first and second, we're not getting them over, or man on third, we're not getting him in,\" Arenado said. \"Like today, I had a man on third, and I popped up. It's unacceptable. In these kinds of games, you need runs, and we haven't been doing that.\"\n\nWith the bases loaded and two outs in the fifth, Parra drove a Sean Newcomb pitch the opposite way to left field, only for Danny Santana to track it down.\n\n\"We're going to go through that; we hit some balls hard,\" second baseman DJ LeMahieu said. \"'G.P.' hit that ball down the line with the bases loaded. You can't really ask much more than putting that ball down the line in that situation. It just doesn't seem like we've had any luck when we have opportunities.\n\n\"Offenses go through that here and there. It's not an excuse, but at the same time we're doing everything we can.\"\n\nThe Rockies showed signs during their last homestand, when they went 4-2 against the Mets and Phillies. Catcher Jonathan Lucroy, who arrived in a trade with the Rangers on July 30, hopes to see the offense he knows the Rockies can produce. He watched starter Kyle Freeland, after missing a start with a left groin injury, give up three runs in six innings and not be rewarded.\n\n\"You give up three runs, it's good enough for me with this offense in this park,\" Lucroy said. \"We've got to get better, myself included.\n\n\"To me, all it means is we're going to break out soon. Guys are grinding out at-bats here and there, and we're just not getting that big knock when we need it.

(Justin Edmonds / Getty Images)\n\nNolan Arenado found plenty to displease him in Tuesday night's loss to the Atlanta Braves. Even his long home run to center field was not enough to soothe the trouble.\n\n\"I was just trying to hit the ball hard, and I got one out,\" said Arenado, the Rockies' all-star third baseman. \"But the rest of my at-bats weren't very good. Not a very good day.\"\n\nHe is not alone. In the first half of August, the Rockies struggled through one of their worst hitting stretches this season. They were trending for their slightest-hitting month this year, on pace for fewest runs, RBIs and home runs.\n\nIn their past eight games before Wednesday, the Rockies averaged just 2.7 runs per game and never scored more than three in winning just twice.\n\n\"We're definitely not putting up the run support we're capable of,\" shortstop Trevor Story said. \"They're really close games. They've been well-pitched games, on both sides. We just haven't been doing enough lately.\"\n\nStory and Mark Reynolds joined Arenado by also hitting solo home runs. But the team scored just those three runs in a 4-3 loss to the Braves. The club is hitting .263 in August, with a .343 on-base percentage, the worst monthly numbers since April. But their 180 total bases are on pace for their worst mark this season.\n\n\"It's a little weird,\" Story said. \"We'd like to have guys on base when we hit those home runs. Our pitchers have been keeping the games close. We need to help them out better.\"\n\nManager Bud Black has noticed. The pitching staff has allowed just 3.5 runs per game this month through Tuesday, with their highest strikeout-to-walk ratio this season (2.54 Ks per walk) and their lowest ERA (4.01) since May.\n\n\"We haven't bunched hits together,\" Black said. \"Some guys are getting hits but they're not coming in the same inning. To score runs, you have to get two or three hits in a inning. And we're getting a hit here and a hit there. We're just not getting the one big hit when we have some baserunners. Those guys who are getting hits aren't doing it at the same time.

But the throbbing, not to mention the bad luck that leads to the same spot being hit twice, wasn't going to stop him. A Rockies offense that has had three decent games, after going eight games without scoring more than three runs, needed him.\n\n\"I just want to play,\" Arenado said. \"If we were in the Dodgers' position, I probably would take a couple days, you know? But we don't have that luxury. These are big games. Milwaukee's only 5 1/2 back now that we won. I want to play every day, and I want to help this team out any way I can.\n\n\"I believe, for instance, me being in the lineup, it helps [DJ LeMahieu], or whatever. There's little things to the game that people don't understand. I know that I can do that. I'm hurting, but it's not the worst thing I've ever been through.\"\n\nSince the first time his wrist was injured, Arenado has missed just one start, and he entered as a reserve in that game. He also has had three doubles, a homer and a triple, all while hurting. Not only that, but he nearly had another homer Friday on a towering 448-foot drive to left that curved just foul.\n\nSometimes you have to deal with some hurt to help an offense that had been hurting.\n\n\"We had a good night a couple nights ago and scored a bunch of runs [in a 17-2 win over the Braves]; yesterday we were held down,\" Rockies manager Bud Black said. \"Time will tell.\"\n\nPut pounding opponents at home has always been a part of the successful Rockies seasons. If they can have nights like Friday more often than not, they can make up for downturns that often occur on the road. They have 20 games at home (where they are 38-23) and 20 on the road (30-31) the rest of the regular year.\n\n\"Tonight was special,\" Gonzalez said. \"The fans showed up. Normally, when we have a weekend at home we have a lot of fans. They understand that this is a big series for us. We know that this is a big series. We're really happy we started the series the right way.\"\n\nBlackmon, who hit his 28th career first-inning leadoff homer, said, \"When you're talking about the postseason, the margin for getting in and not getting in is very small.\"\n\nIt's a pain Arenado and the Rockies don't want to experience.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T06:08:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373507", "time": "06:08:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373507", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "182034", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "225137", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302624", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)", "score": 5}, {"id": "303711", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "score": 4}, {"id": "303798", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain", "score": 4}, {"id": "304985", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "score": 3}, {"id": "305021", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "score": 5}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 3}, {"id": "307683", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "307686", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Triple (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_(baseball)", "score": 4}, {"id": "310507", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "score": 5}, {"id": "310551", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "score": 3}, {"id": "310901", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "score": 3}, {"id": "314182", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "339036", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "score": 3}, {"id": "354190", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Carlos Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Gonz\u00e1lez_(baseball)", "score": 3}, {"id": "386938", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Charlie Blackmon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Blackmon", "score": 3}, {"id": "386945", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Gerardo Parra"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerardo_Parra", "score": 3}, {"id": "407866", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "List of National League Wild Card winners"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_National_League_Wild_Card_winners", "score": 3}, {"id": "742618", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bud Black"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Black", "score": 2}], "image": "http://m.mlb.com/assets/images/9/5/0/249368950/cuts/1280x720/cut.jpg", "timeCrawl": "06:08:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Rockies' Nolan Arenado lifts offense", "originalArticle": null}

Obviously, the Rockies' offense has to continue producing and players like Mark Reynolds and Nolan Arenado must keep ripping RBI hits.\n\nIt's been proven over and over again, postseason success centers around solid, if not great starting pitching.\n\nOne of the big keys for the Rockies will be getting quality starts in the playoffs, and that's where Bettis enters the picture. The right-hander will continue to serve as an inspiration after returning from testicular cancer. But he's also a legit starter who will have to pitch well through the end of the season and into the playoffs if the Rockies hope to be successful.\n\nJon Gray has become the bona fide ace of the Rockies' staff. The key now is to get quality starts from the rest of the staff.\n\nOnce the playoffs arrive, pitching strategy changes, and the Rockies will only need 2 or 3 quality starters instead of 4 or 5.\n\nBettis needs to be that second or third quality starter on the staff.\n\nGray is now a proven ace, but in the playoffs, they need consistency from another couple of starters to eat up innings and limit runs.\n\nPlayoffs are about mental toughness and execution, especially on the mound.\n\nBettis' return to the lineup is an amazing story. He now needs to be that guy who performs well into the playoffs. He will also be a great motivation for the team, and an inspiration to his teammates and Rockies' fans.\n\nI'm going to cheat this a little bit and pick two players, both important for the same reason. Trevor Story and Carlos Gonzalez have struggled mightily this season, and any potential playoff run has to include them.\n\nGonzalez has been one of Colorado's stars for many years, but it's hard to overstate how badly he's played. He's hitting a career-worst .236 and his power is nonexistent, with a slugging percentage of .350. Chris Rusin is slugging better than Gonzalez, as was Kyle Freeland for most of the season. CarGo has seven home runs. Seven. Home. Runs. It's an insane drop in production for a man who hit 40 home runs only two seasons ago.\n\nAdvanced stats paint an even worse picture of CarGo's season. His wins above replacement (WAR) is -1.7, meaning a standard, Triple-A-caliber outfielder will contribute almost two more wins than Gonzalez has this season. His isolated power rating (batting average subtracted from slugging percentage) of .114 is worse than Jon Gray's production.\n\nThe same can be said for Story, whose long-standing flaws are becoming more and more apparent. He's struck out roughly 36 percent of the time, by far the highest rate of any regular contributor on the roster. In fact, only two other qualifying players in Major League Baseball strike out at a higher rate -- Baltimore's Chris Davis and Texas' Joey Gallo.\n\nThe good news is that both CarGo and Story have been working back from their miserable starts, at least for a short stretch. Story hit two home runs in a game against Atlanta this week and has five hits in the past four games.\n\nFor Gonzalez, his standard numbers and metrics are picking up. He has a 35.9 percent hard contact rate over the past two weeks, a nearly seven percent jump that's more in line with his career norms. He's hitting .283 in August, by far his best month of the season.\n\nIf both players can continue improving, they could very well be the team's biggest contributors heading into the playoffs.\n\nJonathan Lucroy needs to be the man. The Rockies traded for the catcher to provide its young pitching staff with a veteran game-caller and a good defensive catcher. Since arriving in Denver, Lucroy has played in 11 of Colorado's 15 games. Two of the games he missed, he was sick with flu-like symptoms.\n\nLucroy's ability to call games will be his most important attribute. With several rookie starters, the Rockies need Lucroy give his pitchers the best chance to win games.\n\nGood pitching will always trump good hitting and if Lucroy can make the Rockies' rookies into good pitchers, Colorado has a good chance to make the playoffs.\n\nAs Lucroy learns each pitchers' strengths and weaknesses, the Rockies will be that much better on the mound.\n\nThe 31-year-old catcher isn't just important for what he can do behind the plate, but also at the plate. Since his insertion into the starting lineup on Aug. 3, Lucroy has gone 10 for 30 with four runs, four doubles, two runs, seven walks and four strikeouts.\n\nLucroy is a proven hitter with a career batting average of .280. Lucroy led the National League in doubles in 2014, with 53, so his bat has a chance to heat up and help the Rockies.\n\nIf Lucroy can continue to swing the bat well and can call a good game behind the plate, Colorado has a chance to make the playoffs as a wild-card team.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T05:46:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 4284, "textStart": 4278, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-03",

The victory helped the Brewers stay two games behind the first-place Cubs while also leapfrogging the Cardinals into second place.\n\nThe Rockies, meanwhile, stayed a game in front of the D-backs for the top Wild Card spot in the NL after Arizona fell to the Twins.\n\nRockies starter Chad Bettis pitched well in his second start following his recovery from testicular cancer. Bettis navigated through seven innings, giving up three runs on 92 pitches. Brewers rookie Brandon Woodruff only gave up one run in 4 2/3 innings before manager Craig Counsell went to his bullpen with a 3-1 lead.\n\nMOMENTS THAT MATTERED\n\nGonna roll it: Bettis only suffered from one poor inning, giving up three runs in the third. After Woodruff led off with a single for his first Major League hit, Eric Thames hit a bouncing line drive to the left of Blackmon. The ball bounced under center fielder Charlie Blackmon's glove as he tried to cut it off and it rolled to the wall for an RBI triple. The inning snowballed from there, with Ryan Braun driving in Thames on a sacrifice fly and Travis Shaw cranking a solo home run to give the Brewers a 3-0 lead.\n\nGonna steal it: Blackmon proved pivotal in the Rockies' tying, two-run rally against Brewers relievers Josh Hader and Jacob Barnes in the seventh. After driving in Trevor Story with a one-out RBI single off Hader, Blackmon stole second, putting himself in scoring position for DJ LeMahieu against Barnes. A couple pitches later, LeMahieu singled him home to knot the game at 3-3.

Aguilar hit his 12th homer, and Milwaukee added another run as Eric Thames walked, stole second and Neil Walker's RBI single chased Holland.\n\nTravis Shaw also homered for the Brewers.\n\nDJ LeMahieu got three hits and Trevor Story had two doubles for Colorado. The Rockies remained a game ahead of Arizona for the NL's first wild card and 4 1-2 up on Milwaukee.\n\nAnthony Swarzak (2-0) tossed one inning and Corey Knebel got the last three outs for his 25th save.\n\nThe Rockies lost for the first time in 12 home games that Chad Bettis has started. Bettis, who pitched seven scoreless innings Monday in his first start since undergoing cancer treatment, went seven innings again and gave up three runs -- all in the third.\n\nMilwaukee starter Brad Woodruff got his first career hit to lead off and came around on Thames' triple. Thames scored on Ryan Braun's sacrifice fly and Shaw homered into the Colorado bullpen to make it 3-0.\n\nThe Rockies got one back on Jonathan Lucroy's RBI single in the fourth, and then tied it in the seventh off Milwaukee's bullpen. Charlie Blackmon had an RBI single, stole second and scored on LeMahieu's single.\n\nWoodruff retired the first two batters in the fifth but was pulled after walking Nolan Arenado. Josh Hader got Gerardo Parra to pop out to end the inning.\n\nTWO TIMES\n\nLeMahieu helped Bettis to a clean inning in the fifth with his Gold Glove defense at second base. First, he ranged up the middle to field Braun's grounder, and then threw across his body to get him by half a step. Shaw then lofted a soft liner into right and LeMahieu made a running, leaping catch to end the inning.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBrewers: RHP Chase Anderson (6-2, 2.89) is expected to be activated from the 10-day disabled list to make his 17th start.

I'm looking at Aug. 17.\"\n\nYep, Aug. 17, which was Thursday. The Rockies may have gone into their game against the Braves holding down the top spot in the National League Wild Card race -- a game up on the D-backs and five ahead of the Brewers, who are No. 3 in the battle for the two NL spots -- but nothing is being taken for granted.\n\nAnd if ever a reminder was needed, it was delivered in Spring Training.\n\nColorado went into the spring set on a starting lineup that was to include Ian Desmond at first base, David Dahl in left field and rookie Tom Murphy behind the plate. The club envisioned a veteran-filled rotation that had one opening with four top rookie prospects to choose from.\n\nThen potential No. 1 starter Chad Bettis was sidelined with a recurrence of testicular cancer, and he didn't even make his first appearance until Monday. Murphy suffered a broken right forearm when on a throw to second base he hit his arm on the bat of the Cubs' Anthony Rizzo. Desmond, the free-agent investment of the offseason, was hit by a pitch and broke his left hand. And Dahl suffered a stress reaction in his sixth rib.\n\nSo much for all those offseason expectations.\n\nAnd since the campaign began, Opening Day starter Jon Gray finally gave into a broken bone in his left foot that he suffered during the spring after three subpar starts in April to spend the better part of 10 weeks on the disabled list. Desmond, who had never been on the DL in his career, has been sidelined two more times since his late-April activation because of a recurring right calf strain. And lefty Tyler Anderson, who compiled the second-lowest Coors Field ERA (3.00) in 2016 for a pitcher making at least eight starts in a season, has been on the DL for all but four days since June 7 with a left knee problem that led to arthroscopic surgery on July 3.\n\nThrough it all, however, a Rockies team that not only has endured six consecutive losing seasons but finished a combined 137 games out of first place in the NL West in those six seasons, has been very much a postseason factor. Oh, they fell out of first place in the NL West in a hurry in mid-June during a 5-15 stretch that allowed the Dodgers to move into first place. The Dodgers have left scorched earth in their wake en route to amassing what was an 18 1/2-game lead entering Thursday.\n\nBut the Rox have nevertheless been in control of one of the two NL Wild Card spots ever since, despite the key absences.\n\nThose four rookie starters who were set to battle for that one open spot in the rotation in the spring -- Kyle Freeland, Antonio Senzatela, German Marquez and Jeff Hoffman -- were a combined 36-20 entering Thursday, while the Rockies were a combined 46-29 in the 75 starts they had made.\n\nMark Reynolds, who signed a Minor League contract with an invite to Spring Training, at the age of 33 is having the best year of his career. He went into Thursday hitting .280 -- 42 points above his career average -- with 25 home runs, 80 RBIs and a .368 on-base percentage, 38 points above his career mark.\n\nGerardo Parra, a disappointment after signing a three-year free-agent contract and hitting .253 with seven home runs a year ago, did spend a month on the DL, but the .346 average, nine home runs and 57 RBIs he has put together in 79 games have been a key reason why the Rockies' left-field position has been one of the more productive in the game.\n\nAnd now Bettis is back -- pitching seven shutout innings in his 2017 debut on Monday -- to provide a fresh arm for the rotation, for which he is the elder statesman at the age of 28. And while Senzatela is now working out of the bullpen, the idea is he could be part of the late-inning mix if the Rockies reach the postseason.\n\nIt is why the Rockies were willing at the non-waiver Trade Deadline to address two key needs -- a veteran catcher to help the young rotation (Jonathan Lucroy) and right-handed setup man (Pat Neshek) to share setup duties with lefty Jake McGee.\n\nIt's why the Rockies are in position for that postseason invitation. And it's why Black knows better than to try and look into the future.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T21:40:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 98, "date": "2017-08-17", "freq": 2, "textStart": 91, "amb": false, "imp": true}, {"textEnd": 1840, "textStart": 1834, "date": "-06-07", "amb": false}, {"textEnd": 1908, "textStart": 1902, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-03", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.5529412031173706, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373507", "time": "21:40:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3373507", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "229985", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "289336", "label": {"eng": "Freeland"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeland,_Oxfordshire", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Freeland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "302624", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)", "score": 4}, {"id": "302626", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Knee"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knee", "score": 2}, {"id": "303564", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "score": 2}, {"id": "303571", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "score": 3}, {"id": "303713", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "score": 2}, {"id": "304050", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "score": 3}, {"id": "304985", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "score": 3}, {"id": "304989", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Disabled list"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disabled_list", "score": 3}, {"id": "304992", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "score": 3}, {"id": "305020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Innings"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "score": 1}, {"id": "305023", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "score": 5}, {"id": "305786", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Batting average"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average", "score": 3}, {"id": "305791", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "score": 2}, {"id": "305799", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "score": 3}, {"id": "305865", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "score": 1}, {"id": "307109", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Bone fracture"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture", "score": 3}, {"id": "308555", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Arthroscopy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthroscopy", "score": 2}, {"id": "308990", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "score": 1}, {"id": "310476", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "score": 3}, {"id": "310507", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "score": 3}, {"id": "310511", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "score": 3}, {"id": "310551", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "score": 4}, {"id": "354189", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mark Reynolds (baseball)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Reynolds_(baseball)", "score": 2}, {"id": "386945", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Gerardo Parra"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerardo_Parra", "score": 2}, {"id": "390016", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jon Gray"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Gray", "score": 3}, {"id": "422011", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ian Desmond"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Desmond", "score": 3}], "image": "http://m.mlb.com/assets/images/9/1/4/249055914/cuts/1280x720/cut.jpg", "timeCrawl": "21:40:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Rockies in line for playoffs despite injuries", "originalArticle": null}

Noteworthy, is that officers from the three security forces conducted the roadblock. However, Acting Chief Police Information and Communications Officer Nosipho Mnguni made it clear that the raids in Siphofaneni were not targeted at the two mentioned politicians.\u201cPeople should not be misled to believe that the raids were only conducted on the two (LaZwide and Ngomuyayona) because other homesteads were searched as well.\u201cThere is nothing sinister about the raids because we never announce them to the public anyway,\u201d Mnguni stated briefly. The police communications officers could not comment on the concerns that the raids were conducted without search warrants, which is contrary to what was required by law.", "summary": "SIPHOFANENI &ndash; Drama unfolded yesterday morning when the country&rsquo;s law enforcers raided homes of Siphofaneni Member of Parliament (MP) Nomalungelo LaZwide Simelane and former Senate", "url": "http://www.times.co.sz/news/145831-cops%2C-warders%2C-soldiers-raid-lazwide%2C-ngoma%E2%80%99s-homes.html", "image": null, "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:02:24", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "sz", "sentiment": -0.666}

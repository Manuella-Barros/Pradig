She rode the wave of momentum all the way to the semifinals of the Australian Open, her first at the venue. She was ultimately beaten by Aryna Sabalenka in straight sets.\n\nGauff tasted her first early loss in a long time as she lost to Katerina Siniakova in the second round of the Qatar Open. She performed well in her next few tournaments, with a quarterfinal finish in Dubai, a semifinal showing at Indian Wells, and a fourth-round appearance in Miami.\n\nGauff's first tournament on clay was the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart. After a first-round bye, the American fought past Sachia Vickery in three sets to make the last eight, where Marta Kostyuk sent her packing.\n\nRus, meanwhile, began her Madrid Open campaign against Brenda Fruhvirtova. The Dutch veteran was on the backfoot at the start of the match as she trailed 4-0 and then 5-2 in the first set.\n\nHowever, Rus reeled off five straight games from that point on to claim the opener. The two went toe-to-toe for most of the second set, until the 33-year-old pulled ahead as she went on a three-game run to win the match 7-5, 6-3.\n\nCoco Gauff vs Arantxa Rus head-to-head\n\nThis will be the first meeting between the duo, so the head-to-head stands at 0-0 at the moment.\n\nRus looked down and out in the first set against Fruhvirtova but her experience eventually helped her turn the match on its head. She didn't look back after that and finished the match with 20 winners against 25 unforced errors. She also improved her yearly record to 10-10 with her latest win.\n\nGauff has generally performed well this year but quite a few of her recent matches have been a slogfest. Her level fluctuated wildly in them, with the quality of her gameplay being quite low. Nevertheless, her determination to see things through often saw her eke out a win.\n\nGauff has lost prior to the quarterfinals just twice this season. She has the opportunity to reach a new career high of No. 2 if she performs well in Madrid. However, she hasn't made it past the third round here in singles.\n\nRus has a 2-12 record against top-10 players. Her last win against a player in that region came way back in 2012 against Samantha Stosur at Wimbledon. Even if Gauff is off to a slow start, she should be able to regroup for a win given her opponent's results.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arantxa_Rus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arantxa Rus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_Qatar_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WTA Qatar Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_Auckland_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WTA Auckland Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate\u0159ina_Siniakov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kate\u0159ina Siniakov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Stuttgart_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's Stuttgart Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachia_Vickery", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sachia Vickery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Wells_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Wells Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marta_Kostyuk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marta Kostyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Stosur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samantha Stosur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/04/e4586-17139389041404-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508713", "eventUri": "eng-9508713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

As the tennis calendar advances into a packed season, Gauff remains focused on achieving greatness, beginning with the French Open on May 26, followed by Wimbledon, the Olympics and her U.S. Open title defense in August.\n\nGauff's journey is fueled by a deep-rooted desire to rise above the achievements of a single Grand Slam victory, a feat she accomplished at the U.S. Open last September.\n\n\"I always knew I wanted to try to win multiple Grand Slams,\" Gauff said, per Sean Gregory of TIME. \"Sometimes people get unmotivated after winning one. That hasn't been a personal challenge for me.\"\n\nHer determination is partly inspired by the Williams sisters, who not only dominated the sport but also provided Gauff with relatable role models in a predominantly white field.\n\n\"As a little girl, it was very important to see representation and see myself in players, especially in the field where it is predominantly white,\" Gauff said. \"I don't think I would have had the belief I could do it if it wasn't for them.\"\n\nHow Coco Gauff deals with the pressures of expectations\n\nThe pressure of her rising profile became palpable during her first major championship final in 2022 against Iga Swiatek, where Gauff shared she faced severe anxiety.\n\n\"It felt like life or death. It felt hard to breathe ... I lost that match before I stepped on the court,\" she said.\n\nThis moment, coupled with an early exit at Wimbledon, brought significant personal and professional revelations, leading to a pivotal shift in her approach to the sport. She made a deliberate effort to shift her mindset, noting, \"It is much easier to play for yourself than it is for other people.\"\n\n\"I was in a really dark place ... I put my identity too much into tennis. It was taxing to feel awful all the time ... I realized it's impossible to satisfy everyone,\" she said.\n\nShe implemented several strategic changes, such as collaborating with Brad Gilbert, who previously led Andre Agassi to six major championships and an Olympic gold medal. Additionally, she adjusted her father Corey's seating during her matches.\n\n\"My dad, he doesn't give the best reactions in the box,\" Gauff said. \"Sometimes when I lose a point, the first thing I look at is the box. And there's something more reassuring seeing somebody clapping.\" In an effort to manage this, Corey did not sit in her box at tournaments in Washington, D.C., and Cincinnati, which Gauff went on to win. During the U.S. Open, he viewed the matches from a suite or, for the final, from a TV in an empty fitness room at Arthur Ashe Stadium, where he could more freely express his emotions.\n\nAs Gauff gears up for a season filled with potential, her eyes are set not only on defending her U.S. Open title but also on adding more Grand Slam trophies to her collection.

Rus - prediction, form, head-to-head", "body": "Coco Gauff's bid for an inaugural Madrid Open crown begins on Thursday, as the American third seed pits her wits against the Netherlands' Arantxa Rus in the third round.\n\nWhile the reigning US Open champion received a bye to this stage, her Dutch foe bested wild card Brenda Fruhvirtova in her opening battle to set up a daunting clash with Gauff.\n\nMatch preview\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nEnding a personal hex will be the overriding goal for Coco Gauff on the Spanish clay, as the Madrid Open remains the only Masters tournament that she had competed in but failed to advance beyond the third round in, suffering back-to-back exits at that stage in 2022 and 2023.\n\nAfter her 2021 debut ended at the first hurdle to Karolina Pliskova, Gauff was sent packing in the third round by Simona Halep in 2022, before being denied a last-16 appearance in a straight-sets loss to Paula Badosa last year, only winning three games and suffering a second-set bagel.\n\nHowever, the American arrives back in Madrid having checked off the Grand Slam and WTA 1000 boxes on her CV, firstly clinching her maiden Masters honour at the 2023 Cincinnati Open just a few weeks before her US Open coronation in front of the buoyant home crowd.\n\nGauff has only managed to add one more top-level honour to her cabinet since - defending her title at the Auckland Open in January - since when she has progressed to the last four at Indian Wells and the Australian Open, but her latest Masters campaign in Miami ended in round four.\n\nThe 20-year-old's Stuttgart run also ended prematurely with a quarter-final loss to Marta Kostyuk - despite managing to save a staggering nine match points on the day - and a 19-6 record for 2024 so far is still nothing to be scoffed at.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nFronting up to Gauff is a player almost 14 years the American's senior in Rus, a clay-court aficionado who won her first and only WTA Tour title to date on the surface during last year's Hamburg European Open, sinking Noma Noha Akugue in straight sets in the final.\n\nSuccess in Germany spelled the end of an agonising 15-year wait for an inaugural top-level honour for the Dutchwoman since she turned professional in 2008, since when she has been a main-draw regular at Grand Slam events, her best result being a fourth-round appearance at the 2012 French Open.\n\nThe world number 47 has already recorded a couple of notable performances this year too, reaching the quarter-finals in Hobart, Rouen and Transylvania and decimating 24th seed Anhelina Kalinina in the first round of the Australian Open, losing just one game in that straight-sets success.\n\nHowever, Rus only has two Madrid Open campaigns already under her belt - which came 12 years apart in 2011 and 2023 - as she lost her opening contest to Maria Sharapova in the former year before going down to Maria Sakkari in round two last year, having battled through qualifying and a first-round clash with Amanda Anisimova.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Fruhvirtova became Rus's second Madrid victim in their opening contest on Tuesday, where the Dutchwoman remarkably fought back from 3-0 and 5-2 down in the first set and saved all four break points she faced in the second en route to a maiden meeting with Gauff.\n\nTournament so far\n\nArantxa Rus:\n\nFirst round: vs. Brenda Fruhvirtova 7-5 6-3\n\nHead To Head\n\nAs mentioned, Gauff and Rus have never crossed paths on the WTA Tour before, but despite having 13 years on her American foe, the latter has only one title to show at the top level compared to Gauff's seven; the third seed also boasts eight doubles crowns to Rus's four.\n\nWith 194 triumphs from 282 matches at the top level, Gauff's career win rate stands at 68.8%, slightly superior to that of Rus, who has prevailed in 672 of a staggering 1,081 encounters to post a percentage of 62.2%.\n\nThursday's contest will see a right-hander in Gauff come to blows with Rus's left-handed style, but the world number 47 possesses a terrific reach at 5ft 11in tall - she has two inches on the world number three.\n\nWe say: Gauff to win in two sets\n\nTwice Fruhvirtova had the chance to serve for the first set against Rus on Tuesday, and twice the Dutchwoman broke back, showcasing her tremendous experience and powers of recovery against youthful opposition.\n\nRus could therefore expect some joy on the Gauff serve, which the American recently admitted needs some work, but the third seed should overcome any slight hitches to book her spot in the second round.\n\nNo Data Analysis info\n\nID:542055:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect7153:Previews by emailClick here to get Sports Mole's daily email of previews and

Some toss medicine balls to their trainers, while others stretch with elastic bands. A few pedal lightly on upright bikes. One player throws a Frisbee.\n\nThen Coco Gauff takes the field.\n\nGauff, who in September became the first American teenager to win the U.S. Open in nearly a quarter-century, grabs a football, sends a guy downfield, and uncoils a tight, 40-yard spiral, right into the receiver's chest. Then she does it again. And again.\n\nGauff's cannon is a flex. I see your toe-tapping a soccer ball and raise you a Patrick Mahomes bomb. Gauff, who grew up in the football hotbed of South Florida, takes tremendous pride in showing off her athleticism. \"It's not really for the girls,\" Gauff tells TIME in early March, about a week before her 20th birthday. \"I don't think they care too much, especially the Europeans. They don't know much about football.\" Her throws are designed to mess with the men. \"I do like to show, especially the American guys, that I can probably throw it just as far as them, if not farther,\" says Gauff. \"I love to get in the American guys' heads.\"\n\nTo her coach, former tour player and current ESPN commentator Brad Gilbert, Gauff's live arm speaks to her still untapped potential. \"When you see that, it's almost like 'Sh-t, she should be serving better,'\" he says.\n\nThat's quite a statement, considering that Gauff's 125-m.p.h. delivery to Aryna Sabalenka at this year's Australian Open was the fastest female serve in the tournament. That her game might just be scratching the surface of its greatness speaks to Gauff's status as America's potential next iconic, mononymous athlete. From Tiger to Serena to LeBron to ... Coco?\n\nFans have forged a unique connection with Gauff, a function of both her achievements at a young age and her willingness to be vocal about sociopolitical issues. She struggled to meet early expectations on the court, fighting self-imposed pressures for years, but she finally eased her mind a bit last summer, thrilling the crowd in New York City as she nabbed her first Grand Slam win at the U.S. Open. Throughout the tournament, Gauff charmed her growing fan base. She supported the rights of climate protesters to disrupt her semifinal match. She mused on her anime infatuation, and, in her victory speech, she spontaneously thanked her online detractors for \"adding gas\" to her fire.\n\nWhen Naomi Osaka withdrew from the 2021 French Open to tend to her mental health, Gauff was the first tennis player to message her with support. Late last year, when 18-time major champion Chris Evert revealed that her ovarian cancer had returned, Gauff was one of the few active players to reach out to her. \"When people see an athlete with her level of fame and fortune having humility and empathy for people around her and awareness of world events, it sends a clear message,\" Evert tells TIME. \"She's focused. She's fearless. We need some leaders in the women's game. She definitely will be one of them. If not the one.\"\n\nRead More: Coco Gauff Is Chasing That Championship High\n\nGauff earned nearly $23 million in winnings and endorsements in 2023, making her the highest-paid female athlete in the world, according to Sportico, a sports-business publication. She has a momentous spring and summer ahead -- the French Open starting May 26, then Wimbledon, then the Olympics, then her U.S. Open title defense beginning in August. \"I always knew I wanted to try to win multiple Grand Slams,\" says Gauff as an SUV rolls along I-10, en route from Indian Wells to L.A. for TIME's Women of the Year gala. \"Sometimes people get unmotivated after winning one. That hasn't been a personal challenge for me.\"\n\nGauff usually arrives ahead of schedule. She won a major while still in her teens, upset Venus Williams in the first round of Wimbledon at 15, and started walking at 9 months, skipping the crawling stage. When she was 3, she got out of her stroller and tried to catch up to her older cousins who were running around a track. She was too small to pass them. But she also refused to tire out. Her mother Candi, a former track-and-field star at Florida State, could spot athletic excellence. \"That was the first inkling of like, 'This is not normal,'\" says Candi.\n\nBefore Coco turned 6, she and her dad Corey were watching Serena Williams win the Australian Open. Corey, a former college basketball player, called Williams the GOAT. \"What's a GOAT?\" Coco asked. Greatest of All Time, he replied. \"I want to be a GOAT,\" she said. He bought her a pink Wilson racquet, and she spent hours hitting against her garage in Atlanta. The example of the Williams sisters drove her. \"As a little girl, it was very important to see representation and see myself in players, especially in the field where it is predominantly white,\" says Gauff. \"I don't think I would have had the belief I could do it if it wasn't for them.\"\n\nWhen Gauff was 8, the family relocated to Delray Beach, Fla. -- where Candi and Corey grew up -- to be closer to expert tennis training. She'd be homeschooled, giving her more time to work on her game. She spent a few weeks a year in France at the academy run by Patrick Mouratoglou, Serena Williams' coach from 2012 to 2022. At 10, she told Mouratoglou she wanted to win more Grand Slams than anybody. \"She was crazy ambitious,\" he says. \"She was looking me in the eyes and was really sure about what she was saying.\"\n\nLife on the road could be isolating for a tween. Gauff missed going to school and hanging out with friends. When she was 12, at a tournament in France, she says, a group of Croatian boys threw orange peels at her and called her a monkey. She cried that night. \"Then I just kind of got over it the next day,\" says Gauff. \"I just felt like that's just something that people experience, which is not a great thing. They just probably didn't grow up around other people that looked different. I don't have any anger towards it. It was not an experience that defined me.\"\n\nIn December 2018, at 14, Gauff became the youngest player in 15 years to win the prestigious Orange Bowl under-18 singles championship. Just a few months later, however, she got rolled, 6-1, 6-1, in a qualifying round of a low-level pro tournament in Bonita Springs, Fla. She complained about the scouting report. \"She was making all kinds of excuses,\" says Candi, who gave her daughter the option to step away and enroll in a brick-and-mortar high school if she wasn't going to at least try. A mere two months later, Gauff was getting social media shout-outs from Michelle Obama, Snoop Dogg, and Magic Johnson for becoming the youngest woman to reach Wimbledon's fourth round in almost three decades. That August, Obama met with Gauff's family in her Washington, D.C., office for nearly an hour. Her main piece of advice: When the demands of fame overwhelm you, it's OK to say no. That fall, Gauff attended a homecoming dance in Boca Raton, Fla., for a glimpse of normal adolescent life. She and her best friend danced together for 15 minutes or so, then spent most of the night sitting in the bleachers, waiting for a ride home. \"I just think I was at a maturity level different from the kids around me,\" says Gauff. \"No one has their life figured out at 15. But I, for the most part, did.\"\n\nIn June 2020, during the global sports shutdown and following the murder of George Floyd, Gauff stepped before a crowd in Delray Beach. \"If you are choosing silence,\" she said, \"you are choosing the side of the oppressor.\" Gauff's parents weren't certain that at such a young age she should wade into the charged issue of police brutality. But the prior speaker at the -protest -- Gauff's grandmother Yvonne Lee Odom, the first Black student to attend an all-white high school in Delray Beach, effectively ending segregation in the area's public schools -- served as inspiration. \"If she can do that with such grace, I can do my part,\" says Gauff now.\n\nWhen tennis restarted later that summer, Gauff lost in the first round of the U.S. Open and the second round of the French. \"I was trying to live up to what other people wanted for me,\" she says. Pundits began knocking her forehand as unsound. \"That got in my head a little bit,\" she says. She reached her first major championship final in 2022, at Roland Garros, where she faced world No. 1 Iga Swiatek. \"I had a lot of anxiety attacks before that final,\" says Gauff. \"It felt like life or death. It felt hard to breathe.\" After losing the first set, she went to the bathroom and cried. \"I lost that match before I stepped on the court,\" she says.\n\nLast year, another early exit -- at Wimbledon, in the first round -- almost sent Gauff spiraling. The day after the loss, she refused to leave her room. Her parents invited her out for dinner and a show. Instead, she ordered Uber Eats and watched Judge Judy. \"I was in a really dark place,\" says Gauff. \"I put my identity too much into tennis. It was taxing to feel awful all the time.\"\n\nShe made a conscious effort to adjust her mindset. \"It is much easier to play for yourself than it is for other people,\" says Gauff. \"I realized it's impossible to satisfy everyone.\" She made other key changes too, like teaming up with Gilbert, who coached Andre Agassi to six major championships and an Olympic gold medal, and having Corey sit in a different spot to watch her matches. \"My dad, he doesn't give the best reactions in the box,\" says Gauff. \"He's a very emotional person.\" She mimics his familiar \"frustrated dad in stands\" histrionics: arms flailing, foot stomping. \"Sometimes when I lose a point, the first thing I look at is the box,\" says Gauff. \"And there's something more reassuring seeing somebody clapping.\" Corey didn't sit in her box during tournaments in Washington, D.C., and Cincinnati, and Gauff won both events. He watched the U.S. Open matches in a suite, or in the case of the final, on a TV in an empty fitness room in Arthur Ashe Stadium, where he could scream, pout, and pray to his heart's content.\n\nGauff lost the first set, just like in Paris the previous year. She again retreated to the bathroom. But this time she didn't shed any tears. She looked in the mirror, splashed water on her face, and brimmed with confidence. \"I feel like I won the match before I even stepped on the court,\" she says.\n\nUnburdened from suffocating expectations, Gauff devotes her attention in Southern California to a favorite off-court pastime: giving proper guff to the middle-aged men in her life. On the ride back to Indian Wells after the Women of the Year event, Gauff laughs out loud watching her father wiggle around in his seat. As he whines about his comfort level, she is utterly gleeful. Before another morning practice session, her conversation with Gilbert -- a man fond of sharing his step count, weight-lifting routine, and history with Agassi -- somehow turns to the Magic Mike movies. \"Brad, do you know how to strip?\" she asks him. Gilbert, 62, seems unsure how to respond. \"You didn't say no.\" Later, Gilbert mimes volleying a ball and shuffling his feet toward the service line, as if Gauff should copy him. \"A little bit faster than that, though, right?\" Gauff says. \"That's how you backpedal? You look like you're going to park the car. It's a technique. The hunchback.\"\n\nWhen she makes a mistake, Gauff will glance at her dad rather than at Gilbert. She's more comfortable venting to him. \"Sometimes he has to take a lot of bullets,\" she says later. She says \"sorry\" a lot: three times in the first eight minutes of one session. She apologizes for serving the ball long into the gut of her hitting partner, or wide, or short. \"That's part of wanting to be perfect,\" Gilbert says. \"The only thing you ever got to be sorry about is if you didn't give 100%. You give 100%, sometimes the result is sh-t.\"\n\n\"It's something I'm going to try to change,\" Gauff says. \"But I don't do it during the match. That's the important part.\"\n\nHer expression turns severe when she walks off the court for a rest during a subpar training block with Russia's Daria Kasatkina. Her body language speaks volumes: Stay away. But near the end of practice, she chases down impossible balls and fires them back, displaying what her doubles partner, world No. 5 Jessica Pegula of the U.S., calls Gauff's \"superpower\" -- her incredible court coverage. At one point, Kasatkina lobs a shot over the net that Gauff, for a moment, loses in the sun. \"I can't see sh-t,\" she says. But she spots it and smashes a winner, delighting hundreds of onlookers.\n\nThen Cocomania ensues. As Gauff walks toward the players' lounge, fans line up against a railing begging for autographs and selfies. An older gentleman asks her to sign his arm. \"It's for my wife!\" he says. A quartet of women fix their hair, for their Instagrammable moment with the defending U.S. Open champ. \"No pushing, please,\" a security guard shouts at the aggressive adults. \"We've got little kids up here.\"\n\nGauff seems most at ease interacting with children. \"I still feel very youthful,\" she says. She watches SpongeBob SquarePants. She dressed up as Aisha -- \"the Fairy of Waves\" from the animated series Winx Club -- for Halloween. She says she's tried to incorporate the respiratory methods of Tanjiro Kamado, the protagonist of the anime series Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, into her tennis. Tanjiro's breathing techniques give him supernatural powers. \"I'm not out here slaying demons,\" says Gauff. \"But it does help in the pressure moments.\"\n\nGauff's an avid reader. She packed Fourth Wing, a fantasy romance novel by Rebecca Yarros that went massively viral on TikTok, in her travel bag at Indian Wells. She also keeps up on current events as best she can. She objects, for example, to the book bans enacted in her home state of Florida and elsewhere. Gauff particularly objects to a YA novel she loves, The Hate U Give, appearing on banned lists: the story explores racial identity and police violence. Gauff's message to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who supported measures that have led to an increase in restrictions: \"Leave the books alone.\"\n\nShe feels a sense of helplessness watching Israel's military force in Gaza. \"I don't really support the mass violence going on to innocent people on both ends of the spectrum,\" Gauff says. \"And there's one side that's getting killed at more drastically faster rates than the other side.\" She wants Hamas to release all Israeli hostages and wants to see a ceasefire, but she fears that neither side is hearing the other. \"I feel like it's becoming more, if you don't support what's happening in Gaza, it makes you feel like you're antisemitic,\" she says. \"I feel far from that.\"\n\nGauff makes no apologies for expressing her views on one of the most fraught issues of our age. \"I am not one to shy away from something that I feel informed about,\" she says. \"And I feel pretty informed about this topic.\"\n\nAfter reaching the semifinals of Indian Wells -- the best showing there of her career -- Gauff returns to Delray Beach in mid-March for a ceremony marking the refurbishment of the tennis courts at Pompey Park, a public facility where she trained with her dad growing up. After Gauff won the U.S. Open, the United States Tennis Association pledged to spend an amount equal to her tournament winnings, $3 million, resurfacing courts around the country, starting here. Before Gauff hits balls with kids from the Delray Beach Youth Tennis Foundation, all wearing her signature New Balance shoe -- the coordinates of Pompey Park are inscribed on the left toe -- some two dozen extended-family members gather around her for pictures. \"Everybody look at the camera,\" Gauff says, one of the youngest members of the group, but unquestionably in charge.\n\nGauff is transitioning to a new phase of her life. \"At first I was scared to grow up,\" she says. \"But now I'm embracing adulthood and womanhood.\" She still lives with her parents. Her mom still washes her clothes. But Gauff hopes to move out and find her own place. \"I don't have a timeline on that,\" she admits. \"I always say it'll happen in my 20s at some point.\" Despite also managing the extracurricular lives of Gauff's brothers Codey, 16, a promising baseball prospect, and Cameron, 10, a multisport athlete, Candi insists either she or Corey will continue to travel with Gauff to tournaments until, in Candi's words, \"she's a true adult.\" \"It has a lot to do with the age gap,\" says Candi, pointing out that Coco is still 10 years younger than many players on tour. \"It's a lonely world.\" Gauff has had a boyfriend for about a year, whose identity she prefers to keep private. She does share that he's from Atlanta, and not famous. \"This is my first real relationship,\" says Gauff. \"To just have someone to talk to who is not involved in tennis at all gives me a fresh perspective.\" Candi was his fourth-grade teacher. \"My mom always said, if they're bad in school, they're probably bad as adults,\" says Candi. \"He's always been a smart, nice kid.\" Meanwhile, Gauff, who's currently ranked third in women's singles, is still shooting for best-in-world status. \"I get goosebumps representing my country,\" says Gauff of her upcoming Olympic debut in Paris. \"I want to win a gold so bad.\" She's backing off her childhood declarations about winning the most Grand Slams in history. \"I was just 10 and delusional,\" she says. \"Serena made it look too easy.\" Double-digit Slam victories, she says, feels like a more realistic goal.\n\nSitting under an awning at Pompey Park, shaded from the late-afternoon sun, Gauff looks out at the gleaming new tennis courts. \"My goal is to be relaxed and have fun and play with less pressure,\" she says. \"I know people are going to start talking about defending the U.S. Open title later on in the year. I'm not worried about that.\" She can't help hearing some noise, like when she fell short of expectations at two hard-court events in the Middle East in February, but her doubters continue to propel her. \"All the hate comes,\" she says. \"People were like, 'Oh, she's burnt out, she's this, she's that.' I'm like, 'Oh my God.'\" In her short time on this planet, Gauff has learned more than most about perspective. \"If I could win every match, I would,\" she says. \"But I can't. People don't go to work and have a good day every day. We just have to all give each other grace.\" -- With reporting by Leslie Dickstein and Julia Zorthian", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

However, a performance marred by errors against Sofia Kenin in the first round of Wimbledon saw the American ousted much earlier than expected.\n\nIn a recent interview with Time, the reigning US Open champion briefly touched on her state of mind following her loss to Kenin. According to Gauff, the defeat left her \"in a really dark place\" and unable to leave her room, despite being invited by her parents to dinner.\n\n\"I was in a really dark place, I put my identity too much into tennis. It was taxing to feel awful all the time,\" Gauff told Time.\n\nHowever, despite Gauff's forgettable outing at the 2023 Wimbledon Championships, she bounced back in style by winning the Washington Open. The 2022 French Open finalist made a major tweak to her coaching setup in the build-up to the WTA 500 event, appointing iconic coach Brad Gilbert.\n\nPrior to coaching Gauff, Gilbert famously worked with Andre Agassi and also had spells with Andy Roddick and Andy Murray. Under Gilbert's guidance, Gauff won against Aryna Sabalenka in the final of the 2023 US Open for her maiden Grand Slam title.\n\n\"I'm very frustrated and disappointed\" - Coco Gauff after losing to Sofia Kenin at last year's Wimbledon Championships\n\nGauff lost the first set of her first-round match against Kenin at the 2023 Wimbledon Championships. However, the American showed her fighting spirit by roaring back into the contest and winning the second set. Ultimately though, it was Kenin who progressed as seventh seed Gauff collapsed in the third set and bowed out.\n\nFollowing her loss, Gauff talked about her frustration and disappointment. She also said at the time that the work she was putting in, despite being a lot, was not translating into results on the big stage.\n\n\"Right now, I'm very frustrated and disappointed. It makes me want to work even harder. I feel like I've been working hard but clearly it's not enough. I have to go back to the drawing board and see where I need to improve and how to do the right drills to do that,\" Gauff said during a press conference.\n\nRight now, Gauff is preparing for her second-round match against Arantxa Rus at the 2024 Mutua Madrid Open.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sudipto_pati@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Sudipto Pati", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia_Kenin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sofia Kenin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastbourne_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastbourne International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Gilbert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Gilbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_500_tournaments", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WTA 500 tournaments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Roddick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Roddick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Agassi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arantxa_Rus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arantxa Rus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/04/8feb5-17139691254325-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508713", "eventUri": "eng-9508713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

importance of representation, sharing how Serena Williams and Venus Williams were pivotal in her own journey of becoming the first American teenager to win the U.S. Open in nearly 25 years.\n\nIn a Time Magazine profile, the now 20-year-old recalled watching Serena compete in the Australian Open at age six with her father, with him calling the tennis legend, \"The GOAT\".\n\nAn inquisitive Gauff asked her father what that meant, and when he explained that it stood for \"The Greatest of All Time\", she proudly declared, \"I want to be a GOAT.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Kate's offer to star undergoing chemotherapy: 'She was so kind'\n\nSoon after, her father bought her a pink Wilson racquet, which she used to practice hitting against the garage in her childhood Atlanta home for hours on end.\n\n\"As a little girl, it was very important to see representation and see myself in players, especially in the field where it is predominantly white,\" Gauff reflects now.\n\n\"I don't think I would have had the belief I could do it if it wasn't for them.\"\n\nREAD MORE: The small city with a culinary scene that puts Melbourne to shame\n\nAs a child, Gauff even spent a few weeks a year in

The duo's connection was forged through the World No. 3's coach Brad Gilbert, who trained with the cast of the film for three months.\n\nIn a recent interview with Tracy Austin on the Tennis Channel, Zendaya elaborated on being inspired by Coco Gauff, stating that she could relate to the pressure the 20-year-old faced, having experienced similar scrutiny when breaking into Hollywood at a young age.\n\nHowever, she emphasized that she couldn't even begin to fathom the challenges Gauff had to endure as a professional tennis player.\n\n\"Well, you know, many things. But also, she's so young and I guess I relate to her in the sense that I was very young when I started in this industry. And so I guess, I relate to the idea of pressure and having all eyes on you but then in many ways, I can't imagine the shoes she has to walk in as a tennis player, as a professional athlete,\" she said.\n\nThe 27-year-old recalled shooting US Open scenes for 'Challengers' at the Billie Jean King Center, admitting to being \"terrified\" despite the absence of any real stakes. She lauded Gauff for her strength, pointing out that the World No. 3 competed on the biggest stages of the sport with her composure and poise intact.\n\nZendaya also opened up about feeling \"protective\" over Coco Gauff and other young stars who were thrust into the spotlight at an early age.\n\n\"I remember when we were shooting our US Open stuff at the Billie Jean King Center, I remember being absolutely terrified. And I'm just pretending, you know, I remember feeling nervous and like, sweating and like the whole thing. And I wasn't actually playing,\" she said.\n\n\"There was no stakes. So I could only imagine and I'm so impressed by her composure, her strength and her poise and like I said, she's so young and so I think when I see young people who are in the public space, I just feel particularly protective,\" she added.\n\nCoco Gauff: \"I loved all the Challengers fashion looks, was really cool to see tennis in that way; Zendaya made it look like high fashion and chic\"\n\nThe admiration between Coco Gauff and Zendaya is mutual, as the 20-year-old tennis ace recently lavished praise on the actress and her film 'Challengers.' During the 2024 Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, Gauff expressed her interest in watching the movie, citing her fondness for dramatic tropes and love triangles.\n\n\"For me, I love that type of stuff, I love the drama, and I love the love triangles, I love all of that. So I'm really excited to see it. I literally have it on my list of movies I'm going to go to see in Europe. As soon as it releases, if I'm not playing a match, I'm going to go,\" Coco Gauff said in a press conference.\n\nThe US Open champion also commended Zendaya for her remarkable looks during the promotional tour, asserting that the actress had elevated tennis fashion to a more sophisticated and chic level.\n\n\"I loved all the Challengers fashion looks. I thought that was really cool to see tennis in that way, because I felt for a tennis player for us, a lot of us wouldn't want to do that, but she [Zendaya] made it look like high fashion and chic,\" she added.\n\nIn other news, Coco Gauff is set to continue her claycourt season at the Madrid Open, taking on Arantxa Rus in her opening match at the WTA 1000 event.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "urvi_mehra@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Urvi Mehra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Challenger_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ATP Challenger Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zendaya", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zendaya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Gilbert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brad Gilbert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_Channel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Austin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tracy Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Jean_King", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Billie Jean King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_1000_tournaments", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WTA 1000 tournaments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_Stuttgart_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's Stuttgart Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arantxa_Rus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arantxa Rus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Organizations", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/04/e93ec-17140191484549-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508713", "eventUri": "eng-9508713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

I think I wanted it too much,\" Gauff said during her post-match press conference.\n\n\"Last night, I started a little bit, but honestly, I just called my boyfriend, and I told him let's talk until it's time to go to sleep so we spoke until 1:00 a.m. and then I went to sleep,\" she added.\n\nDespite acknowledging her boyfriend's existence, the American opted to keep his identity under wraps from the public, refraining from even sharing glimpses of him on social media.\n\nHowever, Coco Gauff recently provided a rare insight into her personal life in an exclusive interview with Time magazine. The American opened up about transitioning into adulthood, admitting that she was initially scared to grow up.\n\nWhile 20-year-old shared that she intended to stop living with her parents at some point in her 20s, she emphasized that she didn't have a set timeline set in stone.\n\n\"At first I was scared to grow up, but now I'm embracing adulthood and womanhood,\" Coco Gauff said. \"I don't have a timeline on that. I always say it'll happen in my 20s at some point.\"\n\nShe also opened up about being in her first real relationship, disclosing that having a confidant who was completely removed from the tennis world allowed her to gain fresh perspectives.\n\n\"This is my first real relationship. To just have someone to talk to who is not involved in tennis at all gives me a fresh perspective,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Coco Gauff's mother, Candi, shed light on her special connection with her daughter's boyfriend, revealing that he had once been a fourth-grade student of hers. She recalled the World No. 3's boyfriend being a model student, describing him as a \"smart, nice\" kid in school.\n\n\"My mom always said, if they're bad in school, they're probably bad as adults. He's always been a smart, nice kid,\" Candi said.\n\nCoco Gauff on the identity of her mystery boyfriend: \"People on Twitter found him, I won't confirm if it's him or not but they caught me\"\n\nCoco Gauff recently disclosed some more details about her mystery boyfriend, sharing that he was an aspiring actor with plans to apply for music school.\n\n\"He's a very nice guy. He's in school now. He's about to apply for music school. He wants to be an actor and he plays the guitar. He's not from Delray. He's actually from Atlanta,\" Coco Gauff said.\n\nThe World No. 3 also humorously admitted that fans had uncovered his identity by combing through her social media activity. However, she still refused to confirm his identity or reveal his name.\n\n\"And actually, um, I will say this: People on Twitter found him two or three days ago. I won't respond and confirm if it's him or not, but they caught me in the comments, so they know. Some people thought it was someone in tennis and that couldn't be further from the truth,\"\n\nIn other news, Coco Gauff is set to commence her 2024 Madrid Open campaign against Arantxa Rus in the second round.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "urvi_mehra@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Urvi Mehra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arantxa_Rus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arantxa Rus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delray_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delray Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delray Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Questionnaires", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Questionnaires", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Instruction", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/04/b7f7b-17140009442022-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508713", "eventUri": "eng-9508713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Reaching merely one semi-final in 5 tournaments, Gauff needs to straighten her act with the French Open 2024 being merely 5 weeks away. She has also had to face allegations in the tennis world about the WTA Tour and organisers of tournaments favoring her while making draws.\n\nLife might not get easier for the American at the Madrid Open 2024 either due to a potentially tricky draw. A potential semi-final encounter against World No.1 Iga Swiatek could have the 20-year-old worried.\n\nThe World No.3 is placed in the top half of the draw and will receive a first-round bye. She will begin her campaign at the WTA 1000 tournament by facing Arantxa Rus in the second round. Expected to breeze past the Dutch player, Gauff could then face Dayana Yastremska in the third round.\n\nA win in the third round will result in Gauff's best performance ever at Madrid. Barring any shocks, the Florida native could then go up against either compatriot Madison Keys or Liudmila Samsonova in the fourth round. A win in the fourth round could set up a Jelena Ostapenko clash in the quarterfinals.\n\nHowever, the biggest test Gauff is likely to face will be the Iga Swiatek one in the semifinals. Now, it is worth noting that she has struggled whenever she has gone up against the Polish star. Out of their 10 meetings, the American youngster has clinched merely 1 win and also lost all three of their battles on clay courts, per Tennis Tonic.\n\nIf she manages to orchestrate an upset, Gauff will find herself in the 2 final of any tournament she has played in, this year. With the sublime form that she's been in, Elena Rybakina will most likely be the player to emerge from the bottom half of the draw. While the Kazakhstani player would be the favorite to win, one can certainly expect a potentially entertaining contest between the two sensational talents.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "advait_jajodia@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Advait Jajodia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WTA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_Auckland_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WTA Auckland Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_1000_tournaments", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WTA 1000 tournaments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayana_Yastremska", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dayana Yastremska"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arantxa_Rus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arantxa Rus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Keys", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madison Keys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liudmila_Samsonova", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liudmila Samsonova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Je\u013cena_Ostapenko", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Je\u013cena Ostapenko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Rybakina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elena Rybakina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/04/27220aea-untitled-design-24.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508713", "eventUri": "eng-9508713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Moreover, she was on a two-match losing streak against the Pole, and by the time the final was over, that streak had extended to three matches.\n\nSwiatek hardly wasted any time to dash any hopes that Gauff had before stepping on the dirt at Estade Roland Garros on June 4, 2022. She broke the American five times and induced a staggering 23 unforced errors from the teen to race to a 6-1, 6-3 win in less than 70 minutes.\n\nIt was ecstasy for Swiatek and agony for Gauff as the former was crowned champion in Paris for the second time whereas the latter cried her way out of the stadium.\n\nTwo years later, Gauff is a Grand Slam champion herself and ranked third in the women's singles world rankings. However, she is still reminded of the horrors of the critical days leading up to that final against Swiatek.\n\nIn a recent interview with Time Magazine, the reigning US Open champion revealed that she had accepted defeat before her title clash with Swiatek began at the French Open.\n\n\"I had a lot of anxiety attacks before that final, it felt like life or death it felt hard to breathe. I lost that match before I stepped on the court,\" she said.\n\nGauff had announced herself to the tennis world in grand fashion by reaching as far as the pre-quarterfinals of Wimbledon in 2019 after starting in the qualifiers as a 16-year-old.

This was notably her eighth meeting with Swiatek and also the only time when the American could clinch a set from the World No. 1. The remaining nine duels between the two have ended in straight sets in Swiatek's favor.\n\nCoco Gauff's struggle against Swiatek can be understood a little bit by the four-time Grand Slam champion's ability to unsettle the baseliners with her spin and ability to find acute angles.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ayush_vashistha@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Ayush Vashistha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_rankings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WTA rankings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/04/165e6-17139650786575-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9508713", "eventUri": "eng-9508713", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

So I'm here to tell you guys that we must first love each other no matter what. We must have the tough conversations with our friends.

Second, we need to take action,\" Coco Gauff said.\n\n\"You need to use your voice, no matter how big or small your platform is, you need to use your voice.

Neil Moss, who was also found guilty of attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child, was struck off by a teaching misconduct panel last month. Mr Moss was suspended from Topcliffe Academy, Castle Vale, in May 2020 after he was arrested by police on suspicion of distributing indecent images of children. In February 2021, he pleaded guilty in court to making and distributing explicit photographs of a child, and one further count of attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child. Mr Moss, 42, was handed a suspended prison sentence and has now been banned from teaching for life by the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA), with no possibility of review. The Topcliffe Academy has been approached for a comment.

In the professional conduct panel hearing, which met on 29 April 2024, Mr Moss was found to have 'fundamentally breached the standard of conduct expected of a teacher.' Images were 'distressing to contemplate' On 29 May 2020, following an intelligence report, West Midlands Police arrested Mr Moss on suspicion of distributing indecent images of children. In court, it was revealed that police found hundreds of indecent images on Mr Moss' device. 63 category A photographs were found, the most serious in the eyes of the law. A further 222 category B images and 683 category C images were also found, although it was acknowledged that some could have been 'duplicates.' A judge at Mr Moss' sentencing hearing said: \"The nature of the images themselves\u2026 is of course distressing to contemplate\". The TRA panel also saw excerpts of messages sent by Mr Moss on messaging app \"Kik\" to a child. 'A lack of full insight and remorse' The TRA panel made the decision to ban Mr Moss from teaching for life stating that public confidence in the profession would be 'seriously weakened' if such conduct was not treated with the 'utmost seriousness.' Mr Moss was found to have 'fundamentally breached the standard of conduct expected of a teacher.' Mr Moss was not present or represented at the hearing, having previously requested the hearing be conducted in private. The panel found there was no evidence his actions were not deliberate and said the fact he had pleaded guilty in his criminal trial demonstrated 'a degree of accountability.' However, the panel also found Mr Moss showed a 'lack of full insight and remorse' having not reflected on the impact of his actions on his victims in court, meaning there was a 'risk of repetition.' The panel was of the view that Mr Moss should be banned from teaching for life, with no opportunity for review. Decision maker David Oatley said: \"The panel finds that the conduct of Mr Moss fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession. The findings of misconduct are particularly serious as they include a finding of a conviction for distributing and making indecent photographs or pseudo photographs of children and attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child.\" He continued: \"In this case, I have considered the extent to which a prohibition order would protect children and safeguard pupils. The panel has observed, 'In the light of the panel\u2019s findings against Mr Moss, which involved possessing and distributing indecent images of children and attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child, there was a strong public interest consideration in respect of the safeguarding and wellbeing of pupils.' A prohibition order would therefore prevent such a risk from being present in the future.\" Topcliffe Academy has been approached for a comment.", "summary": "Neil Moss, a former teacher from Birmingham, admitted making and possesing hundreds of images of children - including 63 in the most serious category", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/primary-teacher-who-made-hundreds-29257022", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29257421.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screenshot-2024-05-29-123318.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:57:08", "author": "Nathan Clarke", "authors": ["Nathan Clarke"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.474}

The co-creator of the huge Heaton Park festival and Night Time Economy Adviser for Greater Manchester shared a post on X on Sunday (June 9). He posted a video of festival security staff 'escorting' the fence jumper away from the festival grounds. The hilarious clip later revealed that the criminal in question was actually a goose. Thousands of festival-goers returned to the huge event in Heaton Park for a second day on Sunday. Acts included Doja Cat, who was headlining The Valley stage, while Kaytranada and TSHA took to the Parklife stage. Performances from ANOTR, Rudimental, Anne Marie, Uncle Waffles and Children of Zeus also graced the stages.

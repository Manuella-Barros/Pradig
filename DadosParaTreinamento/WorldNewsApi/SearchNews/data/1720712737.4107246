{"id": 232085372, "title": "Gotcha! Bungling burglar is caught red-handed by police cowering behind a counter in a restaurant he was targeting amid crime spree", "text": "This is the moment a bungling burglar on a crime spree was caught red-handed by police as he cowered behind the counter of a restaurant. Stephen Clark, 49, had broken into two town centre restaurants in Sevenoaks within the space of half an hour but was quickly tracked down by officers. In CCTV, Clark can be seen smashing the glass on the door of Budare, a Venezuelan restaurant in the Kent town, and forcing his way inside. Bodycam footage of an arriving Kent Police officer shows him announcing to the dark restaurant: 'If there's anybody in this building, please come to the front and make yourself known.' But the officer receives no answer and only discovers Clark hiding behind the counter when he shines his torch on the cowering criminal. The officer says 'hello sir' when he uncovers Clark, before going ahead and arresting him for burglary which Clark appears at first to accept meekly. But when the officer and Clark step outside the restaurant, Clark attempts to flee from the officer and his partner - but they react quickly and tackle him to the floor. Clark targeted another restaurant in Dorset Street, and Budare in The Shambles, between 10.30pm and 11pm on May 31, 2024. He forced open the doors at both venues, damaging glass panels, frames, and locks in the process. Clark was later charged with two counts of burglary and remanded in custody. He attended a hearing at Sevenoaks Magistrates' Court just three days later on June 3, where he was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment. Police Sergeant James Page, of the West Division Victim Based Crime Team, said: 'Clark caused considerable damage to both premises and stole cash from local business owners, causing them inconvenience and placing them under undue financial stress. 'I am thankful to the officers who responded quickly to the initial emergency call and arrested Clark swiftly. 'It is down to their teamwork that Clark, a repeat offender, didn't avoid arrest.", "summary": "Stephen Clark, 49, had\u00a0broken into two town centre restaurants in\u00a0Sevenoaks\u00a0within the space of half an hour but was quickly tracked down by officers.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13510997/burglar-caught-red-handed-police-cowering-counter-restaurant.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/09/17/85899521-0-image-m-18_1717949320121.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:55:34", "author": "Cameron Roy,Editor", "authors": ["Cameron Roy", "Editor"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.547}

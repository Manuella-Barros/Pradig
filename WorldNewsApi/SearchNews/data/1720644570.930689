{"id": 231226388, "title": "Mainland Chinese tourist accuses Hong Kong taxi driver of overcharging by nearly 300%", "text": "A Shenzhen-based tourist has complained about being \u201cripped off\u201d by a Hong Kong taxi driver for being asked to pay HK$600 (US$77), nearly three times the usual fare, on his first day in town for the Dragon Boat Festival long weekend. The complaint on Friday coincides with the government\u2019s wider drive to crack down on the malpractices of cabbies. The tourist took to the Instagram-like Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu to complain about his HK$600 trip from Shenzhen Bay Immigration Control Point in Tuen Mun to the Hong Kong International Airport. A search on three different ride-hailing platforms \u2013 Uber, HKTaxi, and Fly Taxi \u2013 by the Post showed that the route of about 28km (17 miles) cost between HK$228 and HK$278 at about 6pm on Saturday. \u201cNot only is the integrity of Hong Kong\u2019s service industry worse than Singapore\u2019s, it\u2019s also lagging behind second- and third-tier cities on the mainland,\u201d the user said in a post. \u201cThe distance was not shown on the receipt, and I asked the driver about it but he switched to Cantonese to confuse me. The moment he tried to snatch my receipt, I knew I was ripped off,\u201d the post read, showing a receipt that detailed a surcharge of HK$573. \u201cI was furious and disappointed,\u201d the traveller wrote. \u201cThis HK$600 trip ruined my chirpy mood on the first morning of my holiday.\u201d The traveller said he filed the case with the airport police with a photo he took of the receipt and the taxi\u2019s number plate. The Post has reached out to the police for a comment on this case. This Xiaohongshu post attracted over 160 comments, with many of them recounting their own experiences of being overcharged by Hong Kong taxis, while the posts with the hashtag \u201cHong Kong taxis ripping off passengers\u201d fetched 301,000 views and counting. Taxi passengers, local and overseas alike, have long complained about various malpractices of cab drivers. In addition to overcharging, the most common complaints include the refusal to take certain routes, reckless speeding and rudeness. The taxi industry\u2019s poor reputation has made the ride-hailing platform Uber popular in the city, despite doubts about its legality. Ride-hailing services are illegal for vehicles without a hire-car permit in Hong Kong. Cabbies in the city have accused Uber of undermining its business and campaigned for the government to ban it. The government has rolled out initiatives to improve taxi services, including the introduction of a demerit point system in September to stamp out bad behaviour by taxi drivers, as well as the creation of premium taxi fleets across the city. On Saturday, Secretary for Transport and Logistics Lam Sai-hung said the government would monitor the five operators to be chosen under the city\u2019s new taxi fleet scheme, by requesting data from their proprietors regarding how they handled complaints or customer\u2019s rating of their performance. Lam noted that this data would be used as part of a midterm review. \u201cIf they perform poorly, we would issue warnings in some instances demanding they make improvements before a certain time,\u201d he said, adding the government would consider reducing their scale or even suspend their licences if they failed to improve. Hong Kong\u2019s taxi industry rolled out a three-month courtesy drive on Wednesday in a bid to improve its reputation, by deploying ambassadors to cab ranks, including those at the airport and border checkpoints, to encourage drivers to be polite to passengers. Official statistics showed that taxi service complaints and suggestions were 52.8 per cent higher in 2023 at 11,096 from 2022, with cab drivers refusing a hire and overcharging passengers among the top complaints. The Hong Kong Taxi Council said the initiative was more about educating drivers and that measuring its success would be challenging.", "summary": "Visitor from Shenzhen complains on Xiaohongshu about being \u2018ripped off\u2019 after paying HK$600 for a trip from Tuen Mun to Hong Kong airport.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/transport/article/3265911/mainland-chinese-tourist-accuses-hong-kong-taxi-driver-overcharging-nearly-300", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/08/8920f019-3245-4f48-8fe8-c576e4cdbe99_fc3cabbe.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:49:34", "author": "Ambrose Li,Harvey Kong", "authors": ["Ambrose Li", "Harvey Kong"], "language": "en", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": -0.412}

He ran off when challenged, and is still on the run.\n\nPolice have launched a major investigation and the bridge has been closed. One eyewitness described the scene which unfolded from around 11.40pm, and said the man, who is being hunted by police ran off down Burwalls, the residential lane leading down to Rownham Hill. A major manhunt ensued, with the police helicopter involved, but police have still not found the man.\n\nRead next: Manhunt after suitcases containing human remains found on Clifton Suspension Bridge\n\nUpdates: Suitcases with human body parts found as Clifton Suspension Bridge is closed\n\nOne eyewitness said the man who ran off was shouting in Spanish, as he was chased away from the scene. The man, who said he wished to remain anonymous, was out for a walk with his girlfriend across the bridge from the Leigh Woods side, when he saw a commotion ahead.\n\n\"There were two suitcases, one left on the bridge with what appeared to be blood leaking from it, the other case was on the road just after the bridge on the Leigh Woods side,\" he said.\n\n\"There was blood on the floor along the bridge.

The police helicopter was sent up to scour the scene, but it is believed the man escaped into the woods between the bridge and Ashton Meadows.\n\n\"An immediate search of the area was carried out by officers on the ground with the support of the National Police Air Service and HM Coastguard following the discovery of the suitcases,\" confirmed Vicks Hayward-Melen, the acting Bristol Commander for Avon and Somerset Police. \"These searches remain ongoing.\"\n\nShe added that police have established that the man arrived at the bridge in a taxi - which has been seized and the driver is helping police with their inquiries.\n\nPolice confirmed on Thursday lunchtime that they don't yet know who the victim in the suitcases is, and haven't yet found the man who ran off.\n\n\"This is a very disturbing incident and I fully recognise the concern it will be causing our communities,\" said Vicks Hayward-Melen, the acting Bristol Commander for Avon and Somerset Police.\n\n\"The investigation is being led by our Major Crime Investigation Team and involves specialist officers and staff from across our organisation.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nEyewitnesses have told of how a man was chased by a cyclist after horrified staff at Clifton Suspension Bridge discovered human remains inside a suitcase.\n\nThe grim find occurred just before midnight on Wednesday (July 11) when workers, in Bristol, confronted an individual hauling two suitcases onto the bridge from Leigh Woods. Upon being challenged, he bolted and is currently evading capture - despite the efforts of a cyclist who tried to apprehend him.\n\nImages taken from the scene show the moment staff discovered the human remains. A full-scale investigation is underway, and the bridge has been sealed off, Bristol Live reports\n\nAccording to one witness, the drama began around 11.40pm, with the suspect, now sought by police, fleeing down Burwalls Lane towards Rownham Hill. Despite a large-scale search involving a police helicopter, the suspect remains at large.\n\nREAD MORE: Missing Jay Slater in Tenerife LIVE updates as TikTok detective gives verdict on ravine search\n\nOne eyewitness said the man who ran off was shouting in Spanish, as he was chased away from the scene. The man, who said he wished to remain anonymous, was out for a walk with his girlfriend across the bridge from the Leigh Woods side, when he saw a commotion ahead.\n\n\"There were two suitcases, one left on the bridge with what appeared to be blood leaking from it, the other case was on the road just after the bridge on the Leigh Woods side,\" he said.\n\n\"There was blood on the floor along the bridge. The man who had the cases ran from the bridge staff and I saw him being chased by a member of the public on a bike - he was shouting something in Spanish.\n\n\"The cyclist followed the man, who was wearing a dark or black clothing, and was seen running down Burwalls,\" he added.\n\nPictures captured by the eyewitness, which Bristol Live has decided not to share, show a trail of blood close to the viewing area on the south side of the Leigh Woods tower.\n\nBridge staff called police when the man left the suitcases and ran off, and officers arrived and immediately closed down the area. The police helicopter was sent up to scour the scene, but it is believed the man escaped into the woods between the bridge and Ashton Meadows.\n\n\"An immediate search of the area was carried out by officers on the ground with the support of the National Police Air Service and HM Coastguard following the discovery of the suitcases,\" confirmed Vicks Hayward-Melen, the acting Bristol Commander for Avon and Somerset Police. \"These searches remain ongoing.\"\n\nShe added that police have established that the man arrived at the bridge in a taxi - which has been seized and the driver is helping police with their inquiries.\n\nPolice confirmed on Thursday lunchtime that they don't yet know who the victim in the suitcases is, and haven't yet found the man who ran off.\n\n\"This is a very disturbing incident and I fully recognise the concern it will be causing our communities,\" said Vicks Hayward-Melen, the acting Bristol Commander for Avon and Somerset Police.\n\n\"The investigation is being led by our Major Crime Investigation Team and involves specialist officers and staff from across our organisation.

He ran off when challenged, and is still on the run.\n\nPolice have launched a major investigation and the bridge has been closed. One eyewitness described the scene which unfolded from around 11.40pm, and said the man, who is being hunted by police ran off down Burwalls, the residential lane leading down to Rownham Hill. A major manhunt ensued, with the police helicopter involved, but police have still not found the man.\n\nREAD MORE: Tori Towey's mother says she won't be fully happy until flight home from Dubai is in the air\n\nREAD MORE: Tori Towey: What we know about the case of the Irish air hostess detained in Dubai\n\nOne eyewitness said the man who ran off was shouting in Spanish, as he was chased away from the scene. The man, who said he wished to remain anonymous, was out for a walk with his girlfriend across the bridge from the Leigh Woods side, when he saw a commotion ahead.\n\n\"There were two suitcases, one left on the bridge with what appeared to be blood leaking from it, the other case was on the road just after the bridge on the Leigh Woods side,\" he said.\n\n\"There was blood on the floor along the bridge.

The police helicopter was sent up to scour the scene, but it is believed the man escaped into the woods between the bridge and Ashton Meadows.\n\n\"An immediate search of the area was carried out by officers on the ground with the support of the National Police Air Service and HM Coastguard following the discovery of the suitcases,\" confirmed Vicks Hayward-Melen, the acting Bristol Commander for Avon and Somerset Police. \"These searches remain ongoing.\"\n\nShe added that police have established that the man arrived at the bridge in a taxi - which has been seized and the driver is helping police with their inquiries.\n\nPolice confirmed on Thursday lunchtime that they don't yet know who the victim in the suitcases is, and haven't yet found the man who ran off.\n\n\"This is a very disturbing incident and I fully recognise the concern it will be causing our communities,\" said Vicks Hayward-Melen, the acting Bristol Commander for Avon and Somerset Police.\n\n\"The investigation is being led by our Major Crime Investigation Team and involves specialist officers and staff from across our organisation.

An eyewitness said that the suspect was chased by a cyclist but managed to escape.\n\nThe discovery occurred just before midnight on Wednesday, July 10, when bridge workers confronted a man hauling two suitcases from Leigh Woods onto the bridge. He bolted when they approached him and is currently being sought by authorities. Keep up to date on the story with our live blog here\n\nA full-scale investigation has been launched and the bridge has been shut down. According to one witness, the drama began around 11.40pm, with the man fleeing down Burwalls, a lane leading to Rownham Hill.

As of Thursday afternoon, police have yet to identify the victim found in the suitcases and are still searching for the man seen fleeing the scene.\n\n\"This is a very disturbing incident and I fully recognise the concern it will be causing our communities,\" the commander added.\n\n\"The investigation is being led by our Major Crime Investigation Team and involves specialist officers and staff from across our organisation.

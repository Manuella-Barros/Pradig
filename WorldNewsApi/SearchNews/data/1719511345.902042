{"id": 223771598, "title": "Jack Willis calls Antoine Dupont \u2018best of all time\u2019 after leading Toulouse to Champions Cup glory", "text": "Jack Willis has hailed Antoine Dupont as the \u201cbest rugby player of all time\u201d after the scrum half led Toulouse to Champions Cup glory. Dupont dazzled in attack and defence at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as the French side outlasted Leinster to secure their sixth European crown. The 27-year-old beat six defenders and kicked superbly from hand, but it was his efforts on the other side of the ball that embodied a remarkable defensive performance from Ugo Mola\u2019s men. Dupont, who will chase Olympic gold in sevens at Paris 2024 this summer, won four turnovers during the course of a 100-minute epic, underlining his status as the best male player on the planet. And teammate Willis, himself outstanding in the win, went one step further in his praise of the half back. \u201cAs far as I have seen, he\u2019s probably the best rugby player of all time,\u201d the flanker effused of Dupont, who was named Investec Player of the Year. \u201cI think he made three or four turnovers. He can do everything, he\u2019s a hell of a player. The way he kicked and moved us into their part of the field was really important. \u201cYou don\u2019t win trophies without defence and we know that. The attack comes quite naturally to this group. We know that against a team like Leinster they are so organised, so structured in attack and they will just go after you again and again and again. We were really under the pump but we stuck together and managed to get there in the end.\u201d The Champions Cup win is Willis\u2019 second trophy since arriving in Toulouse late in 2022 after the demise of Wasps, with the 14-cap England international influential in securing the Top 14 title last year. The 27-year-old\u2019s international career is on hold with players based overseas ineligible for selection. Barring a change in policy, Willis would have to return to the Premiership to come under consideration for Steve Borthwick, but the back row is loving life in the south of France. \u201cThe last couple of years, there have been lots of lows with Wasps and not playing as much as I would have wanted in certain games, so to be welcomed in here, I can\u2019t tell you how grateful I am. \u201cAfter leaving Wasps, there were a lot of emotions. Trying to deal with joining another club in England is a hard thing. No one probably realises how difficult that is. I think I probably escaped a little bit being out here at being at such a great club where we have had the chance to win a Top 14 and a Champions Cup. \u201cI have been welcomed in a group that have shown nothing but respect to me and welcome me in with open arms. If you had asked me two years ago that I would be winning a Champions Cup, I would have thought that you were mental. \u201cWhen you are a young lad, you dream of winning something in England or winning a European Cup. I have dreamt of winning this trophy since I was a little boy. I was still on the pitch thinking we have just played 100 minutes against Leinster, probably the team to beat over the last couple of years, to win a European final. I can\u2019t put that into words.\u201d", "summary": "<p>The scrum half starred as he captained the French side to victory in an epic final against Leinster </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/antoine-dupont-jack-willis-toulouse-champions-cup-b2551687.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/25/18/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 17:00:08", "author": "Harry Latham-coyle", "authors": ["Harry Latham-coyle"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.336}

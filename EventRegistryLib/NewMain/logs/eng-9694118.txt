The termination letters issued by the institute underlined that the contracts would not be renewed and their services would end on June 30, 2024.\n\nThis move, which has shocked the TISS community, leaves many long-serving staff members facing unemployment. Last year, the Centre converted TISS into a fully publicly funded institute.\n\nProfessor Manoj Kumar Tiwari, in-charge VC of TISS said, \"These staff were appointed under various projects under the funding of Tata Trust. The fundings for these projects have stopped in the last few months. Considering this, we allowed these teachers to work under clock hour basis in the institute. But now we are unable to garner financial aid, so we decided to stop their services. We will reappoint them once funding from the Trust resumes.\"\n\nFollowing the decision, the Progressive Students Forum (PSF), a students' collective from the TISS, in a post on social media platform stated that while the exact number of affected employees remains unclear, the mass termination is expected to create a significant shortage of both teaching and non-teaching staff at the institute.\n\nStudents have voiced their concerns about potential negative impact on the student-faculty ratio, as evidenced by previous years' National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) data. They fear that the current faculty will be insufficient to meet the needs of the student body, and that the termination of these positions might pave the way for politically motivated appointments in the future.\n\n\"TISS, a prestigious institute with a history spanning nearly 90 years, has earned its status as a leading social science institution through the contributions of its faculty and staff. Last year, the union government transformed TISS into a fully public-funded institute. However, this transition has led to delays in student aid and increased financial pressures on students from economically and socially marginalized backgrounds. The latest decision to terminate staff positions further highlights the BJP government's perceived anti-education and anti-TISS stance,\" the statement read.\n\nPSF at TISS has strongly condemned the mass termination and has called for immediate action. The body has demanded that the TISS administration revoke the terminations and collaborate with the union government and the University Grants Commission (UGC) to secure funding for these positions.

The remaining teaching staff on TISS campuses are permanent faculty members on the University Grants Commission (UGC) payroll.\n\nFaculty members have linked the development to changes in the UGC regulations, which, in June last year, brought TISS under the central government's purview of appointments along with other deemed-to-be-universities receiving over 50 per cent funding from the Centre. The TISS administration has dismissed any connection between the two events.\n\n\"The institute tried its best for the release of grant from Tata Education Trust for the purpose of salary. The institute made several attempts for the release of grant through official correspondence and personal meetings with the Tata Education Trust and the decision regarding further extension of grant period has not yet been received from Tata Education Trust,\" said an email sent by the office of the officiating registrar, Anil Sutar, to those dismissed.\n\nThe email, sent on Friday evening, added that \"in the event of non-receipt of approval/ grant from Tata Education Trust\", their services would come to an end with effect from June 30.\n\nWhen contacted, head of communications at Tata Trust, Deepika Surendra, directed The Indian Express to a PR agency, which in turn asked that queries be emailed. At the time of filing the report, there was no response to the email.\n\n\"Yesterday was the last day of MA admissions and most of us were involved in that process despite not having formal contracts since May 31. We were also working to revamp the entire Masters programme in compliance with the New Education Policy during this period. All faculty members worked to develop the new syllabus and courses were allotted for the upcoming semester. We had no inkling that they would not honour the commitment given to us,\" said another faculty member from the Guwahati campus.\n\n\"All these positions were created under various schools and centres run by TISS on the basis of funding from the Tata Education Trust. Most of us have been working for as many as 10-15 years, including in positions of responsibilities such as centre heads. We are unsure how the institute plans to run the courses after this arbitrary dismissal of such a large number of employees without having an alternative ready,\" said a faculty member from the Mumbai campus who requested anonymity.\n\nOn Saturday, the TISS Teachers Association held an urgent meeting to discuss the matter.\n\nAccording to the institute administration, it has approached the Tata Education Trust multiple times in the past six months. The administration was required to submit a proposal for the continuation of the grants, which they said they had sent. \"While there is no direct communication from the Trust that they are going to discontinue the grants, there is no other communication too, making it difficult for the institute administration to sustain,\" said a member of the administration.\n\n\"The institution has already written to the Tata Education Trust. A committee has been formed to pursue the matter with the Trust. If the grants are received, this can be reverted. But in case of no change in situation, there is no alternative. The institute will have to find alternative ways to run the courses,\" said Acting Vice Chancellor Prof Manoj Tiwari.\n\nAccording to a member of the administration, there are plans to propose that the same faculty members work on hourly basis to enable teaching to continue, while also preparing a complete roster of required positions to issue advertisements for regular appointments.\n\n\"All affected people were on the payroll of the Tata Education Trust. The government refused to absorb them, and the Trust has washed its hands off since the government takeover itself was a plan on its own,\" said a senior TISS official in Mumbai.\n\n\"The dismissed faculty members were not just NET-passed PhD scholars but individuals selected by a highly regarded panel of the Tata Education Trust.

The Guwahati campus suffered the most, losing all non-teaching staff and half its teaching staff.\n\nA total of 20 teaching staff members were dismissed from the Mumbai campus, 15 from Hyderabad, 14 from Guwahati, and 6 from Tuljapur, the news website reported.\n\nThe dismissed staff, many with over a decade at TISS, were all on contracts funded by the Tata Education Trust. TISS cited a lack of renewed grants from the Trust as the reason for the dismissals.\n\nSome faculty members linked the dismissals to changes in University Grants Commission (UGC) regulations. Last year, TISS, along with other deemed universities receiving significant central government funding, came under the government's purview for appointments. TISS administration, however, denied any connection.\n\nA dismissed faculty member from TISS Guwahati, with 11 years of service, expressed disappointment at the lack of proper notice (just two days) and the disregard for their contractual obligations (a month's notice period). They highlighted the faculty's continued work on admissions and program revisions despite contract uncertainties.\n\nFaculty members expressed concerns about TISS' ability to run courses effectively after such a large-scale dismissal without a clear alternative plan.\n\nTISS administration claimed they had pursued renewed funding from the Tata Trust for months, including submitting a proposal. They formed a committee to address the issue and expressed a willingness to rehire faculty on an hourly basis if funding is secured. As a long-term solution, they plan to advertise permanent positions.\n\nA senior TISS official revealed that the dismissed staff were funded by the Tata Trust, and the government takeover might have complicated matters, with both entities potentially distancing themselves from the situation.\n\nAnother official lamented the loss of highly qualified faculty, many of whom rejected lucrative offers elsewhere due to their commitment to TISS' social science approach. They viewed the dismissals as a negative consequence of a push for uniformity in the education system.\n\nThe TISS Teachers Association met urgently to discuss the situation.\n\nThe future of TISS campuses, particularly Guwahati, remains uncertain as the institute grapples with funding issues and the sudden loss of experienced staff.", "source": {"uri": "nenow.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "NORTHEAST NOW"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Institute_of_Social_Sciences", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tata Institute of Social Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guwahati", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guwahati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guwahati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tata Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indian_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Indian Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deemed_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deemed university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Grants_Commission_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University Grants Commission (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Political_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Political Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Academic Departments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Academic Departments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Science/Academic Departments", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://nenow.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TISS.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9694118", "eventUri": "eng-9694118", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guwahati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

The remaining teaching staff on TISS campuses are permanent faculty members on the University Grants Commission (UGC) payroll.\n\nSome faculty members have linked the development to changes in UGC regulations, which in June last year brought TISS under the Central government's purview of appointments along with other deemed-to-be-universities receiving over 50 per cent funding from the Centre.\n\nA statement issued by the institute's Progressive Students' Forum (PSF) strongly condemned the mass termination. \"After repeatedly targeting its students and curbing the campus democracy, the present TISS administration, under the BJP-led union government, has unleashed an attack on its employees as well.\"\n\nThe TISS administration has dismissed this connection.", "source": {"uri": "nationalheraldindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nh_digital@nationalheraldindia.com", "name": "Nh Digital", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Institute_of_Social_Sciences", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tata Institute of Social Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Group", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tata Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guwahati", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guwahati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guwahati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Grants_Commission_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University Grants Commission (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuljapur", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tuljapur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tuljapur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Student", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Political_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Political Science", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Education", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Educational_Resources/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Educational Resources/Organizations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/nationalherald%2F2024-01%2F75ac1239-2000-4e46-8017-76eac1fb3cf6%2Ftiss.jpg?rect=0%2C0%2C1024%2C538&w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9694118", "eventUri": "eng-9694118", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

The Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) finds itself embroiled in controversy as nearly 100 teaching and non-teaching staff members face abrupt termination, with their contracts ending today, on June 30. This decision communicated via termination letters sent on June 28, has sent shockwaves through TISS campuses nationwide. Previously supported by the Tata Education Trust, these staff members now confront uncertain futures, sparking outcry from student bodies and accusations of mismanagement under the current administration.\n\nAs reported by The Hindu, the mass termination at TISS has drawn criticism from the Progressive Students' Forum of TISS, who have opposed this move. Critics, including the Progressive Students' Forum, argue that these actions reflect a broader \"anti-education\" agenda perpetuated by the BJP government. This agenda, they allege, undermines academic freedom and threatens the livelihoods of dedicated staff members who have served the institute for years. The Forum contends that these terminations may pave the way for politically motivated appointments, potentially compromising TISS's longstanding commitment to academic excellence and social justice. TISS Suspends PhD Student Ramadas Prinisivanandan for Two Years Over Alleged Involvement in 'Anti-National' Activities.\n\nThe decision has particularly impacted teaching staff across multiple TISS campuses, including 20 from Mumbai, 15 from Hyderabad, 14 from Guwahati, and six from Tuljapur, with permanent faculty members on the University Grants Commission (UGC) payroll unaffected, as reported by The Indian Express. The Forum has expressed apprehension that the abrupt dismissals could lead to an inadequate student-faculty ratio, potentially compromising the quality of education TISS is renowned for. As per the report, as of June 30, approximately 55 teaching staff and nearly 60 non-teaching staff who have been working for over a decade on a contract basis across campuses have been terminated. BBC Documentary Row: Tata Institute of Social Sciences Warns Students Against Screening 'India: The Modi Question' on Campus.\n\nAmid these challenges, the Progressive Students' Forum has called for urgent dialogue between the TISS administration, the BJP government, and UGC to reconsider these terminations or secure alternative funding solutions. They argue that the central government's decision to fully fund TISS as a public institution has exacerbated existing financial pressures, leading to delays in student aid and threatening the accessibility of higher education for marginalised communities.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Institute_of_Social_Sciences", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tata Institute of Social Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tata Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hindu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hindu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Grants_Commission_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University Grants Commission (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indian_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Indian Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guwahati", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guwahati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guwahati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuljapur", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tuljapur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tuljapur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Political_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Political Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Academic Departments", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2-134937925-784x441.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9694118", "eventUri": "eng-9694118", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 15, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 366, "textEnd": 373}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

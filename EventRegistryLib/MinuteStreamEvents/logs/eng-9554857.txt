The research links interpersonal discrimination to changes at the molecular level, revealing a potential root cause of disparities in aging-related illness and death.\n\n\"Experiencing discrimination appears to hasten the process of aging, which may be contributing to disease and early mortality and fueling health disparities,\" said Adolfo Cuevas, assistant professor in the Department of Social and Behavioral Sciences at NYU's School of Global Public Health and senior author of the study published in the journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity-Health.\n\nResearch shows that people who experience discrimination based on their identity (e.g. race, gender, weight, or disability) are at increased risk for a range of health issues, including heart disease, high blood pressure, and depression. While the precise biological factors driving these poor health outcomes are not fully understood, chronic activation of the body's stress response is a likely contributor. Moreover, a growing body of research connects persistent exposure to discrimination to the biological processes of aging.\n\nTo better understand the connection between discrimination and aging, Cuevas and his colleagues looked at three measures of DNA methylation, a marker that can be used to assess the biological impacts of stress and the aging process. Blood samples and surveys were collected from nearly 2,000 U.S. adults as part of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study, a longitudinal analysis of health and well-being.\n\nParticipants were asked about their experiences with three forms of discrimination: everyday, major, and workplace. Everyday discrimination refers to subtle and minor instances of disrespect in daily life, whereas major discrimination focuses on acute and intense instances of discrimination (for example, being physically threatened by police officers). Discrimination in the workplace includes unjust practices, stunted professional opportunities, and punishment based on identity.\n\nThe researchers found that discrimination was linked to accelerated biological aging, with people who reported more discrimination aging faster biologically compared to those who experienced less discrimination. Everyday and major discrimination were consistently associated with biological aging, while exposure to discrimination in the workplace was also linked to accelerated aging, but its impact was comparatively less severe.\n\nA deeper analysis showed that two health factors -- smoking and body mass index -- explained roughly half of the association between discrimination and aging, suggesting that other stress responses to discrimination, such as increased cortisol and poor sleep, are contributing to accelerated aging.\n\n\"While health behaviors partly explain these disparities, it's likely that a range of processes are at play connecting psychosocial stressors to biological aging,\" said Cuevas, who is also a core faculty at the Center for Anti-racism, Social Justice, & Public Health at NYU School of Global Public Health.\n\nIn addition, the link between discrimination and accelerated biological aging varied by race. Black study participants reported more discrimination and tended to exhibit older biological age and faster biological aging. However, white participants, who reported less discrimination, were more susceptible to the impacts of discrimination when they did experience it, perhaps due to less frequent exposure and fewer coping strategies. (Data on other racial and ethnic groups were not available in the MIDUS study.)\n\n\"These findings underscore the importance of addressing all forms of discrimination to support healthy aging and promote health equity,\" added Cuevas.", "source": {"uri": "medicalxpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medical Xpress - Medical and Health News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Senescence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fight-or-flight response"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hypertension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DNA methylation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethnicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stressor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stressor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychosocial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Body mass index"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senior_Health/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senior Health/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Health_and_Wellness", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Health and Wellness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2021/aging.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554857", "eventUri": "eng-9554857", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 249, "relevance": 1}

such as gender, race, weight, or disability - are at increased risk for health issues including depression, heart disease, and high blood pressure.\n\nWhile the exact biological factors are not fully understood, scientists believe chronic activation of the body's stress response is a likely contributor.\n\nA growing body of research also connects persistent exposure to discrimination to the biological processes of aging.\n\nDr Cuevas and his colleagues looked at three measures of DNA methylation, a marker that can be used to assess the biological impacts of stress and the aging process.\n\nBlood samples and surveys were collected from almost 2,000 American adults.\n\nThe participants were asked about their experiences with three forms of discrimination: every day, major, and workplace.\n\nEveryday discrimination refers to subtle and minor instances of disrespect in daily life, whereas major discrimination focuses on acute and intense instances of discrimination while discrimination in the workplace includes unjust practices, stunted professional opportunities, and punishment based on identity.\n\nThe findings, published in the journal Brain, Behaviour, and Immunity-Health, showed that discrimination was linked to accelerated biological aging, with people who reported more discrimination aging faster biologically compared to those who experienced less discrimination.\n\nEveryday and major discrimination was consistently associated with biological aging, while exposure to discrimination in the workplace was also linked to accelerated aging, although its impact was comparatively less severe.\n\nA deeper analysis showed that two health factors - smoking and body mass index (BMI) - explained around half of the association between discrimination and aging.\n\nThe researchers say the findings suggest that other stress responses to discrimination - such as increased cortisol and poor sleep - are contributing to accelerated aging.\n\nDr. Cuevas, Assistant Professor in the Department of Social and Behavioural Science, said: \"While health behaviors partly explain these disparities, it's likely that a range of processes is at play connecting psychosocial stressors to biological aging.\"\n\nThe study also showed that the link between discrimination and accelerated biological aging varied by race.\n\nBlack study participants reported more discrimination and tended to exhibit older biological age and faster biological aging.\n\nHowever, white participants, who reported less discrimination, were more susceptible to the impacts of discrimination when they did experience it, which the researchers say may be due to less frequent exposure and fewer coping strategies.\n\nDr. Cuevas added: \"These findings underscore the importance of addressing all forms of discrimination to support healthy aging and promote health equity.\"", "source": {"uri": "maryvilleforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Maryville Forum"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Senescence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fight-or-flight response"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prejudice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DNA methylation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(statistics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (statistics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hypertension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardiovascular disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stressor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stressor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychosocial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Body mass index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cortisol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smoking"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senior_Health/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senior Health/Sexuality", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workplace_Discrimination", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workplace Discrimination", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Education", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Research", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Research", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/maryvilleforum.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/60/660c5ead-e0a7-52cc-a811-94b0dcd07e8f/663d36723c5d4.image.jpg?crop=1500%2C788%2C0%2C168&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554857", "eventUri": "eng-9554857", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 240, "relevance": 1}

People who experienced intermediate levels of discrimination in the workplace were 22% more likely to develop high blood pressure compared to those who didn't, and participants who experienced high levels of discrimination were 54% more likely to develop high blood pressure, according to the American Heart Association. Young adults who experience discrimination at least a few times a month are 25% more likely to be diagnosed with a mental health disorder and twice as likely to develop severe psychological distress than people who didn't experience discrimination or did less often, a 2021 study found. Everyday discrimination significantly increases moderate to severe depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation. Coping mechanisms like smoking are increased due to discrimination, which can then lead to heart issues, according to previous research from NYU.

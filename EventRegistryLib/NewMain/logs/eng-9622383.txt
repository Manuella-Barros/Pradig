It will be adapted as a live-action series and released in the latter half of this year. Ryoma Takeuchi will lead the show and portray the role of Kazuma Kiryu. Keep scrolling to know about the upcoming series in detail.\n\nThe series depicts the lives of fierce yet passionate gangsters and people living in a huge entertainment district, Kamuroch\u014d, a fictional district modeled after the violent Shinjuku ward's Kabukich\u014d, that acts as the backdrop of the gameplay. Like a Dragon: Yakuza showcases modern Japan and the dramatic stories of these intense characters, such as the legendary Kazuma Kiryu, that games in the past have not been able to explore.\n\nIt is set in 1995 and 2005, spanning across two time-periods, Like a Dragon: Yakuza, an original crime-suspense-action series, follows the life, childhood friends, and repercussions of the decisions of Kazuma Kiryu, a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity.\n\nRyome Takeuchi will play the lead role in the Like a Dragon: Yakuza series, and speaking about his experience, the actor said, \"I am truly honored to be given the opportunity to play the role of Kazuma Kiryu, a beloved character and the game series.

Yokoyama said, \"Since the day I first put pen to paper on the original \"Yakuza\"'s script, I've never once thought about revisiting any of my work on the series. It's because I understand all too well the challenges and hardships that come with remaking a finished title. However, if I were ever sent to the past through some kind of cosmic joke, this is the experience I'd want to create. If I had to go through the wringer anyhow, I'd want to make the most engaging versions of Kamuroch\u014d and Kazuma Kiryu I could -- and this show has it all.\n\nThere is no question that Prime Video's Like a Dragon: Yakuza will become another landmark release for the Like a Dragon series. While the games let you experience their world through a subjective lens, this adaptation will be the ultimately objective way to enjoy the show. I have no doubt that fans of the series will be drawn to how it brings the games to life and adds new surprises. Newcomers, I'm sure, will find themselves invested simply in the gritty realism of the show.

This wildly popular series of games was first released in 2005 and contains a number of entries including spinoffs, remakes, and more. It seems the series even changed English-language names over time, switching from Yakuza to Like a Dragon. (Prime Video has encapsulated both these titles in its series name). And now it can add a live-action series to its deep well. Here's what we know so far about Like a Dragon: Yakuza.\n\nA release shares more about what we can expect from Prime Video's Like a Dragon: Yakuza live-action series. It seems the show will take some inspiration from the first game in the franchise while, of course, making the story its own. Prime Video shares:\n\nReleased in 2005 by SEGA, the 'Yakuza' game series was positioned as an entertaining game for adults, which found massive fanfare amongst its target audience.

A release notes, \"In 1995 and 2005, spanning across two time periods, Like a Dragon: Yakuza, an original crime-suspense-action series, follows the life, childhood friends, and repercussions of the decisions of Kazuma Kiryu, a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity.\"\n\nDirector Masaharu Take notes, \"In 1995, the protagonist is still young, and he makes a lot of mistakes, and these lead to him spending a decade in prison and the consequences he faces when he got out in 2005. I tried to show those differences in the two time periods, and the cast helped to achieve this as well.\"\n\nAs noted, the critically acclaimed Masaharu Take will direct the series. Like a Dragon: Yakuza will also star Ryoma Takeuchi as its lead character, Kazuma Kiryu.\n\nRyoma Takeuchi shared, \"I am truly honored to be given the opportunity to play the role of Kazuma Kiryu, a beloved character and the game series.

Made in Japan, the series stars the hugely popular Japanese drama and stage actor Ryoma Takeuchi in the role of Kazuma Kiryu.\n\nLike a Dragon: Yakuza will be available on Amazon Prime in over 240 countries and territories worldwide, released in two batches on October 25 and November 1, 2024.\n\nThe live-action crime-suspense series is based on an original screenplay loosely inspired by the first game in the series, 2005's Yakuza. It will be set mainly in the Kamurocho entertainment district, straight from the games, and follows Kiryu and three of his childhood friends in two time periods, 1995 and 2005.\n\nSimilar to the games, protagonist Kiryu is described in the show's press release as a \"fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity\", and the story will deal with the repercussions of his actions in the two time periods. Takeuchi commented that the show will include \"intense fighting scenes\", alluding to the wild action the series is famed for.\n\nThe series was announced today at a press conference at the picturesque Hotel Gajoen Tokyo. At the event, Takeuchi and Take discussed the process of adapting the acclaimed game series for a live-action drama.\n\nSpeaking of the tattoo on his back and sculpting his body for the role, as seen in the key visual image released today, Takeuchi said, \"You can't play Kiryu Kazuma without getting into shape, so I knew I had to throw myself into it. This was a job not only for me but also for the costume and makeup teams. It took two and a half hours just to prepare for this shot.\"\n\nHe added, \"It's partly Kiryu Kazuma and it's partly me. I got so close to the part that it was hard to distinguish where he ended and I began. That included getting into shape for the part, the costume and so on. Rather than acting the part of Kiryu, I feel like he became part of the family.\"\n\nDirector Take said, \"Having someone with such a large physical presence as Takeuchi makes all the difference. I understood that he knows his body better than anyone, so I left it to him to get into shape. Takeuchi did all the action himself as well. It was impressive.\"\n\nOf Kiryu's place in the story, Take said, \"In 1995, the protagonist is still young and he makes a lot of mistakes, and these lead to him spending a decade in prison and the consequences he faces when he gets out in 2005. I tried to show those differences in the two time periods, and the cast helped to achieve this as well.\"\n\nTaking their positions in front of a golden folding screen emblazoned with a dragon reminiscent of the tattoo on Kiryu's back, the actor and director made a symbolic prayer for the show's success.\n\nTakeuchi broke through with his role as Shinnosuke Tomari in multiple Kamen Rider projects. His credits include a cameo in 2019's Detective Pikachu movie adaptation as a Pok\u00e9mon trainer, as well as providing the voice for Justice Smith's character Tim Goodman in the Japanese dub. He also has a successful career in stage acting, and before that was a budding soccer player.\n\nIn a press release, Masayoshi Yokoyama, head of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and executive producer of the new drama series, said, \"While the games let you experience their world through the subjective lens, this adaptation will be the ultimately objective way to enjoy the show. I have no doubt that fans of the series will be drawn to how it brings the games to life and adds new surprises. Newcomers, I'm sure, will find themselves invested simply in the gritty realism of the show.\"\n\nThe Like a Dragon game series is developed by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and published by Sega. The first game, upon which the Amazon series will be partly based, was released in 2006 in the West, with IGN praising its story and awarding it 8.2/10. The game spawned a globally successful franchise, with multiple sequels and spinoffs, a movie adaptation directed by Takashi Miike in 2007, and a remake of the first game titled Yakuza Kiwami in 2016.\n\nThe series was renamed Like a Dragon in 2022, and the most recent entry, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, was released globally in January 2024, receiving 9/10 scores from both IGN and IGN Japan.", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yakuza (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yakuza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamuroch\u014d", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamuroch\u014d"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Naked_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Naked Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuma_Kiryu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kazuma Kiryu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_television_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japanese television drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sega"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubbing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dubbing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryu_Ga_Gotoku_Studio", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective_Pikachu_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detective Pikachu (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justice Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza_Kiwami", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yakuza Kiwami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamen_Rider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamen Rider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takashi_Miike", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Takashi Miike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IGN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_remake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video game remake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Realism (arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/03/yakuza-wo-logo-kv-1717451253034.jpg?width=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622383", "eventUri": "eng-9622383", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-25", "textStart": 577, "textEnd": 587}], "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

The show will be available in more than 240 countries and territories worldwide.

While updates have been slim regarding the adaptation, it seems it's still in production, though what stage it may be at remains unknown. The series, as a whole, has grown tremendously over the past few years thanks to Xbox Game Pass and worldwide releases of new games.

Ryoma Takeuchi plays the protagonist, Kazuma Kiryu, under the direction of Masaharu Take.\n\nPrime Video today announced the premiere of the Japanese Original series, Like a Dragon: Yakuza, streaming from October 25. The series is a live-action adaptation with an original story based on SEGA's global hit game franchise, Yakuza: Like a Dragon. Directed by the critically acclaimed Masaharu Take, the series will feature Ryoma Takeuchi as the lead character, Kazuma Kiryu.\n\nRyoma Takeuchi starrer Like a Dragon: Yakuza to premiere on Prime Video on October 25\n\nReleased in 2005 by SEGA, the 'Yakuza' game series was positioned as an entertaining game for adults, which found massive fanfare amongst its target audience. The series depicts the lives of fierce yet passionate gangsters and people living in a huge entertainment district, Kamuroch\u014d, a fictional district modeled after the violent Shinjuku ward's Kabukich\u014d, that acts as the backdrop of the gameplay.\n\nLike a Dragon: Yakuza showcases modern Japan and the dramatic stories of these intense characters, such as the legendary Kazuma Kiryu, that games in the past have not been able to explore. The much-loved game has captured the attention and hearts of fans not only in Japan but also internationally and will now be adapted, developed, and streamed worldwide on Prime Video.\n\nIn 1995 and 2005, spanning across two time periods, Like a Dragon: Yakuza, an original crime-suspense-action series, follows the life, childhood friends, and repercussions of the decisions of Kazuma Kiryu, a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity.\n\nPlaying the lead, Ryoma Takeuchi said, \"I am truly honored to be allowed to play the role of Kazuma Kiryu, a beloved character and the game series. I strongly felt that I was willing to put my life on the line. Audience will enjoy the show's human drama and conflict that unfolds around Kazuma Kiryu. Moreover, please take a look at Kiryu's intense fighting scenes with the Dragon tattoo on his back.\"\n\n\"I have poured out my heart, soul, and the experience that I have garnered over 35 years into Like a Dragon: Yakuza,\" said director Masaharu Take. \"The unbridled passion, talent, and countless hours of efforts from the entire team have helped bring this spectacular story to life in the form of a riveting series that will be launched this year, the year of the dragon. Please look forward to Kazuma Kiryu, played by Ryoma Takeuchi.\"\n\n\"We are thrilled and extremely excited to announce the Amazon Original action-drama Like a Dragon: Yakuza, based on the popular Japanese game series,\" said James Farrell, Head of International Originals, Amazon MGM Studios.\n\n\"The unfettered appeal for Japanese content from within Japan and other parts of the world has been growing exponentially. While Prime Video Japan continues to offer a variety of content across genres, adapting an internationally popular game franchise that has such deep resonance and layered characters presents a unique charm and makes for an extremely compelling watch. We are committed to augmenting our content library and are confident that Like a Dragon: Yakuza will strike a chord with audiences all over the world.\"\n\nMasayoshi Yokoyama, Head of RYUGAGOTOKU Studio and Executive Producer, further added, \"Since the day I first put pen to paper on the original \"Yakuza\"'s script, I've never once thought about revisiting any of my work on the series. It's because I understand all too well the challenges and hardships that come with remaking a finished title. However, if I were ever sent to the past through some kind of cosmic joke, this is the experience I'd want to create. If I had to go through the wringer anyhow, I'd want to make the most engaging versions of Kamuroch\u014d and Kazuma Kiryu I could -- and this show has it all. There is no question that Prime Video's Like a Dragon: Yakuza will become another landmark release for the Like a Dragon series. While the games let you experience their world through the subjective lens, this adaptation will be the ultimately objective way to enjoy the show. I have no doubt that fans of the series will be drawn to how it brings the games to life and adds new surprises. Newcomers, I'm sure will find themselves invested simply in the gritty realism of the show. If anything, I'd love to watch this version alongside audiences all around the world -- experiencing all of its intensity and soaking in every single second.\"\n\nLike a Dragon: Yakuza, an Amazon Original series based on the globally popular game, will be available on Prime Video worldwide starting on October 25, 2024.\n\nALSO READ: BTS' Jung Kook announces new single 'Never Let Go' during military service; to release on June 7 ahead of group's 11th anniversary Tags : Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Prime Video India, Anime, Game, International, Japan, Japanese, Like a Dragon: Yakuza, Masaharu Take, OTT, OTT Platform, Prime Video India, Ryoma Takeuchi, Web Series\n\nBOLLYWOOD NEWS -

Like a Dragon: Yakuza will span six episodes, three of which will arrive in late October, with the remaining three set to debut the following week.\n\nIn an announcement post, Amazon says the series will feature an \"original story\" based on the franchise, so it doesn't sound as if Like a Dragon: Yakuza will adapt any particular game in the Like a Dragon (nee Yakuza) series.\n\nWith that being said, it sounds like the series will hew pretty closely to the first game; it'll take place in 1995 and 2005 and will feature Kazuma Kiryu as its protagonist.\n\nStepping into the rather intimidatingly large shoes of Kiryu is actor Ryoma Takeuchi, who played the main role in Kamen Rider Drive and also provided the Japanese dub for Tim Goodman in the movie Detective Pikachu.\n\nLike a Dragon: Yakuza will be directed by Masaharu Take, a movie and TV director whose works include 100 Yen Love, which was submitted (but not nominated) as the Japanese entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2015 Oscars.\n\nTake says that he's \"poured out my heart, soul, and the experience that I have garnered over 35 years\" into the series, and that it's fitting that Like a Dragon: Yakuza should be released in \"the year of the dragon\".\n\nFor his part, Takeuchi says he's \"truly honored\" to be playing Kazuma Kiryu. He playfully directs viewers to \"take a look at Kiryu's intense fighting scenes with the Dragon tattoo on his back\". Sounds like those iconic shirtless rooftop battles will make an appearance in the show.\n\nWe don't yet know which other iconic characters from the Like a Dragon-slash-Yakuza series will be making an appearance in Prime Video's series. Hopefully, we'll get to see regulars like Goro Majima and Haruka Sawamura develop their relationships with Kiryu.\n\nLike a Dragon: Yakuza seems to be part of a push Prime Video is making to create more shows based on video games.\n\nIt joins the likes of the critically-acclaimed Fallout, which launched earlier this year, and the upcoming Tomb Raider series, which boasts the involvement of writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge.\n\nWe'll get to see how Like a Dragon: Yakuza handles the story of Kazuma Kiryu when its first three episodes arrive on Prime Video on October 25th.

Directed by Take Masaharu and featuring lead actor Takeuchi Ryoma, the series explores the life and decisions of Yakuza warrior Kazuma Kiryu. With two time periods, 1995 and 2005, the show promises to showcase modern Japan and intense character stories.\n\nLike a Dragon: Yakuza, the live-action series adaptation of the popular role-playing video game Yakuza: Like a Dragon, is heading to Amazon's Prime Video as revealed by Variety, where it will premiere in two batches: October 25 and November 1, with subtitled and dubbed versions in up to thirty languages. The batches will comprise three episodes each, adding up to a six-part series, solely based on the SEGA game franchise, and will be available to stream in over two hundred and forty countries worldwide.\n\nDirected by Take Masaharu (100 Yen Love) and Takimoto Kengo (Kamen Teacher), Like a Dragon: Yakuza stars Takeuchi Ryoma as the lead character, Kazuma Kiryu. Sean Crouch and Nakamura Yugo are in charge of the screenplay and story, with a Japanese screenplay by Yoshida Yasuhiro and Yamada Kana. As for the plot, which is established in two time periods, 1995 and 2005, it centers on the life, childhood friends and the consequences of the decisions of Kazuma, the \"fearsome and peerless\" Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity.\n\nAs the world excitedly counts down to the premiere date, director Take is as eager to unveil the \"spectacular story\" which he and the team have put so much effort into. \"I have poured out my heart, soul, and the experience that I have garnered over 35 years into Like a Dragon: Yakuza,\" he shared. Meanwhile, joining him on the crew are executive producers Erik Barmack, Roberto Grande and Joshua Long.\n\n'Like A Dragon: Yakuza' Is An \"Extremely Compelling Watch\"\n\nThe original Yakuza game series, released in 2005 by SEGA and developed by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, gained laudable reviews globally and grew its fanbase in no time. Like a Dragon: Yakuza is expected to gain as much popularity, if not more, especially given its approaching launch on the streaming giant Prime Video. And according to the streamer, the series \"showcases modern Japan and the dramatic stories of these intense characters, such as the legendary Kazuma Kiryu, that games in the past have not been able to explore.\"\n\nAnnouncing the upcoming premiere, James Farrell, the head of international originals, Amazon MGM Studios, could not be more thrilled. He said, \"The unfettered appeal for Japanese content from within Japan and other parts of the world has been growing exponentially. While Prime Video Japan continues to offer a variety of content across genres, adapting an internationally popular game franchise that has such deep resonance and layered characters presents a unique charm and makes for an extremely compelling watch.\"\n\nLike a Dragon: Yakuza will be exclusively available to stream on Prime Video on October 25 and November 1.

He said in the Amazon press release, \"I am truly honored to be given the opportunity to play the role of Kazuma Kiryu, a beloved character and the game series. I strongly felt that I was willing to put my life on the line. The audience will enjoy the show's human drama and conflict that unfolds around Kazuma Kiryu. Moreover, please take a look at Kiryu's intense fighting scenes with the Dragon tattoo on his back.\"\n\nThe show will be in the hands of director Masaharu Take, who said \"I have poured out my heart, soul, and the experience that I have garnered over 35 years into Like a Dragon: Yakuza. The unbridled passion, talent, and countless hours of effort from the entire team have helped bring this spectacular story to life in the form of a riveting series that will be launched this year, the year of the dragon.\"\n\nMasayoshi Yokoyama, Head of RYUGAGOTOKU Studio will act as an Executive Producer. He said that he'd never previously considered recreating his work in a different format due to the difficulties entailed in that process, but \"If I had to go through the wringer anyhow, I'd want to make the most engaging versions of Kamuroch\u014d and Kazuma Kiryu I could -- and this show has it all.

But going off what Masayoshi Yokoyama (Head of RYUGAGOTOKU Studio and Executive Producer) has said in the announcement press release, the series is poised to be what in his words will be \"another landmark release for the Like a Dragon series\".\n\nHere's what else we know about \"Like A Dragon: Yakuza\" right now...\n\nAmazon's synopsis for the series reads: \"In 1995 and 2005, spanning across two time periods, 'Like a Dragon: Yakuza', an original crime-suspense-action series, follows the life, childhood friends, and repercussions of the decisions of Kazuma Kiryu, a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity.\"\n\nIf you're yet to dive into Yakuza's criminal world, most installments recount a sprawling story within the fictionalized district of Kamurocho, with the first game arriving in 2005. Typically, you'll be roaming the game's open world where you can get involved with all kinds of tasks ranging from exploring and getting into brawls with fellow gangsters to managing businesses and, of course, singing karaoke. Kazuma Kiryu was the primary protagonist, with the enthusiastic Ichiban Kasuga taking center stage in 2020's Yakuza: Like a Dragon.\n\nEach game has its own tale, but Prime Video claims the show \"showcases modern Japan and the dramatic stories of these intense characters, such as the legendary Kazuma Kiryu, that games in the past have not been able to explore.\"\n\nA big part of Amazon's announcement was clearly designed to put any fears to rest that this will be anything but an authentic take that won't upset longtime fans. Whilst Yokoyama said he's \"never once thought about revisiting\" any of his work on the series to date, he claims this show is \"the experience I'd want to create\" if he had to. His full statement on the show is below:\n\n\"Since the day I first put pen to paper on the original Yakuza's script, I've never once thought about revisiting any of my work on the series. It's because I understand all too well the challenges and hardships that come with remaking a finished title. However, if I were ever sent to the past through some kind of cosmic joke, this is the experience I'd want to create. If I had to go through the wringer anyhow, I'd want to make the most engaging versions of Kamuroch\u014d and Kazuma Kiryu I could -- and this show has it all.\n\n\"There is no question that Prime Video's 'Like a Dragon: Yakuza' will become another landmark release for the Like a Dragon series\", Yokoyama says. \"While the games let you experience their world through the subjective lens, this adaptation will be the ultimately objective way to enjoy the show.\n\n\"I have no doubt that fans of the series will be drawn to how it brings the games to life and adds new surprises. Newcomers, I'm sure will find themselves invested simply in the gritty realism of the show. If anything, I'd love to watch this version alongside audiences all around the world -- experiencing all of its intensity and soaking in every single second.\"\n\n\"Like a Dragon: Yakuza\" will be released in two batches of three episodes, releasing on Thursday, October 24 and Friday, November 1.

If you buy something through this post, the publisher may get a share of the sale.\n\nAmazon has announced an original live-action series for Prime Video based on Sega's successful Like a Dragon game series, previously known as Yakuza.\n\nSimply titled Like a Dragon: Yakuza and including six episodes, this original series is directed by Masaharu Take, best known for the drama series The Naked Director. Made in Japan, the series stars the hugely popular Japanese drama and stage actor Ryoma Takeuchi in the role of Kazuma Kiryu.\n\nLike a Dragon: Yakuza will be available on Amazon Prime in over 240 countries and territories worldwide, released in two batches on October 25 and November 1, 2024.\n\nA new story loosely based on the original Yakuza\n\nThe live-action crime-suspense series is based on an original screenplay loosely inspired by the first game in the series, 2005's Yakuza. It will be set mainly in the Kamurocho entertainment district, straight from the games, and follows Kiryu and three of his childhood friends in two time periods, 1995 and 2005.\n\nSimilar to the games, protagonist Kiryu is described in the show's press release as a \"fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity\", and the story will deal with the repercussions of his actions in the two time periods. Takeuchi commented that the show will include \"intense fighting scenes\", alluding to the wild action the series is famed for.\n\nThe series was announced today at a press conference at the picturesque Hotel Gajoen Tokyo. At the event, Takeuchi and Take discussed the process of adapting the acclaimed game series for a live-action drama.\n\nSpeaking of the tattoo on his back and sculpting his body for the role, as seen in the key visual image released today, Takeuchi said, \"You can't play Kiryu Kazuma without getting into shape, so I knew I had to throw myself into it. This was a job not only for me but also for the costume and makeup teams. It took two and a half hours just to prepare for this shot.\"\n\nHe added, \"It's partly Kiryu Kazuma and it's partly me. I got so close to the part that it was hard to distinguish where he ended and I began. That included getting into shape for the part, the costume and so on. Rather than acting the part of Kiryu, I feel like he became part of the family.\"\n\nDirector Take said, \"Having someone with such a large physical presence as Takeuchi makes all the difference. I understood that he knows his body better than anyone, so I left it to him to get into shape. Takeuchi did all the action himself as well. It was impressive.\"\n\nOf Kiryu's place in the story, Take said, \"In 1995, the protagonist is still young and he makes a lot of mistakes, and these lead to him spending a decade in prison and the consequences he faces when he gets out in 2005. I tried to show those differences in the two time periods, and the cast helped to achieve this as well.\"\n\nTaking their positions in front of a golden folding screen emblazoned with a dragon reminiscent of the tattoo on Kiryu's back, the actor and director made a symbolic prayer for the show's success.\n\nMeet the new Kazuka Kiryu\n\nTakeuchi broke through with his role as Shinnosuke Tomari in multiple Kamen Rider projects. His credits include a cameo in 2019's Detective Pikachu movie adaptation as a Pok\u00e9mon trainer, as well as providing the voice for Justice Smith's character Tim Goodman in the Japanese dub. He also has a successful career in stage acting, and before that was a budding soccer player.\n\nIn a press release, Masayoshi Yokoyama, head of Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and executive producer of the new drama series, said, \"While the games let you experience their world through the subjective lens, this adaptation will be the ultimately objective way to enjoy the show. I have no doubt that fans of the series will be drawn to how it brings the games to life and adds new surprises. Newcomers, I'm sure, will find themselves invested simply in the gritty realism of the show.\"\n\nThe Like a Dragon game series is developed by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio and published by Sega. The first game, upon which the Amazon series will be partly based, was released in 2006 in the West, with IGN praising its story and awarding it 8.2/10. The game spawned a globally successful franchise, with multiple sequels and spinoffs, a movie adaptation directed by Takashi Miike in 2007, and a remake of the first game titled Yakuza Kiwami in 2016.\n\nThe series was renamed Like a Dragon in 2022, and the most recent entry, Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, was released globally in January 2024, receiving 9/10 scores from both IGN and IGN Japan.\n\nDaniel Robson is Chief Editor of IGN Japan.

While Prime Video Japan continues to offer a variety of content across genres, adapting an internationally popular game franchise that has such deep resonance and layered characters presents a unique charm and makes for an extremely compelling watch.\"\n\nHowever, perhaps the most notable of those who commented on the series' announcement was Masayoshi Yokoyama, the current head of Yakuza development studio Ryugagotoku Studio.\n\n\"Since the day I first put pen to paper on the original 'Yakuza' script, I've never once thought about revisiting any of my work on the series,\" said Yokoyama, who has served as a writer and producer on every Yakuza entry since its very first release. \"It's because I understand all too well the challenges and hardships that come with remaking a finished title. However, if I were ever sent to the past through some kind of cosmic joke, this is the experience I'd want to create. If I had to go through the wringer anyhow, I'd want to make the most engaging versions of Kamuroch\u014d and Kazuma Kiryu I could -- and this show has it all.\"\n\n\"While the games let you experience their world through the subjective lens, this adaptation will be the ultimately objective way to enjoy the show,\" he concluded. \"I have no doubt that fans of the series will be drawn to how it brings the games to life and adds new surprises. Newcomers, I'm sure will find themselves invested simply in the gritty realism of the show.\"\n\nAt current, Like A Dragon is set to hit Prime Video in two batches of three simul-dubbed and -subbed episodes, with the first releasing on October 25th and the second on November 1st.", "source": {"uri": "boundingintocomics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bounding Into Comics"}, "authors": [{"uri": "spencer_baculi@boundingintocomics.com", "name": "Spencer Baculi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yakuza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sega"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiry\u016b,_Gunma", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kiry\u016b, Gunma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kiry\u016b, Gunma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza_Kiwami", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yakuza Kiwami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takaya_Kuroda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Takaya Kuroda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_name", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japanese name"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eponym", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eponym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamen_Teacher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamen Teacher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuma_Kiryu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kazuma Kiryu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamen_Rider_Drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamen Rider Drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Exorcist (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underdog_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Underdog (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Yoshida", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shigeru Yoshida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soul music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://boundingintocomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kir.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622383", "eventUri": "eng-9622383", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kiry\u016b, Gunma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 1234, "textEnd": 1242}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-25", "textStart": 4193, "textEnd": 4205}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-01", "textStart": 4224, "textEnd": 4236}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

In the original Yakuza, Kiryu Kazuma spent 10 years in prison after being wrongfully accused of murder. Following his incarceration, Kiryu becomes involved in a mystery involving his longtime friend Yumi Sawamura, and 10 billion yen that has been mysteriously stolen from the Tojo Clan. Knowing that the show will take place in those two time periods, it sounds like the series will attempt to adapt the first game.\n\nIn the 19 years since that initial entry, Like a Dragon has become one of Sega's biggest franchises alongside Sonic the Hedgehog and Persona. Studios have been chasing a number of video game adaptations over the last few years, and Sega properties seem to hold a lot of appeal; Golden Axe will be getting an animated series from Comedy Central, and a live-action version of Streets of Rage is also in development. Given the success Sega has seen with its Sonic Cinematic Universe from Paramount, it's not surprising that we're seeing so much interest in other adaptations; Like a Dragon: Yakuza seems like a very logical next step.\n\nRGG Studio's Involvement\n\nRyu Ga Gotoku Studio head Masayoshi Yokoyama wrote the original Yakuza, and will serve as an executive producer on the series. In Amazon's press release, Yokoyama talked about revisiting the early days of the series, and how the show will appeal to both existing fans and newcomers alike.\n\n\"Since the day I first put pen to paper on the original Yakuza's script, I've never once thought about revisiting any of my work on the series. It's because I understand all too well the challenges and hardships that come with remaking a finished title. However, if I were ever sent to the past through some kind of cosmic joke, this is the experience I'd want to create. If I had to go through the wringer anyhow, I'd want to make the most engaging versions of Kamuroch\u014d and Kazuma Kiryu I could -- and this show has it all. There is no question that Prime Video's Like a Dragon: Yakuza will become another landmark release for the Like a Dragon series. While the games let you experience their world through the subjective lens, this adaptation will be the ultimately objective way to enjoy the show. I have no doubt that fans of the series will be drawn to how it brings the games to life and adds new surprises. Newcomers, I'm sure will find themselves invested simply in the gritty realism of the show. If anything, I'd love to watch this version alongside audiences all around the world -- experiencing all of its intensity and soaking in every single second.\"\n\nAre you planning to check out Like a Dragon: Yakuza?

Adaptation of the games aims to properly explore the crime drama and intrigue of Yakuza.\n\nA live-action adaptation of Yakuza titled Like a Dragon: Yakuza will air on Amazon starting October 25, 2024. The series will be six episodes long, with the first half dropping in October and the second on November 1.\n\nAmazon struck gold with its Fallout adaptation, and is already invested in a God of War show as well, so it comes as no surprise it is seeking out more adaptations for its platform.

This implies a retelling of the first title which picks up in 2005 after Kazuma is released from a 10-year prison sentence.\n\nThe series is being directed by Masaharu Take, written by Seaon Crouch and Nakamura Yuho, and will star Ryoma Takeuchi as Kazuma. Similar to how Todd Howard was an executive producer for Fallout, Studio Head from Ryu Ga Gotoku Masayoshi Yokoyama will produce the series.\n\nNo trailer or footage of the series has been released so far, with only a single image of Kazuma showing off his iconic back tattoo and title revealed.\n\nRelated 10 addictive Android games to play on your phone or tablet The quality of Android games available in Google Play Store have never been better, and these titles make it so hard to put your phone or tablet down.\n\nWhat is Like a Dragon: Yakuza?\n\nShould audiences be excited?\n\nThe Like a Dragon franchise only hit mainstream popularity in the West in the past five years or so. The games are all crime dramas with deep, twisting plots, betrayals, shocking reveals, and over-the-top action. It centers around the Yakuza, the organized crime groups that operate in Japan, and various conspiracies related to their operations. Kazuma Kiryu was the protagonist of the first six mainline titles (not counting a handful of spinoffs) before a new character Ichiban took up the mantle when the series rebranded to the Like a Dragon name.\n\nConsidering the massive popularity of the games, as well as other shows delving into the Japanese criminal underworld like Tokyo Vice, I believe Like a Dragon: Yakuza could be another example of a game adaptation done right. We will have to see if it can match the high marks of shows like Fallout and The Last of Us, but the potential for a new saga set in this universe is very high.\n\nThe first three episodes of Like a Dragon: Yakuza will air on October 25, with the final three on November 1, so we don't have to wait long to see the results.\n\nRelated Complete guide to Amazon Prime: Cost, benefits, and what's included If you're thinking about subscribing to Amazon Prime, here's everything you need to know about it -- including price, benefits, and how to sign up.", "source": {"uri": "pocket-lint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pocket-lint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jesse_lennox@pocket-lint.com", "name": "Jesse Lennox", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yakuza (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yakuza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_War_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "God of War (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crime film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuma_Kiryu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kazuma Kiryu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Howard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Todd Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryu_(Street_Fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryu (Street Fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Last of Us"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Vice_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Vice (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Organized crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://static1.pocketlintimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/untitled-design-1-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622383", "eventUri": "eng-9622383", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-25", "textStart": 193, "textEnd": 200, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-01", "textStart": 586, "textEnd": 596, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

The screenplay and story are by Sean Crouch and Nakamura Yugo, with a Japanese screenplay by Yoshida Yasuhiro and Yamada Kana.\n\nReleased in 2005 by SEGA, the \"Yakuza\" game series was positioned as an entertaining game for adults and found massive fanfare among its target audience.

And it's coming this year.\n\nProduced in collaboration with Sega, Like a Dragon: Yakuza is a live-action adaptation of the excellent Yakuza games from Masayoshi Yokoyama and his Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio. Season 1 will release on the Prime Video streaming service globally on 25 October 2024.\n\nThe show will initially tell the origin story of Yakuza member Kazuma Kiryu - the lead character in the original 2005 Yakuza game and many of the sequels - and span a decade, jumping between his childhood and subsequent decisions that not only change his own destiny, but also the future of his clan.\n\nThe role of Kiryu is in the capable hands of Ryoma Takeuchi (Pok\u00e9mon: Detective Pikachu) who explained that even playing the lead was intense: \"I strongly felt that I was willing to put my life on the line,\" he said.\n\n\"[The] audience will enjoy the show's human drama and conflict that unfolds... moreover, please take a look Kiryu's intense fighting scenes with the Dragon tattoo on his back.\"\n\nIts director, Masaharu Take (100 Yen Love), also revealed that every effort was made to ensure the series is as gripping as the games it's based on: \"I have poured out my heart, soul, and the experience that I have garnered over 35 years into Like a Dragon: Yakuza.\n\n\"The unbridled passion, talent, and countless hours of efforts from the entire team have helped bring this spectacular story to life in the form of a riveting series that will be launched this year, the year of the dragon.\"\n\nWhile very different to Fallout, the Yakuza series of games carry an adult age rating for a reason - they are violent and centre on themes that are not suitable for children. Even the more recent comedic adevntures of Ichiban Yasuga can be near the knuckle - he's capable of wielding sex toys as weapons, for example.\n\nIndeed, if the Prime Video presentation goes as far as the games, even the early ones, we could have another The Boys or Fallout on our hands - which is no bad thing.\n\nAnd, if the martial arts aspect is handled correctly, it might even (shock horror) be even grittier and harder-hitting. I'll certainly be looking for it on one of my streaming devices come October.", "source": {"uri": "t3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "T3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rik_henderson@t3.com", "name": "Rik Henderson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yakuza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yakuza (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryu_Ga_Gotoku_Studio", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuma_Kiryu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kazuma Kiryu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Role-playing video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sega"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Yen_Love", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 Yen Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective_Pikachu_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detective Pikachu (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok\u00e9mon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pok\u00e9mon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Boys (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/History", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MnjZHyGhMEfkeCZfStVMGi-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622383", "eventUri": "eng-9622383", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Fallout was an astonishing success for the streamer, and you can only imagine how many meetings must have been held with every imaginable publisher for the last few months. One winner is Sega, with the announcement of a Yakuza Like a Dragon series due to appear this October.\n\nIf you've ever tried to piece together the history and chronology of Sega's Yakuza games, you likely still have a headache. Going since 2005's original Yakuza, and most recently releasing its ninth mainline entry, Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth in January, 2024, the franchise also sports multiple spin-off games, Japanese-only releases, and the inevitable remakes of older games to confuse anyone who isn't paying close attention. Oh, and yeah, it switched English-language names over the last five years, ditching the Yakuza moniker for Like a Dragon as its official title.\n\nAmazon Prime's show is to compromise on that, titled Like a Dragon: Yakuza, flipping around the ordering of 2019's game name to ensure maximum confusion. However, it's not the first live-action TV show based on the game, that honor going to 2010's Kurohy\u014d: Ry\u016b ga Gotoku Shinsh\u014d based on the PSP spin-off game, airing only in Japan. It then had a sequel based on the following PSP release, Kurohy\u014d 2: Ry\u016b ga Gotoku Ashura hen. You can find it all on YouTube if you look, and it has some powerful soap opera vibes. It's safe to say Prime's version will sport a somewhat larger budget.\n\nFilmed in Japan, and in Japanese, Amazon plans to subtitle and dub the show for international audiences. It will star Ryoma Takeuchi (Kamen Rider: Drive) as lead character Kazuma Kiryu, with direction by Masaharu Take (We Make Antiques) and Kengo Takimoto (Kamen Teacher), in a six-episode show taking place in both 1995 and 2005.\n\nThe storyline, as described by Variety, will be \"the life, childhood friends and the repercussions of the decisions of a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity.\"\n\nIt appears to have the official seal of approval by the video games' writer and producer Masayoshi Yokoyama, who has an executive producer credit on the program. While making it clear that he had no desire to rewrite events based on games he'd previously made, he seems very happy with the job done by others. \"If I were ever sent to the past through some kind of cosmic joke, this is the experience I'd want to create. If I had to go through the wringer anyhow, I'd want to make the most engaging versions of Kamuroch\u014d and Kazuma Kiryu I could -- and this show has it all.\"\n\nLike A Dragon: Yakuza will be dropped in two three-episode batches, one on October 25, the next on November 1, although there's no information yet on how long each episode will be.", "source": {"uri": "kotaku.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kotaku"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yakuza (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yakuza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sega"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yakuza (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation Portable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_mine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Land mine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_remake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game remake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soap_opera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soap opera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubbing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dubbing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamuroch\u014d", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamuroch\u014d"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamen_Teacher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamen Teacher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/eaa9f63adc4b8b17489025b58c96ed5b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622383", "eventUri": "eng-9622383", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-25", "textStart": 2746, "textEnd": 2756}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-01", "textStart": 2770, "textEnd": 2780}], "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

There had been no hint that the show was happening at Amazon, no leaks, no scuttlebutt. That Amazon was able to keep the secret right up until it blasted the messaging out on social is something of a minor miracle.\n\nThe show is apparently eight episodes long, each lasting 60 minutes. It will be loosely based on Yakuza Kiwami, the recent remaster of the original Yakuza game that debuted on the PlayStation 2. Amazon says that Japanese actor Ryoma Takeuchi will play the series' legendary leading man, Kazama Kiryu. Takeuchi is best known to Western audiences for a bit part in Pokemon: Detective Pikachu, but very well known in Japan for the drama series The Naked Director.\n\nThis is not the first Yakuza TV show, either. A two-season programme called Kurohyo: Ryu ga Gotoku Shinsho aired in Japan from 2010, based on characters from the first handheld Yakuza game. Legendary Japanese director Takeshi Miike also made a film adaptation in 2007 that is considered decidedly 'OK.'\n\nThe show becomes Amazon's latest big bet on TV adaptations of video game IP.

He has been covering the business & culture of video games for two decades.\n\nAfter the huge success of its Fallout series, Amazon has moved quickly to follow it up with another video game adaptation. Like a Dragon: Yakuza, a live-action Japanese production based on Sega's long-running series of gangster soaps, drops on Prime Video worldwide on Oct. 25, 2024.\n\nWell, half of it does, anyway. It's a six-episode series, to be released in two chunks: the first three episodes on Oct. 25 and the next three on Nov. 1.\n\nThe show follows series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and his friends across two time periods, in 1995 and 2005 -- suggesting an adaptation of the first game, which came out in 2005 and followed Kazuma after he was released from a 10-year prison sentence. Kazuma is played by Ryoma Takeuchi, star of the Kamen Rider Drive series. The series is directed by Masaharu Take, with a story by Sean Crouch and Nakamura Yugo, and a Japanese screenplay by Yoshida Yasuhiro and Yamada Kana.\n\nAmazon describes the show as \"an original crime-suspense-action series\" that \"follows the life, childhood friends, and repercussions of the decisions of Kazuma Kiryu, a fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity.\"\n\n\"Audience will enjoy the show's human drama and conflict that unfolds around Kazuma Kiryu,\" Takeuchi said in a statement. \"Moreover, please take a look Kiryu's intense fighting scenes with the Dragon tattoo on his back.\"\n\nReading between the lines, it seems like Amazon has swooped in to acquire an already-filmed independent Japanese production, which explains why the show's release is only a few months away. Amazon's streaming muscle and deep pockets mean the show gets a simultaneous worldwide release, supported by subtitling and/or dubbing in 30 languages.\n\nGiven not just the success of Fallout and HBO's The Last of Us but the acclaim and ratings bestowed on FX's mostly Japanese-language Sh\u014dgun, this seems like a clever, opportunistic move from Amazon. To the point: \"The unfettered appeal for Japanese content from within Japan and other parts of the world has been growing exponentially,\" said James Farrell, head of international originals at Amazon MGM studios.\n\nIt's not the first adaptation the Yakuza series has had, though -- the first game was adapted into a typically anarchic movie by Takashi Miike in 2007.", "source": {"uri":

The list of not just good but genuinely great adaptions keeps on growing, and hopefully we'll have a new one to add to that list this year. Amazon has announced a live-action adaption of Sega's cult classic series Yakuza, and it already has a release date of October 25. Seeing the show launch so soon is surprising, but if there's one video game series that feels like the perfect fit for television, it's Yakuza. It could, and should, be a slam dunk for Prime Video, which is already riding high on the success of the Fallout series.\n\nIf you're unfamiliar, the Yakuza series follows a notorious gangster named Kazuma Kiryu, also known by his nickname The Dragon of Dojima. Most of the series chronicles Kiryu's rise in Japan's largest criminal organization, the Tojo Clan, and then his unsuccessful efforts to leave the Yakuza life. From the initial details, it seems the show will adapt the events of the first game across six episodes. Just like the game, the story will have a time jump, taking place in 1995 and then 2005.\n\nWhat makes Yakuza such a perfect fit for television, is that the series is already structured like a serialized drama. Yakuza bears a ton of similarities to shows like Tokyo Vice or even The Sopranos, with stories that play out across decades and show how not only the characters change, but the city and society around them also changes. A huge theme of the series, especially in recent years, is how the modern world is leaving these Yakuza behind, and they struggle to find meaningful life outside of the criminal underworld.\n\nThat's an inherently compelling setup that leads to some fascinating character explorations. Like with The Sopranos, Kiryu and the rest of the cast are highly complex and emotional characters, not just stoic gangsters. The series drama-laden stories explore the nature of humanity, how people use physical force as a crutch, and finding your place in the world.\n\nTheese are all themes perfectly fit for a big-budget television show, but the real challenge Amazon's Yakuza faces, is threading the needle between the series' high-intensity drama and goofy humor. Yakuza is notorious for its completely off-the-wall humor, much of which is displayed in side quests. This is the series that has you helping a dominatrix learn how to be more assertive, and fight a rogue chimpanzee driving a construction vehicle.\n\nYakuza's unique blend of the serious and absurd is what gives the series its soul, and it's absolutely vital that the television series captures the right tone. But again, that's what makes the promise of an adaption so tantalizing. Earlier this year, Amazon's Fallout series just perfectly managed to capture the gleeful chaos of that game series perfectly, while still managing to weave an emotional story.\n\nWith Like a Dragon: Yakuza, the team behind the adaption certainly inspires confidence that it'll be done right. The series is directed by Japanese director Masaharu Take, best known for pulpy films like 100 Yen Love. Kiryu is being played by Ryoma Takeuchi, who's probably best known for appearing in a number of Kamen Rider projects, including playing the main character of Kamen Rider Drive. That dynamic duo has the chops needed to bring Yakuza to life, with both the director and main actor having a wealth of experience in bringing both serious and silly ideas to life.\n\nIn a press release for the show's announcement, executive producer of the Yakuza series Masayoshi Yokoyama says, \"Since the day I first put pen to paper on the original Yakuza's script, I've never once thought about revisiting any of my work on the series. It's because I understand all too well the challenges and hardships that come with remaking a finished title. However, if I were ever sent to the past through some kind of cosmic joke, this is the experience I'd want to create.\"\n\nWhile a creator is obviously going to want to speak positively about any upcoming experience, Yokoyama has been with the Yakuza franchise every step of the way. Seeing his praise, and even involvement, is yet another good sign. Ultimately, if this adaption manages to land things right it shows that Amazon \"gets\" how to make good video game adaptions, involving the game's creators in integral ways, while providing directors and actors room to bring their own interpretations. With Yakuza we dont know how intimately Yokoyama was involved, and likey wont until the show premieres, but this at least shows the creative forces behind the new series care about his input.\n\nThe serialized structure of Yakuza and its trademark brand of humor should have a seamless transition to prestige TV. It's practically a match made in heaven. If things, somehow, go awry, it won't be the source material's fault.", "source": {"uri": "inverse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inverse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fallout (series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yakuza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechagodzilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mechagodzilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangster", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gangster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Organized crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yakuza (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuma_Kiryu", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kazuma Kiryu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sonic the Hedgehog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_plc", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Future plc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Last of Us"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sopranos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyberpunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden Age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_following", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cult following"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sega"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Vice_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Vice (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryoma_Takeuchi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryoma Takeuchi"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable_Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable Television", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Gamebooks", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Gamebooks", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Web", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Web", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2024/6/4/9c31f4fa/yakuza.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622383", "eventUri": "eng-9622383", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-25", "textStart": 438, "textEnd": 448}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Amazon Prime Video has suddenly announced a live-action adaptation of the famed Yakuza: Like a Dragon series, though their show will just be called Dragon: Yakuza. I guess the original had too many words.\n\nWhat's wild about this is not necessarily that it's a live-action video game adaptation. We're racking up quite a few of those now, including Amazon's own blockbuster Fallout series, but that the show already has a director and lead star announced, and a pair of release dates later this year. Here's what we know:\n\nSo yes, I do find it pretty strange this show was announced out of nowhere and is already a little over four months away from release. Not that I'm complaining, this is just not how this sort of thing usually works. IGN has a longer look at the storyline, which is not an exact adaptation of the first game, but a \"loose inspiration.\" Here's what we know:\n\n\"It will be set mainly in the Kamurocho entertainment district, straight from the games, and follows Kiryu and three of his childhood friends in two time periods, 1995 and 2005.\n\nSimilar to the games, protagonist Kiryu is described in the show's press release as a \"fearsome and peerless Yakuza warrior with a strong sense of justice, duty, and humanity\", and the story will deal with the repercussions of his actions in the two time periods. Takeuchi commented that the show will include \"intense fighting scenes\", alluding to the wild action the series is famed for.\"\n\nThe series was announced at a press conference at a hotel in Tokyo, and apparently one of the reasons Takeachi was cast was because he is well, pretty large. He's 6'1 and got very jacked for the role, and according to director Take, he did all his own stunts and fightwork for the series:\n\n\"Having someone with such a large physical presence as Takeuchi makes all the difference. I understood that he knows his body better than anyone, so I left it to him to get into shape. Takeuchi did all the action himself as well. It was impressive.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether this is meant to be a miniseries or ongoing series, but I would bet the latter, given how much Amazon wants to find new hits, and video game adaptations are proving to be profitable. Yakuza has a huge wealth of content to mine across multiple games, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this goes.

The second half will air on November 1, 2024. There will be subtitled and dubbed versions of the show. It'll take place between two time periods -- 1995 and 2005 -- and follow both Kiryu's childhood and his adult life in the yakuza.\n\nMasaharu Take (100 Yen Film) and Kengo Takimoto (Kamen Teacher) are the directors. As mentioned earlier, Takeuchi will be Kiryu, the protagonist and the Dragon of Dojima. Takeuchi's known for his role as Shinnosuke Tomari, the main character of Kamen Rider Drive. He also starred in Love You as the World Ends as Hibiki Mamiya, and voice-acted as Tim Goodman (Justice Smith) in Detective Pikachu.\n\nBecause of the two time periods above, it seems that Like a Dragon: Yakuza on Amazon Prime will also cover the events of the first Yakuza game. The Like a Dragon film (Takashi Miike) which came out in 2007 also focused on that entry. This film had a somewhat comedic and campy tone to it, though. So this upcoming live-action series seems to be a more grounded adaptation. According to Masayoshi Yokoyama (head of RGG Studio and executive producer), the games let you see the world through a subjective lens, this show will let you experience the events from an objective perspective.", "source": {"uri": "siliconera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Siliconera"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephanie_liu@siliconera.com", "name": "Stephanie Liu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yakuza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamen_Teacher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamen Teacher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakuza_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yakuza (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective_Pikachu_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detective Pikachu (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamen_Rider_Drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamen Rider Drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justice Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamen_Rider_Hibiki", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamen Rider Hibiki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takashi_Miike", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Takashi Miike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_(style)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Camp (style)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Dragon_Boating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Dragon Boating", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.siliconera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/like-a-dragon-yakuza-series-06032024.jpg?fit=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622383", "eventUri": "eng-9622383", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Andrew Murrison signed off a written answer to fellow Tory MP Mark Pritchard which was published less than 24 hours after the prime minister had dramatically called a snap election. The response from a seasoned minister has been highlighted after there was a furious backlash to the Tory plan revealed overnight to reintroduce National Service for school leavers. National Service was scrapped in 1963 but now, if they win power again, school leavers would be given the option of joining the military and getting paid or doing voluntary service for nothing. There are concerns that the government is seeking a way of filling gaps in jobs with cheap unskilled labour with the scheme and it drew criticism from a number of quarters. In his response, Mr Murrison warned: \u201cThe demanding, increasingly technical, nature of defence today is such that we require highly trained, professional men and women in our Regular and Reserve Armed Forces, fully committed to giving their best in defending our country and its allies. \u201cIf potentially unwilling National Service recruits were to be obliged to serve alongside the professional men and women of our Armed Forces, it could damage morale, recruitment and retention and would consume professional military and naval resources. \u201cIf, on the other hand, National Service recruits were kept in separate units, it would be difficult to find a proper and meaningful role for them, potentially harming motivation and discipline. For all these reasons, there are no current plans for the restoration of any form of National Service.\u201d The public sector union Unison suggested that the Conservatives were trying to find a way of filling job vacancies on the cheap as the government tries to stem the flow of immigration. Unison general secretary Christina McAneasaid: \u201cEssential services need proper resourcing and enough decently paid staff to deliver for the public. Not thousands of reluctant teen \u2018volunteers\u2019 who\u2019d rather be anywhere else and would require supervision by an already overstretched workforce.\u201d There was also a row over how the scheme will be funded with fury that the Conservatives plan to raid the cash for \u201clevelling-up\u201d in the Shared Prosperity Fund to fund their new National Service plan. This was after Mr Sunak's own North Yorkshire council received \u00a316.9million from the fund and Home Secretary James Cleverly\u2019s Braintree constituency got \u00a31.6million from it despite neither seat being a Red Wall area of deprivation. Lib Dem local government spokesperson Helen Morgan said: \u201cThe fact they are planning to slash local funding to pay for these ludicrous plans shows just how out of touch the Conservative party has become.\u201d Historian Glen O\u2019Hara blasted: \u201cThe Tories have abandoned Levelling Up tonight, abandoned coastal Britain, abandoned North Wales, abandoned Cornwall and all those areas they promised wouldn't lose out from Brexit. Are they out of their minds?\u201d Under the Conservatives' new proposal, young people would be given a choice between a full-time placement in the armed forces for 12 months or spending one weekend a month for a year \"volunteering\" in their community, the Tories said. The Prime Minister said the policy would help unite society in an \"increasingly uncertain world\" and give young people a \"shared sense of purpose\". In an apparent pitch to older voters, he said volunteering could include helping local fire, police and NHS services as well as charities tackling loneliness and supporting elderly, isolated people. Home Secretary James Cleverly confirmed that teenagers would not be jailed for refusing to take part in the proposed scheme. Mr Cleverly said the plans were aimed at getting young people \"out of their bubble\" and would not involve the threat of criminal sanctions for those who refuse to comply. Labour criticised the scheme with shadow work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall branding the announcement a \"headline-grabbing gimmick\". Nigel Farage described it as a \u201cdesperate attempt to win back voters from Reform\u201d. An analysis shows that to train 10,000 National Service volunteers in the army would need the creation of 432 battalions based on 72 trainees per company and six battalions per company. One estimate suggests that to staff training units would require 750 officers and 5,000 NCO\u2019s to staff these unit at a cost of around \u00a3311million a year alone. There were also concerns that the scheme is another way of punishing a generation which already had to make terrible sacrifices during the covid pandemic lockdown. Sam Bidwell, director of the Next Generation Centre at the right-wing Adam Smith Institute think-tank said: \u201cYoung Britons have already done their fair share of national service, sacrificing the best years of their lives to protect the elderly from Covid. That\u2019s not to mention our broken economy.\u201d There is some nervousness that the scheme could be a genuine preparation for war and conscription with fighting in Europe after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukrane and ongoing problems in the Middle East. Last year the head of the British army General Sir Patrick Sanders said: \u201cAs the pre-war generation, we must similarly prepare. That is a whole-of-nation undertaking.\u201d And, in words that have sent flurries of anxiety up and down the land, he also referred to the need for an army \u201cdesigned to expand rapidly\u2026 to train and equip the citizen army that must follow\u201d.", "summary": "<p>Rishi Sunak\u2019s proposal to reintroduce National Service 61 years after it was scrapped has created a backlash </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/national-service-rishi-sunak-army-general-election-b2551827.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/26/17/7cdcfde91e72eb57bc148bf068fad83aY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE2ODIzMTY2-2.75976111.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/rxlRLjEX-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-26 17:00:48", "author": "David Maddox", "authors": ["David Maddox"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.376}

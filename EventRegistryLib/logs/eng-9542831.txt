The phase 1/2 trial called BRILLIANCE, was led by principal investigator Eric Pierce, MD, PhD, of Mass Eye and Ear, a member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system, and sponsored by Editas Medicine, Inc. Findings are reported May 6th in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThis research demonstrates that CRISPR gene therapy for inherited vision loss is worth continued pursuit in research and clinical trials. While more research is needed to determine who may benefit most, we consider the early results promising. To hear from several participants how thrilled they were that they could finally see the food on their plates -that is a big deal. These were individuals who could not read any lines on an eye chart and who had no treatment options, which is the unfortunate reality for most people with inherited retinal disorders.\"\n\nEric Pierce, MD, PhD, Director of Ocular Genomics Institute and Berman-Gund Laboratory for the Study of Retinal Degenerations at Mass Eye and Ear and Harvard Medical School\n\nAll 14 trial participants, including 12 adults (ages 17 to 63) and two children (ages 10 and 14), were born with a form of Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) caused by mutations in the centrosomal protein 290 (CEP290) gene. They underwent a single injection of a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing medicine, EDIT-101 in one eye via a specialized surgical procedure. This trial, which included the first patient to ever receive a CRISPR-based investigational medicine directly inside the body, focused primarily on safety with a secondary analysis for efficacy.\n\nNo serious treatment or procedure-related adverse events were reported, nor were there any dose-limiting toxicities. For efficacy, the researchers looked at four measures: best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA); dark-adapted full-field stimulus testing (FST), visual function navigation (VNC, as measured by a maze participants completed), and vision-related quality of life.\n\nEleven participants demonstrated improvements in at least one of those outcomes, while six demonstrated improvement in two or more. Four participants had clinically meaningful improvement in BCVA. Six participants experienced meaningful improvements in cone-mediated vision as indicated by FSTs, five of whom had improvements in at least one of the three other outcomes. Cone photoreceptors are used for daytime and central vision.\n\n\"The results from the BRILLIANCE trial provide proof of concept and important learnings for the development of new and innovative medicines for inherited retinal diseases. We've demonstrated that we can safely deliver a CRISPR-based gene editing therapeutic to the retina and have clinically meaningful outcomes,\" said Baisong Mei, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Editas Medicine.\n\nStudies like this one show the promise of gene therapy for treating incurable conditions. Mass General Brigham's Gene and Cell Therapy Institute is helping to translate scientific discoveries made by researchers into first-in-human clinical trials and, ultimately, life-changing treatments for patients.\n\nExploring CRISPR as an inherited retinal disorder treatment\n\nMutations in the CEP290 gene are the leading cause of inherited blindness taking place during the first decade of life. The mutations cause rod and cone photoceptors in the eye's retina to function improperly, which after some time will lead to irreversible vision loss. Pierce compares it to a small part of an engine breaking down, which eventually leads the entire engine to falter.\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing toolkit that acts as a GPS-guided scissor to cut a portion of the mutated genome to leave a functional gene. For inherited blindness, the goal was to inject CRISPR to reach the eye's retina to restore the ability to produce the gene and protein responsible for light-sensing cells.\n\nThe CEP290 gene is larger than what traditional adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector gene therapies, including one FDA-approved for a different type of inherited vision loss, can accommodate. The genome editing company Editas Medicine began exploring how to tackle the CEP290 mutation in 2014, conducting preclinical studies to determine whether a gene editing approach like CRISPR-Cas9 might be feasible to target these large gene mutations. This work led to the BRILLIANCE trial, which began in mid-2019.\n\nThe first patient to receive a CRISPR treatment inside the body (in vivo) took place at the Casey Eye Institute at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), under the leadership of Mark Pennesi, MD, PhD.\n\n\"This trial shows CRISPR gene editing has exciting potential to treat inherited retinal degeneration,\" Pennesi said. \"There is nothing more rewarding to a physician than hearing a patient describe how their vision has improved after a treatment. One of our trial participants has shared several examples, including being able to find their phone after misplacing it and knowing that their coffee machine is working by seeing its small lights. While these types of tasks might seem trivial to those who are normally sighted, such improvements can have a huge impact on quality of life for those with low vision.\"\n\nThe second patient was treated at Mass Eye and Ear in September 2020, following delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional participants were treated across three other trial sites: Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, W.K. Kellogg Eye Center, and Scheie Eye Institute at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Two adults received low-dose therapy, five received mid-dose, and another five received a high-dose treatment. Two children, treated at CHOP under the leadership of Tomas S. Aleman, MD, received a mid-dose treatment.\n\n\"Our patients are the first congenitally blind children to be treated with gene-editing, which significantly improved their daytime vision. Our hope is that the study will pave the road for treatments of younger children with similar conditions and further improvements in vision,\" said Aleman, the Irene Heinz-Given and John LaPorte Research Professor in Ophthalmology at Penn Medicine with the Scheie Eye Institute and a pediatric ophthalmologist at CHOP who served as a site principal investigator and study co-author. \"This trial represents a landmark in the treatment of genetic diseases, in specific, genetic blindness, by offering an important alternative treatment, when traditional forms of gene therapy, such as gene augmentation, are not an option.\"\n\nParticipants were monitored every three months for one year, and then followed less frequently for two additional years. At visits, they would undergo a series of serum and vision tests to examine safety and efficacy outcome measures.\n\nIn November 2022, Editas paused enrollment on the BRILLIANCE trial. Pierce and colleagues are exploring working with other commercial partners to conduct additional trials, in collaboration with Editas. The researchers hope future studies can examine ideal dosing, whether a treatment effect is more pronounced in certain age groups such as younger patients, and include refined endpoints to measure the effects of improved cone function on activities of daily living.\n\nMass Eye and Ear\n\nJournal reference:\n\nPierce, E.

The phase 1/2 trial called BRILLIANCE, was led by principal investigator Eric Pierce, MD, PhD, of Mass Eye and Ear, a member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system, and sponsored by Editas Medicine, Inc. Findings are reported May 6th in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n\"This research demonstrates that CRISPR gene therapy for inherited vision loss is worth continued pursuit in research and clinical trials,\" said Pierce, director of Ocular Genomics Institute and Berman-Gund Laboratory for the Study of Retinal Degenerations at Mass Eye and Ear and Harvard Medical School. \"While more research is needed to determine who may benefit most, we consider the early results promising. To hear from several participants how thrilled they were that they could finally see the food on their plates -that is a big deal. These were individuals who could not read any lines on an eye chart and who had no treatment options, which is the unfortunate reality for most people with inherited retinal disorders.\"\n\nAll 14 trial participants, including 12 adults (ages 17 to 63) and two children (ages 10 and 14), were born with a form of Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) caused by mutations in the centrosomal protein 290 (CEP290) gene. They underwent a single injection of a CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing medicine, EDIT-101 in one eye via a specialized surgical procedure. This trial, which included the first patient to ever receive a CRISPR-based investigational medicine directly inside the body, focused primarily on safety with a secondary analysis for efficacy.\n\nNo serious treatment or procedure-related adverse events were reported, nor were there any dose-limiting toxicities. For efficacy, the researchers looked at four measures: best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA); dark-adapted full-field stimulus testing (FST), visual function navigation (VNC, as measured by a maze participants completed), and vision-related quality of life.\n\nEleven participants demonstrated improvements in at least one of those outcomes, while six demonstrated improvement in two or more. Four participants had clinically meaningful improvement in BCVA. Six participants experienced meaningful improvements in cone-mediated vision as indicated by FSTs, five of whom had improvements in at least one of the three other outcomes. Cone photoreceptors are used for daytime and central vision.\n\n\"The results from the BRILLIANCE trial provide proof of concept and important learnings for the development of new and innovative medicines for inherited retinal diseases. We've demonstrated that we can safely deliver a CRISPR-based gene editing therapeutic to the retina and have clinically meaningful outcomes,\" said Baisong Mei, MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer, Editas Medicine.\n\nStudies like this one show the promise of gene therapy for treating incurable conditions. Mass General Brigham's Gene and Cell Therapy Institute is helping to translate scientific discoveries made by researchers into first-in-human clinical trials and, ultimately, life-changing treatments for patients.\n\nExploring CRISPR as an inherited retinal disorder treatment\n\nMutations in the CEP290 gene are the leading cause of inherited blindness taking place during the first decade of life. The mutations cause rod and cone photoceptors in the eye's retina to function improperly, which after some time will lead to irreversible vision loss. Pierce compares it to a small part of an engine breaking down, which eventually leads the entire engine to falter.\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing toolkit that acts as a GPS-guided scissor to cut a portion of the mutated genome to leave a functional gene. For inherited blindness, the goal was to inject CRISPR to reach the eye's retina to restore the ability to produce the gene and protein responsible for light-sensing cells.\n\nThe CEP290 gene is larger than what traditional adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector gene therapies, including one FDA-approved for a different type of inherited vision loss, can accommodate. The genome editing company Editas Medicine began exploring how to tackle the CEP290 mutation in 2014, conducting preclinical studies to determine whether a gene editing approach like CRISPR-Cas9 might be feasible to target these large gene mutations. This work led to the BRILLIANCE trial, which began in mid-2019.\n\nThe first patient to receive a CRISPR treatment inside the body (in vivo) took place at the Casey Eye Institute at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), under the leadership of Mark Pennesi, MD, PhD.\n\n\"This trial shows CRISPR gene editing has exciting potential to treat inherited retinal degeneration,\" Pennesi said. \"There is nothing more rewarding to a physician than hearing a patient describe how their vision has improved after a treatment. One of our trial participants has shared several examples, including being able to find their phone after misplacing it and knowing that their coffee machine is working by seeing its small lights. While these types of tasks might seem trivial to those who are normally sighted, such improvements can have a huge impact on quality of life for those with low vision.\"\n\nThe second patient was treated at Mass Eye and Ear in September 2020, following delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional participants were treated across three other trial sites: Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, W.K. Kellogg Eye Center, and Scheie Eye Institute at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Two adults received low-dose therapy, five received mid-dose, and another five received a high-dose treatment. Two children, treated at CHOP under the leadership of Tomas S. Aleman, MD, received a mid-dose treatment.\n\n\"Our patients are the first congenitally blind children to be treated with gene-editing, which significantly improved their daytime vision. Our hope is that the study will pave the road for treatments of younger children with similar conditions and further improvements in vision,\" said Aleman, the Irene Heinz-Given and John LaPorte Research Professor in Ophthalmology at Penn Medicine with the Scheie Eye Institute and a pediatric ophthalmologist at CHOP who served as a site principal investigator and study co-author. \"This trial represents a landmark in the treatment of genetic diseases, in specific, genetic blindness, by offering an important alternative treatment, when traditional forms of gene therapy, such as gene augmentation, are not an option.\"\n\nParticipants were monitored every three months for one year, and then followed less frequently for two additional years. At visits, they would undergo a series of serum and vision tests to examine safety and efficacy outcome measures.\n\nIn November 2022, Editas paused enrollment on the BRILLIANCE trial. Pierce and colleagues are exploring working with other commercial partners to conduct additional trials, in collaboration with Editas. The researchers hope future studies can examine ideal dosing, whether a treatment effect is more pronounced in certain age groups such as younger patients, and include refined endpoints to measure the effects of improved cone function on activities of daily living.\n\nAuthorship: The senior corresponding author of this study was Eric A.

Mass General Brigham's Gene and Cell Therapy Institute is helping to translate scientific discoveries made by researchers into first-in-human clinical trials and, ultimately, life-changing treatments for patients.\n\nExploring CRISPR as an inherited retinal disorder treatment\n\nMutations in the CEP290 gene are the leading cause of inherited blindness taking place during the first decade of life. The mutations cause rod and cone photoceptors in the eye's retina to function improperly, which after some time will lead to irreversible vision loss. Pierce compares it to a small part of an engine breaking down, which eventually leads the entire engine to falter.\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing toolkit that acts as a GPS-guided scissor to cut a portion of the mutated genome to leave a functional gene. For inherited blindness, the goal was to inject CRISPR to reach the eye's retina to restore the ability to produce the gene and protein responsible for light-sensing cells.\n\nThe CEP290 gene is larger than what traditional adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector gene therapies, including one FDA-approved for a different type of inherited vision loss, can accommodate.\n\nThe genome editing company Editas Medicine began exploring how to tackle the CEP290 mutation in 2014, conducting preclinical studies to determine whether a gene editing approach like CRISPR-Cas9 might be feasible to target these large gene mutations. This work led to the BRILLIANCE trial, which began in mid-2019.\n\nThe first patient to receive a CRISPR treatment inside the body (in vivo) took place at the Casey Eye Institute at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), under the leadership of Mark Pennesi, MD, PhD.\n\n\"This trial shows CRISPR gene editing has exciting potential to treat inherited retinal degeneration,\" Pennesi said. \"There is nothing more rewarding to a physician than hearing a patient describe how their vision has improved after a treatment.\n\n\" One of our trial participants has shared several examples, including being able to find their phone after misplacing it and knowing that their coffee machine is working by seeing its small lights. While these types of tasks might seem trivial to those who are normally sighted, such improvements can have a huge impact on quality of life for those with low vision.\"\n\nThe second patient was treated at Mass Eye and Ear in September 2020, following delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional participants were treated across three other trial sites: Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, W.K. Kellogg Eye Center, and Scheie Eye Institute at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nTwo adults received low-dose therapy, five received mid-dose, and another five received a high-dose treatment. Two children, treated at CHOP under the leadership of Tomas S. Aleman, MD, received a mid-dose treatment.\n\n\"Our patients are the first congenitally blind children to be treated with gene-editing, which significantly improved their daytime vision.\n\n\" Our hope is that the study will pave the road for treatments of younger children with similar conditions and further improvements in vision,\" said Aleman, the Irene Heinz-Given and John LaPorte Research Professor in Ophthalmology at Penn Medicine with the Scheie Eye Institute and a pediatric ophthalmologist at CHOP who served as a site principal investigator and study co-author.\n\n\"This trial represents a landmark in the treatment of genetic diseases, in specific, genetic blindness, by offering an important alternative treatment, when traditional forms of gene therapy, such as gene augmentation, are not an option.\"\n\nParticipants were monitored every three months for one year, and then followed less frequently for two additional years. At visits, they would undergo a series of serum and vision tests to examine safety and efficacy outcome measures.\n\nIn November 2022, Editas paused enrollment on the BRILLIANCE trial. Pierce and colleagues are exploring working with other commercial partners to conduct additional trials, in collaboration with Editas.\n\nThe researchers hope future studies can examine ideal dosing, whether a treatment effect is more pronounced in certain age groups such as younger patients, and include refined endpoints to measure the effects of improved cone function on activities of daily living.\n\nAuthorship: The senior corresponding author of this study was Eric A.

Mass General Brigham's Gene and Cell Therapy Institute is helping to translate scientific discoveries made by researchers into first-in-human clinical trials and, ultimately, life-changing treatments for patients.\n\nExploring CRISPR as an inherited retinal disorder treatment\n\nMutations in the CEP290 gene are the leading cause of inherited blindness taking place during the first decade of life. The mutations cause rod and cone photoceptors in the eye's retina to function improperly, which after some time will lead to irreversible vision loss. Pierce compares it to a small part of an engine breaking down, which eventually leads the entire engine to falter.\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 is a gene editing toolkit that acts as a GPS-guided scissor to cut a portion of the mutated genome to leave a functional gene. For inherited blindness, the goal was to inject CRISPR to reach the eye's retina to restore the ability to produce the gene and protein responsible for light-sensing cells.\n\nThe CEP290 gene is larger than what traditional adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector gene therapies, including one FDA-approved for a different type of inherited vision loss, can accommodate. The genome editing company Editas Medicine began exploring how to tackle the CEP290 mutation in 2014, conducting preclinical studies to determine whether a gene editing approach like CRISPR-Cas9 might be feasible to target these large gene mutations. This work led to the BRILLIANCE trial, which began in mid-2019.\n\nThe first patient to receive a CRISPR treatment inside the body (in vivo) took place at the Casey Eye Institute at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), under the leadership of Mark Pennesi, MD, PhD.\n\n\"This trial shows CRISPR gene editing has exciting potential to treat inherited retinal degeneration,\" Pennesi said. \"There is nothing more rewarding to a physician than hearing a patient describe how their vision has improved after a treatment. One of our trial participants has shared several examples, including being able to find their phone after misplacing it and knowing that their coffee machine is working by seeing its small lights. While these types of tasks might seem trivial to those who are normally sighted, such improvements can have a huge impact on quality of life for those with low vision.\"\n\nThe second patient was treated at Mass Eye and Ear in September 2020, following delays caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional participants were treated across three other trial sites: Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, W.K. Kellogg Eye Center, and Scheie Eye Institute at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. Two adults received low-dose therapy, five received mid-dose, and another five received a high-dose treatment. Two children, treated at CHOP under the leadership of Tomas S. Aleman, MD, received a mid-dose treatment.\n\n\"Our patients are the first congenitally blind children to be treated with gene-editing, which significantly improved their daytime vision. Our hope is that the study will pave the road for treatments of younger children with similar conditions and further improvements in vision,\" said Aleman, the Irene Heinz-Given and John LaPorte Research Professor in Ophthalmology at Penn Medicine with the Scheie Eye Institute and a pediatric ophthalmologist at CHOP who served as a site principal investigator and study co-author. \"This trial represents a landmark in the treatment of genetic diseases, in specific, genetic blindness, by offering an important alternative treatment, when traditional forms of gene therapy, such as gene augmentation, are not an option.\"\n\nParticipants were monitored every three months for one year, and then followed less frequently for two additional years. At visits, they would undergo a series of serum and vision tests to examine safety and efficacy outcome measures.\n\nIn November 2022, Editas paused enrollment on the BRILLIANCE trial. Pierce and colleagues are exploring working with other commercial partners to conduct additional trials, in collaboration with Editas. The researchers hope future studies can examine ideal dosing, whether a treatment effect is more pronounced in certain age groups such as younger patients, and include refined endpoints to measure the effects of improved cone function on activities of daily living.\n\nAuthorship: The senior corresponding author of this study was Eric A.

Now, new trial results show about 79% of the 14 trial's participants with a rare form of inherited blindness had measurable improvement after receiving an experimental, CRISPR-based gene editing treatment. (OHSU/Kristyna Wentz-Graff)\n\nAbout 79% of clinical trial participants experienced measurable improvement after receiving experimental, CRISPR-based gene editing that is designed to fix a rare form of blindness, according to a paper published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nMark Pennesi, M.D., Ph.D. (OHSU)\n\n\"This trial shows CRISPR gene editing has exciting potential to treat inherited retinal degeneration,\" said Mark Pennesi, M.D., Ph.D., a corresponding author on the paper, an ophthalmologist and Oregon Health & Science University's lead scientist for the Phase 1/2 BRILLIANCE trial. \"There is nothing more rewarding to a physician than hearing a patient describe how their vision has improved after a treatment. One of our trial participants has shared several examples, including being able to find their phone after misplacing it and knowing that their coffee machine is working by seeing its small lights.\n\n\"While these types of tasks might seem trivial to those who are normally sighted, such improvements can have a huge impact on quality of life for those with low vision.\"\n\nThe BRILLIANCE trial evaluated the safety and effectiveness of EDIT-101, an experimental gene editing treatment developed by Editas Medicine that uses CRISPR technology. The experimental treatment was designed to edit a mutation in the CEP290 gene, which provides instructions to create a protein that is critical for sight.\n\nPeople with this gene mutation have a rare condition that is commonly called Leber Congenital Amaurosis, or LCA, Type 10, for which there is currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment. LCA's various types occur in about 2 or 3 out of 100,000 newborns.\n\nLearn more about how OHSU is a leader in eye health care and research.\n\nThe OHSU Casey Eye Institute treated the trial's first participant in early 2020. That procedure also marked the first time that CRISPR had been used to edit genes within the human body, called in vivo gene editing.\n\nThe new paper describes the study's findings through February 2023 and details how the trial's 14 participants -- 12 adults and two children -- responded to receiving EDIT-101 in one eye. Key results include:\n\n11 participants, about 79%, showed improvement in at least one of four measured outcomes.6 participants, about 43%, showed improvement in two or more outcomes.6 participants, about 43%, reported improved vision-related quality of life.4 participants, about 29%, had clinically meaningful improvement in visual acuity, or how well they could identify objects or letters on a chart.There were no serious adverse events related to the treatment.Most adverse events were mild or moderate, and all have since been resolved.\n\nFour specific outcomes were used to evaluate the experimental treatment's effectiveness:\n\nVisual acuityHow well participants saw colored points of light while looking into a specialized device, which scientists call a full-field testHow well participants navigated a research maze with physical objects and varying amounts of lightHow much participants reported experiencing improved quality of life Further research for a future treatment\n\nIn November 2022, trial sponsor Editas Medicine announced that it was pausing the trial's enrollment and would seek another partner to continue the experimental therapy's development. Pennesi and colleagues are exploring working with other commercial partners to conduct additional trials, in collaboration with Editas. The researchers hope future studies can examine ideal dosing, whether a treatment effect is more pronounced in certain age groups such as younger patients, and include refined endpoints to measure impacts on activities of daily living.\n\n\"This research demonstrates that CRISPR gene therapy for inherited vision loss is worth continued pursuit in research and clinical trials,\" said Mass Eye & Ear ophthalmologist Eric Pierce, M.D., Ph.D., who is also a corresponding author. \"While more research is needed to determine who may benefit most, we consider the early results promising. To hear from several participants how thrilled they were that they could finally see the food on their plates -- that is a big deal. These were individuals who could not read any lines on an eye chart and who had no treatment options, which is the unfortunate reality for most people with inherited retinal disorders.\"\n\n\"Our patients are the first congenitally blind children to be treated with gene editing, which significantly improved their daytime vision,\" said the paper's third corresponding author, Tomas S. Aleman, M.D., a pediatric ophthalmologist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania's Scheie Eye Institute. \"Our hope is that the study will pave the road for treatments of younger children with similar conditions and further improvements in vision. This trial represents a landmark in the treatment of genetic disease, in specific genetic blindness, by offering important alternative treatment when traditional forms of therapy, such as gene augmentation, are not an option.\"\n\n\"The results from the BRILLIANCE trial provide proof of concept and important learnings for the development of new and innovative medicines for inherited retinal diseases. We've demonstrated that we can safely deliver a CRISPR-based gene editing therapeutic to the retina and have clinically meaningful outcomes,\" said Editas Medicine Chief Medical Officer Baisong Mei, M.D., Ph.D.\n\nThe OHSU Casey Eye Institute is one of five clinical sites that recruited participants for the trial. The other sites are: Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in Miami, Florida; Mass Eye and Ear in Boston, Massachusetts; Scheie Eye Institute at the University of Pennsylvania and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia; and Kellogg Eye Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nMore information is also available from Mass Eye and Ear.\n\nREFERENCE: Eric A.

It included 12 adults and 2 children, who had a rare form of inherited blindness, known as Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA). LCA affects about one in 40,000 people and causes severe vision loss at an early age.\n\nBlindness in LCA is caused by a gene mutation that prevents a protein from functioning properly. That protein -- CEP290 -- is critical for sight.\n\nParticipants in the study received a single dose of a CRISPR gene therapy called EDIT-101.\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 is considered a precise way of altering DNA. It cuts out specific strands of DNA -- the thing that makes us who we are -- and replaces them with a new strands.\n\nIn the case of EDIT-101, the treatment cuts out the mutation in CEP290 and inserts a healthy strand of DNA back into the gene. This restores normal function of the protein CEP290, allowing the retina to detect light.\n\nEmmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna were awarded the 2020 Chemistry Nobel Prize for discovering CRISPR-cas9.\n\nThe BRILLIANCE study tested how well the participants could see colored lights, navigate a small maze in varying amounts of light and read from a chart after receiving the treatment.\n\nAlmost all of the participants, except three, showed some level of visual improvements. Six participants had major improvements in vision-related quality of life and could identify objects and letters on a chart.\n\nAccording to the researchers, EDIT-101 caused no serious adverse side effects in participants. Some patients reported mild adverse effects which resolved quickly.\n\nMore than two hundred people have been treated with experimental CRISPR technologies. But so far, only one CRISPR treatment has been approved for clinical use -- Casgevy, a treatment for sickle-cell disease -- which has been available in the US, EU, and UK since December 2023.\n\nScientists say they are entering a new phase in genome editing technologies, in which they say they can help and cure patients with a variety of diseases -- not just treat them.

It was as if she was watching the world through a straw hole, and in dimly lit places, she could not make out people's faces, only their silhouettes.\n\nBut after receiving an experimental gene-editing treatment to one of her eyes, she now can see things she never saw before.\n\nCook was born with an inherited retinal disorder that causes blindness, a rare type of eye disorder historically called Leber congenital amaurosis or LCA. A few years ago, she decided to participate in a clinical trial that involved using the gene-editing tool CRISPR to correct the form of inherited blindness that she has.\n\n\"My life has mostly changed in terms of being hopeful that there is going to be more science and findings in the future,\" said Cook, 22, who is currently studying marketing and product development at Missouri State University in Springfield. She received the experimental gene-editing treatment through a surgery performed on her left eye.\n\n\"Now, post-surgery and post recovery, I am able to see in dimmer lighting with my left eye,\" Cook said.\n\nA treatment that used CRISPR was found to be safe and efficacious in improving vision among a small sample of patients with inherited blindness in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial that Cook participated in. Inherited retinal degenerations are a leading cause of blindness around the world.\n\nAmong a total of 14 volunteers, including Cook, the gene-editing tool was found to be associated with a \"meaningful improvement\" in vision for most patients around three months later and it was not directly tied to any serious side effects, according to the trial results, published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The therapy remains experimental and the results need to be replicated in a larger group of people.\n\nMonths following the treatment, Cook was sitting with friends on a balcony that had Christmas lights wrapped around the railing. It was dusk, she recalled, yet she could see her friends' faces glow under the twinkling Christmas lights. She was shocked.\n\n\"With my right eye, I was not able to see their facial features. I was only able to see their silhouette. With my left eye, I could see everything on their face - so, significant difference, especially in the dim lighting,\" Cook said about that evening.\n\n\"One of the biggest 'aha moments' that I had was I had been talking to my mom one day after the surgery - it was about six to nine months after the surgery when I noticed most of my improvement,\" Cook said.\n\n\"I could see a candle flickering behind me, which I've never seen that before,\" she said. \"I'd never picked up anything from over there before with the peripheral.\"\n\nBefore the treatment, Cook said that she sometimes could conceal the vision challenges she has had. Her limited vision often was an internal struggle.\n\n\"You wouldn't really know that my eyesight is terrible until you spend a significant amount of time with me,\" Cook said. \"If we saw each other in the street, if I introduced myself to you, you'd never know.\"\n\nBut now, she is no longer hiding.\n\nA groundbreaking 'proof of concept'\n\nThis study is the first time that CRISPR has been used in the eyes of living people.\n\n\"The results of this study provide proof of concept that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing can be used safely and effectively to treat inherited retinal disorders,\" said the study's first author Dr. Eric Pierce, director of the Ocular Genomics Institute at Mass Eye and Ear and Harvard Medical School.\n\nThe trial was funded by the biotechnology company Editas Medicine and conducted in the United States by researchers at Mass Eye and Ear of the Mass General Brigham health care system and other US-based institutions, including the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Michigan, the University of Miami, and Oregon Health & Science University.\n\n\"We're really hopeful that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technologies will now be applied to other genetic forms of inherited blindness, and indeed other genetic diseases in general,\" Pierce said. \"We're hoping this will help open the era of therapeutic use of CRISPR-Cas9 technologies.\"\n\nThe trial, which started in 2019, enrolled 12 adults, ages 17 to 63, and two children, ages 9 and 14, with inherited retinal degeneration caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene. That gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in many types of cells, including light receptor cells in the eyes. Mutations in CEP290 are the most common cause of severe early-onset retinal degeneration, which causes vision loss in children.\n\nCurrently, there is no treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for CEP290-associated inherited retinal degeneration. These patients would not be able to read any lines of letters or numbers on a vision chart that most people receive at the eye doctor, and visual impairment may worsen over time.\n\nFor the trial, the 14 participants underwent a surgical procedure in which a drug called EDIT-101 that encodes the CRISPR gene-editing components was injected under the retina of one of their eyes. Since the trial was conducted to primarily evaluate safety and efficacy, only one eye in each patient was studied.\n\n\"The subjects get an injection of the gene-editing drug, which is called EDIT-101, under their retina,\" Pierce said. \"That drug encodes the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing machinery, and once that starts working inside the retinal cells of those patients, it cuts out the mutation in CEP290 from the genome of their retinal cells, allowing the function of the CEP290 gene to be restored.\"\n\nWhen the first patients in the study were treated in 2020, it was the first time in medical history that a CRISPR-based medicine, resulting in gene-editing, was inserted directly into the living human body.\n\nAmong the adult volunteers, two were given a low dose of the medication, five were given an intermediate dose and five were given a high dose. Both of the children in the study were given the intermediate dose. The outpatient procedure took around an hour and a half.\n\nThe patients were then monitored every three months for a year and then less frequent monitoring continued for two years. In these follow-up visits, they underwent a series of vision tests among other evaluations.\n\nThe researchers found that 11 patients in the study had some type of improvement in their vision following the CRISPR therapy, and these improvements occurred about three months after the procedure and were sustained during subsequent visits.\n\nAlso, no serious side effects occurred in response to the treatment at any of the dose sizes, according to the researchers, and the adverse events that did occur were mild or moderate. There were also no signs that the CRISPR gene-editing caused ripple-effect harm to the genomes of the patients.\n\n\"The primary goal of this first in-human study was to test the safety of using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in vivo. When we started the trials, the subjects who were treated were the first patients ever to have received CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing treatments in vivo,\" Pierce said. \"There were no serious adverse events related to the treatment, or the surgery required to deliver the treatment and no dose-limiting toxicities.\"\n\nFollowing the surgery, one patient experienced some bleeding in the eye, impairing their vision, but that has since resolved, according to the researchers.\n\n\"Once that hemorrhage cleared, the subject's vision returned to baseline,\" Pierce said.\n\nAnother patient experienced vision impairment associated with small mounds observed under their retina six months after the procedure. These types of hyperreflective mounds have been seen in other studies involving subretinal gene therapies, the researchers noted, and the cause of them is not clear.\n\n\"It's thought to be inflammation,\" Pierce said about the mounds.\n\nThe patient was treated with a course of steroid medicines, according to the study, and their recovery is ongoing.\n\n\"As the mounds resolved their vision also improved,\" Pierce said. \"I think this drug was as safe as possible in terms of design.\"\n\n'It's not a panacea'\n\nComplete vision has not been restored among the patients. Most in the trial could not read any line of an eye chart prior to the study, and only four of them experienced some improvements in this ability. But some patients reported, after receiving treatment, being able to see their cell phones light up, differentiate various foods on their dinner plates, identify the spinning Apple icon on a computer screen or even noticing vibrant sunsets.\n\n\"I started to see what are described as bursts of color,\" said Michael Kalberer, 46, who received the CRISPR treatment in his right eye and first noticed improvements in his vision about two to six months later. He started the study in 2020.\n\n\"It was a pretty cool moment to see strobe lights on the dance floor of my cousin's wedding change color,\" said Kalberer, who added that if he had not received the treatment, all he would have seen on the dance floor would have been shadows and flickering lights, and he would not have been able to identify the colors.\n\nKalberer described the CRISPR treatment as \"groundbreaking,\" but warned it's not a cure.\n\n\"It's not a panacea,\" said Kalberer, who still can't see standard text or photos on a screen. \"My disease is still here. It's not gone. I'm not cured. ... But it definitely slowed the progression of it.\"\n\nPierce said that he hopes this approach to using CRISPR as a therapy for inherited blindness can be studied again in a larger and more diverse group of patients. All of the Phase 1/2 trial participants were non-Hispanic and White.\n\nIn 2022, Editas Medicine announced that it paused further studying CRISPR gene editing as a therapeutic approach for CEP290-associated inherited blindness and instead of conducting further trials, has continued to follow-up with the patients who have been treated to date.\n\nThe latest results from the Phase 1/2 trial support moving forward with a Phase 3 trial and then ultimately registering the therapy for possible FDA approval, Pierce said.\n\n\"We are working with Editas to identify an additional commercial partner for Phase 3 studies. We're actually hoping this publication will stimulate interest in the biotech and pharma communities about that,\" Pierce said.\n\nMore research over time could shed light on the long-term effects of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tools, which, now that they have been injected into patients, will be present in patients for the rest of their lives, Pierce said.\n\n\"I think the real risk that we're all concerned about with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing is: Could the gene editing machinery that we've introduced into the retinal cells of these patients do something else, somewhere else in the genome, in addition to the therapeutic activities that it was designed for?\" Pierce said.\n\n\"Could a cut in the genome be made 10 years from now, that could have an adverse effect over time? I think the answer to that is yes, it could. But we're hopeful that risk is very low,\" Pierce said. \"That's what we need additional follow-up for.\"\n\n'Quality of life matters'\n\nThe results from the Phase 1/2 trial -- and how patients experienced some improvements in vision -- are a valuable reminder of how important quality of life can be for patients, said Art Caplan, a professor of bioethics and founding head of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine's Department of Population Health.\n\n\"Usually when we're doing gene therapies or other innovative interventions, we associate them with saving lives. This experiment is a huge reminder that quality of life matters. This is about vision,\" Caplan said. \"No one's dying. No one's saved. But restoration of vision is an important achievement, and it's a reminder that quality of life has to be factored into what we decide to cover in terms of insurance, reimbursement and what we try to study.\"\n\nHe agreed with the researchers that more safety data over time would be helpful.\n\n\"They haven't really had these subjects that long with the intervention to guarantee long-term safety,\" Caplan said. \"For these kinds of genetic interventions, you have to follow them over long periods of time -- years -- to make sure that other genes weren't impacted.\"\n\nThese new Phase 1/2 trial results provide a \"building block\" for scientists to work off of in the future when developing gene therapies to treat eye disorders, said Dr. Vlad Diaconita, a retinal surgeon and assistant professor of ophthalmology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. He was not involved in the trial.\n\n\"Does this apply to the American population at large? Not right now,\" Diaconita said about the experimental treatment.\n\n\"It does, however, apply to the thousands of kids born in future years that have this particular genetic subtype. So yes, an approval of this particular gene delivery could benefit people over time,\" he said. \"It's a proof of concept that seems to be moving us in the right direction.\"\n\nDiaconita's colleague Dr. Aliaa Abdelhakim called this proof-of-concept study \"groundbreaking\" in the sense that it shows the treatment approach can be safe and result in some improvement for patients, but more research is needed on a larger scale to determine what kind of patients will benefit in the long term, and how long those improvements may last.\n\n\"We still have to wait a little longer to see if this pans out in the long-term,\" said Abdelhakim, an ophthalmologist-geneticist, retina specialist and assistant professor of ophthalmology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. She also was not involved in the trial.\n\n\"We don't know if improvements from this treatment are going to be sustained. Is their vision going to stay improved throughout their lives?\" she asked. \"The reason this is important is because this is the first time CRISPR has been used in this way, in the eye.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

It included 12 adults and 2 children, who had a rare form of inherited blindness, known as Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA). LCA affects about one in 40,000 people and causes severe vision loss at an early age.\n\nBlindness in LCA is caused by a gene mutation that prevents a protein from functioning properly. That protein -- CEP290 -- is critical for sight.\n\nParticipants in the study received a single dose of a CRISPR gene therapy called EDIT-101.\n\nCRISPR-Cas9 is considered a precise way of altering DNA. It cuts out specific strands of DNA -- the thing that makes us who we are -- and replaces them with a new strands.\n\nIn the case of EDIT-101, the treatment cuts out the mutation in CEP290 and inserts a healthy strand of DNA back into the gene. This restores normal function of the protein CEP290, allowing the retina to detect light.\n\nEmmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer A. Doudna were awarded the 2020 Chemistry Nobel Prize for discovering CRISPR-cas9.\n\nEDIT-101 gene therapy restores vision\n\nThe BRILLIANCE study tested how well the participants could see colored lights, navigate a small maze in varying amounts of light and read from a chart after receiving the treatment.\n\nAlmost all of the participants, except three, showed some level of visual improvements. Six participants had major improvements in vision-related quality of life and could identify objects and letters on a chart.\n\nAccording to the researchers, EDIT-101 caused no serious adverse side effects in participants. Some patients reported mild adverse effects which resolved quickly.\n\nThe future of CRISPR gene editing\n\nMore than two hundred people have been treated with experimental CRISPR technologies. But so far, only one CRISPR treatment has been approved for clinical use -- Casgevy, a treatment for sickle-cell disease -- which has been available in the US, EU, and UK since December 2023.\n\nScientists say they are entering a new phase in genome editing technologies, in which they say they can help and cure patients with a variety of diseases -- not just treat them. And safely.\n\nOngoing clinical trials are testing other CRISPR therapies for HIV/AIDS, diabetes, cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and antibiotic resistance.\n\nEdited by: Zulfikar Abbany", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR_gene_editing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CRISPR gene editing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_defect", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Birth defect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Visual impairment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gene therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEP290", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CEP290"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_editing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genome editing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard Medical School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Retina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New England Journal of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CRISPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle_cell_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sickle cell disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuelle_Charpentier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuelle Charpentier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_resistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antimicrobial resistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Doudna", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Doudna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Blood_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Blood Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://st1.latestly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/65395530_403-784x441.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542831", "eventUri": "eng-9542831", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 392, "textEnd": 397, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

It was as if she was watching the world through a straw hole, and in dimly lit places, she could not make out people's faces, only their silhouettes.\n\nBut after receiving an experimental gene-editing treatment to one of her eyes, she now can see things she never saw before.\n\nCook was born with an inherited retinal disorder that causes blindness, a rare type of eye disorder historically called Leber congenital amaurosis or LCA. A few years ago, she decided to participate in a clinical trial that involved using the gene-editing tool CRISPR to correct the form of inherited blindness that she has.\n\n\"My life has mostly changed in terms of being hopeful that there is going to be more science and findings in the future,\" said Cook, 22, who is currently studying marketing and product development at Missouri State University in Springfield. She received the experimental gene-editing treatment through a surgery performed on her left eye.\n\n\"Now, post-surgery and post recovery, I am able to see in dimmer lighting with my left eye,\" Cook said.\n\nA treatment that used CRISPR was found to be safe and efficacious in improving vision among a small sample of patients with inherited blindness in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial that Cook participated in. Inherited retinal degenerations are a leading cause of blindness around the world.\n\nAmong a total of 14 volunteers, including Cook, the gene-editing tool was found to be associated with a \"meaningful improvement\" in vision for most patients around three months later and it was not directly tied to any serious side effects, according to the trial results, published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The therapy remains experimental and the results need to be replicated in a larger group of people.\n\nMonths following the treatment, Cook was sitting with friends on a balcony that had Christmas lights wrapped around the railing. It was dusk, she recalled, yet she could see her friends' faces glow under the twinkling Christmas lights. She was shocked.\n\n\"With my right eye, I was not able to see their facial features. I was only able to see their silhouette. With my left eye, I could see everything on their face - so, significant difference, especially in the dim lighting,\" Cook said about that evening.\n\n\"One of the biggest 'aha moments' that I had was I had been talking to my mom one day after the surgery - it was about six to nine months after the surgery when I noticed most of my improvement,\" Cook said.\n\n\"I could see a candle flickering behind me, which I've never seen that before,\" she said. \"I'd never picked up anything from over there before with the peripheral.\"\n\nBefore the treatment, Cook said that she sometimes could conceal the vision challenges she has had. Her limited vision often was an internal struggle.\n\n\"You wouldn't really know that my eyesight is terrible until you spend a significant amount of time with me,\" Cook said. \"If we saw each other in the street, if I introduced myself to you, you'd never know.\"\n\nThis study is the first time that CRISPR has been used in the eyes of living people.\n\n\"The results of this study provide proof of concept that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing can be used safely and effectively to treat inherited retinal disorders,\" said the study's first author Dr. Eric Pierce, director of the Ocular Genomics Institute at Mass Eye and Ear and Harvard Medical School.\n\nThe trial was funded by the biotechnology company Editas Medicine and conducted in the United States by researchers at Mass Eye and Ear of the Mass General Brigham health care system and other US-based institutions, including the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Michigan, the University of Miami, and Oregon Health & Science University.\n\n\"We're really hopeful that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technologies will now be applied to other genetic forms of inherited blindness, and indeed other genetic diseases in general,\" Pierce said. \"We're hoping this will help open the era of therapeutic use of CRISPR-Cas9 technologies.\"\n\nThe trial, which started in 2019, enrolled 12 adults, ages 17 to 63, and two children, ages 9 and 14, with inherited retinal degeneration caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene. That gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in many types of cells, including light receptor cells in the eyes. Mutations in CEP290 are the most common cause of severe early-onset retinal degeneration, which causes vision loss in children.\n\nCurrently, there is no treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for CEP290-associated inherited retinal degeneration. These patients would not be able to read any lines of letters or numbers on a vision chart that most people receive at the eye doctor, and visual impairment may worsen over time.\n\nFor the trial, the 14 participants underwent a surgical procedure in which a drug called EDIT-101 that encodes the CRISPR gene-editing components was injected under the retina of one of their eyes. Since the trial was conducted to primarily evaluate safety and efficacy, only one eye in each patient was studied.\n\n\"The subjects get an injection of the gene-editing drug, which is called EDIT-101, under their retina,\" Pierce said. \"That drug encodes the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing machinery, and once that starts working inside the retinal cells of those patients, it cuts out the mutation in CEP290 from the genome of their retinal cells, allowing the function of the CEP290 gene to be restored.\"\n\nWhen the first patients in the study were treated in 2020, it was the first time in medical history that a CRISPR-based medicine, resulting in gene-editing, was inserted directly into the living human body.\n\nAmong the adult volunteers, two were given a low dose of the medication, five were given an intermediate dose and five were given a high dose. Both of the children in the study were given the intermediate dose. The outpatient procedure took around an hour and a half.\n\nThe patients were then monitored every three months for a year and then less frequent monitoring continued for two years. In these follow-up visits, they underwent a series of vision tests among other evaluations.\n\nThe researchers found that 11 patients in the study had some type of improvement in their vision following the CRISPR therapy, and these improvements occurred about three months after the procedure and were sustained during subsequent visits.\n\nAlso, no serious side effects occurred in response to the treatment at any of the dose sizes, according to the researchers, and the adverse events that did occur were mild or moderate. There were also no signs that the CRISPR gene-editing caused ripple-effect harm to the genomes of the patients.\n\n\"The primary goal of this first in-human study was to test the safety of using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in vivo. When we started the trials, the subjects who were treated were the first patients ever to have received CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing treatments in vivo,\" Pierce said. \"There were no serious adverse events related to the treatment, or the surgery required to deliver the treatment and no dose-limiting toxicities.\"\n\nFollowing the surgery, one patient experienced some bleeding in the eye, impairing their vision, but that has since resolved, according to the researchers.\n\n\"Once that hemorrhage cleared, the subject's vision returned to baseline,\" Pierce said.\n\nAnother patient experienced vision impairment associated with small mounds observed under their retina six months after the procedure. These types of hyperreflective mounds have been seen in other studies involving subretinal gene therapies, the researchers noted, and the cause of them is not clear.\n\n\"It's thought to be inflammation,\" Pierce said about the mounds.\n\nThe patient was treated with a course of steroid medicines, according to the study, and their recovery is ongoing.\n\n\"As the mounds resolved their vision also improved,\" Pierce said. \"I think this drug was as safe as possible in terms of design.\"\n\nComplete vision has not been restored among the patients. Most in the trial could not read any line of an eye chart prior to the study, and only four of them experienced some improvements in this ability. But some patients reported, after receiving treatment, being able to see their cell phones light up, differentiate various foods on their dinner plates, identify the spinning Apple icon on a computer screen or even noticing vibrant sunsets.\n\n\"I started to see what are described as bursts of color,\" said Michael Kalberer, 46, who received the CRISPR treatment in his right eye and first noticed improvements in his vision about two to six months later. He started the study in 2020.\n\n\"It was a pretty cool moment to see strobe lights on the dance floor of my cousin's wedding change color,\" said Kalberer, who added that if he had not received the treatment, all he would have seen on the dance floor would have been shadows and flickering lights, and he would not have been able to identify the colors.\n\nKalberer described the CRISPR treatment as \"groundbreaking,\" but warned it's not a cure.\n\n\"It's not a panacea,\" said Kalberer, who still can't see standard text or photos on a screen. \"My disease is still here. It's not gone. I'm not cured. ... But it definitely slowed the progression of it.\"\n\nPierce said that he hopes this approach to using CRISPR as a therapy for inherited blindness can be studied again in a larger and more diverse group of patients. All of the Phase 1/2 trial participants were non-Hispanic and White.\n\nIn 2022, Editas Medicine announced that it paused further studying CRISPR gene editing as a therapeutic approach for CEP290-associated inherited blindness and instead of conducting further trials, has continued to follow-up with the patients who have been treated to date.\n\nThe latest results from the Phase 1/2 trial support moving forward with a Phase 3 trial and then ultimately registering the therapy for possible FDA approval, Pierce said.\n\n\"We are working with Editas to identify an additional commercial partner for Phase 3 studies. We're actually hoping this publication will stimulate interest in the biotech and pharma communities about that,\" Pierce said.\n\nMore research over time could shed light on the long-term effects of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tools, which, now that they have been injected into patients, will be present in patients for the rest of their lives, Pierce said.\n\n\"I think the real risk that we're all concerned about with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing is: Could the gene editing machinery that we've introduced into the retinal cells of these patients do something else, somewhere else in the genome, in addition to the therapeutic activities that it was designed for?\" Pierce said.\n\n\"Could a cut in the genome be made 10 years from now, that could have an adverse effect over time? I think the answer to that is yes, it could. But we're hopeful that risk is very low,\" Pierce said. \"That's what we need additional follow-up for.\"\n\nThe results from the Phase 1/2 trial -- and how patients experienced some improvements in vision -- are a valuable reminder of how important quality of life can be for patients, said Art Caplan, a professor of bioethics and founding head of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine's Department of Population Health.\n\n\"Usually when we're doing gene therapies or other innovative interventions, we associate them with saving lives. This experiment is a huge reminder that quality of life matters. This is about vision,\" Caplan said. \"No one's dying. No one's saved. But restoration of vision is an important achievement, and it's a reminder that quality of life has to be factored into what we decide to cover in terms of insurance, reimbursement and what we try to study.\"\n\nHe agreed with the researchers that more safety data over time would be helpful.\n\n\"They haven't really had these subjects that long with the intervention to guarantee long-term safety,\" Caplan said. \"For these kinds of genetic interventions, you have to follow them over long periods of time -- years -- to make sure that other genes weren't impacted.\"\n\nThese new Phase 1/2 trial results provide a \"building block\" for scientists to work off of in the future when developing gene therapies to treat eye disorders, said Dr. Vlad Diaconita, a retinal surgeon and assistant professor of ophthalmology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. He was not involved in the trial.\n\n\"Does this apply to the American population at large? Not right now,\" Diaconita said about the experimental treatment.\n\n\"It does, however, apply to the thousands of kids born in future years that have this particular genetic subtype. So yes, an approval of this particular gene delivery could benefit people over time,\" he said. \"It's a proof of concept that seems to be moving us in the right direction.\"\n\nDiaconita's colleague Dr. Aliaa Abdelhakim called this proof-of-concept study \"groundbreaking\" in the sense that it shows the treatment approach can be safe and result in some improvement for patients, but more research is needed on a larger scale to determine what kind of patients will benefit in the long term, and how long those improvements may last.\n\n\"We still have to wait a little longer to see if this pans out in the long-term,\" said Abdelhakim, an ophthalmologist-geneticist, retina specialist and assistant professor of ophthalmology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. She also was not involved in the trial.\n\n\"We don't know if improvements from this treatment are going to be sustained.

It was as if she was watching the world through a straw hole, and in dimly lit places, she could not make out people's faces, only their silhouettes.\n\nBut after receiving an experimental gene-editing treatment to one of her eyes, she now can see things she never saw before.\n\nCook was born with an inherited retinal disorder that causes blindness, a rare type of eye disorder historically called Leber congenital amaurosis or LCA. A few years ago, she decided to participate in a clinical trial that involved using the gene-editing tool CRISPR to correct the form of inherited blindness that she has.\n\n\"My life has mostly changed in terms of being hopeful that there is going to be more science and findings in the future,\" said Cook, 22, who is currently studying marketing and product development at Missouri State University in Springfield. She received the experimental gene-editing treatment through a surgery performed on her left eye.\n\n\"Now, post-surgery and post recovery, I am able to see in dimmer lighting with my left eye,\" Cook said.\n\nA treatment that used CRISPR was found to be safe and efficacious in improving vision among a small sample of patients with inherited blindness in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial that Cook participated in. Inherited retinal degenerations are a leading cause of blindness around the world.\n\nAmong a total of 14 volunteers, including Cook, the gene-editing tool was found to be associated with a \"meaningful improvement\" in vision for most patients around three months later and it was not directly tied to any serious side effects, according to the trial results, published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The therapy remains experimental and the results need to be replicated in a larger group of people.\n\nMonths following the treatment, Cook was sitting with friends on a balcony that had Christmas lights wrapped around the railing. It was dusk, she recalled, yet she could see her friends' faces glow under the twinkling Christmas lights. She was shocked.\n\n\"With my right eye, I was not able to see their facial features. I was only able to see their silhouette. With my left eye, I could see everything on their face - so, significant difference, especially in the dim lighting,\" Cook said about that evening.\n\n\"One of the biggest 'aha moments' that I had was I had been talking to my mom one day after the surgery - it was about six to nine months after the surgery when I noticed most of my improvement,\" Cook said.\n\n\"I could see a candle flickering behind me, which I've never seen that before,\" she said. \"I'd never picked up anything from over there before with the peripheral.\"\n\nBefore the treatment, Cook said that she sometimes could conceal the vision challenges she has had. Her limited vision often was an internal struggle.\n\n\"You wouldn't really know that my eyesight is terrible until you spend a significant amount of time with me,\" Cook said. \"If we saw each other in the street, if I introduced myself to you, you'd never know.\"\n\nBut now, she is no longer hiding.\n\nA groundbreaking 'proof of concept'\n\nThis study is the first time that CRISPR has been used in the eyes of living people.\n\n\"The results of this study provide proof of concept that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing can be used safely and effectively to treat inherited retinal disorders,\" said the study's first author Dr. Eric Pierce, director of the Ocular Genomics Institute at Mass Eye and Ear and Harvard Medical School.\n\nThe trial was funded by the biotechnology company Editas Medicine and conducted in the United States by researchers at Mass Eye and Ear of the Mass General Brigham health care system and other US-based institutions, including the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Michigan, the University of Miami, and Oregon Health & Science University.\n\n\"We're really hopeful that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technologies will now be applied to other genetic forms of inherited blindness, and indeed other genetic diseases in general,\" Pierce said. \"We're hoping this will help open the era of therapeutic use of CRISPR-Cas9 technologies.\"\n\nThe trial, which started in 2019, enrolled 12 adults, ages 17 to 63, and two children, ages 9 and 14, with inherited retinal degeneration caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene. That gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in many types of cells, including light receptor cells in the eyes. Mutations in CEP290 are the most common cause of severe early-onset retinal degeneration, which causes vision loss in children.\n\nCurrently, there is no treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for CEP290-associated inherited retinal degeneration. These patients would not be able to read any lines of letters or numbers on a vision chart that most people receive at the eye doctor, and visual impairment may worsen over time.\n\nFor the trial, the 14 participants underwent a surgical procedure in which a drug called EDIT-101 that encodes the CRISPR gene-editing components was injected under the retina of one of their eyes. Since the trial was conducted to primarily evaluate safety and efficacy, only one eye in each patient was studied.\n\nDr. Jason Comander performs the surgical procedure to deliver experimental CRISPR-based medicine to a trial participant in September 2020. Mass Eye and Ear\n\n\"The subjects get an injection of the gene-editing drug, which is called EDIT-101, under their retina,\" Pierce said. \"That drug encodes the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing machinery, and once that starts working inside the retinal cells of those patients, it cuts out the mutation in CEP290 from the genome of their retinal cells, allowing the function of the CEP290 gene to be restored.\"\n\nWhen the first patients in the study were treated in 2020, it was the first time in medical history that a CRISPR-based medicine, resulting in gene-editing, was inserted directly into the living human body.\n\nAmong the adult volunteers, two were given a low dose of the medication, five were given an intermediate dose and five were given a high dose. Both of the children in the study were given the intermediate dose. The outpatient procedure took around an hour and a half.\n\nThe patients were then monitored every three months for a year and then less frequent monitoring continued for two years. In these follow-up visits, they underwent a series of vision tests among other evaluations.\n\nThe researchers found that 11 patients in the study had some type of improvement in their vision following the CRISPR therapy, and these improvements occurred about three months after the procedure and were sustained during subsequent visits.\n\nAlso, no serious side effects occurred in response to the treatment at any of the dose sizes, according to the researchers, and the adverse events that did occur were mild or moderate. There were also no signs that the CRISPR gene-editing caused ripple-effect harm to the genomes of the patients.\n\n\"The primary goal of this first in-human study was to test the safety of using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in vivo. When we started the trials, the subjects who were treated were the first patients ever to have received CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing treatments in vivo,\" Pierce said. \"There were no serious adverse events related to the treatment, or the surgery required to deliver the treatment and no dose-limiting toxicities.\"\n\nFollowing the surgery, one patient experienced some bleeding in the eye, impairing their vision, but that has since resolved, according to the researchers.\n\n\"Once that hemorrhage cleared, the subject's vision returned to baseline,\" Pierce said.\n\nAnother patient experienced vision impairment associated with small mounds observed under their retina six months after the procedure. These types of hyperreflective mounds have been seen in other studies involving subretinal gene therapies, the researchers noted, and the cause of them is not clear.\n\n\"It's thought to be inflammation,\" Pierce said about the mounds.\n\nThe patient was treated with a course of steroid medicines, according to the study, and their recovery is ongoing.\n\n\"As the mounds resolved their vision also improved,\" Pierce said. \"I think this drug was as safe as possible in terms of design.\"\n\n'It's not a panacea'\n\nComplete vision has not been restored among the patients. Most in the trial could not read any line of an eye chart prior to the study, and only four of them experienced some improvements in this ability. But some patients reported, after receiving treatment, being able to see their cell phones light up, differentiate various foods on their dinner plates, identify the spinning Apple icon on a computer screen or even noticing vibrant sunsets.\n\n\"I started to see what are described as bursts of color,\" said Michael Kalberer, 46, who received the CRISPR treatment in his right eye and first noticed improvements in his vision about two to six months later. He started the study in 2020.\n\n\"It was a pretty cool moment to see strobe lights on the dance floor of my cousin's wedding change color,\" said Kalberer, who added that if he had not received the treatment, all he would have seen on the dance floor would have been shadows and flickering lights, and he would not have been able to identify the colors.\n\nTrial participant Michael Kalberer at a follow-up appointment after receiving the experimental CRISPR-based therapy.

It was as if she was watching the world through a straw hole, and in dimly lit places, she could not make out people's faces, only their silhouettes.\n\nBut after receiving an experimental gene-editing treatment to one of her eyes, she now can see things she never saw before.\n\nCook was born with an inherited retinal disorder that causes blindness, a rare type of eye disorder historically called Leber congenital amaurosis or LCA. A few years ago, she decided to participate in a clinical trial that involved using the gene-editing tool CRISPR to correct the form of inherited blindness that she has.\n\n\"My life has mostly changed in terms of being hopeful that there is going to be more science and findings in the future,\" said Cook, 22, who is currently studying marketing and product development at Missouri State University in Springfield. She received the experimental gene-editing treatment through a surgery performed on her left eye.\n\n\"Now, post-surgery and post recovery, I am able to see in dimmer lighting with my left eye,\" Cook said.\n\nA treatment that used CRISPR was found to be safe and efficacious in improving vision among a small sample of patients with inherited blindness in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial that Cook participated in. Inherited retinal degenerations are a leading cause of blindness around the world.\n\nAmong a total of 14 volunteers, including Cook, the gene-editing tool was found to be associated with a \"meaningful improvement\" in vision for most patients around three months later and it was not directly tied to any serious side effects, according to the trial results, published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The therapy remains experimental and the results need to be replicated in a larger group of people.\n\nMonths following the treatment, Cook was sitting with friends on a balcony that had Christmas lights wrapped around the railing. It was dusk, she recalled, yet she could see her friends' faces glow under the twinkling Christmas lights. She was shocked.\n\n\"With my right eye, I was not able to see their facial features. I was only able to see their silhouette. With my left eye, I could see everything on their face - so, significant difference, especially in the dim lighting,\" Cook said about that evening.\n\n\"One of the biggest 'aha moments' that I had was I had been talking to my mom one day after the surgery - it was about six to nine months after the surgery when I noticed most of my improvement,\" Cook said.\n\n\"I could see a candle flickering behind me, which I've never seen that before,\" she said. \"I'd never picked up anything from over there before with the peripheral.\"\n\nBefore the treatment, Cook said that she sometimes could conceal the vision challenges she has had. Her limited vision often was an internal struggle.\n\n\"You wouldn't really know that my eyesight is terrible until you spend a significant amount of time with me,\" Cook said. \"If we saw each other in the street, if I introduced myself to you, you'd never know.\"\n\nBut now, she is no longer hiding.\n\nA groundbreaking 'proof of concept'\n\nThis study is the first time that CRISPR has been used in the eyes of living people.\n\n\"The results of this study provide proof of concept that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing can be used safely and effectively to treat inherited retinal disorders,\" said the study's first author Dr. Eric Pierce, director of the Ocular Genomics Institute at Mass Eye and Ear and Harvard Medical School.\n\nThe trial was funded by the biotechnology company Editas Medicine and conducted in the United States by researchers at Mass Eye and Ear of the Mass General Brigham health care system and other US-based institutions, including the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Michigan, the University of Miami, and Oregon Health & Science University.\n\n\"We're really hopeful that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technologies will now be applied to other genetic forms of inherited blindness, and indeed other genetic diseases in general,\" Pierce said. \"We're hoping this will help open the era of therapeutic use of CRISPR-Cas9 technologies.\"\n\nThe trial, which started in 2019, enrolled 12 adults, ages 17 to 63, and two children, ages 9 and 14, with inherited retinal degeneration caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene. That gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in many types of cells, including light receptor cells in the eyes. Mutations in CEP290 are the most common cause of severe early-onset retinal degeneration, which causes vision loss in children.\n\nCurrently, there is no treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for CEP290-associated inherited retinal degeneration. These patients would not be able to read any lines of letters or numbers on a vision chart that most people receive at the eye doctor, and visual impairment may worsen over time.\n\nFor the trial, the 14 participants underwent a surgical procedure in which a drug called EDIT-101 that encodes the CRISPR gene-editing components was injected under the retina of one of their eyes. Since the trial was conducted to primarily evaluate safety and efficacy, only one eye in each patient was studied.\n\n\"The subjects get an injection of the gene-editing drug, which is called EDIT-101, under their retina,\" Pierce said. \"That drug encodes the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing machinery, and once that starts working inside the retinal cells of those patients, it cuts out the mutation in CEP290 from the genome of their retinal cells, allowing the function of the CEP290 gene to be restored.\"\n\nWhen the first patients in the study were treated in 2020, it was the first time in medical history that a CRISPR-based medicine, resulting in gene-editing, was inserted directly into the living human body.\n\nAmong the adult volunteers, two were given a low dose of the medication, five were given an intermediate dose and five were given a high dose. Both of the children in the study were given the intermediate dose. The outpatient procedure took around an hour and a half.\n\nThe patients were then monitored every three months for a year and then less frequent monitoring continued for two years. In these follow-up visits, they underwent a series of vision tests among other evaluations.\n\nThe researchers found that 11 patients in the study had some type of improvement in their vision following the CRISPR therapy, and these improvements occurred about three months after the procedure and were sustained during subsequent visits.\n\nAlso, no serious side effects occurred in response to the treatment at any of the dose sizes, according to the researchers, and the adverse events that did occur were mild or moderate. There were also no signs that the CRISPR gene-editing caused ripple-effect harm to the genomes of the patients.\n\n\"The primary goal of this first in-human study was to test the safety of using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in vivo. When we started the trials, the subjects who were treated were the first patients ever to have received CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing treatments in vivo,\" Pierce said. \"There were no serious adverse events related to the treatment, or the surgery required to deliver the treatment and no dose-limiting toxicities.\"\n\nFollowing the surgery, one patient experienced some bleeding in the eye, impairing their vision, but that has since resolved, according to the researchers.\n\n\"Once that hemorrhage cleared, the subject's vision returned to baseline,\" Pierce said.\n\nAnother patient experienced vision impairment associated with small mounds observed under their retina six months after the procedure. These types of hyperreflective mounds have been seen in other studies involving subretinal gene therapies, the researchers noted, and the cause of them is not clear.\n\n\"It's thought to be inflammation,\" Pierce said about the mounds.\n\nThe patient was treated with a course of steroid medicines, according to the study, and their recovery is ongoing.\n\n\"As the mounds resolved their vision also improved,\" Pierce said. \"I think this drug was as safe as possible in terms of design.\"\n\n'It's not a panacea'\n\nComplete vision has not been restored among the patients. Most in the trial could not read any line of an eye chart prior to the study, and only four of them experienced some improvements in this ability. But some patients reported, after receiving treatment, being able to see their cell phones light up, differentiate various foods on their dinner plates, identify the spinning Apple icon on a computer screen or even noticing vibrant sunsets.\n\n\"I started to see what are described as bursts of color,\" said Michael Kalberer, 46, who received the CRISPR treatment in his right eye and first noticed improvements in his vision about two to six months later. He started the study in 2020.\n\n\"It was a pretty cool moment to see strobe lights on the dance floor of my cousin's wedding change color,\" said Kalberer, who added that if he had not received the treatment, all he would have seen on the dance floor would have been shadows and flickering lights, and he would not have been able to identify the colors.\n\nKalberer described the CRISPR treatment as \"groundbreaking,\" but warned it's not a cure.\n\n\"It's not a panacea,\" said Kalberer, who still can't see standard text or photos on a screen. \"My disease is still here. It's not gone. I'm not cured. ... But it definitely slowed the progression of it.\"\n\nPierce said that he hopes this approach to using CRISPR as a therapy for inherited blindness can be studied again in a larger and more diverse group of patients. All of the Phase 1/2 trial participants were non-Hispanic and White.\n\nIn 2022, Editas Medicine announced that it paused further studying CRISPR gene editing as a therapeutic approach for CEP290-associated inherited blindness and instead of conducting further trials, has continued to follow-up with the patients who have been treated to date.\n\nThe latest results from the Phase 1/2 trial support moving forward with a Phase 3 trial and then ultimately registering the therapy for possible FDA approval, Pierce said.\n\n\"We are working with Editas to identify an additional commercial partner for Phase 3 studies. We're actually hoping this publication will stimulate interest in the biotech and pharma communities about that,\" Pierce said.\n\nMore research over time could shed light on the long-term effects of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tools, which, now that they have been injected into patients, will be present in patients for the rest of their lives, Pierce said.\n\n\"I think the real risk that we're all concerned about with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing is: Could the gene editing machinery that we've introduced into the retinal cells of these patients do something else, somewhere else in the genome, in addition to the therapeutic activities that it was designed for?\" Pierce said.\n\n\"Could a cut in the genome be made 10 years from now, that could have an adverse effect over time? I think the answer to that is yes, it could. But we're hopeful that risk is very low,\" Pierce said. \"That's what we need additional follow-up for.\"\n\n'Quality of life matters'\n\nThe results from the Phase 1/2 trial -- and how patients experienced some improvements in vision -- are a valuable reminder of how important quality of life can be for patients, said Art Caplan, a professor of bioethics and founding head of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine's Department of Population Health.\n\n\"Usually when we're doing gene therapies or other innovative interventions, we associate them with saving lives. This experiment is a huge reminder that quality of life matters. This is about vision,\" Caplan said. \"No one's dying. No one's saved. But restoration of vision is an important achievement, and it's a reminder that quality of life has to be factored into what we decide to cover in terms of insurance, reimbursement and what we try to study.\"\n\nHe agreed with the researchers that more safety data over time would be helpful.\n\n\"They haven't really had these subjects that long with the intervention to guarantee long-term safety,\" Caplan said. \"For these kinds of genetic interventions, you have to follow them over long periods of time -- years -- to make sure that other genes weren't impacted.\"\n\nThese new Phase 1/2 trial results provide a \"building block\" for scientists to work off of in the future when developing gene therapies to treat eye disorders, said Dr. Vlad Diaconita, a retinal surgeon and assistant professor of ophthalmology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. He was not involved in the trial.\n\n\"Does this apply to the American population at large? Not right now,\" Diaconita said about the experimental treatment.\n\n\"It does, however, apply to the thousands of kids born in future years that have this particular genetic subtype. So yes, an approval of this particular gene delivery could benefit people over time,\" he said. \"It's a proof of concept that seems to be moving us in the right direction.\"\n\nDiaconita's colleague Dr. Aliaa Abdelhakim called this proof-of-concept study \"groundbreaking\" in the sense that it shows the treatment approach can be safe and result in some improvement for patients, but more research is needed on a larger scale to determine what kind of patients will benefit in the long term, and how long those improvements may last.\n\n\"We still have to wait a little longer to see if this pans out in the long-term,\" said Abdelhakim, an ophthalmologist-geneticist, retina specialist and assistant professor of ophthalmology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. She also was not involved in the trial.\n\n\"We don't know if improvements from this treatment are going to be sustained. Is their vision going to stay improved throughout their lives?\" she asked. \"The reason this is important is because this is the first time CRISPR has been used in this way, in the eye.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

In a multi-site clinical trial called BRILLIANCE that included researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), 14 people-including two children under 17 years old-with Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA), a form of blindness resulting from mutations in the CEO290 gene, received a single, surgical injection of a gene editing agent. Of those 14, nearly half reported measurable improvements in sight, including the two children according to the study, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).\n\n\"Our patients are the first congenitally blind children to be treated with gene-editing, which significantly improved their ability to see things like daylight. Our hope is that the study will pave the road for treatments of younger children with similar conditions and further improvements in vision,\" said Tomas S. Aleman, MD, the Irene Heinz-Given and John LaPorte Research Professor in Ophthalmology at Penn Medicine with the Scheie Eye Institute and a pediatric ophthalmologist at CHOP who served as a site principal investigator and study co-author. \"This trial represents a landmark in the treatment of genetic diseases, in specific, genetic blindness, by offering an important alternative treatment, when traditional forms of gene therapy, such as gene augmentation, are not an option.\"\n\nThe researchers used a host of measures to test whether the procedure improved vision, including one that tests how bright a flash needs to be to be detected (dark-adapted full-field stimulus testing), and another measured by participants moving through a physical maze (visual function navigation). In the end, 11 patients experienced improvement in at least one measure, while six showed improvement in two or more. Meaningful improvements were seen in six patients in \"cone-mediated vision,\" referring to the cone photoreceptors in the retina that allow us to perceive color.\n\nThere were no events of side effects reported in the study or any \"dose-limiting toxicities\" that would have required the treatment level to be changed. The treatment, EDIT-101, is manufactured by Editas Medicine Inc., which helped fund the study.\n\nCHOP and Penn Medicine served as a study site for the pediatric portion of the study, while the main principal investigator was Eric Pierce, MD, PhD, of Mass Eye and Ear, a member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system. The other site that participated was the Casey Eye Institute at Oregon Health & Science University, under the leadership of Mark Pennesi, MD, PhD.\n\nIn addition to the funding from Editas, the research was supported by supported by the National Institutes of Health (P30 EY014104, P30 EY010572), the Malcolm M. Marquis MD Endowed Fund for Innovation, and unrestricted grants from Research to Prevent Blindness to Casey Eye Institute and the Scheie Eye Institute.

Children with LCA often experience severe vision loss or complete blindness from a very young age. One of the most common causes of LCA is a defect in the CEP290 gene, which plays a crucial role in the development and function of the retina's light-sensing cells, called photoreceptors.\n\nUntil now, there have been no effective treatments for LCA resulting from CEP290 mutations. However, the new study led by researchers at Massachusetts Eye and Ear and Oregon Health & Science University offers a glimmer of hope. Published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers tested a novel therapy called EDIT-101 in 14 patients with LCA.\n\nSo, what exactly is EDIT-101, and how does it work? In simple terms, it's a gene editing tool that uses CRISPR technology to correct the genetic defect in CEP290. CRISPR, which stands for \"clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats,\" is a powerful gene editing technique that allows scientists to make precise changes to DNA.\n\nYou can think of CRISPR as a pair of molecular scissors that can cut out a defective piece of DNA and replace it with a corrected version. In the case of EDIT-101, the CRISPR tool is designed to specifically target and repair the most common mutation in the CEP290 gene that causes LCA.\n\nHere's how the treatment works: The EDIT-101 complex, which contains the CRISPR components, is injected directly into the retina of the patient's worse-seeing eye in a surgical procedure. Once inside the retina, the CRISPR tool goes to work, finding and cutting out the CEP290 mutation and allowing the gene to function normally. The goal is to restore the activity of the photoreceptor cells and improve vision.\n\nIn the study, 14 LCA patients age three and older received a single injection of EDIT-101 at three different dose levels. The patients were then followed for up to two years to assess the safety and effectiveness of the treatment.\n\nThe results, while preliminary, are encouraging. No serious side-effects related to the treatment were observed, suggesting that EDIT-101 is safe. More excitingly, 11 out of the 14 patients (79%) showed some improvement in at least one measure of visual function, such as visual acuity, retinal sensitivity to light, navigational abilities, or quality of life scores.\n\nSix patients (43%) had meaningful improvements in cone photoreceptor function, the cells responsible for color vision and visual acuity. This is especially noteworthy because LCA primarily affects rod photoreceptors that are responsible for night and peripheral vision, while cone cells are relatively spared. Enhancing cone function could potentially have a big impact on patients' central vision and daily functioning.\n\n\"There is nothing more rewarding to a physician than hearing a patient describe how their vision has improved after a treatment,\" says Dr. Mark Pennesi of the Casey Eye Institute at Oregon Health & Science University, where the first in vivo CRISPR treatment took place, in a media release. \"One of our trial participants has shared several examples, including being able to find their phone after misplacing it and knowing that their coffee machine is working by seeing its small lights. While these types of tasks might seem trivial to those who are normally sighted, such improvements can have a huge impact on quality of life for those with low vision.\"\n\nThe youngest participants, two children who were nine and 14 years-old, seemed to have the most robust response, with both showing improvements in multiple visual outcomes. This suggests that intervening early, while the retina is still developing, may yield the greatest benefits.\n\nWhile these initial results are promising, it's important to remember that this is still an early-stage trial with a small number of patients. Larger and longer studies will be needed to fully assess the safety and efficacy of EDIT-101. Scientists will also need to fine-tune the treatment to optimize the dose and timing of the injections for maximum benefit.\n\nNonetheless, the fact that a single injection of EDIT-101 could lead to measurable improvements in vision in these patients with previously untreatable blindness is a major milestone. It provides proof-of-concept that CRISPR gene editing can be successfully used to treat inherited retinal diseases, paving the way for its application to other forms of blindness and potentially other genetic disorders.\n\nFor families affected by LCA, this research represents a beacon of hope. The possibility of restoring even a small amount of vision could have a profound impact on the lives of these children, allowing them to better navigate their environment, perform daily activities, and experience the world in a whole new light.\n\nOf course, there are still many questions to be answered and challenges to overcome before CRISPR therapies like EDIT-101 become widely available. However, this study is a crucial first step in demonstrating the feasibility and promise of this cutting-edge approach.\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the implications of this research extend far beyond just LCA. CRISPR gene editing has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of countless genetic diseases that have long been considered incurable. By correcting the underlying genetic defects, we may one day be able to not just manage the symptoms of these disorders but actually cure them at their source.\n\nFor the children and families affected by LCA, that day can't come soon enough. With each passing breakthrough, the light at the end of the tunnel grows a little brighter, offering renewed hope for a future where blindness is no longer a life sentence but a treatable condition. And that is truly a vision worth fighting for.", "source": {"uri": "studyfinds.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Study Finds"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEP290", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CEP290"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoreceptor_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Photoreceptor cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Retina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CRISPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Visual impairment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cone cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_editing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Genome editing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Genetic disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leber_congenital_amaurosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leber congenital amaurosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR_gene_editing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CRISPR gene editing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_acuity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Visual acuity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_England_Journal_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New England Journal of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Health_&_Science_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon Health & Science University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tissue (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vivo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "In vivo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_vision", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Color vision"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Blood_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Blood Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Comander-in-surgery.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542831", "eventUri": "eng-9542831", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

The trial is seen as a landmark achievement in the treatment of genetic blindness, offering an alternative treatment option when traditional forms of gene therapy are not viable.\n\nDuring the trial, each participant received an injection of EDIT-101 in one eye through a surgical procedure. The participants were divided into three groups receiving different doses of the therapy, with children receiving a mid-dose treatment. Over 12 months, participants were monitored every three months for safety, with follow-up continuing for an additional two years.\n\nThe results revealed no severe adverse events or toxicities related to the treatment, indicating that CRISPR-based therapy can be safely delivered to the retina with clinically significant results.\n\nWhile full vision restoration was not achieved, some individuals experienced improvements in their visual abilities, with a few managing to read certain lines on an eye chart. The outcomes of the BRILLIANCE trial were seen as pivotal for advancing treatments for inherited retinal diseases.\n\nEditas Medicine, the company that initially funded the BRILLIANCE trial, paused enrollment in November 2022, leading the researchers to explore collaborations with other commercial partners for further trials.\n\nDr. Eric Pierce, the lead author of the study, expressed optimism that the published results would attract interest from the biotech and pharmaceutical sectors to support Phase 3 studies.\n\nFuture investigations aim to delve into optimal dosing strategies, potential age-related treatment effects, and improved outcome measures for evaluating the therapy's impact on daily activities.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "source": {"uri": "rttnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTTNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Visual impairment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_defect", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Birth defect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome_editing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genome editing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CRISPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_event", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adverse event"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gene therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editas_Medicine", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Editas Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotechnology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biotechnology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://cdn.rttnews.com/articleimages/ustopstories/2024/may/vision-06052024-lt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542831", "eventUri": "eng-9542831", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

It is typically performed outside of the body by taking cells out and then transplanting them again after the genetic correction.\n\nThe two children were part of a clinical trial involving hospitals in five cities that also included 12 adults. All of the patients had Leber Congenital Amaurosis, a common cause of blindness in children. The results of the clinical trial were published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n\"It's the first time that gene editing has been used in the eyes of children, and proved safe and successful,\" said Tomas Aleman, a retina specialist at CHOP and one of the study's authors.\n\n\" READ MORE: Gene therapy at CHOP allowed a deaf boy to hear. But some deaf people object to the treatment.\n\nThe study focused on the safety of the procedure, finding the gene-editing injection to the eye to be safe. But researchers also saw vision improvement in half of the patients, including the two children treated at CHOP.\n\nThe children still did not leave the hospital with 20/20 eyesight, said Aleman, who is also a professor at Penn Medicine. He hopes that delivering the treatment to children when they are younger will lead to greater improvement in eyesight.\n\nThe study is part of an ongoing collaboration that includes CHOP, University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, and Oregon Health and Science University, and the University of Michigan.\n\nThe research was funded by Editas Medicine, Inc., a Cambridge, Mass.-based gene therapy company.\n\nGene therapy fixes errors in the body's genetic code using an approach analogous to editing a text, said Eric Kmiec, executive director and chief scientific officer of ChristianaCare's Gene Editing Institute, who was not involved in the study.\n\nA deficiency in a gene is like a misspelled word.\n\nGene therapies a decade ago could only fix the error by injecting corrected DNA next to it within the cell, like striking out a word and writing it the right way by its side. The newer generation of therapies instead fix the misspelling itself using a technology called CRISPR.\n\n\" READ MORE: The FDA just approved the first gene-editing treatment, and CHOP played a key role\n\nPhysicians most often apply gene therapy by taking cells out of the body, fixing the genetic error, and then transplanting the cells back into the patient. That's how CRISPR works to cure sickle cell anemia: bone marrow cells are corrected to produce red blood cells in the right shape, and are returned to the body where they multiply.\n\nThat approach has a few problems, Kmiec said. The body can reject the corrected cells like any transplantation. And cells in the nervous system don't multiply.\n\nThese problems have led scientists to work on ways to fix the mutations in cells while they are inside the body.

Her work has appeared in Scientific American, Popular Science, GenomeWeb, Business Insider, and Discover magazine.\n\nMedicine has entered a new era in which scientists have the tools to change human genetics directly, creating the potential to treat or even permanently cure diseases by editing a few strands of troublesome DNA. And CRISPR, the gene-editing technology whose creators won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2020, is the face of this new normal.\n\nCRISPR's novel harnessing of bacterial proteins to target disease-carrying genes has reshaped medical research over the past decade. While gene-editing itself has been around for more than 30 years, scientists can use CRISPR to edit genomes faster, cheaper, and more precisely than they could with previous gene-editing methods. The method's novel harnessing of bacterial proteins to target disease-carrying genes has reshaped medical research over the past decade.\n\nAs a result, investigators have gained far more control over where a gene gets inserted and when it gets turned on. That in turn has opened the door to a new class of better gene therapies -- treatments that modify or replace people's genes to stop a disease.\n\nLast December, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the first-ever CRISPR-based therapy, designed to treat sickle cell disease. In February, the treatment, called Casgevy, gained approval from the European Commission as well. It joins the dozen or so pre-CRISPR gene therapies that are already available to patients.\n\nBut there's a significant impediment to maximizing CRISPR's potential for developing novel therapies: the lack of diversity in genetics research.\n\nFor decades, gene therapy has been defined by both its enormous therapeutic potential, and by the limitations imposed by our imprecise knowledge of human genetics. Even as gene-editing methods, including CRISPR, have become more sophisticated over the years, the data in the genetic databases and biobanks that scientists use to find and develop new treatments are still riddled with biases that could exclude communities of color from enjoying the full benefits of innovations like CRISPR. Unless that gap is closed, CRISPR's promise won't be fully fulfilled.\n\nDeveloping effective gene therapies depends on growing our knowledge of the human genome. Data on genes and their correlation with disease have already changed the way cancer researchers think about how to design drugs, and which patients to match with which drug.\n\nScientists have long known that certain genetic mutations that disrupt regular cell functions can cause cancer to develop, and they have tailored drugs to neutralize those mutations. Genetic sequencing technology has sped that progress, allowing researchers to analyze the genetics of tumor samples from cancer patients after they've participated in clinical trials to understand why some individuals respond better than others to a drug.\n\nIn a clinical trial of the colorectal cancer drug cetuximab, investigators found retrospectively that tumors with a mutation in the KRAS gene (which helps govern cell growth) did not respond to treatment. As a result, clinicians are now asked to confirm that patients do not have the mutation in the KRAS gene before they prescribe that particular drug. New drugs have been developed to target those mutations in the KRAS gene.\n\nIt's a step-by-step process from the discovery of these disease-related genes to the crafting of drugs that neutralize them. With CRISPR now available to them, many researchers believe that they can speed this process up.\n\nThe technology is based on -- and named after -- a unique feature in the bacterial immune system that the organism uses to defend itself against viruses. CRISPR is found naturally in bacteria: It's short for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, and it functions like a mugshot database for bacteria, containing snippets of genetic code from foreign viruses that have tried to invade in the past.\n\nWhen new infections occur, the bacteria deploys RNA segments that scan for viral DNA that matches the mugshots. Special proteins are then dispatched to chop the virus up and neutralize it.\n\nTo develop CRISPR into a biotech platform, this protein-RNA complex was adapted from bacteria and inserted into human and animal cells, where it proved similarly effective at searching for and snipping strands of DNA.\n\nUsing CRISPR in humans requires a few adjustments. Scientists have to teach the system to search through human DNA, which means that it will need a different \"mugshot database\" than what the bacteria originally needed. Critical to harnessing this natural process is artificial RNA, known as a guide RNA. These guide RNAs are designed to match genes found in humans. In theory, these guide RNAs search for and find a specific DNA sequence associated with a specific disease. The special protein attached to the guide RNA then acts like molecular scissors to cut the problematic gene.\n\nCRISPR's therapeutic potential was evident in the breakthrough sickle cell treatment approved by the FDA late last year. What made sickle cell such an attractive target is not just that it affects around 20 million people or more worldwide, but that it is caused by a mutation in a single gene, which makes it simpler to study than a disease caused by multiple mutations. Sickle cell is one of the most common disorders worldwide that is caused by a mutation in a single gene. It was also the first to be characterized at a genetic level, making it a promising candidate for gene therapy.\n\nIn sickle cell disease, a genetic mutation distorts the shape of a person's hemoglobin, which is the protein that helps red blood cells carry and deliver oxygen from the lungs to tissues throughout the body. For people with sickle cell disease, their red blood cells look like \"sickles\" instead of the normal discs. As a result, they can get caught in blood vessels, blocking blood flow and causing issues like pain, strokes, infections, and death.\n\nSince the 1990s, clinicians have observed that sickle cell patients with higher levels of fetal hemoglobin tend to live longer. A series of genome-wide association studies from 2008 pointed to the BCL11A gene as a possible target for therapeutics. These association studies establish the relationships between specific genes and diseases, identifying candidates for CRISPR gene editing.\n\nCasgevy's new CRISPR-derived treatment targets a gene called BCL11A. Inactivating this gene stops the mutated form of hemoglobin from being made and increases the production of normal non-sickled fetal hemoglobin, which people usually stop making after birth.\n\nOut of the 45 patients who have received Casgevy since the start of the trials, 28 of the 29 eligible patients who have stayed on long enough to have their results analyzed reported that they have been free of severe pain crises. Once the treatment moves out of clinical settings, its exact effects can vary. And if the underlying data set doesn't reflect the diversity of the patient population, the gene therapies derived from them might not work the same for every person.\n\nSickle cell disease as the first benefactor of CRISPR therapy makes sense because it's a relatively simple disorder that has been studied for a long time. The genetic mutation causing it was found in 1956. But ironically, the same population that could benefit most from Casgvey may miss out on the full benefits of future breakthrough treatments.\n\nScientists developing CRISPR treatments depend on what's known as a reference genome, which is meant to be a composite representation of a \"normal\" human genome that can be used to identify genes of interest to target for treating a disease.\n\nHowever, most of the available reference genomes are representative of white Europeans. That's a problem because not everybody's DNA is identical: Recent sequencing of African genomes shows that they have 10 percent more DNA than the standard reference genome available to researchers. Researchers have theorized that this is because most modern humans came out of Africa. As populations diverged and reconcentrated, genetic bottlenecks happened, which resulted in a loss of genetic variation compared to the original population.\n\nMost genome-wide association studies are also biased in the same way: They have a lot of data from white people and not a lot from people of color.\n\nSo while those studies can help identify genes of importance that could lead to effective treatments for the population whose genes make up the majority of the reference data -- i.e., white people -- the same treatments may not work as well for other nonwhite populations.\n\n\"Broadly, there's been an issue with human genetics research -- there's been a major under-representation of people of African ancestry, both in the US and elsewhere,\" said Sarah Tishkoff, professor of genetics and biology at the University of Pennsylvania. \"Without including these diverse populations, we're missing out on that knowledge that could perhaps result in better therapeutics or better diagnostics.\"\n\nEven in the case of the notorious breast cancer gene BRCA1, where a single gene mutation can have a serious clinical impact and is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer, underlying mutations within the gene \"tend to differ in people of different ancestries,\" Tishkoff said.\n\nThese differences, whether large or small, can matter. Although the vast majority of human genomes are the same, a small fraction of the letters making up our genes can differ from person to person and from population to population, with potentially significant medical implications. Sometimes during sequencing, genetic variations of \"unknown significance\" appear. These variants could be clinically important, but because of the lack of diversity in previous research populations, no one has studied them closely enough to understand their impact.\n\n\"If all the research is being done in people of predominantly European ancestry, you're only going to find those variants,\" Tishkoff said.\n\nThose limitations affect scientists up and down the developmental pipeline. For researchers using CRISPR technology in preclinical work, the lack of diversity in the genome databases can make it harder to identify the possible negative effect of such genetic variation on the treatments they're developing.\n\nSean Misek, a postdoctoral researcher at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, started developing a project with the goal of investigating the differences in the genetic patterns of tumors from patients of European descent compared to patients of African descent. CRISPR has become a versatile tool. Not only can it be used for treatments, but it can also be used for diagnostics and basic research. He and his colleagues intended to use CRISPR to screen for those differences because it can evaluate the effects of multiple genes at once, as opposed to the traditional method of testing one gene at a time.\n\n\"We know individuals of different ancestry groups have different overall clinical responses to cancer treatments,\" Misek said. \"Individuals of recent African descent, for example, have worse outcomes than individuals of European descent, which is a problem that we were interested in trying to understand more.\"\n\nWhat they encountered instead was a roadblock.\n\nWhen Misek's team tried to design CRISPR guides, they found that their guides matched the genomes in the cells of people with European and East Asian ancestry, whose samples made up most of the reference genome, but not on cells from people of South Asian or African ancestry, who are far less represented in databases. In combination with other data biases in cancer research, the guide RNA mismatch has made it more difficult to investigate the tumor biology of non-European patients.\n\nGenetic variations across ancestry groups not only affect whether CRISPR technology works at all, but they can also lead to unforeseen side effects when the tool makes cuts in places outside of the intended genetic target. Such side effects of \"off-target\" gene edits could theoretically include cancer.\n\n\"A big part of developing CRISPR therapy is trying to figure out if there are off-targets. Where? And if they exist, do they matter?\" said Daniel Bauer, an attending physician at Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center.\n\nTo better predict potential off-target edits, Bauer collaborated with Luca Pinello, associate professor at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, who had helped develop a tool called CRISPRme that makes projections based on personal and population-level variations in genetics. To test it, they examined the guide RNA being used for sickle cell disease treatment, and found an off-target edit almost exclusively present in cells donated by a patient of African ancestry.\n\nIt is currently unclear if this off-target edit detected by the CRISPRme tool has any negative consequences. When the FDA approved the sickle-cell therapy in December 2023, regulators required a post-marketing study to look into off-target effects. Any off-target edits affecting a person's blood should be easily detected in the blood cells, and drawing blood is easier to do than collecting cells from an internal organ, for example.\n\nThe genetic variant where the off-target effect occurred can be found in approximately every 1 in 10 people with African ancestry. \"The fact that we actually were able to find a donor who carried this variant was kind of luck,\" Bauer said. \"If the cells we were using were only of European ancestry, it would've been even harder to find.\"\n\n\"Most of these [off-target] effects probably won't cause any problems,\" he said. \"But I think we also have these great technologies, so that's part of our responsibility to look as carefully as we can.\"\n\nThese issues recur again and again as investigators hunt for novel treatments. Katalin Susztak, professor of medicine and genetics at the University of Pennsylvania, thinks one promising candidate for a future CRISPR therapy is a standout gene for kidney disease: APOL1.\n\nResearchers identified the gene when they looked into kidney disease risk in African Americans. While genome-wide association studies turned up thousands of distinct genes increasing risk for people of European ancestry, in African Americans, this single gene was responsible for \"3 to 5 times higher risk of kidney disease in patients,\" said Susztak.\n\nThe APOL1 variant is common among African Americans because it protects people from developing African sleeping sickness, which is spread by the Tsetse fly present across much of the continent. This is similar to the story of the sickle cell mutation, which can protect people from malaria.\n\n\"The variant is maybe only 5,000 years old, so this variant has not arisen in Europe, Asia, or anywhere else. Just in West Africa,\" Susztak said. \"But because of the slave trades, West Africans were brought to the United States, so millions of people in the United States have this variant.\"\n\nThe variant also predisposes people to develop cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and COVID-related disease, \"which maybe explains why there was an increased incidence of deaths in African Americans during COVID than in Europeans,\" Susztak said. \"APOL1 is potentially a very interesting target [for CRISPR] because the disease association is strong.\"\n\nA CRISPR treatment for kidney disease is currently being investigated, but using the tool comes with complications. Cutting the APOL1 gene would set off an immune response, Susztak noted, so they will have to somehow prevent undesirable side effects, or find a related, but editable gene, like they did with sickle cell.\n\nAn alternative RNA-based strategy utilizing CRISPR is also in the works. DNA needs to be transcribed into a messenger RNA sequence first before it can be turned into proteins. Instead of permanently altering the genome, RNA editing alters the sequence of RNAs, which can then change what proteins are produced. The effects are less permanent, however, lasting for a few months instead of forever -- which can be advantageous for treating temporary medical conditions.\n\nAnd it may turn out that gene therapy is simply not the right approach to the problem. Sometimes, a more conventional approach still works best. Susztak said that a small molecule drug developed by Vertex -- which works similarly to most drugs except special classes like gene therapies or biologics -- to inhibit the function of the APOL1 protein has enjoyed positive results in early clinical trials.\n\nEven with these limitations, more CRISPR treatments are coming down the pike.\n\nAs of early last year, more than 200 people have been treated with experimental CRISPR therapies for cancers, blood disorders, infections, and more. In the developmental pipeline is a CRISPR-based therapeutic from Intellia Therapeutics that treats transthyretin amyloidosis, a rare condition affecting the function of the heart tissues and nerves. The drug has performed well in early trials and is now recruiting participants for a Phase III study. Another CRISPR drug from Intellia for hereditary angioedema, a condition that causes severe swelling throughout the body, is slated to enter Phase III later this year.\n\nAs the CRISPR boom continues, some research groups are slowly improving the diversity of their genetic sources.\n\nThe All of Us program from the National Institutes of Health, which aims to find the biological, environmental, and lifestyle factors that contribute to health, has analyzed 245,000 genomes to date, over 40 percent of which came from participants who were not of European ancestry. They found new genetic markers for diabetes that have never been identified before.\n\nThen there's the Human Pangenome project, which aims to create a reference genome that captures more global diversity. The first draft of its proposal was released last May. Another project called the PAGE study, funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, is working to include more ancestrally diverse populations in genome-wide association studies.\n\nBut at the current pace, experts predict that it will take years to reach parity in our genetic databases. And the scientific community must also build trust with the communities it's trying to help. The US has a murky history with medical ethics, especially around race. Take the Tuskegee experiment that charted the progression of syphilis in Black American men while hiding the true purpose of the study from the participants and withholding their ability to seek treatment when it became available, or the controversy over Henrietta Lacks' cervical cells, which were taken and used in research without her consent. Those are just two prominent historical abuses that have eroded trust between minority communities and the country's medical system, Tishkoff said. That history has made it more difficult to collect samples from marginalized communities and add them to these critical data sets.\n\nWhere the research is being done, where the clinical trials are being held, as well as who's doing the research, can all have an impact on which patients participate. The Human Genetics & Genomics Workforce Survey Report published by the American Society of Human Genetics in 2022 found that 67 percent of the genomic workforce identified as white. Add in the financial burden of developing new treatments when using a reference genome, or a pre-made biobank from past efforts to collect and organize a large volume of biological samples, saves time and costs. In the race to bring CRISPR treatments to market, those shortcuts offered valuable efficiency to drug makers.\n\nWhat this means is that the \"first-generation\" of CRISPR therapeutics might therefore be blunter instruments than they might otherwise be. However, if improvements can be made to make sure the source genomes reflect a wider range of people, Pinello believes that later generations of CRISPR will be more personalized and therefore more effective for more people.\n\nFinding the genes and making drugs that work is, of course, momentous -- but ultimately, that's only half the battle. The other worry physicians like Susztak have is whether patients will be able to afford and access these innovative treatments.\n\nThere is still an overwhelming racial disparity in clinical trial enrollment. Studies have found that people of color are more likely to suffer from chronic illness and underuse medications like insulin compared to their white counterparts. Gene therapies easily rack up price tags in the millions, and insurance companies, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, are still trying to figure out how to pay for them.\n\n\"Because it's the pharmaceutical industry, if they don't turn around profit, if they cannot test the drug, or if people are unwilling to take it, then this inequity is going to be worsened,\" said Susztak. \"We are essentially going to be creating something that makes things worse even though we are trying to help.\"", "source": {"uri": "vox.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

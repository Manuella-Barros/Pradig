Newsweek reports that the digital archive website the Wayback Machine was able to access the page as of December 3, 2023, but that an attempt to access it on December 10 failed, which suggests it was deleted in the period between.\n\nIn his 2023 memoir, Spare, Harry reflected on what drove him to draft the groundbreaking statement for Meghan, despite the palace's traditional policy of staying silent on such matters. \"We needed a statement out there,\" the Duke of Sussex wrote. \"Within a day we had a draft. Strong, precise, angry, honest.\"\n\nThe message apparently didn't go over well with other members of his family -- namely, with King Charles (still a prince and heir to the throne at the time) and Prince William. Harry described the reactions of his father and brother as \"furious.\"\n\n\"Because they'd never put out a statement for their girlfriends or wives when they were being harassed,\" he continued.\n\nHarry and Meghan, who wed in 2018, ultimately stepped back as senior members of the royal family in 2020. Since, the royal website has undergone several updates in regard to the couple. This past March, the individual profiles of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were merged into one page that combined both of their biographies. The biographies of their children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet, were also removed from the family's homepage.\n\nYou can read Harry's full 2016 statement below.\n\nSince he was young, Prince Harry has been very aware of the warmth that has been extended to him by members of the public. He feels lucky to have so many people supporting him and knows what a fortunate and privileged life he leads.\n\nHe is also aware that there is significant curiosity about his private life. He has never been comfortable with this, but he has tried to develop a thick skin about the level of media interest that comes with it. He has rarely taken formal action on the very regular publication of fictional stories that are written about him and he has worked hard to develop a professional relationship with the media, focused on his work and the issues he cares about.\n\nBut the past week has seen a line crossed. His girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment. Some of this has been very public -- the smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments. Some of it has been hidden from the public -- the nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers; her mother having to struggle past photographers in order to get to her front door; the attempts of reporters and photographers to gain illegal entry to her home and the calls to police that followed; the substantial bribes offered by papers to her ex-boyfriend; the bombardment of nearly every friend, co-worker, and loved one in her life.\n\nPrince Harry is worried about Ms. Markle's safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her.

They gave me an earful. My statement made them look bad, they both said. 'Why in hell?'

But in a shocking twist, they have now quietly removed a VERY significant statement condemning the \"abuse and harassment\" the Suits alum received at the start of her romance with the prince.\n\nAccording to Newsweek over the weekend, The Firm deleted a November 2016 address released by Harry's communications secretary, in which he confirmed his romance and slammed all the racist hatred being sent the actress' way. After being preserved on the website (alongside other press releases and official announcements) for years, the statement was removed late last year!\n\nRelated: When Catherine Is Expected To Return To Public Duties Amid Cancer Battle\n\nIn the statement, his spokesperson said on his behalf (in part):\n\n\"His girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment.

This means it was removed sometime in that timeframe. Wow.\n\nThis is pretty shady for several reasons. Obviously, it signals the royal family is doing everything they can to cut ties with the Archewell co-founders! But to delete this important statement of all statements?? It's not a good look! It's almost like... they don't wish to condemn racist harassment of Meghan Markle??\n\nThe royals have long been slammed by the Sussexes for mistreating the Duchess -- and here they go hiding Harry's big speech in support of his then-girlfriend!\n\nIn his tell-all Spare, the father of two explained how he was advised at this time how \"silence is the best option,\" but that he pushed to clap back anyway. Unfortunately, \"the onslaught continued.\" Plus, the statement only made his father and brother, King Charles III and Prince William, \"furious,\" he dished:\n\n\"Because they'd never put out a statement for their girlfriends or wives when they were being harassed.\"\n\nAnd now they've deleted it from their official site?? Damn! Guess they really were upset by that statement! Little by little, it's like they're trying to erase Harry and Meghan from the royal history books!\n\nReactions, Perezcious readers?

It was the first public confirmation of his relationship with Markle. Harry said then that he was worried about Markle's safety, and called out the \"racial undertones of comment pieces,\" as well as the \"outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments.\"\n\nNewsweek, which first reported the deletion of the statement, says the statement was removed at some point between Dec. 3, 2023 and Dec. 10. 2023.\n\nThe statement also mentioned the private battles Markle had faced because of the media storm caused by her relationship, including legal fights to prevent \"defamatory stories\" from being printed, bribes from press to Markle's exes, and \"attempts of reporters and photographers to gain illegal entry to her home.\"\n\n\"Prince Harry is worried about Ms. Markle's safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her,\" the statement read.\n\nThe decision to make a statement was heralded as shocking by many. Royal press strategy advised Harry, 39, to remain silent about the media attention, but Harry said he wanted to make \"course correction\" quickly, according to his memoir Spare. The decision had angered his father, King Charles, and brother, Prince William, who had never put out a statement in defense of their partners.\n\nPrince Harry and Markle, 42, stepped down as senior royals in January 2020, with the initial idea to split their time between North America and the U.K. The royals had said they wished to become financially independent while supporting the Queen.

The British tabloids went into overdrive trying to learn everything they could about the actress. That's when Harry leaped to protect his girlfriend with a big ask from the press -- leave her alone.\n\nThe strongly worded statement issued by then-Kensington Palace communications secretary Jason Knauf (yes, that Jason Knauf) in November 2016 noted that \"a line has been crossed\" when it came to covering Meghan. \"His girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment,\" read the statement. \"Prince Harry is worried about Ms. Markle's safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her. It is not right that a few months into a relationship with Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm.\" The request worked for a hot minute until the tide turned on the Sussexes completely. Now, the statement has completely vanished from the Royal.uk website, per Newsweek.\n\nThe media outlet pointed out that Wayback Machine last archived the statement, which was located in the press release section of the royal's site, on Dec. 3, 2023. Anything beyond Dec. 10 shows that the statement disappeared from the page. The 2023 year was fraught with headlines from Prince Harry's memoir, Spare, and Omid Scobie's book, Endgame, which corroborated many of the Duke of Sussex's original claims about the couple's treatment behind palace walls. Yet the statement Harry made in 2016 showed how much he loved her from the moment they met. He was worried about her safety as a private citizen, and he's still concerned now that she's his wife.\n\nThe statement came as a result of an awful Daily Mail headline that read, \"Harry's girl is (almost) straight outta Compton: Gang-scarred home of her mother revealed -- so will he be dropping by for tea?\" It was awful, but Harry confronted the issue head-on. \"Some of this has been very public -- the smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments,\" he said in 2016.\n\nA source told The Times in 2022 that Prince Harry was concerned he would lose Meghan because of the press coverage. He wanted to do everything he could to protect her because he knew that no one else would. The insider shared, \"It did feel like that if the palace was not able to stand up and support his girlfriend, against some of that disgusting coverage . . . then who in their right mind would ever consider entering into a relationship [with him] in the future? He definitely felt that if nothing was done to support her, then she would be, 'I'm not sure this is what I signed up for.'\" Now, the palace has erased the statement from its archives forever, perhaps hoping to forget the ugly headlines that taunted Meghan.", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristyn_burtt@sheknows.com", "name": "Kristyn Burtt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghan,_Duchess_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markle,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Markle, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Markle, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suits_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suits (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glamour_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glamour (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time travel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tabloid journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omid_Scobie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Omid Scobie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wayback Machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Compton, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/meghan-markle-prince-harry.png?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605182", "eventUri": "eng-9605182", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-10", "textStart": 1445, "textEnd": 1452}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-11-", "textStart": 677, "textEnd": 690}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

He has never been comfortable with this, but he has tried to develop a thick skin about the level of media interest that comes with it. He has rarely taken formal action on the very regular publication of fictional stories that are written about him and he has worked hard to develop a professional relationship with the media, focused on his work and the issues he cares about.\"\n\nThe statement then goes on to discuss the more outright ways in which Meghan was being harassed -- \"the smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments\" -- in addition to the more insidious acts not seen outright by people -- \"the nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers; her mother having to struggle past photographers in order to get to her front door; the attempts of reporters and photographers to gain illegal entry to her home and the calls to police that followed; the substantial bribes offered by papers to her ex-boyfriend; the bombardment of nearly every friend, co-worker, and loved one in her life.\"\n\n\"[Harry] has asked for this statement to be issued in the hopes that those in the press who have been driving this story can pause and reflect before any further damage is done. He knows that it is unusual to issue a statement like this, but hopes that fair-minded people will understand why he has felt it necessary to speak publicly,\" the plea ends.\n\nLuckily, despite the kinda \ud83d\udc40 news, Meghan and Harry seem to be more unified than ever.

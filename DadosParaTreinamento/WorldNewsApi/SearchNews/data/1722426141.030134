{"id": 243298742, "title": "Skincare lovers beg Aldi to limit how much people can buy as cult-favourite items return", "text": "A cult-classic Dior skincare dupe is back in Aldi, but you might struggle to get your hands on it. Skincare and makeup take a different form in the summer, especially now the weather is starting to pick up. We're no longer interested in thick foundations and oily moisturisers \u2013 and prefer more natural, lighter products that won't sweat off while we're at the pub. Luckily, budget retailer Aldi has launched a range of products in its cruelty-free and dermatologically tested range, Lacura. The Sun Kissed Bronzer and Coral Blusher (\u00a33.99) \u2013 which are both said to be dupes of luxury brand Nars \u2013 have hit the shelves, as well as another holy grail product you may have seen before. The Luminous Lip Oil is officially back as part of the supermarket's Special Buys. Available in both clear or cherry colours, the antioxidant and vitamin E-enriched product is designed 'to moisturise and nourish lips, while leaving them enhanced and full of shine'. Priced at \u00a33.99 for a 10ml bottle, the holy grail product comes in much cheaper than Dior's Universal Clear Lip oil, which costs \u00a332 for just 6ml. \"Which shade will you be grabbing?\" Aldi asked, after revealing the re-launch on Instagram.

Hundreds of shoppers flocked to the comments section to hail the lip oil's triumphant return, sharing the news with their friends. \"Yes!!! Still have my one from my box of goodies last year,\" one user raved. \"Hoping to get a cherry one next.\" Another agreed, commenting: \"These look gorgeous.\" A third added: \"I need badly!\" While a fourth wrote: \"Can't wait!\" However, other users were less impressed about the re-launch, arguing they could never get hold of the product when it was last available. \"Hopefully I can grab some this time!\" one user moaned. \"It would be very helpful to put a limit on maybe one of each shade per customer though, because I've seen so many people on Vinted selling for three times the price after buying a tray full!\" Another agreed, adding: \"People buy in bulk and then sell on eBay.\" What's your favourite Aldi skincare product?

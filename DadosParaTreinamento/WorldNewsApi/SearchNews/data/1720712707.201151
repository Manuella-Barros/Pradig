Toronto police have said they aim to \u201cavoid confrontations\u201d by designating certain areas for those who plan to protest the event, and they have warned anyone engaging in criminal behaviour will be arrested. Officers from numerous other police forces are also present, and a large stretch of Bathurst Street has been blocked off for the march. Marchers encountered two groups of protesters within the first hour of the walk, with police at one point directing a nearby parked bus to obstruct demonstrators\u2019 view of the event. Duelling chants of \u201cfree, free Palestine\u201d and \u201cbring them home\u201d rang out when the groups crossed paths. One of the pro-Palestinian groups encountered along the march route declined a request for comment. The United Jewish Appeal Federation of Greater Toronto\u2019s Noah Shack says \u201ctens of thousands\u201d are expected to attend this year\u2019s event as a show of resilience in the face of \u201can explosion of hate\u201d directed at the city\u2019s Jewish community since the start of the latest war. \u201cWalk with Israel\u201d attendees also include some people whose family members were taken hostage by Hamas. Several groups representing Jews who oppose Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza are urging community members to instead sit with the students at a pro-Palestinian encampment on the University of Toronto campus this morning.", "summary": "Toronto police have said they aim to \"avoid confrontations\" by designating certain areas for those who plan to protest against the walk.", "url": "https://montrealgazette.com/news/national/high-security-protesters-on-hand-at-todays-walk-with-israel-event-in-toronto", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/montrealgazette/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ont-israel-walk-20240609.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:42:40", "author": "The Canadian Press", "authors": ["The Canadian Press"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": 0.32}

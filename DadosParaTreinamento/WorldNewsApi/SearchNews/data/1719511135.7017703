The Manchester United youngster has been one shining light (other than the FA Cup triumph, of course) in an otherwise gloomy season for the club. The 19-year-old established himself as the heartbeat of United's midfield and is now a shoo-in to travel to Germany for the Euros. But it's easy to forget that the campaign actually started horribly for Mainoo. He picked up an injury during the club's pre-season tour of the USA and didn't end up playing again until late November. That said, the Stockport-born star did his best to make the most of the setback, and decided to use his extra free time to learn how to speak Spanish. \"I started Spanish lessons on Zoom just to pass the time a bit,\" Mainoo told The Guardian. \"It\u2019s tough to keep doing them now with the schedule being so busy but now it\u2019s into summer I\u2019ll try to pick it up again because I enjoyed it.\" Mainoo had to shelve the language lessons when he returned to full fitness because he very quickly became a vital cog in Erik ten Hag's side. A few months later he made his England debut and now stands a decent chance of partnering Declan Rice in Gareth Southgate's team this summer. Fittingly, it was his contribution that turned United's dreadful campaign into a semi-memorable one, as he netted what turned out to be the winning goal against Manchester City in the FA Cup final on Saturday, appropriately capping off a wonderful individual campaign. Mainoo has been on United's books since he was nine-years-old, having joined the club's academy in 2014. He quickly rose through the ranks and was offered a professional contract as soon as he was eligible for one, just after turning 17 in 2022. A few months later, Ten Hag called him up to the first team for training, and he was named on the bench for United's clash with Newcastle in October. Though he had to wait until January 2023 to make his debut, starting in a 3-0 win over Charlton in the EFL Cup. He made his Premier League bow a month later against Leicester, though only managed to play once more before season's end. But after impressing Ten Hag during the subsequent pre-season break, a pathway to first team football was immediately laid, even though it took him a while to start walking down it.

{"id": 232086564, "title": "Ukraine says it struck one of Russia\u2019s most advanced warplanes -- for the first time in war", "text": "Ukraine on Sunday said its forces hit an ultra-modern Russian warplane stationed on an air base nearly 600 kilometers (370 miles) from the front lines. The strike came shortly after its Western allies allowed Kyiv to use their weapons for limited strikes inside Russia. But it wasn\u2019t immediately clear what hit the airfield allegedly housing the twin-engine Su-57 stealth jet, lauded as Moscow\u2019s most advanced fighter plane. Its distance from Ukraine suggests it was most likely hit by drones. Kyiv\u2019s main military intelligence service shared satellite photos it said showed the aftermath of the attack. If confirmed, it would mark Ukraine\u2019s first known successful strike on a Su-57. In one photo, black soot marks and small craters can be seen dotting a concrete strip around the parked aircraft. According to the Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine\u2019s Ministry of Defense, the strike took place on Saturday at the Akhtubinsk base in southern Russia, some 589 kilometers (366 miles) from the front line. The Ukrainian agency said that the plane, which is capable of carrying stealth missiles across hundreds of kilometers (miles), was among \u201ca countable few\u201d of its type in Moscow\u2019s arsenal. According to reports by Russian agencies, Moscow\u2019s air force obtained \u201cmore than 10\u201d new Su-57s last year, and has placed an order for a total of 76 to be delivered by 2028. Ilya Yevlash, a spokesman for Ukraine\u2019s air force, told Ukrainian media in April that Moscow was trying to keep its Su-57 fleet \u201cat a safe distance\u201d from Ukrainian firepower. The strike comes after the United States and Germany recently authorized Ukraine to hit some targets on Russian soil with the long-range weapons they are supplying to Kyiv. Ukraine has already used U.S. weapons to strike inside Russia under newly approved guidance from President Joe Biden that allows American arms to be used for the limited purpose of defending Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city. But the airstrip\u2019s distance from Ukraine, as well as unofficial comments from Russia, points to the likely use of Ukrainian-made drones. Since Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion more than two years ago, Kyiv has ramped up domestic drone production and used the munitions to strike deep inside Russia, including a gas terminal near St. Petersburg that lies over 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) north of the Ukrainian border. A popular pro-Kremlin Telegram channel, thought to be run by a retired Russian army pilot, claimed that three Ukrainian drones hit the Akhtubinsk airstrip on Saturday and that flying shrapnel damaged the jet. \u201cIt is now being determined whether it can be restored or not. If not, it would be the first combat loss of a Su-57 in history,\u201d the Fighterbomber channel reported. A military correspondent for Russia\u2019s state-run RIA news agency, Aleksandr Kharchenko, in a Telegram post Sunday denounced Moscow\u2019s failure to build hangars to protect its aircraft. But the post stopped short of directly acknowledging the strike. Russia\u2019s so-called \u201cmilitary bloggers\u201d like Fighterbomber are often seen as sources of information on military losses in the absence of an official Kremlin comment. Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry or senior political figures did not comment Sunday. The ministry on Saturday claimed its forces downed three Ukrainian drones in the Astrakhan region, home to the Akhtubinsk airstrip. Igor Babushkin, the governor of Astrakhan, that same day reported that Ukraine attempted to strike an unspecified facility there, but claimed the attack was unsuccessful. Russia\u2019s Su-57 fleet has been largely absent from the skies over Ukraine, and has instead been used to fire long-range missiles across the border. The U.K. Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence briefing last year that Russia is likely trying to avoid \u201creputational damage, reduced export prospects, and the compromise of sensitive technology\u201d that would come from losing any Su-57 jets in enemy territory. Elsewhere, Ukrainian forces kept up drone attacks on Russia\u2019s southern border regions, according to local Russian officials. Three drones hit Belgorod province late on Saturday, damaging a power line and blowing out windows but causing no casualties, said Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov. Another five drones and a Ukrainian-made missile were brought down over the region on Sunday, the Russian Defense Ministry said. According to an update by Pepel (Ashes), a channel run by Belgorod journalists now based outside Russia, Ukrainian drones on Sunday afternoon struck an ammunition depot outside the town of Rakitnoye, some 35 kilometres (22 miles) from Ukraine. Footage circulating on social media showed thick plumes of smoke rising into the sky. In one video, a woman\u2019s voice is heard, saying \u201cI wonder if soldiers lived there?\u201d Gladkov, the governor, did not directly comment on those claims, but confirmed that a blaze had broken out in a \u201cnon-residential building\u201d near Rakitnoye. He said no one was hurt. Across Ukraine\u2019s front-line provinces, Russian shelling killed at least three civilians and wounded at least nine others on Saturday and overnight, according to reports by regional officials. A man died and two women suffered wounds in the village of Khotimlya, east of Kharkiv, Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said. Shelling also damaged the local school, a council building, a shop and private homes, Syniehubov said. Heavy battles continued in the area as Ukrainian troops try to beat back Russia\u2019s invading forces after a weekslong push by Moscow that sparked fears for Kharkiv, located just 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Russian border, and a wave of civilian evacuations. Russia\u2019s coordinated new offensive has centered on the Kharkiv region, but seems to include testing Ukrainian defenses in Donetsk farther south, while also launching incursions in the northern Sumy and Chernihiv regions. The easing of restrictions on the use of Western weapons will help Ukraine protect Kharkiv by targeting Russian capabilities across the border, according to Ukrainian and Western officials. It is unclear what other impact it may have on the direction of the war, in what is proving to be a critical period. The move drew a furious response from Moscow, and warnings it could embroil NATO in a war with Russia. But Jake Sullivan, Biden\u2019s national security adviser, described it as \u201ccommon sense.\u201d \u201cWhat was happening up around Kharkiv \u2026 was a Russian offensive where they were moving from one side of the border directly to the other side of the border, and it simply didn\u2019t make sense not to allow the Ukrainians to fire across that border, to hit Russian guns and emplacements that were firing at (them),\u201d Sullivan said Sunday in an interview with CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d", "summary": "Ukraine on Sunday said its forces hit an ultra-modern Russian warplane stationed on an air base nearly 370 miles from the front lines.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/09/world-news/ukraine-says-it-struck-one-of-russias-most-advanced-warplanes/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-pg9jndeg4-1717950948231.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1717936599&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/byGKd71x-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:51:30", "author": "Associated Press", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.069}

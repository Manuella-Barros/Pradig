{"id": 227557188, "title": "Schools are supposed to get more arts and music from Prop. 28. In San Diego, could it lead to cuts, too?", "text": "San Diego Unified parents have raised concerns that the way the school district plans to spend voter-approved funding meant to expand arts programs could actually reduce elementary schools' existing music instruction. The money comes from Proposition 28, which voters passed in 2022 to create new ongoing funding dedicated for public schools to spend on arts programs, such as music, visual art, theater and dance. The law requires that schools only use the money to increase arts programs and funding \u2014 not reduce or take the place of existing ones. Already, growing numbers of advocates, parents and school staff across California have been raising alarms that some districts appear to be misusing Prop. 28 money to pay for current staff and programs. San Diego Unified is using Prop. 28 money to change how it offers elementary arts instruction for next school year to provide more prep time for classroom teachers \u2014 but it has not clearly explained whether or how schools' existing music programs will be affected. That has caused confusion among parents who say they have been told their schools' music programs will be cut because of the changes. Many parents have also said they felt blindsided by the changes and did not get to give input beforehand. In response to parents' public comments at two recent board meetings, Superintendent Lamont Jackson said he is working with staff to \"make sure that our commitment to the arts is foundational\" and that the district is not using Prop. 28 money to supplant existing programs. \"I'm working with staff to identify what reductions we've made, why we made those reductions, if it's proportionate to the reductions in loss of students, the use of Prop. 28 funds, so that we are not supplanting but we are supplementing,\" Jackson said at a board meeting last week. For San Diego Unified elementary schools, music is the most common visual and performing arts program offering. How much and what kind of music instruction students can get depends on their school. Most elementary schools have access to a team of itinerant teachers who teach fourth- and fifth-graders. At those schools, fourth-graders receive general music instruction, while fifth-graders get to choose from options like band, orchestra and choir. Dozens of other elementary schools, however, get only a general introductory music education that is only for fifth-graders. Parents now fear those music offerings could change, or be reduced, due to changes the district is making to elementary arts programs that relate to Prop. 28 and a new agreement the district made with the teachers union last year. The district promised the teachers union that starting next school year, it will essentially double the amount of planning or prep time it gives every classroom teacher. Under their new contract, the district now has to provide three hours of planning time every two weeks, up from 90 minutes. To help meet that higher prep time quota, the district is having elementary arts teachers relieve classroom teachers by covering that prep time with their own arts enrichment. The district says it hired 22 new elementary arts teachers for this current school year to help cover it. How much arts enrichment each school gets is based on how much Prop. 28 funding it gets, which in turn is based on enrollment and how many high-needs students attend, district spokesperson Maureen Magee said in an email. The district is using Prop. 28 to fund arts enrichment. More than three-quarters of the district's 122 elementary schools will only get arts enrichment for the equivalent of no more than two days a week, according to preliminary staffing allocations approved by the school board last week. About 30 elementary schools \u2014 like Webster, Lafayette, Whitman and the special education school Riley/New Dawn \u2014 will only get arts instruction for the equivalent of one day or one half-day a week. Out of the district's 122 elementary schools, only the Logan Memorial Educational Campus will get arts instruction five days a week. But based on those limited amounts of time, and with more students to teach, parents worry that music teachers will be stretched so thin that the more intensive music programs they have long enjoyed \u2014 like fifth-grade band, orchestra and choir \u2014 will no longer be feasible. Loren Keagle, a parent of two students at Dailard Elementary in the San Carlos neighborhood, told the school board at a meeting last week that his early music education taught him all the lessons he needed to be successful in his current technology career, including time management, teamwork, individual discipline and a drive for self-improvement. Keagle enrolled his two boys in Dailard largely because of the school's music program. His fourth-grader participated in the school's wind band, and his first-grader has been learning violin through the school's program. He was shocked to hear that the music program could shrink next year because of how the district is restructuring its arts programs and funding. \"I thought surely after Californians passed Prop. 28 that we would finally have some respite against school districts constantly cutting arts programs,\" he said. \"How can it be that we\u2019re losing a critical, foundational music program in my child's school when we have access to this new large pot of funding that appears to promise to expand these programs?\" San Diego Unified has not yet released a plan outlining exactly how it will spend the roughly $14.8 million in Prop. 28 funding it received this school year. Prop. 28 requires districts and charters to disclose how they are using their Prop. 28 funds in an annual, board-approved report. They have to say what arts programs they are paying for and exactly how many teachers, support staff and school sites are providing them, as well as how many students they are serving. Districts aren't required to finalize such a report until later this summer. Individual school sites are also required to write plans for spending their Prop. 28 funds, but the state does not require them to be published on their district's website nor be submitted to the state. The parent concerns about San Diego Unified come as scores of advocates are raising similar concerns that other school districts may be misusing Prop. 28 funds. A group of almost 90 arts advocates \u2014 including former Los Angeles Unified superintendent Austin Beutner, who had authored Prop. 28 \u2014 told state leaders last month that they fear some districts are using the money to pay for existing arts staff and programs, in violation of the law. They say districts are not using the money to hire more arts staff or expand programs, as the measure intends, but are merely using it to plug budget deficits by eliminating existing arts funding and swapping in Prop. 28 funds. Advocates say districts have incentive to do so, considering that California is in the midst of a tight budget year while federal pandemic relief funds are set to expire this fall. \"We are concerned that some school districts are making decisions without input from their communities and not complying with Prop 28\u2019s supplement requirements by using the funds to replace existing arts education funding,\" the group wrote in a letter to the governor, state superintendent and leaders of both legislative chambers. \"For example, some school districts are encouraging arts education teachers to resign, promising to rehire these teachers using Prop 28 funds.\" Pauline Crooks, arts coordinator for the San Diego County Office of Education, said she has seen districts in the county that appear to be using the money in a way that conflicts with state law, though she declined to identify them. \"I voted for this as a parent so that my child would have an increased access to arts education. That's what we wanted our taxpayer dollars to go towards \u2014 not to switch funding around,\" Crooks said. It's disappointing to see districts misusing Prop. 28 funds, Crooks said, because arts programs can motivate kids to come to school and help them love it more. Arts programs can also be a draw to help boost enrollment at schools where it's declining. \"This is an incredible opportunity to minimize chronic absenteeism and discipline issues ... and all those things we talk about as challenges in our schools,\" Crooks said. \"We know the arts can bring and help keep kids in school, so not to use this funding ... to address that is a huge missed opportunity.\" According to the state law, it's up to districts' hired auditors to certify whether districts used Prop. 28 funds properly, including following the \"supplement, not supplant\" requirement. The state department of education is aware of concerns about how the money is being spent, said department spokesperson Liz Sanders in an email. \"(The department) takes such concerns very seriously and is working directly with district leaders to ensure that all statutory requirements are understood and followed,\" Sanders wrote. She said it is working to support the funding's appropriate and effective use but is not trying to take over the accountability task from auditors. It's unclear if San Diego Unified is using some Prop. 28 money to pay for existing teachers. When asked whether the district removed elementary arts teachers from their current jobs to reassign them into positions funded by Prop. 28, Magee said the district is still mulling its budget needs and staffing assignments for next school year. San Diego Unified officials said the district is adding arts programming through the prep time increase. Magee noted the district's hiring of almost two dozen additional arts enrichment teachers. \"It's not supplanting. It's helping meet that requirement through this funding source to be able to double the amount of enrichment at every elementary school,\" said Kyle Weinberg, president of the San Diego Unified teachers union.", "summary": "Some parents worry the district's restructuring of its arts programs could effectively reduce music offerings at elementary schools", "url": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/education/story/2024-06-02/prop-28-is-supposed-to-fund-arts-and-music-in-schools-in-san-diego-unified-could-it-force-cuts", "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2014eaa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+170/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3a%2Fa1%2Ffcb42305468ea73f09df81e2e758%2F1214261-sd-me-studen", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:00:01", "author": "Kristen Taketa", "authors": ["Kristen Taketa"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.079}

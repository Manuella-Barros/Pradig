(Photo by Robert Cianflone/Getty Images) Getty Images These days, the vast majority of new albums hit their peak on the Billboard charts the week they debut. The goal in today\u2019s music industry is for any artist to launch their latest collection as high as possible, because chances are that interest in the title will wane, and it will begin to fall after it arrives. This is not true for every musician and every album, and that\u2019s evidenced this week with one rising title. Post Malone\u2019s greatest hits compilation, named The Diamond Collection, is doing better than ever before, thanks, in part, to his massive new hit single. The Diamond Collection rises to No. 12 on the Billboard 200 this week. That marks the title\u2019s best-ever showing on the ranking of the most-consumed full-lengths and EPs in the U.S. Malone\u2019s compilation\u2013which features his diamond-certified singles\u2013lifts from No. 15 this time around. According to Luminate, the project moved 29,863 equivalent units in the past tracking period. That\u2019s actually down ever so slightly\u2013less than 1%\u2014but due to it being a fairly quiet frame on the tally, the multi-genre star is able to climb. The Diamond Collection is inching closer and closer to becoming Malone\u2019s sixth top 10 album on the Billboard 200. It only needs to climb two more spaces to reach the loftiest tier, though whether it will be able to do so or not is anybody\u2019s guess. As The Diamond Collection jumps up the Billboard 200, it\u2019s also performing well on other charts. The collection lifts one rung to No. 3 on the Top Rap Albums ranking. That\u2019s just one rung below its No. 2 high point. The set is a non-mover on the Top Streaming Albums list at No. 12\u2013also one space behind its peak.

The hip-hop favorite dropped the collection to celebrate becoming the musician with the most diamond-certified songs in U.S. history. The short project featured his eight such wins, as well as a new single from his most recent album. The Diamond Collection is surging thanks, at least in part, to Malone\u2019s new single, \u201cI Had Some Help\u201d with Morgan Wallen. The track officially brings the Grammy nominee into the country field, which is something he\u2019s spoken openly about wanting to try. \u201cI Had Some Help\u201d debuts at No. 1 on several Billboard charts, including the Hot 100, where it brings both musicians back to the summit. The same cut is also new at No. 1 on several genre-agnostic lists, like the Streaming Songs and Digital Song Sales charts. In the country world, it\u2019s the biggest hit on almost every tally, as it rules the Hot Country Songs, Country Streaming Songs, and Country Digital Song Sales rosters.

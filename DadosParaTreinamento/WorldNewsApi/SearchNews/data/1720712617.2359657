My airline canceled the flight, and I could not get another flight. So, I had to cancel my hotel reservation. I contacted Traveluro, and a representative agreed to cancel my reservation and give me a full refund. But the refund showed up in my account as \u201cpending\u201d and then completely dropped off. It was never fully processed. I filed a credit card dispute with my bank, but my bank denied my request. Traveluro is extremely hard to get in touch with. I call, and it rings once, then hangs up on me. I\u2019ve been trying for months! The one time I got through \u2014 other than my first call \u2014 a representative said they would escalate the situation and that somebody would call me within 24 to 48 hours. That never happened. Please help me get my $444 back! \u2014 Jessica Radosevic, Danville ANSWER: If Traveluro promised you a refund, it should have delivered one. First of all, you might be wondering what Traveluro is. It\u2019s an online travel agency operated by Holisto, a company based in the United States and Israel. Traveluro offers support in several European languages, which is perhaps where the \u201curo\u201d part comes from. So, why didn\u2019t Traveluro refund your hotel? First, online agencies don\u2019t control refunds on nonrefundable rooms. They would have to ask the hotel in Las Vegas for a waiver, which would take some time. It looks as if Traveluro tried to get your money back \u2014 hence the \u201cpending\u201d refund. But it ran out of time when you decided to file a credit card dispute. A credit card dispute means you are asking your bank to reverse a transaction because it\u2019s fraudulent, or you didn\u2019t receive the product or service you ordered. I have more on how chargebacks work in my ultimate guide to credit card disputes on my consumer advocacy site, Elliott.org. So, what went wrong? I mean, besides trying to call an online agency, which is usually a bad idea. (Always email to create a paper trail.) Well, it turns out the company was able to secure a full refund for your hotel, according to Elad Shmilovich, Holisto\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cHowever, in parallel, the customer submitted a charge-back, which prevented the refund from being fully processed,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why the customer saw a pending notification, which disappeared.\u201d \u201cNot to worry,\u201d Shmilovich added. \u201cI\u2019ve asked my ops team to issue a new refund, which should already be in her account.\u201d Ah, I love a happy ending! But there\u2019s an important lesson here for the rest of us. When a company promises a refund, you have to give it time. Sometimes a refund to your credit card can take up to two billing cycles, which is more than two months. If you lose patience and file a credit card dispute, it doesn\u2019t just stop the refund process. It can actually reverse it, ensuring that you never end up getting your money.

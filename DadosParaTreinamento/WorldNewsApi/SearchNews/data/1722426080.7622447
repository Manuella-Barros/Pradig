Simon Brown There are various hotels in New York that have terraces attached to suites. But only one has its suite terraces accessorized with grass, ferns and cedars that a Brooklyn landscape designer, Brook Landscape, tends to every week. Warren Street Hotel does, just one hint of the detail that co-Founder and Creative Director Kit Kemp included in her plans. Anyone who has stayed in one of Kit and Tim Kemp\u2019s Firmdale Hotels, of which this hotel which opened in February is the latest, knows her exuberant, colorful style. But the attention to detail is always surprising. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Kit Kemp also picked the albums for the turntable in the Songbird Suite- Amy Winehouse and David Bowie among them.) An orange wing chair by the elevators flanked by zigzag wallpaper and a Terry Frost painting. Laurie Werner It's obvious that this hotel has a different slant to it even before you go inside. Mixed in with the red brick buildings along Warren Street, this new build is a cool blue, sleek with floor to ceiling glass. Entering the lobby, you don\u2019t know where to look first: the tower of baskets installation by Argentine artist Cristi\u00e1n Mohaded by the front wall, the large artwork by Ugandan artist Sanaa Gateja composed of paper beads, the veined black marble statue. And all of the color: saffron, orange, royal blue framed by multicolored zigzag wallpaper. By the elevators, an orange wing chair with slashes of yellow, blue and green sits under a large Terry Frost painting of yellow and orange orbs and stripes. Even in the elevators, there are vibrant swaths of fabric and cut out figures: Jack in the Boxes or theatrical characters\u2014so many places to look. The soothing Drawing Room. Simon Brown The Drawing Room nearby is intentionally calmer in subtle reds, salmon pink and beige but it\u2019s also filled with details to examine and different patterns, a Kit Kemp trademark also on view in the 69 individually designed rooms upstairs. As in her other hotels, it\u2019s a source of wonder: how did she know that patterns in so many different directions could actually co-exist and enhance each other instead of violently clashing? But they do and the overall effect is both lively and appealing. Also relaxing since the rooms are filled with supremely comfortable furniture in cozy fabrics that invite touching.

Russia\u2019s War On Ukraine: News And Information From Ukraine Vivid fabric headboards are a trademark of the rooms in Firmdale Hotels. Simon Brown Firmdale restaurants always deliver satisfying, well-executed menus that appeal to a variety of tastes and Warren Street Bar & Restaurant does as well. Among the lunch and dinner choices are a lobster roll with tarragon aioli, squash blossoms with lemon-basil ricotta and Romanesco and Hanger steak au poivre. But it\u2019s also an essential stop for a top-of-the-line afternoon tea served on Kit Kemp designed bone china: Coronation chicken and smoked salmon sandwiches, pastries such as mini canel\u00e9s, chocolate opera cake and mango and pistachio profiteroles along with the requisite scones and clotted cream. Meals are served in the main and equally colorful restaurant, the light alleyway Orangery or with a limited menu on the bright yellow rooftop. The bar at Warren Street Restaurant & Bar Simon Brown For additional outdoor options, it\u2019s a short walk to the World Financial Center and Brookfield Place with its string of restaurants with seating options overlooking North Cove Marina. Taking a table at P.J. Clarke\u2019s on the Hudson and ordering clams or oysters from the restaurant\u2019s new raw bar is a good idea; it will make anyone feel that they\u2019re not really in the city. And Warren Street adds the sense that you\u2019re in a completely different and much more interesting world. Warren Street Bar & Restaurant Orangery Simon Brown Follow me on Twitter.

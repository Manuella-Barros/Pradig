The 56-year-old singer looked radiant at the New York City event for I Am: Celine Dion, an upcoming Prime Video documentary that goes inside her life as a legendary performer. The film also chronicles Dion's battle with a rare neurological disorder, stiff-person syndrome (SPS). The \"Queen of Power Ballads\" stunned in an all-white look that included a long skirt and an elegant long-sleeved blouse. She accessorized with a silver belt, matching bracelets, and stud earrings. Ren\u00e9-Charles, 23, opted for a black suit and coordinating dress shoes. Dion shares Ren\u00e9-Charles, as well as twins Nelson and Eddy, with her late husband, Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil. Ang\u00e9lil died in 2016 from throat cancer. I Am: Celine Dion is described as \"a love letter to her fans\" in a press release. The official trailer, released in May 2024, shows snippets from Dion's career as well as confessional-style interviews. \u201cMy voice is the conductor of my life,\u201d she says, adding that recently \u201cit\u2019s been a struggle\u201d to do what she loves most due to her condition, which causes muscle spasms. The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now! \u201cI miss it so much,\u201d Dion adds in the trailer. \u201cThe people, I miss them. If I can\u2019t run, I\u2019ll walk. If I can\u2019t walk, I\u2019ll crawl.\u201d Directed by Oscar nominee Irene Taylor, I Am: C\u00e9line Dion premieres on Prime Video on June 25. Since being diagnosed with SPS in 2022, Dion has largely stayed out of the spotlight but made a surprise appearance at the 2024 Grammy Awards in February. The five-time Grammy Award-winning singer received a standing ovation as she graced the stage to present the award for album of the year to Taylor Swift. For the awards show, Dion wore a floor-length baby pink Valentino gown with a pleated bodice. She accessorized with Tiffany & Co. jewelry including a 12+ carat diamond necklace, 6-carat pear-shaped cocktail ring and diamond bracelets. She added a long caramel coat (also Valentino) over her gown and her hair was styled into a sleek bob. \"It was very nerve-wracking, but at the same time, a big honor,\" she said of the appearance during an April 2024 interview forVogue's \"Life in Looks\" series. \"That magic. That excitement. To see the fans, to see the crowd. To see show business again.\" Dion's stylist Law Roach shared his gratitude on Instagram for the opportunity to work with the singer again. \"This makes me so much Joy! Not just to dress my Queen again but the fact that she\u2019s HEALTHY AND HAPPY! The UNIVERSE always PROTECTS and PROVIDES Thank you @maisonvalentino @pppiccioli@f3nardi @tiffanyandco@michaelmclaughlin2@matthewreisman and of course Thank you Celine for allowing me to share this triumphant moment with you,\" Roach captioned a photo of him and Dion.

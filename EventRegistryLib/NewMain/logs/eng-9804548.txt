Only one race out of up to a maximum of six was held at the Marseille Marina on Aug 8.\n\nBut the two-time world champion noted that waiting was a normal part of the sport, saying: \"You come to kiting and and sometimes the weather doesn't play ball, and sometimes it just doesn't work out.\n\n\"So you get used to it and I've been competing long enough so that it doesn't really bother me to wait around. I mean, of course, it's a shame to wait.\"\n\nWhile the mixed dinghy and multihull medal races were completed earlier in the day, the kitefoiling competition started with the men's and women's semi-finals after a two-hour delay owing to a lack of wind.\n\nUnder the scorching sun in Marseille, Maximilian maintained his cool and appeared relaxed in the athletes' area, listening to Austrian composer Johann Strauss and replying to messages of support from supporters.\n\nIn the semi-finals, Austria's Valentin Bontus and Italy's Riccardo Pianosi earned their spots to join Maximilian and Slovenian Toni Vodisek in the final. The latter two had qualified direct from the opening series.\n\nVodisek, 24, entered the four-athlete final with two match points, needing just one race win in the first-to-three series to clinch gold, while Maximilian needed two as he carried just one point over.\n\nBut the regatta served up yet another dramatic twist as Bontus took the first race ahead of Maximilian, who finished second, to draw level with the Singaporean on one match point.\n\nA drop in the wind delayed the start of the second final race, with the wake from the surrounding boats causing Vodisek and Bontus to fall into the water ahead of the start. Bontus struggled to his kite up again in poor wind conditions and the organising committee then decided to postpone the race to Aug 9 as it was past the local cut-off time of 5.37pm.\n\nAs things stand, Vodisek, who finished last in the first race of the final, still has the upperhand going into the final day of racing with two match points in hand. He just needs to win one race to clinch the gold.\n\nBontus and Maximilian both need two race wins on Aug 9 to finish at the top of the podium, while Pianosi needs three.\n\nThe regatta ends once one kitefoiler gets three match points, with the standings for the rest determined first by the number of race wins they have. If there is a tie, it goes down to the result of the final race.\n\nIf no racing takes place on Aug 9 and things remain as they are, Vodisek will take gold, while Bontus and Maximilian will take silver and bronze respectively based on the results from the latest race.\n\nReflecting on his sole race of the day, Maximilian expressed surprise at how he recovered from a blip before the start as he went from foiling to touching the water.\n\nHe explained: \"Right before the start, probably my wing tip came out... I went from foiling (and) basically crashed into the water, but I didn't fall off the board.\n\n\"I managed to recover immediately, come back up and so yes, I was slower for a couple of seconds, meaning that everyone went ahead.\"\n\nMaximilian is glad to have another chance to race on Aug 9. He said: \"Everything remains the same in terms of strategic approach and procedure I follow.\n\n\"The only thing that does change is I'm no longer in a silver position, I'm holding a bronze position. If there's no racing tomorrow, I go home with a bronze medal.\n\n\"But of course we hope to get racing tomorrow.\"\n\nAs she waited on the shore, Maximilian's mum Teng Hwee Keng told The Straits Times that she has gotten used to the delays at kitefoiling competitions.\n\nShe said: \"This is something that happens quite often in this sport and I'm quite used to it because my husband is a glider pilot and it's also a nature sport.\"\n\nThe 52-year-old also shared a message of support for Max: \"We love you, Max. Enjoy, be happy, the world is your oyster.\"", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kimberly_kwek@straitstimes.com", "name": "Kimberly Kwek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marseille"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marseille"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kite", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_Kite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula Kite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boat_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boat racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multihull", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multihull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinghy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dinghy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Strauss_II", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Johann Strauss II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gliding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Straits_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Straits Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oyster"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Races", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Races", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2024/08/09/2024080984982488img2762.jpg?VersionId=TUCQhKkTvaqbDmPqxqpmn1l0xXdhEkF8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804548", "eventUri": "eng-9804548", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marseille"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 378, "textEnd": 383}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 2063, "textEnd": 2068, "freq": 4}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Since no race can start later than 5:37 p.m., the next competition was pushed back to Friday.\n\nDuring the first final race on Friday afternoon, Bontus kept an early lead and sped through the finish line, setting himself up to starting the next final race with two wins like Vodisek.

Maximilian's podium finish in the men's formula kite at the Olympics on Aug 9 is no surprise given his track record in recent years. In 2024, he swept every trophy on offer, including retaining his world championship title.\n\nBut the 17-year-old faced a slightly harder path to a medal than in any of his other events this season.\n\nLight winds at the Marseille Marina made the regatta challenging, with many hours spent on shore as the sailors waited for the wind to pick up. Of the 16 races that were scheduled in the opening series, only seven took place.\n\nIt was a volatile leaderboard over the first four days of racing, with the standings in flux as riders tried to navigate the conditions.\n\nSlovenia's Toni Vodisek led after the first day as Maximilian finished third before the latter rose to the top of the standings the day after.\n\nBut the former reclaimed his lead after the third of racing, with Maximilian slipping to second, and the standings remained the same on Aug 7 with the lack of wind resulting in the cancellation of all races on the last day of the opening series.\n\nVodisek, 24, had the upperhand going into the final as he earned two match points by virtue of being the top qualifier from the opening series, needing just one race win in the final to clinch gold. Maximilian, who carried over one match point, needed two wins to claim the title.\n\nBut a late twist saw Vodisek handed two penalties resulting in 1.1 points being deducted before the start of the final on Aug 9.\n\nWith Austria's Valentin Bontus winning both races on Aug 9, the 23-year-old claimed gold ahead of his rivals at the Marseille Marina, with Vodisek and Maximilian settling for the silver and bronze respectively.\n\nMaximilian's journey to clinching an Olympic medal started more than a decade ago.\n\nHis competitive streak was evident from a young age - Maximilian, whose father Valentin is Swiss and mother Hwee Keng is Singaporean, was already competing in ski races when he was four and did not like to lose.\n\nBut soon, another sport would capture his attention. He was introduced to kiteboarding by his father Valentin when he was six and transitioned to kitefoiling four years later.\n\nMaximilian then started doing the sport competitively the following year and at 11, he declared his ambition to become a world champion, a goal he first achieved in 2023 before he claimed his second consecutive world title in May.\n\nHe won the first of three world youth championship titles when he was 14 and along the way also picked up three European Championships titles, as well as the Asian Games gold in 2023.\n\nThe precocious teenager now has a coveted Olympic medal in an already impressive resume, joining a select group of Singaporeans medallists at the quadrennial Games.\n\nFor years, weightlifter Tan Howe Liang's silver from Rome 1960 was the Republic's sole Olympic medal.\n\nThe women's table tennis team of Li Jiawei, Feng Tianwei and Wang Yuegu then clinched a silver at Beijing 2008 before bagging a bronze at London 2012, where Feng also won an individual bronze.\n\nFour years later, Joseph Schooling snagged the country's historic gold in Rio de Janeiro.

Maximilian's podium finish in the men's formula kite at the Olympics on Aug 9 is no surprise given his track record in recent years. In 2024, he swept every trophy on offer, including retaining his world championship title.\n\nBut the 17-year-old faced a slightly harder path to a medal than in any of his other events this season.\n\nLight winds at the Marseille Marina made the regatta challenging, with many hours spent on shore as the sailors waited for the wind to pick up. Of the 16 races that were scheduled in the opening series, only seven took place.\n\nIt was a volatile leaderboard over the first four days of racing, with the standings in flux as riders tried to navigate the conditions.\n\nSlovenia's Toni Vodisek led after the first day as Maximilian finished third before the latter rose to the top of the standings the day after.\n\nBut the former reclaimed his lead after the third of racing, with Maximilian slipping to second, and the standings remained the same on Aug 7 with the lack of wind resulting in the cancellation of all races on the last day of the opening series.\n\nVodisek, 24, had the upperhand going into the final as he earned two match points by virtue of being the top qualifier from the opening series, needing just one race win in the final to clinch gold. Maximilian, who carried over one match point, needed two wins to claim the title.\n\nBut a late twist saw Vodisek handed two penalties resulting in 1.1 points being deducted before the start of the final on Aug 9.\n\nMaximilian's journey to clinching an Olympic medal started more than a decade ago.\n\nHis competitive streak was evident from a young age - Maximilian, whose father Valentin is Swiss and mother Hwee Keng is Singaporean, was already competing in ski races when he was four and did not like to lose.\n\nBut soon, another sport would capture his attention. He was introduced to kiteboarding by his father Valentin when he was six and transitioned to kitefoiling four years later.\n\nMaximilian then started doing the sport competitively the following year and at 11, he declared his ambition to become a world champion, a goal he first achieved in 2023 before he claimed his second consecutive world title in May.\n\nHe won the first of three world youth championship titles when he was 14 and along the way also picked up three European Championships titles, as well as the Asian Games gold in 2023.\n\nThe precocious teenager now has a coveted Olympic medal in an already impressive resume, joining a select group of Singaporeans medallists at the quadrennial Games.\n\nFor years, weightlifter Tan Howe Liang's silver from Rome 1960 was the Republic's sole Olympic medal.\n\nThe women's table tennis team of Li Jiawei, Feng Tianwei and Wang Yuegu then clinched a silver at Beijing 2008 before bagging a bronze at London 2012, where Feng also won an individual bronze.\n\nFour years later, Schooling snagged the country's historic gold in Rio de Janeiro.", "source": {"uri": "tnp.straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Paper"},

Austrian Valentin Bontus, who won the decisive Race 3, took gold while Slovenia's Toni Vodisek clinched silver.\n\nStanley Chan, 46, deputy president of the Singapore Sailing Federation, said: \"Congratulations to Max. It was a great race and he has got the only medal (at Paris 2024) for Singapore. It has been such close racing. We are all so proud of him and he is only 17.\n\n\"People forget that he is still a teenager and he is achieving these things. There are still more medals to come. He has always said in his interviews that his endeavours in the sport is about what he can do for the country too and he has really brought so many people together over the last few days, especially today on National Day.\"", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "deepanraj_ganesan@straitstimes.com", "name": "Deepanraj Ganesan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Sailing_Centre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Sailing Centre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Coast Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sailing (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Schooling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Schooling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marseille", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marseille"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marseille"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Day_(Singapore)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Day (Singapore)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Sailing_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore Sailing Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2024/08/09/Dgsail09.ab0587b3.Attachment.134339.jpg?VersionId=J9czE9hoxnhifzUh47WKDeyjI5puYaNu", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804548", "eventUri": "eng-9804548", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 374, "textEnd": 379}], "sentiment": 0.5921568627450979, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

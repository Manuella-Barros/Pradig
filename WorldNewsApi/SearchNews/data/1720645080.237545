On an emotional afternoon at Wembley as the sport celebrated Rob Burrow, who died aged just 41 on Sunday after his battle with motor neurone disease, the Super League champions were simply too good for Sam Burgess\u2019 side. After a poignant rendition of Abide With Me by Katherine Jenkins, with huge Burrow banners unfurled at both ends of Wembley, there was an impeccable minute\u2019s silence for the Leeds Rhinos legend. And when the action kicked-off, it was reigning Man of Steel French who came up with the goods, creating one try, scoring himself and having another ruled out as he claimed the Lance Todd Trophy as player of the match. It means Wigan become the first club since St Helens in 2007 to hold all four trophies of Challenge Cup, Super League, World Club Challenge and League Leaders\u2019 Shield. They eventually eased home - even after a chaotic and brutal opening three minutes that saw both side see players sin-binned. Peet made a bold call by bringing veteran prop Mike Cooper, 35, in for the banned England front-row Tyler Dupree. Many expected second-row Sam Walters to be brought into the squad but he had to make do with 18th man duties. When Cooper was yellow carded after just two minutes Peet must have feared he\u2019d got it badly wrong. The ex-Warrington forward copped Josh Thewlis high with a swinging arm and could have few complaints with Chris Kendall\u2019s decision. But barely 60 seconds later, the Wolves were also down to 12 men. Aussie full-back Matt Dufty collared Liam Marshall high prompting a melee near the touchline. Television cameras panned to Peet in the coaching box who was visibly incandescent as well. Kendall brandished his yellow card again but once everything calmed down it was Warrington who took an 11th minute lead with Thewlis\u2019 penalty. That was about all that they got right in an error-ridden half. Wigan got off the mark when Zach Eckersley latched onto Bevan French\u2019s dabbed kick in the 17th minute. The 20 year-old academy product was only playing because Aussie centre Adam Keighran was also suspended earlier in the week with Dupree. Indeed, it was only his fifth appearance for the club but what a way to mark it. Harry Smith improved and, when Matty Ashton spilled his high kick, Wigan were in again on 23 minutes. Slick stand-off French was too elusive for the Warrington defence from a scrum 10m out, easily stepping inside the onrushing Toby King to accelerate over. Smith converted again and a catalogue of Wolves mistakes meant they could get no foothold in the game. Lachlan Fitzgibbon fumbled, Dufty spilled playing the ball, Nicholson dropped trying an offload and even England captain George Williams passed into touch near his own line. French almost scored again after that last error, stretching over from the scrum, but video referee Liam Moore ruled the 28 year-old didn\u2019t have control. It was a huge let-off for Burgess\u2019 side. But they didn\u2019t make the most of it. They improved slightly in the second half but never enough to truly trouble Wigan. Williams gave Ashton half a chance in the 43rd minute but Eckersley and French got across to deny the England winger. Their last-tackle options were poor and Peet\u2019s side never really had to go up through the gears. It means when Jai Field, the fleet-footed Aussie full-back who had Warrington nervy every time he took possession, slipped Liam Farrell through a gap in the 57th minute it was all but done. The Wigan second-row, who turns 34 next month and won his first final in 2011, sped through and had the confidence to step inside Dufty\u2019s poor attempted tackle to score. Smith added the last of his three goals for an 18-2 lead his side never looked like relinquishing. Warrington put some passes together finally to see Dufty slice over in the 63rd minute, Thewlis converting. But they toiled after that and could have no arguments.", "summary": "WOLVES 8-18 WARRIORS: Aussie stand-off, 28, claims the Lance Todd Trophy after helping Wigan to 18-8 win over Warrington as rugby league celebrates Rob Burrow's life at Wembley", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/wigan-warriors-warrington-rob-burrow-32989509", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32989416.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Warrington-Wolves-v-Wigan-Warriors-Betfred-Challenge-Cup-Final-Wembley-Stadium.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:19:28", "author": "David Craven,David-Craven", "authors": ["David Craven", "David-Craven"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.365}

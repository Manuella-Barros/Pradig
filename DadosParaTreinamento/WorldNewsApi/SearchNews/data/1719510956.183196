In an interview with PTI, Shah claimed that his party has not resorted to any religion-based campaign but insisted that if canvassing against reservation for Muslims, and reaching out to voters on the abolition of Article 370 and implementing a Uniform Civil Code is religion-based campaign, then the BJP has done it and will continue doing so. He dismissed the opposition's criticism of the Election Commission for its handling of poll data and the issue of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), saying that similar protocols and practices have been followed in previous assembly polls, including Telangana, West Bengal and Himachal Pradesh where the BJP lost. \u201dIf those elections were fair, then this election is also fair. When you see defeat, you start crying in advance and try to find excuses to go abroad. This can't go on and on. They want to go on vacation on June 6. So, they are telling something or the other,\u201d he said. The Congress's questions about the polling process is aimed at covering up Rahul Gandhi's failure, he said. Shah said the opposition party had not offered any such suggestion at the customary all-party meeting called by the poll watchdog before the elections. \u201dWhenever the opposition loses an election, they raise some questions. There is zero possibility of rigging in EVMs and they want an election which can be rigged.\u201d With six phases of the seven-phase Lok Sabha polls over, the BJP's key strategist said the party's assertion that its alliance will cross the 400-seat mark when the poll results are out on June 4 is not merely a poll slogan but a well thought-out goal. He said, \u201dWe will surely cross 400 seats. We will also form governments in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh.\u201d Assembly polls in the three states have been held alongside the Lok Sabha elections. \u201dIf we get 399 seats and you say we have not crossed 400, then it is your wisdom. But the \u2018400 paar' slogan is based on calculation and considered opinion,\u201d Shah said in his characteristic combative and sure-footed manner. Asked if the party was overly dependent on Modi and if a relatively weak opposition was benefitting from its alliance, he said it was not a negative but a positive vote which the ruling alliance is receiving. \u201dThis is not a negative vote. Please accept one thing. This is a positive vote. We will get people's support where (in states) we are in power. And mark my words\u2026where we are not, we will be getting a bigger mandate. So this is a positive mandate for the work of the central government,\u201d he said. As Modi has brought to fruition the BJP's core ideological plans, be it the poor's welfare, a secure country, abrogation of Article 370, a uniform law (UCC) across the country, women's reservation and Ram temple, his popularity naturally becomes the strength of the BJP, he added. \u201dHe is our biggest leader.\u201d He accused the main opposition party of misleading people on the issue of Muslim reservation, insisting that its accusation that the BJP has been telling a lie rings hollow as it has already implemented such a religious quota in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. \u201dIf they divide the truth in pieces to mislead people, then isn't it our duty to put these pieces together and inform people,\u201d he said, defending Modi's intense attack on the Congress over the religious quota and the issue of redistribution of wealth. \u201dYou might have heard and understood Rahul Gandhi's X-ray speech. So you want X-ray of what? And if you want to distribute it equally, then who will you distribute to? Manmohan Singh Ji said minorities are their priority. What do you make of this,\u201d he asked when questioned about the Congress's allegations against Modi. To a question about the Congress's promise of giving Rs 1 lakh to women in poor households, he said the party has a history of making populist assurances to come to power but never fulfilling them. Shah said, \u201dThey are in power in two-three states. They should at least fulfil this promise there. At least start giving Rs 1,500 which you promised (in Himachal Pradesh). You are talking about Rs 1 lakh, at least start giving Rs 1,500. Who will trust them.\u201d Making his projection for the BJP in the states where the ruling party is eying major gains, he said it will anywhere between 24 to 30 seats in West Bengal and 16-17 in Odisha. Its alliance will bag nearly 17 seats in Andhra Pradesh. The three states have 42, 21 and 25 Lok Sabha seats, respectively. Shah claimed that the BJP is set for a maiden majority in the Odisha assembly and expects to win 75 seats in the 147-member House. Its alliance will storm to power in Andhra too, he said. People are angry with the Mamata Banerjee-led government over issues of corruption, cow and coal smuggling and infiltration, and the Sandeshkhali issue has exposed as to what extent she can stoop in her appeasement politics, he said. With Modi spearheading the BJP's push in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, two states where the party has been so far unable to make much headway, in these polls, Shah said the party will certainly increase its vote share in the Dravidian state. He said, \u201dIt is a very tight contest. We have a new team. I will not make an estimate with figures. But our seats and vote share will increase and we will certainly lay a strong foundation in Tamil Nadu. We can open our account in Kerala. We are in a good position in three seats.\u201d", "summary": "<p>NEW DELHI, May 26: Union Home Minister Amit Shah has asserted that the BJP will get a bigger win in opposition-ruled states due to a \u201cpositive mandate\u201d for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Lok Sabha polls, as he slammed the opposition's criticism of the Election Commission as a ploy to cover up for its [&#8230;]</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://thenorthlines.com/amit-shah-asserts-that-campaigning-on-religious-lines-is-unacceptable-but-bjp-will-continue-to-highlight-issues-like-article-370-ucc-and-opposition-to-muslim-quota/\">Amit Shah Asserts that Campaigning on Religious Lines is Unacceptable, But BJP Will Continue to Highlight Issues Like Article 370, UCC, and Opposition to Muslim Quota</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://thenorthlines.com\">Northlines</a>.</p>", "url": "https://thenorthlines.com/amit-shah-asserts-that-campaigning-on-religious-lines-is-unacceptable-but-bjp-will-continue-to-highlight-issues-like-article-370-ucc-and-opposition-to-muslim-quota/", "image": "https://thenorthlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/north-24-parganas-union-home-minister-amit-shah-during-a-public-meeting-for-lok-.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:58:04", "author": "Northlines", "authors": ["Northlines"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.35}

This ruling is not going to stop the fight for Oklahomans against activists using ESG in state.\" Russ also said he is preparing to appeal the order.\n\nOklahoma is a major U.S. oil and gas producing state.\n\nAn attorney for Keenan declined to comment.\n\nLegal experts say the judge's decision, while specific to Oklahoma law, may illustrate legal vulnerabilities of other \"anti-boycott\" laws passed by Republicans in other states.\n\nRobert Skinner, a lawyer at the law firm Ropes & Gray, said \"the principles animating the court's reasoning should resonate broadly\" in other states with similar laws.\n\n\"Many of these statutes are vulnerable to the same critique -- that using pension assets as a political tool for the supposed 'protection' of particular industries runs afoul of state law mandates that pensions must be managed solely in the interest of retirees,\" Skinner said.\n\nBryan McGannon, managing director of sustainable investment organization US SIF, said the judge's action shows the anti-ESG laws are not in beneficiaries' best interests.\n\n\"Financial professionals, ultimately, should have the freedom to make the best investment choices for their beneficiaries without partisan legislative interference,\" McGannon said.\n\n(Reporting by Clark Mindock in New York and Ross Kerber in Boston; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi, Bill Berkrot and Daniel

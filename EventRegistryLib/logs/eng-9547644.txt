A friend and former SMU teammate, Teddy Knox, was traveling 116 mph in a separate car, and he faces the same charges as Rice.\n\nSeven people were left with injuries, including at least one woman who sustained \"serious bodily injury\" and another who was stranded on the highway with her 4-year-old son for about five hours after the crash.\n\nOn April 3, Rice said he took \"full responsibility\" for his actions related to the crash.", "source": {"uri": "islandpacket.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Island Packet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@islandpacket.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashee_Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rashee Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_Owls_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rice Owls football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WFAA", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WFAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Dallas Morning News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMU_Mustangs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SMU Mustangs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas\u2013Fort_Worth_metroplex", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knox_College_(Illinois)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knox College (Illinois)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Grains_and_Legumes", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Grains and Legumes", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Grains", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Grains", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Grains", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Grains", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/ia2zk/picture287574560/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/575f307a-911e-4189-bd23-c8a9e0b4b638", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547644", "eventUri": "eng-9547644", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-30", "textStart": 668, "textEnd": 676}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-03", "textStart": 1332, "textEnd": 1339}], "sentiment": -0.388235294117647, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

The incident occurred early Monday at the Lit Kitchen club.\n\nWhile there aren't any more reported details as of Tuesday afternoon, the incident marks Rice's second potential run-in with the law in Dallas this spring. Rice was born in Philadelphia but went to high school in the Dallas area and stayed in the region for his college football career at SMU.\n\nThe second-year Chiefs wide receiver is already facing eight charges stemming from a hit-and-run crash in late March -- six counts of collision involving bodily injury as well as one count of aggravated assault and one count of collision involving serious bodily injury.\n\nRice could face a suspension under the NFL's personal conduct policy as a result of March's hit-and-run crash.\n\nThe Chiefs have prepared themselves well if Rice faces a lengthy suspension. Kansas City added to a thin wide receiving corps by signing Marquise Brown to a one-year deal in free agency, and the Chiefs filled out the room by selecting Texas speedster Xavier Worthy with their first-round pick in April's draft.\n\nRice would still be an integral part of Kansas City's offense when on the field. He came on strong late in his rookie season as one of the few pass-catchers Patrick Mahomes seemed to fully trust, and he also has a bit of a different skillset than Brown and Worthy, who both have smaller frames and rely on their speed. Rice has a larger frame and didn't look one-dimensional at all in 2023.\n\nThe Chiefs have Mahomes, which puts them in a strong position regardless of who's catching the ball. Still, Rice's availability could be significantly impacted if he faces additional charges in this separate case.\n\nMORE: How experts graded Chiefs' NFL Draft haul\n\nRice racked up 938 yards and seven touchdowns as a rookie, finishing second among rookies in receiving yards behind only Rams record-setter Puka Nacua.\n\nThe SMU product became more trusted by Mahomes as the season went on, hauling in at least six catches in five of his last six regular season games.

Nobody had it better than Rice in early February.\n\nThen the 23-year-old started acting like he's got a 12-year-old's brain. He started doing foolish things. Dangerous things. And, yes, possibly illegal things.\n\nAnd now, three months later, Rice's future and career are uncertain.\n\nThe latest trouble came Tuesday when Dallas law enforcement began an investigation into an incident in which Rice allegedly struck a photographer at a high-end nightclub, according to Dallas TV station WFAA.\n\nThe incident happened early Monday at the Lit Kitchen & Lounge in downtown Dallas, where Rice apparently partied Sunday night and into Monday's early morning hours.\n\nDallas police have reportedly been interviewing witnesses to get as full an account of the incident as possible before taking next steps.\n\nAnd my question to Rice is why were you even there to begin with? Again, what are you thinking?\n\nNever mind that nothing good happens in a bar or club after midnight, something Hall of Fame coach Bill Parcells used to tell his players all the time.\n\nIt's just that Rice is already in enough trouble and doesn't need even one situation more to go sideways and complicate matters.\n\nRice, you see, is free now on $40,000 bond after he was arrested on eight counts connected to a hit-and-run accident he was involved in on March 30. That crash, a six-vehicle pileup, happened when Rice and some of his friends were allegedly racing along a Dallas highway.\n\nThe rented Lamborghini Rice was driving was allegedly traveling at 119 MPH.\n\nRice has already said in a statement he plans to take responsibility and will make everyone involved whole, but that hasn't stopped two victims from filing a civil suit against Rice and former SMU cornerback Teddy Knox, who also was allegedly speeding in Rice's Corvette.\n\nRice is facing six counts of collision involving bodily injury, one count of collision involving serious bodily injury and one count of aggravated assault in connection with this wreck.\n\nIf convicted of all these charges, Rice faces a combined sentence of up to 60 years in jail.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there.\n\nAfter the accident, Rice and his friends decided to leave the scene. There is actual video of them simply walking away. Yes, the bad decisions are coming in droves.\n\nLaw enforcement is still weighing whether to add charges for that offense.\n\nSo, amid that accident, the NFL and Kansas City Chiefs are weighing the matter.\n\nThe NFL's official stance is it is monitoring the first incident as it moves through the legal system. Rice is subject to suspension under the collectively bargained Personal Conduct Policy.\n\nHe is probably already in violation of the policy because this has brought negative publicity to himself, his team and the NFL - a no-no within the policy.\n\nThe NFL is not commenting on the latest incident with the photographer.\n\nThe Chiefs, meanwhile, are hopeful Rice can emerge from the problems he's created and help the team. But everyone saw them select speedy Texas receiver Xavier Worthy in the first round of the draft last month.\n\nThe team has not yet announced a decision on whether to let Rice attend Phase III of its offseason conditioning program or the veteran minicamp that follows.\n\nSo, facing a six-course meal of trouble, why would Rice put himself in a position to add a terrible dessert?\n\nDoesn't he understand that his mere presence at a ritzy nightclub the first week of May isn't going to play well in civil court when it's juxtaposed with the lives of his victims as they try to recover from their injuries?\n\nDoesn't he realize that any incident in which he becomes entangled - such as, say, hitting someone in a bar - puts him at risk of jail time for failing to comply with the conditions of his bond?\n\nRashee Rice probably got an idea to go out Sunday night and have a nice time. Harmless enough. But he should have considered that idea and immediately dismissed it out of hand.\n\nAm I suggesting the guy should become a hermit until all his legal problems are resolved?

Harwood Street in Dallas, which is the location of Lit Kitchen nightclub.\n\nThe Morning News, citing an incident report it obtained through an open records request, said the photographer told police he had left a party but then was told to come back when the \"suspect\" messaged him on Instagram.\n\nThe photographer, according to the incident report the Morning News acquired, told police he found the suspect and was asked to read Instagram messages on the suspect's phone; when the photographer did that, he said the suspect punched him on the left side of his face.\n\nAccording to the Morning News, Dallas police officials have identified Rice as the \"suspect\" in the report.\n\nThe Morning News reported Tuesday that a man was taken to the hospital in relation to the incident with non-life-threatening injuries. Police told the Morning News the man had \"visible swelling on one side of his face.\"\n\nThe Chiefs, when reached earlier this week, had no comment.\n\nTuesday's report was the latest offseason news for Rice, who in March crashed a leased Lamborghini Urus into a freeway median in Dallas, starting a chain-reaction collision of vehicles.\n\nThe arrest affidavit in that case stated Rice was driving 119 mph some 4.5 seconds before the collision. Videos also showed Rice leaving the scene without attempting to render aid to other drivers.\n\nDallas Police later announced that Rice, 24, faced eight charges for his role in the crash. Rice turned himself in to authorities before being released on bond.\n\nRice's charges from the car wreck include six counts of collision involving bodily injury. There is also one count of aggravated assault and one count of collision involving serious bodily injury. The count of aggravated assault is a second-degree felony, while the count of collision involving serious bodily injury is a third-degree felony.\n\nRice remained with the Chiefs following that incident.

Just months after the Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver caused an accident by speeding a Lamborghini in the Dallas area with a friend, it looks like he could be involved in a fresh affair with the law regarding a possible assault.\n\nAccording to the WFAA, Rice is under investigation by the Dallas police for allegedly hitting a photographer inside a club in the city, and the police is interviewing witnesses for the incident, which allegedly happened on Monday. It's still early in the investigation and no further details have been made available.\n\nRice turned himself in to the Dallas police a month ago for his role in the Lamborghini crash, which led to the wide receiver facing eight counts. If they indeed arrive at the conclusion that an assault happened, his situation with the law and the NFL won't be getting any easier.\n\nIs Rashee Rice facing a suspension?\n\nThe league has not made any official comments on Rice's case as they're still doing their own diligence, but it's likely that he'll miss at least six games for his role in the Lamborghini crash as a violation of the NFL's Personal Conduct Policy (PCP).\n\nA month ago, Rashee Rice released a statement where he confirmed his role in the incident:\n\n\"Today I met with Dallas PD investigators regarding Saturday's accident,\" Rice said in a social media statement. \"I take full responsibility for my part in this matter and will continue to cooperate with the necessary authorities. I sincerely apologize to everyone impacted in Saturday's accident.\"\n\nThe accident involved six cars in total, which was certainly a bad look.

Regardless, what is now clear is that he is currently under investigation after allegedly hitting a photographer at a Dallas club. If that's the case, it's yet another blemish on an increasingly questionable track record.\n\nRashee Rice is in trouble once again\n\nAccording to reports on Tuesday, Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice is currently under investigation following an incident in Dallas, Texas. As per reports, law enforcement officials have begun the process of interviewing witnesses regarding what exactly occurred. To be clear, Rice is currently facing a multi-game suspension due to his involvement in a car crash that involved multiple vehicles. Indeed, the accident appears to have been the result of the 24-year-old's participation in a street race, which in turn saw him and several other individuals fleeing the scene after the multi-car collision occurred.\n\nUnbelievably, What followed was a manhunt that later saw Rice turning himself in to the police before finally being released on bond. The Chiefs' player now faces eight charges in the case: six counts of collision involving bodily injury, one count of collision involving serious bodily injury, and one count of aggravated assault. It is understood that Rice was the driver of the vehicle that caused the six-car crash. An arrest warrant affidavit later confirmed the idea that Rice was traveling at a speed of 119 mph when the accident occurred.\n\nAt this point, it remains unclear as to what comes next, but it goes without saying that Rice has done himself no favors. Where his onfield contribution is concerned, there can be no question that Rice was a critical part of the Chiefs' march to a second consecutive Super Bowl title.

Officers have begun the process of interviewing witnesses about the incident, per the report.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs receiver is already slated to face a multi-game suspension from the NFL for his involvement in a multi-car crash Rice, who turned himself into the police last month before being released on bond, faces eight charges in the case: six counts of collision involving bodily injury, one count of collision involving serious bodily injury and one count of aggravated assault.\n\nRice was driving the vehicle that ultimately led to the six-car crash. His top speed, 119 miles per hour, occurred right before the crash, per an arrest warrant affidavit acquired by the Dallas Morning News.\n\nObviously, the news of his alleged assault of a photographer is not good for Rice, who as a rookie last year played a key role in the Chiefs' successful title defense. But off-field issues could derail Rice's promising career.\n\nBoth Rice and SMU cornerback Theodore Knox are being sued for $1 million by two victims in the crash on March 30. Plantiffs Irina Gromova and Edvard Petrovskiy are suing for $1 million on account of their severe injuries that include \"trauma to the brain, lacerations to the face requiring stiches, multiple contusions about the body, disfigurement, internal bleeding and other internal and external injuries that may only be fully revealed over the course of medical treatment,\" according to the court document.\n\nThe Chiefs, likely expecting that Rice wouldn't be available to start the season, selected former Texas wideout Xavier Worthy with the 28th overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft. Worthy, who ran an NFL Combine record 4.21-second 40-yard-dash, has turned heads during his initial practices with Kansas City.\n\n\"It's going to be fun to play in this offense,\" Worthy recently said, via The Athletic. \"I played every (receiver) position at Texas.

He led the team with seven touchdowns receiving in the regular season.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The second-year wide receiver has gone from standout on-field rookie to off-field concern in a hurry.\n\nRice's latest issue stems from an alleged assault of a photographer at a Dallas nightclub. This comes roughly a month after Rice surrendered to Dallas police on April 10 after being charged with eight felonies, including aggravated assault, for a hit-and-run high-speed crash on March 30.\n\nThe NFL already was doing its due diligence into what kind of disciplinary action Rice would face from the first incident as a violation of the league's personnel conduct policy. Multiple reports have the Chiefs expecting a lengthy suspension, up to half of the 2024 regular.\n\nNow with the news of the additional assault probe coming not long after the first major misstep, there are questions on whether on the Chiefs should part ways with the talented 24-year-old receiver. Here's looking at when Kansas City officials can expect to know Rice's fate and whether they might take action before the league does.\n\nNFL SCHEDULE RELEASE: What we know about 2024-25 announcement\n\nAll indications are, given Rice's pivotal role in the multi-car crash tied to high-speed racing, that the legal process will play out this summer. The next court hearing for the lawsuit that also includes co-defendant Theodore Knox is scheduled for June.\n\nAlthough the league, via commissioner Roger Goodell, has said it will be patient for a Rice resolution in the courts, it would be surprising if an announcement isn't made before the regular season kicks off in September. There's a slim chance nothing is resolved within the 2024 calendar year.\n\nThe Chiefs used a first-round draft pick on a wide receiver, Xavier Worthy and also signed Marquise Brown in free agency. Kansas City needed to replace free agents Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Richie James, but given their aggressiveness to trade up for Worthy, they have a strong contingency should Rice not be available for an early-season stretch.\n\nLast season, the Chiefs saw wide receiver Justyn Ross plead guilty to domestic battery and criminal property damage charges in late October. He was put on the Commissioner's Exempt List later that week and quickly drew a six-game suspension to keep him out from Weeks 8-14.\n\nRice's charges are different but still serious. He turned himself in to police on April 10 for the crash-related felony charges. There was swift action taken on Ross by the NFL during the regular season. The fact Rice ran into trouble rather early this offseason points to the Chiefs knowing Rice's upcoming unavailability sometime in training camp.\n\nRoss crossed the line with the personal conduct policy. Rice endangered lives with his behavior. If Rice already was being considered to miss half the 2024 season for the fallout of the crash, six games looks like his minimum.\n\nThe range of 8-12 games also can't be ruled out given the multiple charges. There was no drunken driving or death involved with his charges, but Rice is in line to be suspended as many as 10 games when you factor in the multiple incidents.\n\nRice, a second-round pick from the 2023 NFL Draft, is in Year 2 of four-year rookie contract worth just less than $6.5 million. Around $3.5 million of that has been guaranteed with a signing bonus and his salaries for the first two seasons.\n\nThere's no reason for the Chiefs to get rash with Rice. He counts only $1.5 million toward the cap and would cost the team more against the cap with a release and eating $2.33 million in dead money.\n\nThe Chiefs have prepared well for Rice missing games, which could end up being a good chunk of the season, but they also know how valuable he was as a target for Patrick Mahomes down the stretch and into the postseason.

The photographer also did not respond to The Dallas Morning News' request for a statement on Thursday and earlier in the week.\n\nRice turned himself in to the police in April after allegedly causing a multivehicle collision\n\nThe new allegations came behind Rice surrendering himself to police after he allegedly caused a multivehicle crash that injured at least seven people in Dallas on March 30.\n\nAccording to an arrest warrant affidavit, the 2024 Super Bowl winner was driving a vehicle at 199 mph while SMU football player Teddy Knox drove another at 116 mph before the incident. Footage showed Rice and four other men leaving the scene after the crash without checking to see if anyone needed medical attention, according to authorities.\n\nRice and Knox each faced one count of aggravated assault, one count of collision involving serious bodily injury, and six counts of collision involving bodily.\n\nThe pair posted bond after turning themselves in two weeks after the collision.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Dallas Morning News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightclub", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nightclub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashee_Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rashee Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_Owls_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rice Owls football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMU_Mustangs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SMU Mustangs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knox_College_(Illinois)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knox College (Illinois)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/09/22/84680847-0-image-m-55_1715289906862.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547644", "eventUri": "eng-9547644", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-30", "textStart": 2280, "textEnd": 2288}], "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Dallas police sources have reportedly commenced the investigation by interviewing witnesses about the altercation that allegedly took place at 609N. Harwood Street. The location is notably listed as the address for Lit Kitchen & Lounge, attached to Feu Nightclub.\n\nThe Dallas Morning News further relayed the happenings on the scene, which law enforcement officials supposedly confirmed.\n\nAlso read | Pro-Palestine protesters arrested at NYC's Fashion Institute of Technology as Israel moves into Rafah\n\nA police spokesperson stated that officers were dispatched to a club in the 600 block of North Harwood Street, near Federal Street, in response to reports of an assault at about 2:30 am Monday.\n\nNew reports informed that the alleged victim - a man - was transferred to the hospital with \"non-life-threatening injuries. He reportedly had \"visible swelling on one side of his face.\"\n\nAdditionally, regarding Rice's involvement, officials claimed that Rice, a former Richland High School star, was accused. They did not confirm other names, stating, \"It is not our practice to release or confirm a suspect identity during an investigation.\"\n\nReports also claim that as of Tuesday afternoon, no charges were filed, implying there were no records of Rice's recent arrest.\n\nAlso read | Vanderpump Rules Season 11 Reunion: Ariana Maddix has had enough of Tom Sandoval | Watch the explosive trailer\n\nMerely a month ago, the police tied Rice to eight charges when a multivehicle crash left at least seven people injured on March 30 in Dallas. Back then, Rice and SMU footballer Theodore 'Teddy' Knox were said to have been driving two luxury sports cars that were ultimately connected to the speed-racing accident.\n\nAccording to The Dallas News Morning, an arrest-warrant affidavit states that Rice was driving 119 mph before the cars collided in the 6600 block of North Central Expressway.

On top of the legal issues and lawsuit he is facing, Rice is expected to be disciplined by the NFL, resulting in at least a multi-game suspension.\"\n\nWith Rice facing a potential suspension, Schefter revealed that Kansas City is hosting Zay Jones on a free agent visit.\n\nZay Jones was released from the Jacksonville Jaguars on April 30 after he signed a three-year, $24 million contract in 2022. Since being released, he visited the Dallas Cowboys, Tennessee Titans and Arizona Cardinals.\n\nZay Jones could fill a void in Chiefs' wide receiver room\n\nWith Rashee Rice's status up in the air, Kansas City is looking to add to its receiver room.\n\nLast season with the Jaguars, Jones played in eight games as he recorded 28 receptions for 274 yards and two touchdowns. He dealt with injuries last season after a productive first season in Jacksonville, as he had 82 receptions for 823 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nKansas City already added to their wide receiver room in the draft by selecting Texas Longhorns wide receiver Xavier Worthy in the first round.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cole_shelton@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Cole Shelton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashee_Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rashee Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_Owls_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rice Owls football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zay_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zay Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Smith_Sr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Smith Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeSoto,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DeSoto, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "DeSoto, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavier University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Longhorns_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas Longhorns football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Grains_and_Legumes", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Grains and Legumes", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Grains", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Grains", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Grains", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Grains", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/22242582-1715261827.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547644", "eventUri": "eng-9547644", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-10", "textStart": 312, "textEnd": 319}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-30", "textStart": 398, "textEnd": 406}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 1546, "textEnd": 1554}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Rice is a suspect in an alleged assault that injured a man at a Dallas nightclub, according to Dallas Morning News. It's the latest offseason trouble for the SMU product who has been emerging as a big-time receiver for the Super Bowl champions. This comes after his arrest for involvement in a six-car crash in Dallas in March, leaving at least seven people with injuries.\n\nThe former second-rounder is already facing multiple charges from that car crash so it seems like this recent incident could be enough for the Chiefs to move on. As of this posting, Rice's attorney and the Chiefs have no comment. Rice is already facing a multi-game suspension so the troubles are just piling. It sounds like the Chiefs made the logical move to select Xavier Worthy from Texas in this year's draft to be his possible replacement.\n\nHowever, the Chiefs are being patient with the SMU product but that could always wear out. It seems like if the NFL decides to suspend him for one season then they could release him. Head Coach Andy Reid said he is letting law enforcement handle the situation and they will revisit to see what his future holds with the team. However, one can wonder how long this will play out until the team eventually wants to do the waiting game.\n\nIt was looking like the Chiefs were going to be without a receiver this season. The team was also able to acquire Marquise Brown on a one-year deal for veteran help. It sounds like the opinions and talking heads wanting the Chiefs to cut Rice may come sooner than expected.\n\nBreakout Receiver Rashee Rice Could Be Released Imminently\n\nThe Release May Come Soon\n\nThe punishment of his release isn't close to what is facing in real life. Rice could be facing jail time, so it's hard to envision that the Chiefs move on from him. He has every right to defend his actions but the case doesn't look promising on his side. It makes one think if his on-field talent can mask the amount of off-field issues he's been facing this offseason.\n\nThe Chiefs are already investing so much in the SMU product, especially coming off an explosive rookie season. During his rookie year, he was able to notch 79 receptions for 938 yards and seven touchdowns while adding more yards on their playoff this season. Kansas City probably wouldn't have made it another second consecutive Super Bowl without his contributions. It's why the team saw potential in the SMU product by selecting him in last year's draft with the second pick.\n\nHowever, Worthy probably needs a year to adjust to the scenery of the NFL but they have Marquise Brown. They have other weapons like Travis Kelce and Kadarius Toney that Patrick Mahomes can use. The Chiefs may need one more veteran addition to be a reliable weapon while Worthy adjusts and can team alongside Brown. Here are some late-minute wide receivers the Chiefs could add.\n\nPossible Wide Receivers Free Agents\n\nThere were rumors that Tyler Boyd could sign with the team but he just signed a contract with the Titans this week. This leaves the receiver market wearing thin after Odell Beckham Jr. agreed to terms with the Miami Dolphins. However, guys like Michael Thomas and Zay Jones are still available. It's not a big need for the Chiefs but one drastic injury could leave the receiving corps in shambles.\n\nThe team won't be able to afford a trade for Tee Higgins, Brandon Aiyuk or Deebo Samuel so a cheap signing would be logical.", "source": {"uri": "lastwordonsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Last Word on Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Put simply, he claimed that the former SMU standout needed to spot and avoid trouble-laden situations before they happened.\n\n\"So when you already have eight felony charges pending against you, what are you doing?\" Florio said on 'Pro Football Talk.' \"Putting yourself even in a position where you can be credibly accused of doing something you shouldn't have done?\n\n\"That's the problem here.

Worthy, picked 28th overall in the 2024 NFL Draft, was picked by some to be the successor to Tyreek Hill. The wide receiver was praised for his speed as arguably the fastest player in the draft.\n\nOf course, as Rice might be secretly hoping, players as fast as Worthy rarely come with the hands and durability of Hill.\n\nAt this point, the team might be hoping for a quieter second half of an offseason that has seen headlines draped across publications like it is still the regular season, for many of the wrong reasons.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ian_van_roy@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Ian Van Roy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashee_Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rashee Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Dallas Morning News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_Owls_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rice Owls football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMU_Mustangs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SMU Mustangs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Worthy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavier Worthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyreek_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyreek Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Grains_and_Legumes", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Grains and Legumes", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Grains", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Grains", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Grains", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Grains", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/22453001-1715186965.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547644", "eventUri": "eng-9547644", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.388235294117647, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Officers from the Dallas Police Department were called to the scene at 2:30 AM, per the Dallas Morning News.\n\nThe alleged victim, a photographer, was taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

Instead, members of the alleged suspect's entourage alerted them of the photographer's presence.\n\nThe suspect then asked to look at the photographer's phone, and while they looked down at the phone, they proceeded to punch the complainant on the left side of his face.\n\nRice is already in trouble with the NFL over a high-speed car crash in April that injured at least seven people. He is currently facing one count of aggravated assault, one count of collision involving serious bodily injury and six counts of collision involving injury.\n\nRice and SMU cornerback Theodore Knox are being sued for $1 million each by two victims in said crash.

Patrick Mahomes was instrumental in the Atlanta Falcons choosing Michael Penix Jr. in the 2024 Draft\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs are facing a potential void at the wide receiver position due to Rashee Rice's legal troubles. With Rice being the subject of two investigations, the team is exploring their options and considering potential replacements. However, there is a possibility that Rice could be cleared from the newest investigation, adding a layer of uncertainty to the situation.\n\nIn light of these developments, the Chiefs are set to meet with veteran wide receiver Zay Jones this Thursday. Jones has been on the radar of multiple teams, including the Tennessee Titans, Arizona Cardinals, and Dallas Cowboys. His recent release from the Jacksonville Jaguars has opened up opportunities for him to explore new options in the league.\n\nJones' time with the Jaguars saw him achieve career highs in catches and receiving yards, but his second term with the team did not unfold as planned. Following the team's signing of Gabe Davis and the drafting of Brian Thomas Jr., Jones was released from the Jaguars' roster late last month.\n\nThe Chiefs' decision to bring in Jones for a visit reflects their proactive approach to addressing the potential absence of Rice. Furthermore, the team's recent draft pick of Xavier Worthy at No. 28 overall suggests their commitment to bolstering their receiving corps.\n\nRice, who played a pivotal role as a premier wide receiver for the Super Bowl champions in his rookie season, is facing the likelihood of a suspension following his involvement in a hit-and-run incident in March. This has created uncertainty around his availability for the upcoming season.\n\nIn addition to the hit-and-run incident, Rice is under investigation for an alleged assault on a photographer at a nightclub on Monday. The outcome of this investigation could further impact his standing with the team.\n\nThe potential absence of Rice has prompted the Chiefs to consider alternative options to support star quarterback Patrick Mahomes. As they brace for the possibility of Rice being sidelined, the team is navigating through a challenging situation as they prepare for the upcoming season.\n\nIn the midst of these developments, the Chiefs are actively evaluating their roster and exploring potential reinforcements to ensure they are well-equipped for the challenges ahead.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_Owls_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rice Owls football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Penix_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Penix Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zay_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zay Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabe_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gabe Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Worthy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xavier Worthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/d50848fa69606fd8faeb540c44716513/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/05/09/17152736444108.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547644", "eventUri": "eng-9547644", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

WFAA reported on May 7 that Rice was \"under investigation for allegedly hitting a photographer at a club in Dallas\" early Monday morning.\n\nWhile Chiefs Kingdom grapples over Rice's off-the-field issues, a 2023 scouting report regarding his character resurfaced. NFL analyst Bob McGinn listed Rice as the sole player under \"Scout's Nightmare.\"\n\nMcGinn wrote of the SMU alum, \"Has the size (6-0 \u00bd, 205), speed (4.42), athletic ability (41-inch vertical jump) and production (233 receptions, 25 touchdowns) to be a high draft choice. At least one team, however, has removed him from its draft board because of behavioral issues. 'He's talented, but not a good dude,' one personnel director said.\"\n\nFans and analysts strongly reacted to McGinn's harsh assessment. The Athletic's Dan Duggan posted, \"Sure this was decried as being wrong to report about a draft prospect at the time. It's definitely a fine line to anonymously quote people making critical comments like this. But the objective is to inform, even if that means reporting negative info.\n\n\"And just to be clear, reports like this don't cause players' stocks to drop. The players drop because the teams are aware of the character concerns, whether they're reported or not.\"\n\nSI's Albert Breer posted, \"In my experience, people in the media decrying these reports are often the ones who don't have access to this kind of information. The information, though, is usually commonly known among teams and -- while there are exceptions -- almost always accurate.\"\n\nThe Chiefs felt his talent outweighed the red flags raised, and selected him as their No. 55 overall pick.\n\nIn addition to the felony charges, KCTV 5 reported Rice is facing two lawsuits stemming from the car accident that injured several people.\n\nA few weeks later, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid fielded questions on if the organization still trusts Rice. \"Yeah, listen, as long as he's learned from it. That's the important part of it,\" Reid said, per SI's Jordan Foote. \"We'll take it from there and see what takes place, but right now we're just kind of gathering everything and trying to make sure we have all the bases covered.\"\n\nWith Rice under police investigation just a few weeks later, fans and analysts are worried. 610 Sports Radio host Cody Tapp posted, \"Chiefs might have a problem. Way too much trouble for your first offseason.\" AtoZ Sports' Charles Goldman wrote, \"Someone needs to get in this kid's ear quickly or I'm afraid he's not long for the NFL.\"\n\nThe Dallas Police Department told TMZ in a statement following the nightclub altercation, \"A victim reported being assaulted by a suspect. The victim self-transported to a local hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.\" The police did not confirm Rice's involvement.\n\nFox 4 KC's Harold R Kuntz posted, \"Police spokesperson says officers were dispatched about 2:30 am Monday morning for report of an assault,\" at Lit Kitchen & Lounge in downtown Dallas. \"No charges have been filed and no record of recent arrest.\"\n\nWhile conflicting reports swirl over the length of Rice's suspension, there's also a matter of when. Depending on how the legal process plays out, his suspension might get delayed until 2025.\n\n\"If his case wraps up, then there is potential the NFL could issue its discipline and he would likely be suspended,\" Rapoport said, per Goldman. \"If the case is still ongoing, as we've seen with several others, then likely he'd be eligible to play this season. Discipline would be handled the following season. So the timing is really an issue, not whether or not he'll actually be suspended.\"\n\nAccording to NFL insider James Palmer, the Chiefs are \"expecting\" Rice's suspension to be \"half a season at least.\"\n\nWhile Chiefs Digest's Matt Derrick predicted a punishment more in the 2-to-6 game range, that changed following the latest incident. \"OK, well, now it might be eight games or more,\" Derrick posted. \"Let's see what the facts tell us though.\"", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_bicks@heavy.com", "name": "Emily Bicks",

On Tuesday, one of Rice's pre-draft scouting assessments resurfaced, initially posted as part of a series by Bob McGinn of Go Long. The scout assessed Rice as talented, but \"not a good dude,\" which led to at least one team removing him from their draft board due to potential behavioral issues.\n\nThat comment certainly looks prescient now that Rice suddenly cannot stay out of trouble. The Chiefs probably will not have him for an extended period of time next year as a result.\n\nThe Chiefs have been willing to take chances on controversial players in the past, with decidedly mixed results.

Patrick Mahomes made it work with a pretty underwhelming group of wideouts.\n\nThey've done just that, as they added free agent Hollywood Brown and drafted Texas speedster Xavier Worthy with the 28th-overall pick. Those two, plus second-year stud Rashee Rice had the makings of a great group to pair with Travis Kelce as pass-catching weapons for the Chiefs.\n\nBut, it seems likely that they're going to be without Rashee Rice for at least some of the season, if not all of it. Off-the-field issues are piling up for the SMU alum.\n\nRice has been charged with multiple felonies after driving a luxury automobile at unsafe speeds and causing a multi-car crash in the Dallas area in March. And, he's being investigated for allegedly assaulting a photographer at a club on Monday.\n\nBetween the two incidents, one has to assume that Rashee Rice will get a pretty significant suspension from the league office when it's all said and done.\n\nSo, they're back to needing wide receiver depth. That's a problem they're trying to solve, quickly.\n\nAccording to Adam Schefter, the Chiefs are going to bring in former Jaguar and current free agent wide receiver Zay Jones in for a visit this week.\n\nJones has been a productive receiver in the past, especially in 2022. That year, he had 82 catches for 823 yards and 5 touchdowns. The East Carolina alum was a second-round pick in 2017 by the Buffalo Bills and also spent time with the Raiders.\n\nUltimately, this would be a smart insurance move for the Chiefs to make due to Rice's uncertain status.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "garrett_carr@brobible.com", "name": "Garrett Carr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashee_Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rashee Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Worthy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xavier Worthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_Owls_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rice Owls football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMU_Mustangs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SMU Mustangs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas\u2013Fort_Worth_metroplex", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Carolina_Pirates_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Carolina Pirates football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zay_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zay Jones"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rashee-Rice3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547644", "eventUri": "eng-9547644", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Police have said the men didn't stop to see if anyone needed medical attention or provide any of their information.\n\nRice and Knox each face one count of aggravated assault, one count of collision involving serious bodily injury and six counts of collision involving injury.

Mandatory Credit: Lucas Peltier-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIs there trouble brewing in the Kansas City Chiefs camp? It seems Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid might have some personnel issues on their hand in the upcoming season. One of their star receivers, Rashee Rice has had a controversial run-in with the law. The decorated wide receiver is now under allegations of assaulting a photographer in a nightclub in Dallas. While these allegations still remain under police investigation, Rice's image continues to take a hit.\n\nWith these assault allegations, Rice has been named for unlawful activities twice this off-season. Earlier in the off-season, the WR was named in a six-car accident situation in Dallas. With his legal trouble count up to two, his presence with the Chiefs might be in danger.\n\nAs per Marca, the Chiefs have a zero-tolerance policy for off-field misconduct. So there remains a chance that his activities might affect his future with the Chiefs. This, in turn, is going to affect Reid's plans for the team as well as Mahomes' target options on the field. Moreover, after Rice's issues with the law, the fans aren't happy.\n\nAfter the news of Rice's supposed assault went viral on X (Twitter), fans had an explosive reaction. A lot of the NFL fans took to Twitter to comment on Rice's behavior as well as the allegations against him. Fans proclaimed that the young WR needs to learn his priorities and stay at home.\n\nFans are understandably not happy with the trajectory of Rice's behavior. Furthermore, police have made a statement about Rice's conduct and the further legal implications it can have on his future, including his future in the NFL.\n\nPolice sources have revealed that Rice's legal status as of now is that he remains under investigation. The Chief WR is facing accusations of assault and the police have made it clear that this is an ongoing investigation. Law enforcement has revealed that they are currently conducting interviews with witnesses about the incident.\n\nFurthermore, the WR has already turned himself in for a previous run-in with the law. His previous run-in, also in Dallas, included 8 serious charges, with all charges being felonies.\n\nThe WR was involved in a multi-vehicle crash in March. Rice and his legal team were quick to assume responsibility and even made a statement about his actions. However, after his arrest, Rice had to pay a bond worth $40,000 for release and remains cooperative with law enforcement.\n\nAs for his future with the Chiefs, Coach Reid has made it clear that until he is legally cleared, Rice will virtually participate in the voluntary offseason training program.\n\nHowever, his absence from the training practice will affect the game plans that Reid might be devising. Having one of your core targets missing from the field is also bound to have a negative effect on how in-sync the WR will be with his QB Mahomes if he returns.

In a story written by Kelli Smith and Jamie Landers, The News reports that they obtained an offense report from the Dallas Police Department from the incident in which Rice is suspected.\n\n\"The report, obtained by The News through a public records request, said a 'suspect' assaulted a photographer after luring him back to a downtown Dallas nightclub under the premise he was being hired to take pictures,\" The News story reads, citing the offense report. \"Officers were dispatched for reports of an assault about 2:30 a.m. Monday to the Lit Lounge & Feu Nightclub in the 600 block of North Harwood Street, near Federal Street.\"\n\nThe News confirmed that \"law enforcement officials\" have told the outlet that Rice is the alleged suspect and that while the suspect's name is redacted, \"a description outlined in the document matches Rice, including his age, height and weight.\"\n\nThe News included a timeline of the alleged incident.\n\n\"The photographer was at an after hours party about 1:30 a.m. at the nightclub, but he left after a short period, the report said,\" per The News. \"About 1:55 a.m., the 'suspect' messaged the photographer on Instagram and asked him to return to the nightclub, the report said.\"\n\nThe alleged timeline from The News' reporting on the police report continues, italicized below:\n\n\"According to the police report, the photographer believed the suspect wanted to hire him to take pictures.

That's the question actress Whitney Rice will answer when she takes the stage as the keynote speaker at the San Gabriel Valleys Women's Summit.\n\nPresented by the Duarte Chamber of Commerce, the event will kick off on Friday, May 10, from 12:30 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., at the DoubleTree Hotel in Monrovia. The summit began as the Duarte Womens Business Expo in 2015 and has been held annually except for a two-year hiatus, from 2020 to 2022.\n\nThe event is also in honor of Duarte council member Tzeitel Paras-Caracci, who died in 2022 following a battle with lung cancer. She created the summit to empower women and help them succeed.\n\nJennifer Dickinson invited Rice to speak at the summit. Author and writing coach, she is also one of the guest speakers.\n\nRice is best known for playing Jacquiline Hilgrove on the four-time Emmy Award-nominated show Jury Duty. Before he started acting, Rice worked as a teacher. Her first foray into the industry was through stand-up, something she admits she wasn't very good at when she started.\n\nIt gave me the backbone I needed to put more of myself and more of my voice out there, Rice said.\n\nHer breakthrough came when she landed an audition for a theater production of The Last Tycoon.\n\nDuring her speech, Rice plans to address her multifaceted vision of the modern Renaissance woman.\n\nBeing a Renaissance person or woman in today's time is both admirable and very complicated because of what we've done in defining the concept, Rice said. Specifically, as women, I think we tend to put a lot of pressure on ourselves to do everything.\n\nSpecifically, we will discuss the challenges this role has created.\n\nI think it's cool that we can have it all. We can do everything right now, Rice said. That's great, but that doesn't mean we have to do everything we can to be relevant.\n\nShe plans to discuss the trend of women juggling multiple jobs, wives, mothers, influencers, business owners and therapists. However, they hold themselves back because they are afraid of failing.\n\nFear is in their way, and I think it's very important to use fear as a compass, Rice said.\n\nWhat I want women to start doing is when they feel that fear like, \"I can't do this,\" then that means they need to take the step forward, they need to take this opportunity.\n\nIt's not about treating failure as an end point but as an indicator of progress.\n\nI think scientists are right that when they test something and it fails, they rejoice because they believe it brings them closer to the solution, Rice said.\n\nExamples included writing a movie script that may not have been well received or showing up to a dinner party with a dish the guests didn't like.\n\nThis doesn't mean you should never write or cook again; it just means you get closer to what works and what works for you, Rice said.\n\nShe went on to say that she wasn't just there to talk. Her advice comes from personal experience, like her family's reaction when she left the security of her teaching career to pursue her acting career.\n\n\"They were really mad at me and they didn't understand that I wanted to take the plunge into acting, and I get it, it's scary,\" Rice said. There is no job security in this field, but I had to put my head down and ignore being told it was a crazy idea.\n\nIt also meant learning to defend yourself.\n\nOver the last 10 years in this industry in Hollywood, and I think this applies to all careers, I spent so much time listening to what other people wanted me to be, how I should do my hair, how I should speak, what was my point of view. The question is what kind of acting I should do, what kind of writing I should do, Rice said. It wasn't until a few years ago that I realized: you know what? I'm going to do what I want to do.\n\nWhen I started accepting who I am, my quirks and my flaws and showing up as me, flaws and all, that's when the opportunities started to open up and present themselves to me. me, but more importantly, it made me feel good.\n\nThis is because, fundamentally, the definition of rebirth is rebirth. It's about seeking knowledge, finding balance, and seeking social awareness. It's not about performance of perfection.\n\nI wear a lot of hats. I'm an actor, writer, director, public speaking coach, wife, friend, volunteer, mentor, Rice said. These are all things that a Renaissance woman would do by definition, but (I do it) because it does my soul good, not because it seems demanded by society and my peers.\n\nFor all women who feel like they can't break out of the cycle, Rice promises an authentic and sympathetic view of her own experience as a modern Renaissance woman.\n\nWhen we're in that space, it feels very performative and inauthentic, Rice said. What I hope women take away from this is that they move away from perfectionism and toward what feels authentic and good in ourselves and not for others.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rice University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duarte,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Duarte, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Duarte, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_Duty_(2023_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jury Duty (2023 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summit League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dickinson_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dickinson College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Gabriel_Valley", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Gabriel Valley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lung cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynote", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keynote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stand-up comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monrovia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monrovia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monrovia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Liberia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juggling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Tycoon_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Last Tycoon (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectionism_(psychology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perfectionism (psychology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_speaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public speaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reincarnation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soul music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/pasadenaweekly.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/d9/3d9d53e8-0d81-11ef-8a2a-abbe078fecc9/663bed5cb7c08.image.jpg?crop=1840%2C966%2C152%2C0&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547644", "eventUri": "eng-9547644", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 276, "textEnd": 282}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

For months, NBC 5 Investigates has reported on dangerous driving and excessive speeds on Dallas roads in a series of reports: \"Driven to Death.\"\n\nWhether it's an NFL star accused of injuring multiple people or the case of an elderly woman killed by a driver in a street race, Assistant District Attorney Andrew James and the Vehicular Crimes Unit at the Dallas County District Attorney's Office are often called in to prosecute cases involving allegations of high speeds, street racing or reckless driving.\n\nJames's team has obtained lengthy prison sentences for dangerous conduct on Dallas roads.\n\nIn the death of 73-year-old Linda Peterson, a woman killed by a driver who was street racing along Ferguson Road, the Vehicular Crimes Unit secured a 15-year prison sentence.\n\n\"Her life should not have ended that way,\" said James. \"Vehicular crimes are violent crimes. What happens to the human body in the span of milliseconds when they're being hit by cars at these speeds -- it's devastating.\"\n\nJames's unit now steps into the national spotlight as it prosecutes Rice and SMU football player Teddy Knox.\n\nBoth Rice and Knox were arrested after being charged with causing injuries in a collision and aggravated assault in connection with a crash on Central Expressway in March.\n\nRice and Knox have both said, through their attorneys, that they were cooperating with investigations. Rice also released a public apology and said he was taking full responsibility for his role in the crash.\n\nA police report obtained by NBC 5 said Rice was driving a Lamborghini SUV at 119 mph and Knox was behind the wheel of a Corvette traveling 116 mph in the seconds before the crash.\n\nTo verify those speeds, the police report said investigators obtained a search warrant \"for the download of (event data recorder) EDR data\" from the two vehicles. An EDR captures a vehicle's movements right before an impact.\n\nWeeks before the crash, Dallas County prosecutors met with NBC 5 Investigates to share how they are using EDRs and other onboard electronics to prove how fast drivers are going.\n\n\"And we're getting more and more tools that are available,\" James said.\n\nTools that Dallas County District Attorney John Creuzot said are helping tackle what he described as a worsening problem -- extreme speeds and dangerous driving on Dallas roads.\n\n\"If something bad happens and you hit somebody, you kill them or hurt them. We're going to do everything we can to prosecute you, and we will get the evidence. We will get your speed,\" said Creuzot.\n\nTo get speed data, Creuzot has invested in a team skilled at analyzing the information captured in devices including GPS navigation systems and mobile phone apps that gather location data that can be used to determine speed.\n\nRon Cathcart, an investigator at the Dallas County District Attorney's Office said being able to obtain that data has made all the difference in prosecuting cases.\n\n\"That's the big change for us, is actually to be able to get all these things that ... 15 years ago, we couldn't do,\" said Cathcart.\n\nCathcart said some car models now record the vehicle's speed every second, making it even easier to give jurors a look at what was happening in the car before a crash.\n\n\"So for us, those are, you know, a fantastic source of information,\" Cathcart said.\n\nIn some cases, the team has documented speeds of 80 mph and 100 mph before deadly crashes, not on freeways but on city streets. Event data recorders on many vehicles can also capture other important information including the rate of deceleration once a crash has occurred.\n\n\"So 100 mph is 146 feet that that vehicle is going in one second. That's just shy of a football field in two seconds,\" James said.\n\nLast year the DA's team obtained a conviction in another case receiving intense publicity, a high-speed police chase involving a driver with a fraudulent paper license plate. Grand Prairie police officer Brandon Tsai was killed in a crash that occurred during that chase.\n\n\"Every single family that I meet is in the worst time of their life. Because they've lost a loved one,\" James said.\n\nJames said helping bring justice for crash victims makes the work rewarding.\n\nBy speaking publicly about how the unit does the work, prosecutors said they hope that it will remind people that if they drive recklessly, it's become almost impossible to conceal their speed.\n\n\"These are all very important, and they're very impactful cases. And we want to do our best to hold people accountable for them,\" Creuzot said.\n\nCreuzot said he has made funding the Vehicular Crimes Unit a priority so that it can be better prepared to put on cases more likely to result in convictions. In two years, the unit has obtained 67 guilty pleas, and seven cases they took to trial ended in convictions with an average sentence of 54 years in prison.\n\nNBC 5 Investigates shot the interviews with the district attorney and the Vehicular Crimes Unit before the Rashee Rice case. Since that time the district attorney's office said they can't comment on that case in particular or on evidence they've obtained because it's an ongoing investigation, but we know from police reports that both the Lamborghini driven by Rice and the Corvette driven by Knox had EDRs.\n\nAs the Rice case moves through the courts, more may be learned about whether investigators also have obtained data from mobile phones, roadway cameras, or other devices that might help illustrate the speeds and driving movements involved.", "source": {"uri": "nbcdfw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 5

Are any veteran pass-catchers worth signing from the remaining pool of free agents? Joshua Brisco and Jordan Foote of Arrowhead Report on SI.com discuss.\n\nJoshua Brisco: Let's start with the big question: Do the Chiefs actually need to add another wide receiver, or are we overreacting to last year's shortcomings? Even with Rashee Rice likely being suspended for a good portion of the season (and with that arrow trending in the wrong direction), the Chiefs' pass-catching group is better than it was at this time last year. Xavier Worthy enters with more NFL-ready skills than rookie Rice, Hollywood Brown is a clear upgrade over Marquez Valdes-Scantling, and Rice is now a matter of availability. However, without Rice (and/or with injuries to the slight duo of Brown and Worthy), Kadarius Toney, Justin Watson, Skyy Moore and Justyn Ross will be competing for playing time. If those guys are competing for a couple of roster spots, that's fine by me. If they have to play half of KC's offensive snaps, it's time to look at other options. I'm intrigued by the possibility of Toney and Moore getting another offseason to develop, but they shouldn't be shoo-ins for significant work before proving they belong on the field.\n\nJordan Foote: It's easy to look at a wideout trio of Brown, Rice and Worthy and conclude that it's significantly better than whatever Kansas City put on the field in 2023. That also has a ripple effect on players like Toney and Moore, as you mentioned, being moved down a rung or two and competing for reps instead of competing for premium reps. The Rice situations do make the addition of a veteran intriguing, and KC can never have too much depth considering the uncertainty of how much he'll be available in 2024-25. The Chiefs don't need to bring anyone else in, but they could surely benefit from it.\n\nOf the thin group of remaining free agents, Zay Jones is interesting, although there are serious questions about what he has left in the tank. The same is true for Michael Thomas, who is a good fit in Kansas City and had a bit of a rebound in 2023 but still saw his year end early. Odell Beckham Jr. was my go-to pick, but the Miami Dolphins swooped him up. Who jumps out to you?\n\nBrisco: For what feels like the third offseason in a row, Beckham seemed like a good fit to me too, but Thomas is next on my list. Thomas has dealt with serious injury issues following his incredible first four years in the league, and perhaps he's riding on a bit of reputation from that era, but I could see Thomas making an impact in the middle of the field while Brown and Worthy test defenses everywhere else. Maybe Thomas isn't actually an upgrade over Toney/Moore once they get to training camp, but I'd like to see the battle. May the best receiver win.\n\nEven if Rice wasn't in line to be suspended (and acknowledging the fact that Worthy is still entering Andy Reid's offense as a rookie), I'd be interested in Thomas or a more traditional X-type WR in order to reinforce a lesson learned last season: don't be in positions where you're forced to trust players who haven't earned the workload.\n\nFoote: Usage and skill sets are things to factor in here, too, as you referenced with Thomas. The Chiefs seem to think highly of Worthy's versatility on offense (and Worthy agrees), but at the end of the day, he's still a wiry non-X receiver in an offense with another wiry non-X in Brown and a hybrid or big slot in Rice. No one has proven to be consistently capable of holding down that role -- does Kansas City really want Watson to do it in 2024 or risk suppressing Rice's effectiveness by banking on him to fulfill that? Reid offenses haven't always had an orthodox answer to \"Solve for X,\" so it isn't the end of the world. It is a calculated shot in the dark, though.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_Owls_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rice Owls football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashee_Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rashee Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Thomas_(wide_receiver,_born_1993)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Thomas (wide receiver, born 1993)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Worthy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xavier Worthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Saints"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore,_Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moore, Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moore, Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyy_Moore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skyy Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadarius_Toney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kadarius Toney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Watson_(wide_receiver)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Watson (wide receiver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquez_Valdes-Scantling", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marquez Valdes-Scantling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justyn_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justyn Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odell_Beckham_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Odell Beckham Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Beckham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zay_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zay Jones"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2797,h_1573,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/arrowhead_report/01hxcwa00yd85pn2hmyr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547644", "eventUri": "eng-9547644", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-10-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

The new building will seamlessly integrate with McNair Hall - the current home of Rice Business - enhancing the campus environment and continuing to cultivate a collaborative culture.\n\n\"This remarkable new building embodies the evolution of Rice Business over the past five decades and its commitment to equipping graduates who are not only integral to organizations around the globe but are also poised to lead them,\" Rice President Reginald DesRoches said. \"We're committed to offering top-tier facilities that complement our top-ranked academic programs, attracting the best students, faculty and staff to our campus.\"\n\nRice Business has experienced unprecedented growth in recent years due to new programs, including the new undergraduate business major, the increased cohort to the Full-time MBA program, as well as the MBA@Rice and Hybrid MBA, both of which have multiple on-campus residentials each year. The school has increased faculty by 41% to support its new programs and growing student population. In addition, Rice Business hosts large annual events such as the Rice Business Plan Competition, Rice Energy Finance Summit and the Women in Leadership Conference.\n\n\"We are energized by the momentum of our innovative new programs, the addition of new faculty and students and a fresh outlook on the future,\" said Peter Rodriguez, dean of the Jones Graduate School of Business. \"Our commitment is to attract more talented and innovative students, faculty and staff to Rice, who will further improve our programs and research capabilities. This wonderful new facility is critical to fulfilling that commitment.\"\n\nArchitecture Research Office (ARO) leads the building's design, while Houston-based Kirksey Architecture serves as the project's executive architect. Skanska and its joint venture partner, B. Bell Builders, are the general contractors. The project is expected to be completed in spring 2026.\n\nThe interior of the building is designed for various teaching and learning styles, including traditional lectures and informal collaborations. Two 120-seat classrooms, two 65-seat classrooms and breakout rooms throughout the building will support increased enrollment and team-based learning.\n\nThe expanded facility will broaden Rice Business' capacity for world-class innovation and leadership development as a hub for collaborative and interdisciplinary thinking. It will allow Rice Business to:\n\nEstablish a home for undergraduate business education.Centralize resources for Rice's top-ranked entrepreneurship programs.Offer versatile spaces for entrepreneurship competitions, events and accelerators.Introduce innovative event venues for faculty, students and the wider Rice community.Become a premier location for speakers from the Houston and global business community, allowing students to connect with the top organizations and minds in business.Lead in addressing global challenges like energy transition, finance, health care and more.\n\nThe new building will expand around the existing one, creating new public spaces between both. Designed to blend seamlessly with the campus and its surroundings, the exterior includes a serrated brick facade, which deflects sunlight and keeps the interior cool, a red clay-tile roof, and a cast-stone trim. The use of glazed brick in bond and herringbone patterns pays homage to the traditional materials found on campus. The new building will be constructed above an existing underground parking garage and will include flood-proofing measures to enhance the school's resilience to extreme weather.\n\n\"The opportunity to design a building on Rice's historic and exceptionally beautiful campus comes with enormous responsibility,\" ARO's Principal Stephen Cassell said. \"Our task is to deliver a contextual yet forward-looking structure that embodies Rice Business' focus on the future as it continues to grow.\"\n\nThe new building encloses the Woodson Courtyard with a glass fa\u00e7ade and a skylit coffered roof, creating a shaded atrium and landing space. A triple-height pathway called The Walk will connect the courtyard to a new West Commons. Dining facilities on the ground floor will flow outdoors to a tree-shaded terrace, blending indoor and outdoor spaces. The atrium will be a central hub for community gatherings with a larger event space on the second floor.\n\nRice Business has begun fundraising towards its goal of $40 million in support of the project.\n\n\"Donor support has been and will continue to be a crucial part of this project,\" Rodriguez said. \"I want to thank the alumni and donors who have already contributed. This is a unique moment in our school's history - particularly as this year we celebrate our 50th anniversary.\"\n\nLearn more about the new building and how you can be a part of the future of Rice Business here.\n\nView the video and photos from today's groundbreaking event here.\n\n/Public Release.

He was hit with eight charges, ranging from aggravated assault to collision involving serious bodily injury.\n\nWe now have more information on this latest incident courtesy of the Dallas Morning News' Kelli Smith. She shared a police report pertaining to the alleged assault earlier on Thursday. It's not good for Rice. Here is a copy of it with some redactions.\n\nPer the police report, Rice allegedly lured the photographer back into the club solely to assault him. This could very well lead to more serious charges.\n\nIt must be noted that no criminal charges have been filed against Rice. He's simply the subject of an investigation.\n\nAs for Rice's future in the NFL, he's expected to receive a lengthy suspension stemming from the accident in March. The league will also look into these allegations. That's for sure.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vincent_frank@sportsnaut.com", "name": "Vincent Frank", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_Owls_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rice Owls football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Dallas Morning News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://sportsnaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Rashee-Rice-assault-allegations-22453001.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547644", "eventUri": "eng-9547644", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 452992383, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 98, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 98}}}

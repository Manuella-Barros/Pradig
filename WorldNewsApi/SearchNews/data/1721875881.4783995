Keep an eye on Kate Douglass, too", "text": "INDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 Caeleb Dressel locked up his second individual race in Paris, giving him another chance to shine after his stellar performance at the last Olympics. Keep an eye on Kate Douglass, too. She could be one of the the biggest American stars at the pool. And, of course, Katie Ledecky will be swimming a whole bunch of events. Dressel, the winner of five gold medals at the Tokyo Games, claimed a victory in the men\u2019s 100-meter butterfly at the U.S. Olympic swimming trials Saturday night. Dressel followed up his triumph in the 50 freestyle with a winning time of 50.19 seconds, giving him a chance to defend another of the gold medals he captured in Tokyo. Douglass locked up her third individual event at the Olympics with a victory in the 200-meter individual medley. She was neck and neck with Alex Walsh at the final turn, but no one could keep up with Douglass on the freestyle leg. She finished in 2:06.79, while Walsh held on for the second Olympic spot in 2:07.86. Douglass has lived up to her billing as one of the world\u2019s most versatile swimmers, also claiming trials victories in the 200 breaststroke and 100 freestyle. \u201cI\u2019m really happy with that,\u201d Douglass said. \u201cI was coming into the meet trying to win all three events, but I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to achieve that. So I\u2019m happy I did.\u201d Ledecky romped to her fourth victory of the trials, winning the 800 freestyle in 8 minutes, 14.12 seconds. Paige Madden took the second spot in 8:20.71. Ledecky plans to drop the 200 freestyle from her Olympic program, but will be competing in the 400, 800 and 1,500 free, as well as the 4x200 free relay. Dressel didn\u2019t come close to his world record of 49.45, which he set at the last Olympics. But he led all the way and touched about a half-body length ahead of 17-year-old Thomas Heilman, who earned the second spot for Paris in 50.80. Dressel will also swim up to three relays at the Summer Games, which would put him close to the six-event program he had in Tokyo. The only event he didn\u2019t win three years ago was the mixed relay. \u201cIt\u2019s tough making it through the trials,\u201d Dressel said. \u201cThis truly is the hardest part.\u201d The only individual gold that Dressel won\u2019t get to defend in Paris is the 100 freestyle. He missed out with a third-place showing in his first event of these trials. Heilman will also compete in the 200 butterfly, winning that event at the trials to become the youngest male to make the U.S. swim team since 15-year-old Michael Phelps in 2000. \u201cThe butterfly is in good hands with this guy,\u201d Dressel said, motioning toward Heilman. \u201cHe\u2019s scary, scary.\u201d Walsh will get to swim at the Olympics with her sister Gretchen, finally making the team on the next-to-last night of the trials. \u201cIt means the world,\u201d said Alex Walsh, who competed without her sister in Tokyo. \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I was going to make it to Paris after she made it. This is a dream we\u2019ve been dreaming for so long.\u201d ___ AP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL29seW1waWNzLXVzLXN3aW1taW5nLXRyaWFscy0xMTA0NzY3OWY2YzFjMmQwNGIzMzEwZmUzNzBkOGIyNdIBAA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Dressel and Ledecky win again at U.S. Olympic swimming trials.

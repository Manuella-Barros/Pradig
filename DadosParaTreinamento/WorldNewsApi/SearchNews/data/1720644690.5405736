Police have identified the accused persons as Dr Madhukar Chandrakant Shinde (52) of Phaltan in Satara district and Nitin Balasaheb Ghule (34) of Dhekalwadi, Baramati. Dr Mahesh Jagtap, superintendent at the sub-district hospital, Baramati, lodged the first information report (FIR) in this case at Malegaon police station on Saturday. As per the FIR, a police team comprising sub inspector Yuvraj Ghodke acted on a tip-off and nabbed Shinde and Ghule in Malad area of Baramati on Friday evening. Police seized a sonography machine from their possession. A prima-facie investigation revealed Shinde and Ghule conducted an illegal sex determination test on a woman at Gofne Wasti in Malegaon in Baramati taluka, around 1.30 pm on Friday. Police have booked the two accused persons under sections of the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act. Police have launched a search for the woman on whom the doctors conducted the prenatal sex determination test, which is banned in the country. Assistant police inspector Balaji Bhange is investigating the case. District civil surgeon Nagnath Yempalle told The Indian Express that the doctor was earlier caught in two different cases in Satara and Pune for determining the sex of the foetus. There are court cases against him. However, despite being a gynaecologist, he had blatantly flouted PC PNDT rules and used an unregistered sonography machine in a mobile van where he conducted the sex determination of the foetus. Due to these sex determination practices unfortunately there is an imbalance in the sex ratio to birth ratio. \"However our PCPNDT Pune Cell is creating awareness and implementing law effectively,\" advocate Megha Sontale, Pune District Legal Advisor, told The Indian Express.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/baramati-doctor-agent-held-for-illegal-sex-determination-test-9380273/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/kasba-peth-2.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:38:04", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.142}

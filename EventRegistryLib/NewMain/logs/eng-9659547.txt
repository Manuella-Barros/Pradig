The security minister's agenda reportedly includes a meeting with President Nayib Bukele as well as other members of the Salvadoran government and police forces.\n\nShortly after taking office in December, the government of Argentina expressed its intention to adapt and implement its own version of the \"Bukele model\" of fighting crime, which has worked in El Salvador to greatly reduce the threat of the nation's largest criminal organizations in the past two years.\n\nEl Salvador has been under a state of emergency since March 2022 to combat gang violence, prompted after its most violent day in over a century in which police documented 62 homicides.\n\nThe still-active state of emergency decree, which has been renewed on a month-by-month basis, effectively placed El Salvador in a de facto state of martial law and has greatly expanded operations by Salvadoran security forces against gangs such as MS-13 and 18th Street, leading to the virtual \"disappearance\" of the gangs from Salvadoran territory.\n\nBullrich posted a brief video of her visit to the CECOT prison on Sunday in which she praised El Salvador for going from one of the world's \"most dangerous\" countries to one where \"families can walk, live in peace, and in tranquility\" thanks to a program \"to destroy the murderous gangs, which are now locked up here.\"\n\n\"From a country taken over by violence, drug trafficking and the gangs that murdered 150,000 Salvadorans, to one of the safest countries in the world, where families have recovered their lives and live in peace,\" Bullrich's social media message read.\n\n\"This is the way. Tough on criminals. Freedom for the good Argentines,\" the message continued.\n\nSalvadoran Security Minister Gustavo Villatoro said in a social media statement on Sunday that Bullrich's visit is the result of the meeting between Presidents Bukele and Javier Milei. The two leaders held a private meeting on June 1 during Argentine President Milei's visit to El Salvador for Bukele's second inauguration.\n\n\"It is a true pleasure to receive you in El Salvador. I am sure that this visit from Argentina will be enriching, you and your team will be able to see first-hand the \"Bukele Model,\" Villatoro said.\n\nRepresentatives from El Salvador and Argentina have increased dialogue on security issues this year. Bukele first confirmed security cooperation with Argentina during a press conference in February shortly after he was reelected for a new five-year term. Bukele gave a quick assessment of Argentina's crime and gang violence situation, explaining that the measures his government could share with Argentina \"wouldn't have to be so drastic\" as the ones implemented in El Salvador.\n\n\"In the face of smaller problems, maybe the medicine can be smaller,\" Bukele said at the time.\n\nShortly before the visit to the prison, Bullrich visited El Salvador's National Academy of Public Security to meet with its general director, C\u00e9sar Flores Murillo.

Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele had told her he was open to giving Argentina any assistance it might need regarding security issues.\n\nThe relationship between the two countries grew stronger earlier this month when Argentine President Javier Milei attended Bukele's inauguration for a second straight term in office.\n\nUnder Bukele, street violence in El Salvador has been reported to have suffered a significant decrease, due to which getting reelected was only to be expected. However, humanitarian organizations have received more than 6,000 complaints regarding the detention facility where numerous human rights abuses are said to have been carried out, in addition to arbitrary arrests, torture, and short-term disappearances. Moreover, some 300 detainees were said to have died at the penitentiary, most of them showing visible signs of violence.\n\n\"As a result of the bilateral meeting between President Nayib Bukele and President Javier Milei, we welcome Minister Patricia Bullrich to the safest country in Latin America,\" Salvadoran Security Minister Gustavo Villatoro posted on X.\n\n\"It is a real pleasure to receive you in El Salvador, I am sure that this visit from Argentina will be enriching, you and your team will be able to learn firsthand about the 'Bukele Model',\" he added.\n\n\"From a country taken over by violence, drug trafficking and gangs that murdered 150 thousand Salvadorans, to one of the safest countries in the world, where families recovered their lives and live in peace,\" Bullrich wrote on the same social network. \"This is the way.

Freedom for the good Argentines,\" she added.\n\nThe CECOT Center was opened by Bukele on Jan. 31, 2023, in an area of 116 hectares in the Tecoluca district of the central department of San Vicente.

The two nations then exchanged notes on practices implemented to professionalise police forces.", "source": {"uri": "batimes.com.ar", "dataType": "news", "title": "Buenos Aires Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martin_soltys@batimes.com.ar", "name": "Martin Soltys", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Bullrich", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patricia Bullrich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Salvador", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "El Salvador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "El Salvador"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayib_Bukele", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nayib Bukele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buenos Aires"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buenos Aires"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18th_Street_gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "18th Street gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-13", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MS-13"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Latin America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Milei", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Javier Milei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Declaration of war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inauguration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amnesty International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized_Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized Crime", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories_and_Patches", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories and Patches", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://fotos.perfil.com/2024/06/17/trim/1140/641/bullrich-in-el-salvador-1820855.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659547", "eventUri": "eng-9659547", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

A post mortem examination showed he died from gunshot wounds.\n\nMr Skelton's family informed investigators he suffered from a mental health condition and the IPCC recovered the weapons used on the morning, as well as searching Mr Skelton's flat in Durham Street, east Hull, as part of their investigation.\n\nMr Skelton's sister, Laura, said: \"It has been such a long and difficult time since we lost Lewis last year. Not only was his sudden death a massive shock to us all, but the nature of it has been so hard to accept and understand.\n\n\"It is vital to us that we feel every avenue is explored getting to the bottom of what actually happened that day.\"\n\nA spokesman for the IPCC confirmed the investigation should be completed by the end of the year.\n\nHe said: \"Our independent investigation into the fatal shooting of Lewis Skelton has progressed well and we are on course to conclude it before the end of this year.\n\n\"An investigation report will be compiled.

For example, the National Intelligence Council uses IPCC climate projections as the basis for their assessment of the risk of extreme weather events for national security.\n\nIPCC sea level rise projections also formed part of the basis of the Department of Defense's 2016 assessment of the risk of sea level rise for DOD coastal installations. Take a look at examples of US military bases confronting rising seas.\n\nThe information generated by the IPCC (e.g. special reports and comprehensive climate assessments) is incorporated into the US National Climate Assessment and similar activities in nations around the world.\n\nThe US has historically contributed around $2 million a year to the IPCC Secretariat to facilitate gatherings of hundreds of world experts to assess the latest developments in climate science published in peer-reviewed journals.\n\nThrough these assessments, IPCC scientists produce highly vetted climate projections for governments, and identify key risks and sources of exposure and vulnerability to climate change.\n\nTo put this annual historic contribution of around $2 million to the IPCC in perspective, New York City, in 2013 embarked upon a $20 billion climate resiliency plan. In one year, the climate resiliency portion of the New York 2017 Executive Budget included $170 million in City funds for storm water management infrastructure to complement the East Side Coastal Resiliency Project from Montgomery Street to East 23rd Street and $27.5 million in City funds for the Two Bridges section of Lower Manhattan Protect and Connect flood protection.\n\nThe design for these investments must incorporate the latest climate projections. New York City and other communities around the US benefit from a sustained IPCC that continually draws upon experts worldwide, including many from the U.S. Without the U.S.' contribution in FY 2017, the IPCC was short in contributions. As a result, the institution was forced to draw from its financial reserves.\n\nThis may not be sustainable in the long run and risks the institution's ability to provide governments with the best available information on changes ahead. Accordingly, in June 2017, the Netherlands announced it would double its IPCC contribution in light of U.S. actions and is urging other nations to increase their contributions.\n\nThere is a large return on investment in the IPCC for the United States. Annual U.S. contributions to the IPCC trust fund could help ensure the IPCC Secretariat can sustain convening functions that leverages largely voluntary contributions of experts that produce robust IPCC assessments. Highly vetted information from the IPCC is key for our nation's risk assessments.\n\nBrenda Ekwurzel is a senior climate scientist and the director of climate science at Union of Concerned Scientists.

I have recommended they create a policy document setting out what is expected of officers in collaborating on serious offence investigations.\"\n\nInside the Yorkshire jail where Ian Watkins was held and where many sex abusers still deny their guilt\n\nBut an email exchange shows the IPCC did not intend to publish the full investigation report when it made the findings public next Friday at the same time as findings on allegations against South Wales Police involving Watkins are made public.\n\nMs Mjadzelics made reports to officers between March and May 2012 about Watkins and subsequently complained to the IPCC that officers failed to conduct an examination of her laptop when she took it to Doncaster Police Station three times during that period.\n\nThe laptop allegedly contained an indecent image of a child that Watkins, then lead singer of the Lostprophets rock band, had allegedly sent her.\n\nThe draft says: \"The investigation found that a request in early March 2012 from South Wales Police for assistance with allegations from Ms Mjadzelics was initially allocated to the SYP Safer Neighbourhood Team, rather than its specialist Public Protection Unit .\n\n\"This led to a police constable with no training in the investigation of child sex abuse, or in the handling and preservation of evidence in computer-related offences, conducting an initial meeting with Ms Mjadzelics at Doncaster police station.\n\n\"The constable did not view any image, and there was no subsequent determined effort to ascertain whether Ms Mjadzelics had evidence of child sexual abuse in her possession.\n\n\"Later, in May 2012, a constable from the PPU had been instructed by a senior officer to seize the laptop at a further meeting with Ms Mjadzelics at Doncaster police station and to take a statement, but neither action was undertaken.\n\n\"On viewing the relevant alleged close-up indecent image of a child at the meeting, officers believed it to be of an adult female.\n\n\"The investigation also considered the supervisory actions of a police sergeant over other officers involved.\n\n\"In the IPCC investigator's opinion, there was sufficient evidence that a police constable involved could have made inappropriate remarks to Ms Mjadzelics at the police station, about the reasons why she was making allegations about Watkins.\n\n\"The IPCC investigation considered a range of national and force policies on child abuse enquiries, and powers of seizure under PACE.\n\n\"The IPCC is also issuing findings today in respect of how South Wales Police handled allegations against Ian Watkins.\n\n\"Ian Watkins was arrested on 21 September 2012 by South Wales Police, initially in connection with drugs offences.\n\n\"He was further arrested on 24 October 2012 on suspicion of possession of indecent images of children and of publishing an obscene article.\"\n\nSouth Yorkshire Police have been contacted for comment.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

The IPCC says that \"more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010\" have been caused by human activity.\n\nIf Lloyd's results hold, the IPCC may have to revise how much warming it attributes to mankind. In any case, the IPCC's estimate of man-made and natural warming (0.85 degrees) is still below the standard deviation for the last 8,000, according to Lloyd's results. This means that warming is not very significant within the context of the Earth's recent climate history.\n\nLloyd arrived at his conclusion after the \"differences in temperatures between all records which are approximately a century apart were determined, after any trends in the data had been removed.\" Lloyd noted the \"differences were close to normally distributed.\"\n\nBut Lloyd's study hits at a larger debate within climate science: how much warming is attributable to mankind or nature. Clearly, Lloyd and the IPCC he once contributed to now represent different ends of the spectrum.\n\n\"The key challenge in understanding climate change is to assess the natural climate variability,\" Dr. Judith Curry, a climate scientist at Georgia Tech, told The Daily Caller News Foundation in April.\n\nAt the time, Ronald Bailey, a science write for Reason magazine, wrote that there has still not been enough observed warming to meet the IPCC's standard of \"enhanced warming\" -- that is, warming above natural levels.\n\nIn his article, Bailey noted that there has not been enough temperature rise since the IPCC set its benchmark for \"enhanced warming\" in 1990. Curry noted that there was a big jump in temperature between 1993 and 1998, but that was basically because of the latter year's El Ni\u00f1o.\n\n\"The magnitude of natural climate variability over the past 1000 years and even the past 100 years is hotly debated,\" Curry added. \"Personally, I think the role of natural climate variability has been substantially underestimated in our interpretation of recent climate change.\"\n\nBut not all scientists agree with Bailey's article, and some argue that signs of human influence on the Earth's climate were evident in the 1970s. Indeed, by 1995 the IPCC stated that the \"balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.\" The international body has only made stronger statement on man's climatic influence ever since.\n\n\"I would not pin anything on what was said by IPCC in 1990,\" Dr. Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, told TheDCNF in April. \"In the reports since then there have been thorough evaluations of past IPCC projections and whether they were out of line.\"\n\nHuman influence on the climate may have been observable in the 1970s, but scientists have had trouble explaining why satellite data shows that average global temperatures have been virtually flat for more than 18 years. Satellites measure the troposphere -- the lowest few miles of the atmosphere -- in contrast, to surface temperature measurements, which most climate bodies rely on for estimates of global average temperature average.\n\nBut even surface temperature data showed a hiatus in warming for about 15 years or so. Scientists have offered up dozens of explanations for why global temperatures have been flat since the late 1990s. The most prominent explanation is that oceans have been absorbing most of the \"heat\" from increased greenhouse gas emissions, meaning surface temperatures show less warming than they otherwise would.\n\n\"What is evident now is that the signal of global warming emerged from the noise of natural variability about the mid 1970s,\" Trenberth added. \"There are fluctuations in global mean temperatures: from year to year with El Ni\u00f1os, etc., and from decade to decade, so that trends reflecting global warming need to be taken over at least 20 years.\"\n\nFollow Michael on Twitter",

I have recommended they create a policy document setting out what is expected of officers in collaborating on serious offence investigations.\"\n\nBut an email exchange shows the IPCC did not intend to publish the full investigation report when it made the findings public next Friday at the same time as findings on allegations against South Wales Police involving Watkins are made public.\n\nMs Mjadzelics made reports to officers between March and May 2012 about Watkins and subsequently complained to the IPCC that officers failed to conduct an examination of her laptop when she took it to Doncaster Police Station three times during that period.\n\nThe laptop allegedly contained an indecent image of a child that Watkins, then lead singer of the Lostprophets rock band, had allegedly sent her.\n\nThe draft says: \"The investigation found that a request in early March 2012 from South Wales Police for assistance with allegations from Ms Mjadzelics was initially allocated to the SYP Safer Neighbourhood Team, rather than its specialist Public Protection Unit .\n\n\"This led to a police constable with no training in the investigation of child sex abuse, or in the handling and preservation of evidence in computer-related offences, conducting an initial meeting with Ms Mjadzelics at Doncaster police station.\n\n\"The constable did not view any image, and there was no subsequent determined effort to ascertain whether Ms Mjadzelics had evidence of child sexual abuse in her possession.\n\n\"Later, in May 2012, a constable from the PPU had been instructed by a senior officer to seize the laptop at a further meeting with Ms Mjadzelics at Doncaster police station and to take a statement, but neither action was undertaken.\n\n\"On viewing the relevant alleged close-up indecent image of a child at the meeting, officers believed it to be of an adult female.\n\n\"The investigation also considered the supervisory actions of a police sergeant over other officers involved.\n\n\"In the IPCC investigator's opinion, there was sufficient evidence that a police constable involved could have made inappropriate remarks to Ms Mjadzelics at the police station, about the reasons why she was making allegations about Watkins.\n\n\"The IPCC investigation considered a range of national and force policies on child abuse enquiries, and powers of seizure under PACE.\n\n\"The IPCC is also issuing findings today in respect of how South Wales Police handled allegations against Ian Watkins.\n\n\"Ian Watkins was arrested on 21 September 2012 by South Wales Police, initially in connection with drugs offences.\n\n\"He was further arrested on 24 October 2012 on suspicion of possession of indecent images of children and of publishing an obscene

The companies aim to improve AI using Stack Overflow's technical data. According to relationship, they will collaborate in several key areas to enhance both platforms.\n\nUnder the new agreement, OpenAI will use Stack Overflow's API to access more than 15 years of technical questions and answers on the site. This data will help OpenAI improve the GPT model by grounding it in real-world coding problems and solutions. The AI will also be programmed to attribute answers directly to their authors on Stack Overflow.\n\nIn addition, Stack Overflow will use OpenAI's GPT model internally to build new features. One example is OverflowAI, a tool that powers search and discovery on the site. Stack Overflow says it can determine how best to use AI to surface the most relevant information for users.\n\nOpenAI will utilize Stack Overflow's OverflowAPI product and collaborate with Stack Overflow to improve model performance for developers who use their products. This integration will help OpenAI improve its AI models using enhanced content and feedback from the Stack Overflow community and provide attribution to the Stack Overflow community within ChatGPT to foster deeper engagement with content. Stack Overflow will utilize OpenAI models as part of their development of OverflowAI and work with OpenAI to leverage insights from internal testing to maximize the performance of OpenAI models. OpenAI's partnership with Stack Overflow will help further drive its mission to empower the world to develop technology through collective knowledge, as Stack Overflow will be able to create better products that benefit the Stack Exchange community's health, growth, and engagement.\n\nBoth companies will share insights to improve their systems. OpenAI aims to provide solutions to coding problems at scale through access to Stack Overflow's knowledge base. And Stack Overflow hopes to reward community members while creating innovative tools to improve the developer experience.\n\nThe first joint integrations from the partnership are expected to launch in mid-2024. Stack Overflow says the deal will also allow for long-term reinvestment in community-focused products.\n\nStack Overflow has been experimenting with AI integration. In April, it began building models to reward contributors for sharing knowledge.

When a ChatGPT user asks a coding question that has been answered on Stack Exchange's forum, the chatbot will be capable of fetching information from relevant posts. OpenAI says that it plans to \"provide attribution to the Stack Overflow community\" within ChatGPT responses.\n\nThe LLM developer will collaborate with Stack Overflow to improve its models. According to the companies, the effort will place an emphasis on making OpenAI's LLMs more useful for developers. This hints the goal is to enhance ChatGPT's code explanation and generation capabilities.\n\n\"Stack Overflow is the world's largest developer community, with more than 59 million questions and answers,\" said Stack Overflow Chief Executive Officer Prashanth Chandrasekar. \"Our goal with OverflowAPI, and our work to advance the era of socially responsible AI, is to set new standards with vetted, trusted, and accurate data that will be the foundation on which technology solutions are built and delivered to our user.\"\n\nOpenAI will access Stack Overflow data through OverflowAPI, an application programming interface that Stack Exchange debuted last June. It enables companies to license the more than 59 million coding questions and answers on the forum by buying a subscription. In addition to existing content, the subscription offers access to the new posts that users upload to Stack Overflow over time.\n\nOne major selling point of OverflowAPI is that it provides \"feedback signals\" an AI model can use to evaluate the accuracy and usefulness of a given post. Those feedback signals take the form of the upvote and downvote counters next to users' content submissions. By evaluating the number of upvotes a given post has received, neural networks can determine whether it should be incorporated into prompt responses.\n\nStack Exchange says that OverflowAPI can noticeably improve foundation models' coding capabilities. In an internal evaluation, the company used the API to train a version of Llama 2 with 34 billion parameters. The data from OverflowAPI increased the percentage of coding tasks the model performed successfully during the test by nearly 20%.\n\nOpenAI is not the only customer of OverflowAPI. In late February, Stack Exchange announced that Google LLC will make content from its forum available through the Gemini for Google Cloud chatbot. Stack Exchange, in turn, will use the search giant's public cloud as its \"platform of choice\" for hosting its forum.\n\nThe deal with OpenAI likewise extends beyond content licensing. Stack Exchange will use the LLM developer's models to support the development of OverflowAPI. Furthermore, it's working on integrations between Stack Overflow and OpenAI models that will begin rolling out by the end of June.\n\nIt's possible Stack Exchange plans to integrate OpenAI models into one or more of the AI features it's currently developing for its platform. Last year, the company previewed an enhanced version of the Stack Overflow search bar that can generate answers to coding questions based on information in forum posts. The technical level of the automatically-generated answers is customizable.\n\nStack Exchange also intends to add AI tools to Stack Overflow for Teams, a commercial product that software teams can use to share technical knowledge internally. One of the planned features is capable of automatically asking questions about code and other technical data stored in third-party platforms such as GitHub. According to Stack Exchange, those questions can help developers more quickly familiarize themselves with an application's code base.", "source": {"uri": "siliconangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SiliconANGLE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stack Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stack Overflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial neural network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Cloud Platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GitHub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Source code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Languages", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Languages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Component_Frameworks", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Component Frameworks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Internet", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Threads", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Threads", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Metaprogramming", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Metaprogramming", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2024/05/Stack-Overflow.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542840", "eventUri": "eng-9542840", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

This invite-only event in SF will explore the intersection of technology and business. Find out how you can attend here.\n\nA week after partnering with Financial Times, OpenAI has announced it is teaming up with Stack Overflow - the open platform to discuss and vote on common coding challenges - to improve its models' ability to handle programming-related tasks.\n\nUnder the engagement, the terms of which remain undisclosed, OpenAI developers will have access to Stack Overflow's vetted technical knowledge and code to improve the performance of their models. The partnership will also make ChatGPT better at programming chops, both companies confirmed in a statement.\n\nThe development comes over a year after Stack Overflow banned ChatGPT-generated code and content on its platform over concerns of inaccurate information hitting the site. Now, it is moving to improve the same platform.\n\nStack Overflow has built a subscription-based API service, dubbed OverflowAPI, that gives continuous access to its public datasets (accumulated over the last 15 years) to enterprises looking to train and fine-tune large language models. The company roped Google as its first customer with a deal to provide data for the Gemini family of models.\n\nNow, with the latest partnership, the company is giving this API (and the technical content it provides access to) to developers leveraging OpenAI models, including the GPT-4 family. This will help them improve the models using vetted technical content and feedback from the Stack Overflow community.\n\nAs the API is put to use, ChatGPT, which also runs on the GPT family of models, will begin to provide improved coding-related answers leveraging technical knowledge from Stack Overflow. According to the companies, this will give users of the chatbot access to trusted, attributed, accurate and highly technical knowledge and code backed by millions of developers.\n\nHowever, given the credibility concerns many may still have, each ChatGPT response using Stack Overflow data will also link back to the highest relevance posts that influenced the summarized answer. This way, users could go to the platform for \"deeper engagement.\"\n\nBut sharing data is just one part of the deal.\n\nStack Overflow also said that it will use OpenAI's models to accelerate the development of OverflowAI, a series of generative AI capabilities on both the public Stack Overflow site as well as its enterprise offering Stack Overflow for Teams. The partnership with Google also helped the company build out gen AI features for its knowledge platform. The first set of integrations and capabilities developed with OpenAI will be available in the first half of 2024.\n\n\"Stack Overflow is the world's largest developer community, with more than 59 million questions and answers.

At the same time, Stack Overflow will benefit from OpenAI's expertise in developing new generative AI integrations on the Stack Overflow platform.\n\nThe first set of integrations will go live by the end of June.\n\nThe tie-up with OpenAI is a remarkable reversal for Stack Overflow, which initially banned responses from ChatGPT on its platform over fears of spammy responses.\n\nStack Overflow began experimenting with generative AI features last April, promising to craft models that \"reward\" users who contribute knowledge to the platform. In July, the company launched a conversational search tool that lets users pose queries and receive answers based on Stack Overflow's database of over 58 million questions and answers, along with tools for businesses to fine-tune searches on their own documentation and knowledge bases.\n\nSome members of Stack Overflow's developer community rebelled against the changes, pointing out concerns related to the validity of information generated by AI, information overload, and data privacy for individual contributors on the platform.\n\nThere was at least some basis for those concerns. An analysis of more than 150 million lines of code committed to project repos over the past several years by GitClear found that generative AI dev tools are resulting in more mistaken code being pushed to codebases. Elsewhere, security researchers have warned that such tools can amplify existing bugs and security issues in software projects.\n\nBut despite the apparent flaws, developers are embracing generative AI tools for at least some coding tasks. In a Stack Overflow poll from June 2023, 44% of developers said that they use AI tools in their development process now while 26% plan to soon.\n\nThis has precipitated something of an existential crisis for Stack Overflow. Traffic to the platform has reportedly dipped significantly since the release of capable new generative AI models last year -- models that in many cases were trained on data from Stack Overflow.\n\nSo now, as it cuts costs, Stack Overflow is pursuing licensing agreements with AI providers.\n\nThe company's deal with OpenAI -- the financial terms of which weren't disclosed -- comes after Stack Overflow partnered with Google to enrich Google's Gemini models with Stack Overflow data and work with Google to bring more AI-powered features to its platform.

At its peak, it served legions of job seekers resulting in roughly 6 million yearly job searches, 2 million yearly \"apply\" clicks, and above industry average application submission rates.\n\nMany community members reported a strong preference for using Stack Overflow Jobs in their job search because of our unique focus on developer needs, and were truly disappointed to see it go.\n\nBut unfortunately, the business model of the feature was not sustainable for Stack because of the investment it would have taken to make it competitive with other job sites. However, we are aware of how much users liked it, and how many people found a great job through it. In the last few years, we have heard repeatedly from community members that they want it back.\n\nWe heard you, and we are delighted to announce that we are introducing a new version of Stack Overflow Jobs, crafted in partnership with Indeed, a leading global hiring platform. By partnering with Indeed, we believe we have found a solution that allows us to provide a best-in-class job site experience while continuing to focus on our strength - the developer community.\n\nStack Overflow Jobs will be launching in the coming weeks as an initial test (we will update this post once the experiment is live, so stay tuned). At first, this will be only available in the US. Through the first phase of this experiment we will be looking to get answers to some of these questions:\n\nWe know job searching can be stressful and time consuming. Half the battle is finding quality jobs that are a good match for your skills and interests, before even starting the application process. We believe that by combining the unique strengths of Stack Overflow, including our dedication to the developer community, and Indeed's volume of quality tech jobs, we can help developers and other technical job seekers find their next great opportunity via a curated, tech focused job site.\n\nWe see this as just the beginning, with hopes of proving out this partnership model to expand in both product features and functionally, as well as more markets outside the US.\n\nThe new Stack Overflow Jobs, powered by Indeed, will be hosted on its own domain, linked from the left navigation on Stack Overflow and technical Stack Exchange sites (the same group of sites where you see 'Companies' in the left navigation, though to be clear 'Companies' and 'Jobs' remain separate features).\n\nThe job site will showcase thousands of technical job listings in the US. Use keyword searches to find jobs that are a great fit for your interests and experience. In order to apply for a job, hit the \"apply\" button and you will be redirected to the posting on Indeed, where you can submit your application. No personal data about users is shared between Stack Overflow and Indeed.\n\nWe are taking measures to ensure that the listings that populate Stack Overflow Jobs will be high quality and highly relevant to the Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange technical community. However in the event that something off-topic slips through the cracks, we want to get it corrected as soon as possible. See the help center article here with more information.\n\nWe are considering this an experiment with bringing back a feature that previously brought a lot of value to the site. As we learn, we will evaluate growth and expansion opportunities. This may include revisiting features from the original version of Stack Overflow Jobs and/or building new ones, to continue helping technologists on a job search journey.\n\nOur goal is to create a job site experience that developers and other technical job seekers love. Let us know how we can do that!\n\nWhen thinking about searching for your next technical role, what pieces of information or features would be most useful for you?\n\nDo you have feedback about your experience with the original Stack Overflow Jobs?

These technologies have a significant potential to impact participation and content production in online knowledge communities. We provide initial evidence of this, analyzing data from Stack Overflow and Reddit developer communities between October 2021 and March 2023, documenting ChatGPT's influence on user activity in the former. We observe significant declines in both website visits and question volumes at Stack Overflow, particularly around topics where ChatGPT excels. By contrast, activity in Reddit communities shows no evidence of decline, suggesting the importance of social fabric as a buffer against the community-degrading effects of LLMs. Finally, the decline in participation on Stack Overflow is found to be concentrated among newer users, indicating that more junior, less socially embedded users are particularly likely to exit.\n\nRecent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) technologies, especially large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, have been significant. LLMs demonstrate remarkable proficiency in tasks that involve information retrieval and content creation. Given these capabilities, it is important to consider their potential to drive seismic shifts in the way knowledge is developed and exchanged within online knowledge communities.\n\nLLMs may drive both positive and negative impacts on participation and activity at online knowledge communities. On the positive side, LLMs can enhance knowledge sharing by providing immediate, relevant responses to user queries, potentially bolstering community engagement by helping users to efficiently address a wider range of peer questions. Viewed from this perspective, Gen AI tools may complement and enhance existing activities in a community, enabling a greater supply of information. On the negative side, LLMs may replace online knowledge communities altogether.\n\nIf the displacement effect dominates, it would give rise to several serious concerns. First, while LLMs offer innovative solutions for information retrieval and content creation and have been shown to significantly enhance individual productivity in a variety of writing and coding tasks, they have also been found to hallucinate, i.e., providing 'confidently incorrect' responses to user queries, and to undermine worker performance on certain types of tasks. Second, if individual participation in online communities were to decline, this would imply a decline in opportunities for all manner of interpersonal interaction, upon which many important activities depend, e.g., collaboration, mentorship, job search. Further, to the extent a similar dynamic may emerge within formal organizations and work contexts, it would raise the prospect of analogous declines in organizational attachment, peer learning, career advancement and innovation.\n\nWith the above in mind, we address two questions in this work. First, we examine the effects that generative artificial intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), have on individual engagement in online knowledge communities. Specifically, we assess how LLMs influence user participation and content creation in online knowledge communities. Second, we explore factors that moderate (amplify or attenuate) the effects of LLMs on participation and content creation at online knowledge communities. By addressing these relationships, we aim to advance our understanding of the role LLMs may play in shaping the future of knowledge sharing and collaboration online. Further, we seek to provide insights into approaches and strategies that can encourage a sustainable knowledge sharing dynamic between human users and AI technologies.\n\nWe evaluate our questions in the context of ChatGPT's release, in late November of 2022. We start by examining how the release of ChatGPT impacted Stack Overflow. We show that ChatGPT's release led to a marked decline in web traffic to Stack Overflow, and a commensurate decline in question posting volumes. We then consider how declines in participation may vary across community contexts. Leveraging data on posting activity in Reddit developer communities over the same period, we highlight a notable contrast: no detectible declines in participation. We attribute this difference to social fabric; whereas Stock Overflow focuses on pure information exchange, Reddit developer communities are characterized by stronger social bonds. Further, considering heterogeneity across topic domains within Stack Overflow, we show that declines in participation varied greatly depending on the availability of historical community data, a likely proxy for LLM's ability to address questions in a domain, given that data would likely have been used in training. Finally, we explore which users were most affected by ChatGPT's release, and the impact ChatGPT has had on the characteristics of content being posted.

When a ChatGPT user asks a coding question that has been answered on Stack Exchange's forum, the chatbot will be capable of fetching information from relevant posts. OpenAI says that it plans to \"provide attribution to the Stack Overflow community\" within ChatGPT responses.\n\nThe LLM developer will collaborate with Stack Overflow to improve its models. According to the companies, the effort will place an emphasis on making OpenAI's LLMs more useful for developers. This hints the goal is to enhance ChatGPT's code explanation and generation capabilities.\n\n\"Stack Overflow is the world's largest developer community, with more than 59 million questions and answers,\" said Stack Overflow Chief Executive Officer Prashanth Chandrasekar. \"Our goal with OverflowAPI, and our work to advance the era of socially responsible AI, is to set new standards with vetted, trusted, and accurate data that will be the foundation on which technology solutions are built and delivered to our user.\"\n\nOpenAI will access Stack Overflow data through OverflowAPI, an application programming interface that Stack Exchange debuted last June. It enables companies to license the more than 59 million coding questions and answers on the forum by buying a subscription. In addition to existing content, the subscription offers access to the new posts that users upload to Stack Overflow over time.\n\nOne major selling point of OverflowAPI is that it provides \"feedback signals\" an AI model can use to evaluate the accuracy and usefulness of a given post. Those feedback signals take the form of the upvote and downvote counters next to users' content submissions. By evaluating the number of upvotes a given post has received, neural networks can determine whether it should be incorporated into prompt responses.\n\nStack Exchange says that OverflowAPI can noticeably improve foundation models' coding capabilities. In an internal evaluation, the company used the API to train a version of Llama 2 with 34 billion parameters. The data from OverflowAPI increased the percentage of coding tasks the model performed successfully during the test by nearly 20%.\n\nOpenAI is not the only customer of OverflowAPI. In late February, Stack Exchange announced that Google LLC will make content from its forum available through the Gemini for Google Cloud chatbot. Stack Exchange, in turn, will use the search giant's public cloud as its \"platform of choice\" for hosting its forum.\n\nThe deal with OpenAI likewise extends beyond content licensing. Stack Exchange will use the LLM developer's models to support the development of OverflowAPI. Furthermore, it's working on integrations between Stack Overflow and OpenAI models that will begin rolling out by the end of June.\n\nIt's possible Stack Exchange plans to integrate OpenAI models into one or more of the AI features it's currently developing for its platform. Last year, the company previewed an enhanced version of the Stack Overflow search bar that can generate answers to coding questions based on information in forum posts. The technical level of the automatically-generated answers is customizable.\n\nStack Exchange also intends to add AI tools to Stack Overflow for Teams, a commercial product that software teams can use to share technical knowledge internally. One of the planned features is capable of automatically asking questions about code and other technical data stored in third-party platforms such as GitHub. According to Stack Exchange, those questions can help developers more quickly familiarize themselves with an application's code base.", "source": {"uri": "siliconangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SiliconANGLE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stack Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_Overflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stack Overflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "API"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial neural network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Cloud Platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GitHub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Source code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Languages", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Languages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Component_Frameworks", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Component Frameworks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Internet", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Threads", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Threads", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Metaprogramming", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Metaprogramming", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2024/05/Stack-Overflow.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542840", "eventUri": "eng-9542840", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 452723229, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 19, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 19}}}

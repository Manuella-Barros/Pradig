{"id": 225017290, "title": "Deadline for registering to vote in general election 2024 as cut off just weeks away", "text": "As Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announces a snap general election on July 4, Brits will be wondering if they have registered to vote or not. Voting is a right given to any British, Commonwealth or Republic of Ireland citizen over the age of 18 and is an important thing for people to decide on in their lives. But before you take part, you have to make sure you are registered to vote in the general election - and there is a deadline for this process to take place. According to the Electoral Commission, the deadline for registering to vote in the 2024 general election is Tuesday, June 18 at 11:59pm. In order to check if you have already registered to vote, you need to contact your local Electoral Registration Office to find out. If you aren't sure if you're already on the register, then there's no harm in registering now in order to make sure you can vote in the general election. You normally only need to register to vote once and not for every election, according to the UK Government website. However, you'll have to reregister if you have changed your name, moved house or switched nationalities. Registering to vote takes around five minutes and requires your national insurance number or passport number, and your address. After you've signed up, then your name and address will appear on the electoral register - this will then allow you to make your choice on July 4. For more information, check out the Government website here and sign up to vote in the general election on July 4.", "summary": "As political parties begin their campaigning for the snap general election on July 4, many people will be looking to see when their last opportunity is for registering to vote.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/deadline-registering-vote-general-election-32915890", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32916656.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1165687569.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:46:20", "author": "Abbie Meehan", "authors": ["Abbie Meehan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.081}

Enzo Millot put France in front, but a Fermin Lopez brace and an Alex Baena free-kick turned the final completely on its head. However, France staged a memorable comeback with Maghnes Akliouche pulling a goal back before Jean-Philippe Mateta converted a stoppage-time penalty awarded following a VAR review.\n\nThat took the final into extra time, where Rayo Vallecano forward Camello emerged as the hero by giving Spain the lead again in the 100 minute of an absorbing game, and then running away to seal their victory at the death. Silver medalists in Tokyo three years ago, it is the second time Spain have won Olympic men's football gold after their victory in Barcelona in 1992 with a squad featuring Pep Guardiola and Luis Enrique.\n\nFrance had hoped for a second gold of their own, 40 years after winning in Los Angeles, but instead has to settle for silver. The victory completes a glorious summer on the field for Spain's men after their triumph at the Euros in Germany last month. They also recently won the Under-19 Euros by getting the better of France in the final.\n\nHowever, Henry's team can leave with their heads held high at the end of a classic match, the scenario of which recalled memories of the 2022 World Cup final which France lost on penalties to Argentina after a similar comeback attempt.\n\nLopez brace\n\nThe final drama began when France went ahead after just 11 minutes thanks to Millot, who collected a scuffed Baena clearance just inside the box wide on the right and tried a first-time shot that caught out Spain goalkeeper Arnau Tenas.\n\nHowever, Spain came from behind to beat Morocco in the semi-finals and they were level here in the 18 minute thanks to Lopez. They strung together 26 passes in a move that culminated in Baena playing a ball into the middle for Lopez to finish.\n\nSpain went ahead on 25 minutes when a Juan Miranda cross was not dealt with by the French defence and Lopez converted the rebound after Guillaume Restes had saved the initial effort from Abel Ruiz. It was a sixth goal at the Olympics for Barcelona midfielder Lopez, who has had an outstanding tournament.\n\nPenalty drama\n\nThe game had barely restarted when Spain won a free-kick just outside the area for a foul on Miranda, and Villarreal midfielder Baena sent the dead ball over the wall and into the net. France had to chase the game but Mateta was denied by a superb Tenas save in first-half stoppage time, and Manu Kone headed against the bar just before the hour.\n\nTenas, of Paris Saint-Germain, distinguished himself again by tipping a Kone shot around the post, before France eventually scored a second goal on 79 minutes. Michael Olise delivered a free-kick from the right and Akliouche's touch took the ball beyond the goalkeeper.\n\nThat set the scene for what felt like inevitable last-minute penalty drama, with the referee initially giving nothing when Benat Turrientes wrestled Arnaud Kalimuendo to the ground. He changed his mind after a VAR review, and Mateta converted the spot-kick to equalize in the 93 minute.\n\nThere was still time for Turrientes to hit the bar before the game moved into extra time, in which Spain went back in front, this time for good. Adrian Bernabe released Camello and he beat Restes with a clipped finish to make it 4-3, before later running clear to score his team's fifth.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news",

They also recently won the Under-19 Euros by getting the better of France in the final.\n\nHowever, Henry's team can leave with their heads held high at the end of a classic match, the scenario of which recalled memories of the 2022 World Cup final which France lost on penalties to Argentina after a similar comeback attempt.\n\nLopez brace\n\nThe final drama began when France went ahead after just 11 minutes thanks to Millot, who collected a scuffed Baena clearance just inside the box wide on the right and tried a first-time shot that caught out Spain goalkeeper Arnau Tenas.\n\nHowever, Spain came from behind to beat Morocco in the semi-finals and they were level here in the 18th minute thanks to Lopez.\n\nThey strung together 26 passes in a move which culminated in Baena playing a ball into the middle for Lopez to finish.\n\nSpain went ahead on 25 minutes when a Juan Miranda cross was not dealt with by the French defence and Lopez converted the rebound after Guillaume Restes had saved the initial effort from Abel Ruiz.\n\nIt was a sixth goal at the Olympics for Barcelona midfielder Lopez, who has had an outstanding tournament.\n\nPenalty drama\n\nThe game had barely restarted when Spain won a free-kick just outside the area for a foul on Miranda, and Villarreal midfielder Baena sent the dead ball over the wall and into the net.\n\nFrance had to chase the game but Mateta was denied by a superb Tenas save in first-half stoppage time, and Manu Kone headed against the bar just before the hour.\n\nTenas, of Paris Saint-Germain, distinguished himself again by tipping a Kone shot around the post, before France eventually scored a second goal on 79 minutes.\n\nMichael Olise delivered a free-kick from the right and Akliouche's touch took the ball beyond the goalkeeper.\n\nThat set the scene for what felt like inevitable last-minute penalty drama, with the referee initially giving nothing when Benat Turrientes wrestled Arnaud Kalimuendo to the ground.\n\nHe changed his mind after a VAR review, and Mateta converted the spot-kick to equalise in the 93rd minute.\n\nThere was still time for Turrientes to hit the bar before the game moved into extra time, in which Spain went back in front, this time for good.\n\nAdrian Bernabe released Camello and he beat Restes with a clipped finish to make it 4-3, before later running clear to score his team's fifth.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki",

The referee initially said no, but he gave the decision following a VAR check, and Jean-Philippe Mateta stepped forward to level the scores at 3-3 in dramatic circumstances.\n\nSpain scored a fourth in the 100th minute, though, with Sergio Camello expertly lifting the ball past France goalkeeper Guillaume Restes after collecting a pass from Adrian Bernabe, and the same player then added another in the final moments following a quick break.\n\nSpain survive France comeback in Paris\n\nSpain have followed up on their gold medal in the men's football at the 1992 Olympics, and Santi Denia's side were deserved winners at the Paris 2024 Olympics despite being given a late scare.\n\nFrance were looking for their first gold medal since 1984, but a silver still represents a strong showing for the host nation despite falling just short of the main prize in front of a vocal home support.\n\nThe breakthrough came in the 11th minute of the contest, with Millot finding the back of the net courtesy of a huge mistake from Spain goalkeeper Arnau Tenas.\n\nIt looked to be a relatively comfortable save for Tenas, with Millot's strike from just inside the box lacking power, but it somehow ended up in the corner, with the Spain stopper palming it into his own goal.\n\nHowever, Tenas managed to make amends late in the first period, producing a stunning save to keep out a header from Mateta, before Olise just missed the target shortly before the whistle.\n\nTenas, who joined Paris Saint-Germain from Barcelona last year, made another big stop late on to deny Kouadio Kone, but France scored twice in the latter stages to force extra-time.\n\nMan of the Match: Fermin Lopez\n\nSpain levelled it at 1-1 in the 18th minute, with Barcelona midfielder Fermin brilliantly picking out the bottom corner after being found by Baena, as two members of Spain's Euro 2024-winning squad combined.\n\nFermin was at it again in the 25th minute, converting from close range after Abel Ruiz had seen his close-range effort kept out by France goalkeeper Guillaume Restes.\n\nSpain then had a third in the 28th minute, with Baena bending a free kick into the top corner; France were stunned, and it was a real battle for the hosts to work their way back into the contest, but they achieved it.\n\nFermin, who played once for Spain at Euro 2024, scored 11 times for Barcelona last season, and the hugely talented 21-year-old has ended the Olympics with six goals; he was replaced in the 72nd minute of Friday's final but was still the star of the show, closely followed by Mateta.\n\nFrance were relying on moments of individual quality, with Olise looking to get on the ball whenever possible, but Spain, much like their team at Euro 2024, were careful with their work, continuing to look for spaces in the final third, and they are comfortably the dominant outfit in the first half in Paris.\n\nAlexandre Lacazette found it so tough to make his mark, and he was replaced in the early stages of the second period, with France looking for some sort of response; the hosts forced extra-time with a late showing, but all of their hard work was ultimately for nothing.\n\nThe future is bright for Spain\n\nSpain were deserved winners of Euro 2024, and they could be the team to beat in the coming years, as a number of youngsters have enjoyed an excellent Olympics.\n\nPau Cubarsi will again be looking to secure regular minutes for Barcelona next season and can star for the national side in the future, while Baena and Fermin are also capable of being key players.\n\nSpain were tipped to enjoy a strong Olympics due to the strength of their squad, and much like the European Championship, there can be little argument that the best side has triumphed in this competition.\n\nFrance must be praised for their late comeback to force extra-time, but Turrientes smashed the crossbar in the latter stages of normal time, as he came close to atoning for his penalty error, and Spain then won it in extra-time courtesy of a brace from late substitute Camello.\n\nbody check tags ::", "source": {"uri": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk"}, "authors":

The match, held at Stade de Lyon, was a thrilling contest that ended with Spain winning 5-3 after extra time. France took an early lead, but Spain quickly fought back with goals from Fermin Lopez and \u00c1lex Baena. Despite a strong effort from France, including a late penalty by Jean-Philippe Mateta, Spain pulled ahead in extra time. Sergio Camello scored twice to secure the win for Spain, adding Olympic gold to their impressive trophy haul and capping off an incredible year.\n\nThierry Henry's French side struck first in the 1st minute. Enzo Millot seized on a defensive mistake and fired a shot from the right side of the area. Spain's goalkeeper, Arnau Tenas, misjudged the flight of the ball, allowing it to slip into the bottom-left corner. The early goal stunned Spain and set a high tempo for the match.\n\nSpain responded quickly and assertively. In the 18th minute, Barcelona's Fermin Lopez levelled the score with a calm finish into the bottom-left corner, following a precise pass from \u00c1lex Baena. The equaliser injected new energy into the Spanish side, who soon began to dominate.\n\nSpain's control was further solidified with two more goals before halftime. In the 25th minute, Lopez scored again, tapping in a rebound after Guillaume Restes had parried a shot from Abel Ruiz. Spain then extended their lead in the 28th minute with a spectacular free-kick from \u00c1lex Baena. His effort curled over the wall and into the top-left corner, leaving Restes with no chance and giving Spain a 3-1 advantage.\n\nFrance's defence, rattled by the swift turnaround, struggled to contain Spain's attacking flair. In the second half, France looked to rally. In the 79th minute, Maghnes Akliouche brought France back into the game with a header from Michael Olise's free-kick, reducing Spain's lead to 3-2 and setting up a tense finish.\n\nAs the match approached its end, the drama intensified. In stoppage time, Benat Turrientes fouled Arnaud Kalimuendo in the box, giving France a penalty. Jean-Philippe Mateta stepped up in the 93rd minute and converted the spot-kick, tying the game 3-3 and forcing it into extra time.\n\nThe additional 30 minutes were a test of stamina and composure. It was Spain who proved to be the stronger side. In the 100th minute, substitute Sergio Camello scored a crucial goal with a delicate chip over Restes, following a pass from Adri\u00e1n Bernab\u00e9. This goal put Spain ahead 4-3 and set them on the path to victory.\n\nCamello sealed the win in the 120th minute. As France pushed forward desperately, Tenas launched a long throw into the box. Camello, showing great positioning, controlled the ball and finished past Restes, securing a 5-3 victory for Spain.\n\nSpain's triumph added Olympic gold to their impressive list of achievements, rounding off a remarkable year for the national team. For France, despite a valiant effort and a dramatic performance, the gold medal eluded them, leaving them with silver in a match that was full of excitement and high drama.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nillohit_bagchi@news9live.com", "name": "Nillohit Bagchi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lex_Baena", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lex Baena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnau_Tenas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arnau Tenas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Millot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Millot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Camello", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Camello"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Philippe_Mateta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Philippe Mateta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_Olympique_Lyonnais", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parc Olympique Lyonnais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thierry Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel_Ruiz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abel Ruiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be\u00f1at_Turrientes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Be\u00f1at Turrientes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adri\u00e1n_Bernab\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adri\u00e1n Bernab\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnaud_Kalimuendo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arnaud Kalimuendo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Olise", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Olise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Animal_Sports/Bullfighting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Animal Sports/Bullfighting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Associations/By_Region", "label": "dmoz/Business/Associations/By Region", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Jai_Alai", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Jai Alai", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Spain-vs-France.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805057", "eventUri": "eng-9805057", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

France won silver at the Paris Games in 1900, and last won gold at Los Angeles in 1984.\n\nThe men's soccer final was a wave of emotions for the French, who were elated after Enzo Millot scored in the 11th minute.\n\nAbout 17 minutes later, Spain's Ferm\u00edn L\u00f3pez scored twice (18' and 25'), and \u00c1lex Baena scored a free kick (28') to take a commanding 3-1 lead.\n\nFrance trailed for much of the match until Jean-Philippe Mateta converted a penalty kick in stoppage time to tie Spain at 3 in the final minutes of regulation.\n\nFrance's Arnaud Kalimuendo was taken down by Spain's Be\u00f1at Turrientes inside the penalty area during a late corner kick in the 89th minute, and the penalty kick was awarded to France after VAR.\n\nThanks to Maghnes Akliouche's goal in the 79th minute, France erased a 3-1 deficit to force extra time.\n\nUnfortunately for France, Spain would not be denied.\n\nCheck out these highlights from USA TODAY Sports on the France-Spain match today:\n\nHow to watch France vs. Spain Olympic men's soccer final?\n\nTV, streaming: USA Network (Fubo), Telemundo, Peacock and NBCOlympics.com\n\nSergio Camello goal: Spain 5, France 3\n\nSpain is on its way to gold at the Paris Olympics against host France.\n\nSergio Camello scored his second goal in extra time (120+1'), and Spain will hang on to win the men's soccer final.\n\nSergio Camello goal: Spain 4, France 3 in extra time\n\nSpain is back on top: Sergio Camello chipped in a goal over sliding French goalkeeper Guillaume Restes to take a 4-3 lead in the 100th minute during extra time.\n\nFrance storms back to force extra time vs. Spain in men's soccer final\n\nThe men's soccer final is not over, and France is back in it.\n\nFrance's Jean-Philippe Mateta converted a penalty kick in stoppage time to tie Spain at 3 in the final minutes of regulation.

Michael Olise also had a left boot that just sailed outside the left post in a hectic sequence near the net. France defender Loic Bad\u00e9 also finished the half with a yellow card after a foul.\n\n\u00c1lex Baena goal: Spain 3, France 1\n\nSpain is on fire in Paris: \u00c1lex Baena scored a free kick goal into the left corner of the net to help Spain take a 3-1 lead in the 28th minute against France in the gold medal match.\n\nSpain scored three unanswered goals in a span of 10 minutes after falling behind 1-0 to France in the 11th minute.\n\nFerm\u00edn L\u00f3pez goal: Spain 2, France 1\n\nIn a matter of 15 minutes, Spain turned an early deficit into an early lead.\n\nFerm\u00edn L\u00f3pez already has a brace after his second goal, a putback in front of the net in the 25th minute, to help Spain take a 2-1 lead against France.\n\nL\u00f3pez has six goals at the Paris Games, two shy of Morocco's Soufiane Rahimi.\n\nFerm\u00edn L\u00f3pez goal: France 1, Spain 1\n\nIt didn't take Spain long to respond: Ferm\u00edn L\u00f3pez finished a stellar sequence with a right boot into the back of the net in the 18th minute of this gold medal match against host France. It's just the second goal France has allowed during the Paris Games.\n\nEnzo Millot goal: France 1, Spain 0\n\nFrance is on the board early in the gold medal game: Enzo Millot's left boot was deflected by Spain goalie Arnau Tenas into the left side of the net in the 11th minute.\n\nFrance vs. Spain betting odds\n\nFrance (+150) is a slight favorite over Spain (+200), while a draw is +195 at BETMGM. These odds only account for the 90-minute regulation.\n\nHow did France reach gold medal game?

(Photo by Patricia De Melo Moreira/ AFP)\n\nThe dramatic climax sent the home fans wild as they chanted \"Alez Les Bleus\" and roared their team on.\n\nAnd while Camello's goals ultimately ended French hopes of a first gold since Los Angeles 1984 the crowd continued to cheer loudly as coach Thierry Henry and his players showed their appreciation with a lap of honor after the final whistle.\n\n\"It was a crazy final, at the end we got a medal,\" Henry told France 2. \"Unfortunately, we are not Olympic champions but you can't take anything away from this team.\"\n\nCamello's second goal, racing away from his own half before firing past Restes, sparked frenzied celebrations from the Spanish.\n\nThe forward tore off his shirt and was swamped by teammates and substitutes, who piled onto the field from the touchline.\n\nHe had only come as substitute as Spain tried to protect its lead in regulation - but ended up a national hero.\n\nSpain's victory ended the dominance of Latin American nations for the last five editions of the Olympics. Brazil and Argentina won twice in that time, with Mexico also taking gold.\n\nNigeria won at Atlanta 1996 and Cameroon at Sydney 2000.\n\nSpain's women couldn't make it a medal double in the soccer

This victory secured Spain the gold medal, marking a triumphant summer for Spanish football following their recent European Championship win.\n\nSpain, which had lost to Brazil in the Tokyo Olympics final three years ago, has now become the first European team to win gold in men's football since their last victory at the 1992 Barcelona Games.\n\nFrance initially took the lead in the 21st minute when Spanish goalkeeper Arnau Tenas misjudged a powerful shot from Enzo Millot, inadvertently punching the ball into his own net.\n\nHowever, Spain quickly responded with a show of attacking prowess. Barcelona's 21-year-old Fermin Lopez played a pivotal role by scoring twice. He first equalized with a low drive and then netted another goal at the back post, showcasing his clinical finishing.\n\nSpain then extended their lead to 3-1 during a thrilling 10-minute period in the first half. \u00c1lex Baena delivered a stunning free-kick into the top left corner, adding to his earlier assist and providing Spain with a commanding lead at halftime.\n\nFrance's resilience shone through as they mounted a formidable comeback in the second half. Maghnes Akliouche scored a crucial goal to bring the score to 3-2.\n\nThe match reached a critical moment in stoppage time when Jean-Philippe Mateta calmly converted a penalty, awarded after a VAR review of a rugby-style tackle by Be\u00f1at Turrientes, to level the score and force extra time.\n\nThe additional period was marked by intense drama as both teams fought for supremacy. Spain's substitute, Sergio Camello, became the hero of the final. In the 100th minute, Camello delicately chipped the ball over French goalkeeper Guillaume Restes to regain the lead for Spain.\n\nHe then sealed the victory with a second goal in the final minute of added time, converting a long throw from Tenas to make it 5-3.\n\nDespite France's valiant efforts and numerous attempts from Michael Olise and Mateta, their comeback fell short as Spain's defense held firm. Spain's victory was a testament to their skill, determination, and resilience.\n\nThis thrilling encounter, marked by high drama and exceptional performances, highlighted the vibrancy and competitiveness of the Olympic football tournament. Spain's triumph at the Paris Olympics not only secured their gold medal but also underscored their resurgence as a dominant force in international football.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnau_Tenas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arnau Tenas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football in Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_des_Princes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parc des Princes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Millot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Millot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lex_Baena", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lex Baena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghnes_Akliouche", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maghnes Akliouche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Camello", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Camello"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Philippe_Mateta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Philippe Mateta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be\u00f1at_Turrientes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Be\u00f1at Turrientes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Olise", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Olise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football at the Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static-gi.asianetnews.com/images/01j4w8x5dhrfy7gcj14bkwtqfc/gettyimages-2166074009.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805057", "eventUri": "eng-9805057", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Tenas in the first minute of extra time.\n\nHis deft lob made it 4-3 for Spain in the 100th minute when a pass from teammate Adrian Bernabe found him unmarked in front of France goalkeeper Guillaume Restes.\n\nSpain had scored three goals in ten first-half minutes, but France equalized with a penalty in injury time to drag the match into extra time.\n\nMidfielder Enzo Millot put the hosts 1-0 ahead in the 11th minute as he capitalized on a failed clearance at the right-hand side of the box and drove in an angled shot.\n\nFermin Lopez pulled level for Spain in the 18th minute when he met a pass from the right flank unchallenged before firing home.\n\nIn the 26th minute, Lopez tapped in a rebound after Restes had failed to hold a shot, making it 2-1.\n\nTwo minutes later, Alex Baena curved in direct free kick to put Spain 3-1 in front.\n\nFrance stepped up their offense after the break, and midfielder Manu Kone almost found the net in the 57th minute when his header hit the

minutes.\n\nMichael Olise missed a chance to make it two just moments later before Spain hit back through Fermin Lopez to equalise.\n\nThe momentum had firmly shifted in favour of the Spanish at this point, and the Barcelona starlet was again on hand, netting his sixth goal of the tournament to give his side the lead.\n\nSpain promptly pressed their advantage and a fabulous strike from Alex Baena made it 3-1 just minutes later seemingly putting the game to bed in the process.\n\nSergio Camello came off the bench to fire Spain to victory in men's Olympic football final\n\nThe Rayo Vallecano

were fortunate not to go even further behind as goalkeeper Guillaume Restes was forced into action on several occasions.\n\nWith the capacity crowd willing them on France grew into the game after the interval, and Olise caused chaos in the Spanish defence with his free-kick as the game approached its closing stages.\n\nThe driven cross looked made its way to Maghnes Akliouche who managed to get the slightest of touches to divert the ball beyond Arnau Tenas in the Spain goal.\n\nFrance continued to push for an equaliser late on and were awarded for their efforts after the referee pointed to the spot after a VAR review following a foul by Benat Turrientes.\n\nJean-Philippe Mateta stepped up to take the stoppage-time spot kick and promptly sent the game to extra-time by cooly slotting his strike home to send the game into extra-time.\n\nBoth sides had their chances in the first-half of extra-time but Spain were clinical when it counted and Sergio Camello netted a chip from close range

The Monaco midfielder had already pulled a goal back for Les Bleus, and when a VAR review showed Spain's Benat Turrientes had fouled him, Mateta drilled in the spot-kick and the drama of extra time ensued.\n\nSanti Denia's team showed their own resilience though by re-taking the lead in the first half of that nail-biting extra time, through another substitute Sergio Camello. Rayo Vallecano's Camello put a last flourish on the scoreline to make it 5-3 for Spain at the very last gasp, latching onto a long and accurate kick from Tenas.\n\nSpain had long since taken off their potent duo of Lopez and Baena, the latter La Liga's joint top goal creator last season, but were grateful for the decisive saves of Tenas as well as that last assist.\n\nThe graduate of Barcelona's La Masia academy, who joined PSG last summer, had got it horribly wrong in their first-half when he misjudged Millot's first-time left-footed shot after meek defending, the strike confounding the 23-year-old goalkeeper.\n\nBut he atoned in style with two sensational saves to deny Crystal Palace striker Mateta and midfielder Kouadio Kone as France pushed hard in the second half.\n\nUrged on by the Paris crowd the hosts cut the deficit on 79 minutes when substitute Maghnes Akliouche got the slightest touch to Michael Olise's free-kick and the ball spun into the net.\n\nIt was Bayern Munich man Olise's fourth assist of the tournament, and he led the French revival with typical energy and skill.\n\nMonaco midfielder Akliouche would play a decisive part again when he was held by Turrientes in the box as a corner came in during added time. VAR checked the incident and eventually, Brazilian referee Ramon Abatti pointed to the spot. With the pressure firmly on, Mateta drilled the ball into the corner as Parc des Princes erupted.\n\nTurrientes then struck the crossbar with France caught upfield in the seventh-minute of added time.\n\nIn extra-time Henry's men did not give up despite tired legs, responding to Henry's dynamic presence in the technical area.\n\nBut they could not find another way back and it was Spain whose golden summer continued.\n\nThe last time a Spain team won an Olympic final in any discipline was in Atlanta 1996, with the water polo men's team getting the gold medal. They had lost every final in every sport since then - up until the 2024 football team stepped into the Parc Des Princes.\n\nSpain won the competition leaving out of the squad their two biggest young stars in Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams, both eligible to play. But this is somehow Spain's biggest success - not relying on individual names but in their collective approach.\n\nThis wasn't a Spain team as dominant as the one that won the Euro 2024, but chemistry built among a group of footballers who had played together for ages in youth ranks, plus individualities rising up at the right time, made it for Spain.\n\nIt will go down as the tournament of Fermin Lopez, who scored six goals and delivered two assists in six games. Two years ago, he could not even earn a spot at Barcelona's second team. Alex Baena became the team's midfield general. 17-year-old Pau Cubarsi the youngest footballer to ever get a golden medal.\n\nThe big names were there in a well-fought final, but it felt a bit like destiny to see the team's back-up striker to eventually give them the title.\n\nAs Mikel Oyarzabal did in the Euro 2024 final against England, Sergio Camello rose to the occasion in Pais in the

The victory marks Spain's second Olympic football gold, following their triumph in Barcelona in 1992.\n\nThe match started with France taking an early lead in the 11th minute. Enzo Millot capitalized on a mistake by Spanish goalkeeper Arnau Tenas, whose attempted save only resulted in the ball rolling into the net. However, Spain responded with remarkable resilience and efficiency.\n\nSpain's comeback began with Fermin Lopez scoring twice in quick succession. His first goal in the 18th minute came after a well-placed pass from Alex Baena. His second goal came seven minutes later as he seized on a rebound to put his team ahead.\n\nThe turning point came with a stunning free-kick from Alex Baena in the 28th minute. Baena's strike left French goalkeeper Guillaume Restes rooted to the spot and secured Spain's 3-1 lead.\n\nDespite a continuous effort from France, including a header from Kone that hit the bar and several near-misses, Spain maintained their lead with disciplined defending and effective counter-attacks.\n\nBut in the second half of the game, France mounted a late comeback. In the 78th minute, Maghnes Akliouche scored from a free-kick, making it 3-2.\n\nWith the narrow gap, France kept pressing for an equalizer, with a series of chances.\n\nThe match reached its peak drama during added time, with Jean-Philippe Mateta converting a penalty to level the score at 3-3 and send the match into extra time.\n\nThe added time was intense, with both teams vying desperately for the gold. In the end, it was Spain who sealed the deal during extra time, thanks to two goals from Camello.\n\nFrance reached the final after beating Egypt 3-1, while Spain advanced by overcoming Morocco 2-1. In the third-place match held yesterday, Morocco stunned Egypt with a 6-0 win, clinching the country's first-ever Olympic football medal.\n\n\u00a9 Morocco World News. All Rights Reserved.

des Princes, capitalising on a poor clearance to net the opener after 11 minutes.\n\nMichael Olise missed a chance to make it two just moments later before Spain hit back through Fermin Lopez to equalise.\n\nThe momentum had firmly shifted in favour of the Spanish at this point, and the Barcelona starlet was again on hand, netting his sixth goal of the tournament to give his side the

It's been a golden summer for Spanish soccer.\n\nParis, Aug 9 (AP) It's been a golden summer for Spanish soccer.\n\nLess than a month after winning the European Championship, Spain followed up with a thrilling 5-3 extra-time victory in the Olympic men's final against France on Friday.\n\nAlso Read | India at Olympics 2024 Schedule Today: Check Full List of Indian Athletes in Action on August 10 in Paris With Time in IST.\n\nSergio Camello's two goals at Parc des Princes eventually sealed a dramatic match, which had seen France fight back from 3-1 down to force extra time.\n\n\"We are the happiest children in the world,\" said Camello, who had come on as an 83rd-minute substitute.\n\nAlso Read | Hearing Concludes in Vinesh Phogat's Appeal in CAS Against Her Disqualification From Women's 50 Kg Final at Paris Olympics 2024, IOA Hopeful Of Positive Resolution.\n\nSpain's coach Santi Denia said his players deserved to cry \"tears of joy\" after \"such a long-suffering match.\"\n\nFrance pushed the game to extra time when Jean-Phillipe Mateta equalized from the penalty spot in the 93rd minute of regulation.\n\nBut Camello coolly lifted over France goalkeeper Guillaume Restes in the 100th and got his second in the first minute of time added on.\n\nSpain, which lost the final to Brazil at the Tokyo Olympics three years ago, became the first European gold medalist in men's soccer since it last won the tournament at the Barcelona Games in 1992.\n\nThe Olympic victory marked a personal double for Fermin Lopez and Alex Baena, who were both part of the Euro 2024-winning squad.\n\nBarcelona star Lopez scored twice and Baena got Spain's other goal in a blistering 10-minute spell in the first half which gave it a 3-1 lead at the break after Enzo Millot had opened the scoring for France.\n\nBut the game was turned on its head when France mounted a late fightback through Maghnes Akliouche and Mateta.\n\nThe dramatic climax sent the home fans wild as they chanted \"Alez Les Bleus\" and roared their team on.\n\nAnd while Camello's goals ultimately ended French hopes of a first gold since Los Angeles 1984 the crowd continued to cheer loudly as coach Thierry Henry and his players showed their appreciation with a lap of honor after the final whistle.\n\n\"It was a crazy final, at the end we got a medal,\" Henry told France 2. \"Unfortunately, we are not Olympic champions but you can't take anything away from this team.\"\n\nCamello's second goal, racing away from his own half before firing past Restes, sparked frenzied celebrations from the Spanish.\n\nThe forward tore off his shirt and was swamped by teammates and substitutes, who piled onto the field from the touchline.\n\nHe had only come as substitute as Spain tried to protect its lead in regulation -- but ended up a national hero.\n\nSpain's victory ended the dominance of Latin American nations for the last five editions of the Olympics. Brazil and Argentina won twice in that time, with Mexico also taking gold.\n\nNigeria won at Atlanta 1996 and Cameroon at Sydney 2000.\n\nSpain's women couldn't make it a medal double in the soccer tournaments after losing 1-0 Germany in the bronze medal match.

Mateta kept his composure to level the match.\n\nThere was still time for Turrientes to hit the bar but in the end Spain's savvy prevailed in extra-time, with the Tokyo silver medallists soaking up French pressure before a classy pass from Adrian Bernabe rolled Camello in to put his side back in front before a breakaway wrapped up a first Olympic title for Spain since their home 1992 Barcelona Games.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Philippe_Mateta", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Philippe Mateta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thierry Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_des_Princes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parc des Princes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnau_Tenas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arnau Tenas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Millot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Millot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lex_Baena", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lex Baena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Camello", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Camello"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "German Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be\u00f1at_Turrientes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Be\u00f1at Turrientes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghnes_Akliouche", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maghnes Akliouche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnaud_Kalimuendo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arnaud Kalimuendo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Olise", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Olise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://e0.365dm.com/24/08/1600x900/skysports-camello-spain-france_6652263.jpg?20240809193538", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805057", "eventUri": "eng-9805057", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Jumping out to a two goal lead by halftime, it seemed like Spain were going to make quick work of the match but it was anything but. Fermin Lopez's brace was boosted by a goal from Alex Baena for Spain to score three consecutive goals following Enzo Millot's opener for the host nation.\n\nWith this victory, Spain has become only the second nation -- along with France -- to win Euros and the Olympics in the same summer. France showed impressive fortitude under Thierry Henry to fight back in the second half with VAR awarding a penalty that Jean-Philippe Mateta slotted home in the 93rd minute of play in order to force the extra period. Sergio Camello netted the go-ahead goal in extra time to put Spain ahead for good but France would still try to push for another equalizer.\n\nSpain would end the match on quite a high note with Paris Saint-Germain keeper Arnau Tenas noticing an opening to find Camello over the top putting the match out of sight. France were pushing everything forward in search of an equalizer so the situational awareness was important to put the match out of reach.\n\nBoth sides have been on impressive runs during these Olympics but Lopez's performances in getting Spain to gold were something else. Involved in the Spain side for both the Euros and the Olympics, the Barcelona man was able to score six goals and assist two more during the tournament.\n\nThe future is bright for both national teams as players like Lopez could come back to their teams for more playing time after this tournament. Even Mateta has been subject to transfer rumors after scoring five goals of his own during the Olympics. He's set to be the starting striker for Crystal Palace, but if he could move to a European team, this will show what international tournaments can do for player values.\n\nWhile the men's side includes younger players, the over aged spots for players like Mateta are critical. Picking the right players can be the difference, and it almost was for France but Spain had that something extra to win gold.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chuck_booth@cbssports.com", "name": "Chuck Booth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thierry Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Millot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Millot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lex_Baena", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lex Baena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Camello", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Camello"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnau_Tenas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arnau Tenas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Philippe_Mateta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Philippe Mateta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/08/09/7fef95cb-16e1-46c6-a361-4ba3304311e4/thumbnail/1200x675/95345aed3293a247fdfb579e0df61877/untitled-design-2024-08-09t211213-980.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805057", "eventUri": "eng-9805057", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

They also recently won the Under-19 Euros by getting the better of France in the final.\n\nHowever, Henry's team can leave with their heads held high at the end of a classic match, the scenario of

Please try again later.\n\nPARIS -- Judging strictly from the sights and sounds Saturday at Parc des Princes -- the famous soccer stadium tucked in the southwest sector of this radiant city -- one might not have the slightest idea Olympic men's soccer barely registers on the sport's vast landscape.\n\nNever mind most of the players are 23 and under, almost all the stars of the game are in preseason camp with their clubs, and the gold medal is a quaint souvenir compared to the World Cup trophy.\n\nThis was an occasion transcending the tournament's narrow parameters. Titans of the sport and incubators of exceptional talent crossed paths for an evening of extraordinary drama, culminating with two extra-time goals by substitute Sergio Camello that lifted Spain over France, 5-3, for its first gold medal in 32 years.\n\nIt was the highest-scoring Olympic men's final in its 124-year history. France has not won the gold medal since 1984.\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\nGet the latest updates on the 2024 Olympics\n\n(Washington Post illustration)\n\nTrack all the Paris Olympic medal counts country by country, and see the breakdown of medals by U.S. athletes. Get live updates from Paris and keep up with the latest by signing up for The Sports Moment: Olympics Edition.\n\nEnd of carousel\n\nSpain extinguished an early deficit with three goals in an 11-minute span of the first half, two by midfielder Ferm\u00edn L\u00f3pez. France scored in the 79th minute and drew even on a penalty kick in stoppage time. Parc des Princes shook.\n\nBut 10 minutes into the 30-minute extra session, Camello collected Adrian Bernabe's piercing pass and chipped the ball over goalkeeper Tenas Arnau. In the dying seconds, Camello scored again, on a breakaway assisted by goalkeeper Arnau Tenas, who threw the ball to midfield.\n\nThe Olympics came at a bountiful time for Spanish soccer. In the past year, the women's national team won the World Cup, and the men's squad won the European Championship. The under-21 men are European runners-up, while the women's under-20 and under-17 sides are world champions.\n\nThe Olympic women's team stumbled in the semifinals, while the men advanced to the final for the second consecutive Olympics.\n\nIt's been a long wait for the French to enjoy Olympic joy. After winning the 1984 gold medal in Los Angeles, Les Bleus not only had failed to get past the Olympic quarterfinals, they had failed to even qualified for the tournament seven of nine times.\n\nUsing their automatic berth this summer, they struggled in the group opener against the United States before blowing open the match, then narrowly defeated Guinea and needed to come from behind to dismiss Egypt in extra time of the semifinals Monday.\n\nNonetheless, France's run had been a triumphant for Coach Thierry Henry, the former superstar who seems on the path to someday succeed Didier Deschamps, the national team coach for 12 years.\n\nJust selecting the roster was not an easy task (for any coach) because FIFA does not require clubs to release players. Had it, Henry would have named three of the biggest names in French soccer as over-aged players: Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Antoine Greizmann and Olivier Girard.\n\n\"I haven't been rejected this much since high school,\" Henry joked before the tournament.\n\nHe was able to assemble a formidable squad because France is producing a seemingly endless supply of world-class talent. So is Spain, though.\n\nFrance went ahead in the 11th minute when Tenas, who plays at Parc des Princes for Paris Saint-Germain, misjudged Enzo Millot's wicked shot from just inside the penalty area. Shifting toward the near post, Tenas had to reach back to get both hands on the ball, which fluttered into the far side of the net.\n\nSeven minutes later, France left L\u00f3pez alone in the heart of the box for a quick one-timer on \u00c1lex Baena's pass.\n\nIn the 25th minute, L\u00f3pez, a 21-year-old from FC Barcelona, put away the rebound after goalkeeper Guillaume Restes blocked Abel Ruiz's close-in bid for his sixth goal in six matches. Left back Juan Miranda had created the danger with an outstanding cross.\n\nThe goals kept coming. On a 20-yard free kick in the 28th minute, Baena hooked the ball into the near side with such exquisite execution, Restes did not budge.\n\nBefore the halftime whistle, Spain continued to threaten and Tenas made amends for his early mistake with a brilliant save.\n\nThe freewheeling match left the door open to a France comeback -- or a Spain blowout. France's Manu Kone headed off the crossbar in the 57th minute. Spain tried to slow the tempo and sustain possession. France continued to press. Rain began to fall. Tenas made a diving save on Kone in the 72nd.\n\nSeven minutes later, Michael Olise drove a free kick from the top corner of the box into a tangle of players. French substitute Maghnes Akliouche leaped in the ball's path. Tenas tried tracking it as it skidded into the far corner of the net. Whether he deflected it, Akliouche was credited with the goal.\n\nPushed by the deafening crowd, France kept coming.\n\nOn a corner kick early in stoppage time, Miranda wrapped both arms around Arnaud Kalimuendo and took him down. Referee Ramon Abatti allowed play to continue, but after the video assistant referee recommended a review, Abatti awarded the penalty kick. Jean-Philippe Mateta converted.\n\nBefore the match reached extra time, Spain's Benat Turrientes hit the crossbar.\n\nExtra time was more of the delightful same until Camello provided the breakthrough.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_goff@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Steven Goff", "type": "author",

One of the greatest football matches in the history of the Olympics had every twist and turn imaginable, and Ferm\u00edn scored twice to add his own name to history and claim Olympic gold less than a month after winning Euro 2024, in what has been a dream summer for the young Bar\u00e7a midfielder and the Spanish national team.\n\nFIRST HALF\n\nThe opening period was wildly entertaining, with both sides willing to take risks and going all in from the beginning, playing fast, attack-minded football from the get-go. France made the better start, and it was rewarded 10 minutes in when a shot from Enzo Millot that should have resulted in a routine save by Arnau Tenas was badly spilled by the former Bar\u00e7a keeper, and the ball went into the net to put the hosts in front.\n\nSpain responded well by taking better care of the ball and moving it quickly between the lines, stepping up their intensity and pressing higher up the pitch. And that's how they set up a magical 10-minute sequence that changed the final completely.\n\nIt all began with a pass from Pau Cubars\u00ed that started a beautiful passing move, which ended with an assist by \u00c1lex Baena and a gorgeous finish from Ferm\u00edn L\u00f3pez, who then doubled his tally and gave Spain the lead by tapping home the rebound after Abel Ruiz's shot was saved by the keeper.\n\nThree minutes after Ferm\u00edn's second goal came a fantastic free-kick goal by Baena, and suddenly La Roja had a 3-1 lead. France were visibly shook by the sudden turn of events and took a while to respond, but still found a way to create real danger towards the end of the half. Jean-Philippe Mateta's header produced an extraordinary save by Tenas, and Michael Olise almost found the bottom corner but saw his shot go agonizingly wide.\n\nThe halftime whistle came to end a breathtaking first half with Spain ahead by two goals and 45 minutes away from gold against a French side desperate for a comeback, which promised a second half for the ages in Paris.\n\nSECOND HALF\n\nThe final period was all about France trying to come back and dominating possession, while Spain stayed organized at the back and looked to kill the game off on the counter. La Roja missed a couple of early chances but mostly defended for almost the entire half, and they had to dodge quite a few bullets.\n\nThe two biggest chances for Les Bleus came through midfielder Manu Kon\u00e9, who headed a cross from the left wing into the crossbar and had a sure-fire goal denied by another world-class save from Tenas, and Spain somehow held on to their two-goal lead going into the final 15 minutes.\n\nBut the French pressure was too strong and the hosts found a way back in the game, as Olise fired a free-kick into the box and the ball deflected off Juan Miranda and went into the net, setting up a dramatic finish in Paris with 10 minutes plus added time to go.\n\nSpain tried their best to slow down the pace of the game with a few substitutions and by looking to keep the ball for extended periods to avoid conceding more dangerous chances. Sergio G\u00f3mez had a huge chance on the counter to kill the game off but fired his shot just wide, and the game was still up for grabs in the dying moments.\n\nThen came a late corner-kick for France in added time, and Be\u00f1at Turrientes was called for a foul in the box after a VAR review. Mateta scored the penalty with ease, and France completed their own incredible comeback.\n\nThere was still time for a few more twists, and Turrientes almost made up for his mistake with a chance to win the game but hit the crossbar instead, and Olise almost scored an amazing solo goal but was stopped by Tenas.\n\nThe final whistle came to temporarily stop an unbelievable Gold Medal Match, and we were headed for extra time in a game that absolutely deserved 30 more minutes.\n\nEXTRA TIME\n\nFrance carried the momentum from the extraordinary finish of regulation into the extra period, dominating the ball and creating more danger with crosses and set pieces that almost unlocked the Spanish defense for a fourth time.\n\nLa Roja looked on the ropes and in desperate need of a moment of magic, and it came 100 minutes into the contest: Adri\u00e1n Bernab\u00e9 played a nice through ball to Sergio Camello, who showed remarkable poise to lob the keeper and put Spain back on top with 20 minutes remaining.\n\nFrance tried everything in the dying moments to try and equalize, and Tenas came up big time and time again. And the goalkeeper had one final trick up his sleeve, with a long kick down the middle releasing Camello, who lobbed the French keeper AGAIN to score his second goal in extra time and silence the Parc des Princes.\n\nThe final whistle came shortly after to end one of the greatest football matches in the history of the Olympic Games, and La Roja have now added a Gold Medal to their Euro 2024 victory. What a summer for Spain, what a football match, and what a player Ferm\u00edn L\u00f3pez is.\n\nFrance: Restes; Sildillia (Cherki 111'), Bad\u00e9, Lukeba, Truffert (Locko 91'); Millot (Dou\u00e9

Enzo Millot opened the scoring after just 11 minutes after Arnau Tenas fumbled his effort into the corner, and the French had their tails up.\n\nThe task went uphill, but Spain turned the tables in rapid fashion. Fermin Lopez was found unmarked by Alex Baena in the box and rolled home for his fifth goal of the tournament in the 18th minute. His sixth, which would see him end as top scorer, followed seven minutes later, after he followed up an Abel Ruiz effort for a poacher's goal. When Baena curled a free-kick in three minutes later, and 17 minutes on from France's opener, it seemed La Roja had things in their hand.\n\nAnd they did for the most part, save from one good save until the 79th minute. As France began to dominate territory though, a Michael Olise free-kick was glanced by Juan Miranda and ended up in his own goal. France continued to push but without much success, until Arnaud Kalimuendo was brought down by Benat Turrientes in stoppage time, which after a VAR review ended up as a penalty. Even after Jean-Philippe Mateta converted to make it 3-3, there was still time for Turrientes to strike the bar with a fingertip save from Theo de Percin.\n\nDespite now having three central defenders on, used to protect the lead, La Roja still managed to find a way forward. Sergio Gomez laid it on a plate for Juan Miranda in behind, but he went back across goal rather than at it. However when Adria Bernabe gave three French defenders the slip in behind for Sergio Camello to run onto, he managed to keep his cool with a dreamy chip over the goalkeeper to put Spain back in front after 102 minutes.\n\nFrance would come again, and applied pressure, but the excellent Pau Cubarsi and Eric Garcia continued to intervene at the last moment. And as the Parc des Princes reached fever pitch, Camello silenced it again. Tenas gathered from a corner, and unleashed a brilliant throw to set Camello straight through on goal, and he beat de Percin with a lifted finish again in the 121st minute.\n\nIt sealed a glorious summer for Spanish football with a 5-3 win over the hosts, coming out gold medallists in the Olympics for a second time. In addition to Spain's Olympic title, La Roja now hold 10 international titles, four of which came this summer in Euros at senior men's level, men's under-19 and women's under-19 level.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lex_Baena", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lex Baena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be\u00f1at_Turrientes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Be\u00f1at Turrientes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnau_Tenas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arnau Tenas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Millot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Millot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santi_Denia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santi Denia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_des_Princes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parc des Princes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnaud_Kalimuendo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arnaud Kalimuendo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Olise", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Olise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Camello", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Camello"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Miranda_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Miranda (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Philippe_Mateta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Philippe Mateta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel_Ruiz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abel Ruiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_G\u00f3mez_(footballer,_born_2000)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio G\u00f3mez (footballer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Garc\u00eda_(footballer,_born_2001)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eric Garc\u00eda (footballer, born 2001)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_under-19_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain national under-19 football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_under-23_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain national under-23 football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_Spain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football in Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/g9tAnBA5RJW4qYG8DG7drw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/football_espana_articles_993/5cd0227baf4ad84b5f10e1f1cc19df49", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805057", "eventUri": "eng-9805057", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

This intense match, which featured a record-breaking scoreline for an Olympic final, transcended the typical parameters of the tournament, as two giants of world football collided in a battle of skill, strategy, and resilience.\n\nThe significance of this match extended beyond the gold medal, which is often considered a mere keepsake compared to the prestigious World Cup trophy. Despite the absence of many star players, who are currently in preseason camps with their clubs, the game drew global attention as young talents from both nations showcased their prowess on an international stage.\n\nSpain's victory was hard-fought. They overcame an early setback and mounted an impressive comeback, culminating in two decisive goals during extra time by substitute Sergio Camello. His heroics secured Spain's place in history with the highest-scoring Olympic men's final in the 124-year history of the Games. France, meanwhile, continues to chase Olympic glory, having last won the gold medal in 1984.\n\nThe evening began with France taking an early lead in the 11th minute. Paris Saint-Germain's goalkeeper Arnau Tenas, playing on his home turf, misjudged a powerful shot from Enzo Millot, allowing France to draw first blood. However, Spain quickly retaliated with a barrage of goals in the first half, turning the tide of the match. Ferm\u00edn L\u00f3pez, the 21-year-old midfielder from FC Barcelona, was instrumental, scoring twice within an 11-minute span. His first goal came from a swift one-timer following \u00c1lex Baena's precise pass, and his second was a composed finish after Guillaume Restes, France's goalkeeper, deflected an initial shot from Abel Ruiz.\n\nSpain's momentum seemed unstoppable as Baena added a third goal in the 28th minute with a beautifully executed 20-yard free kick that left Restes rooted to the spot. As the first half ended, Spain appeared to be in control, with Tenas redeeming himself with a brilliant save to prevent France from narrowing the gap.\n\nThe second half, however, saw a renewed French effort. Manu Kone's header struck the crossbar in the 57th minute, signaling France's determination to claw back into the game. Spain attempted to control the pace, but France's relentless pressure paid off in the 79th minute when Michael Olise's free kick led to a goal credited to substitute Maghnes Akliouche, though it was unclear whether he deflected the ball or it simply evaded Tenas.\n\nAs the clock ticked down, the atmosphere inside Parc des Princes grew increasingly tense. France's persistence was rewarded in stoppage time when a video review confirmed a penalty for a foul on Arnaud Kalimuendo by Spain's Juan Miranda. Jean-Philippe Mateta converted the penalty, sending the match into extra time amid deafening cheers from the home crowd.\n\nThe extra period was a continuation of the exhilarating back-and-forth battle, with both teams creating chances. But it was Spain who found the breakthrough. Ten minutes into extra time, Sergio Camello latched onto a brilliant pass from Adrian Bernabe, calmly chipping the ball over Tenas to restore Spain's lead. As France pressed for an equalizer, Camello struck again in the dying seconds, this time on a breakaway assisted by Tenas, who had launched the attack with a long throw to midfield.\n\nThis victory capped a remarkable year for Spanish football, adding to the nation's recent successes. Over the past year, Spain's women's national team won the World Cup, the men's squad claimed the European Championship, and the under-21 men and under-17 women secured titles in their respective competitions. The men's team's Olympic triumph further solidifies Spain's status as a powerhouse in the football world.\n\nFor France, the loss was a bitter pill to swallow, especially after their strong performance throughout the tournament. This summer, Les Bleus showed resilience, coming from behind to win crucial matches, including a dramatic extra-time victory over Egypt in the semifinals. Despite the heartbreak of the final, the tournament has been seen as a triumph for Coach Thierry Henry, the legendary player who is being touted as a potential successor to Didier Deschamps, the long-serving coach of the national team.\n\nHenry faced numerous challenges in assembling his Olympic roster, as FIFA does not require clubs to release players for the Games. Despite this, he managed to form a formidable squad, highlighting France's deep pool of talent. \"I haven't been rejected this much since high school,\" Henry joked before the tournament, reflecting on the difficulties of player selection.", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The match was tense from the start, with both teams showing nerves befitting the occasion.\n\nFrance took an early lead through Enzo Millot, but Spain quickly responded. Fermin Lopez equalised before putting his team ahead, while Alex Baena added a third. France fought back in the second half, with goals from Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta forcing extra time.\n\nIn the additional period, Sergio Camello emerged as the hero for Spain. The 23-year-old, initially on the standby list, scored two clever chips to seal victory. His goals ensured Spain repeated their 1992 success, when they won gold on home soil in Barcelona.\n\nThe match was a rollercoaster of emotions, with momentum swinging between the teams. Spain dominated the first half, while France showed great determination to level the score. However, Spain's extra-time performance proved decisive.\n\nThis victory marks a significant achievement for Spanish football, adding to their recent successes in international tournaments.

extra-time, but it was not enough to hold off a brilliantly technical Spain side.\n\nFrance took the lead early on through Enzo Millot, whose strike was roared on by the dominant home crowd.\n\nThose in the stands had been treated to an appearance from Arsene Wenger pre-match, as well as a rendition of La Marseillaise ahead of kick off.\n\nBut that was one of the only positives from the match for Thierry Henry's side.\n\nFermin Lopez levelled the match before grabbing a second just seven minutes later.\n\nThe Barcelona star tapped in at the far post to silence the 50,000 fans inside the stadium in Paris.\n\nIt only got better for Spain after Alex Baena scored a delicious free-kick from range, giving his side a two-goal cushion only 25 minutes in.\n\nJean-Philippe Mateta and Michael Olise were France's main threats all night, with the former forcing a brilliant save from Arnau Tenas before Manu Kone struck the post early in the second half.\n\nSpain were defending like their lives depended on it but they were unlocked late on.\n\nMaghnes Aklouche fired home to set-up a grandstand finish and it was certainly a spectacle in the pouring Paris rain.\n\nReferee Ramon Abatti was sent to the VAR screen in added time and decided that Benat Turrientes had fouled Arnaud Kalimuendo, earning France a penalty.\n\nMateta stepped up and converted cooly, adding an extra thirty

Crystal Palace forward Jean-Philippe Mateta netted an injury time penalty after a VAR check to force the extra 30 minutes.\n\nBut sub Sergio Camello netted twice in extra time - the second in the 121st minute - as Spain's glorious summer of football also claimed the Paris gold medal.\n\nLa Roja won the Olympic title for the time since Pep Guardiola's 1992 side won in Barcelona - and gained revenge for their country's defeat in the Euro 84 final here to Michel Platini's France.\n\nHenry, now 46, won the 1998 World Cup final across Paris in the Stade de France but last night the Arsenal legend had to settle for silver.\n\nThe France Under 23 coach said: \"There were a few minutes during the first half in which we disappeared. And we paid a high price for that.\n\n\"Then we were able to recover and get back in the game. It wasn't easy to build this team up, but I'm proud of the work we did.\"\n\nThere was a strong Premier League influence in the team captained by Alexandre Lacazette with Hammersmith-born Michael Olise superb and Mateta netting five goals in the tournament - and attracting transfer interest.\n\nHenry's former boss Arsene Wenger was pitchside before kickoff and it seemed like a good omen as France took an 11th-minute lead when PSG keeper Arnau Tenas fumbled Enzo Millot's tame shot. But the gold medal, like the summer, was to belong to Spain.\n\nReal Madrid won the Champions League in London while Spain beat England in the Euro 2024 final in Berlin. And the two players from Spain's full squad in the Under 23 Olympic team - Fermin Lopez and Alex Baena - scored the three first goals in a devastating 10-minute spell.\n\nThe Barcelona playmaker scored the first two - the first from a Baena pass - while the Villareal midfielder curled in an exquisite 28th-minute free kick to put Spain 3-1 ahead. Urged on by the vocal home crowd, relentless French pressure after the break was rewarded after 79 minutes when Olise's driven free kick was flicked in by Maghnes Akliouche.\n\nAnd the Monaco sub then won the 90th-minute penalty - eventually awarded by Brazilian ref Ramon Abatti with the help of VAR - which allowed Mateta to roll home the dramatic equaliser.\n\nBut Rayo Vallecano sub Camello chipped home after 121 minutes - and sealed the win on a breakaway as France chased the equaliser.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Thierry Henry's side fought back from 3-1 down to send the game to extra-time, but Spain substitute Sergio Camello struck twice to clinch a memorable triumph for La Roja.\n\nWith victory, Santi Denia's team have emulated Spain's 1992 heroes, who won gold on home soil at the Barcelona Games.\n\nFrance got off to a dream start and hit the front on 11 minutes. Enzo Millot made a good connection with his shot, but Spain goalkeeper Arnau Tenas appeared to misjudge the flight of the ball, only succeeding in parrying it into the net.\n\nSpain responded quickly, and their equaliser came via a predictable source. Alex Baena played in Fermin Lopez, who swept a fine first-time finish into the bottom corner.\n\nLopez soon had his and Spain's second. Abel Ruiz's close-range effort was saved by Guillaume Restes, but the Barcelona star was on the rebound in a flash to slot home his sixth goal of the tournament. Spain were rampant at this stage and they made it 3-1 when Baena curled home a magnificent free-kick.\n\nAfter initially looking shellshocked, France gradually regained a foothold in the game, and they came close to reducing the deficit on the stroke of half-time. Jean-Philippe Mateta's header appeared to be looping into the net, but Tenas tipped the ball over the bar.\n\nLes Bleus upped the ante after the break and, after Loic Bade shot off target, Manu Kone's header rattled the crossbar. The all-action Kone then forced a stunning one-handed save from Tenas, before Millot blazed over from a tight angle.\n\nFrance's relentless pressure was eventually rewarded when Maghnes Akliouche diverted Michael Olise's free-kick into the net. France were now within striking distance, and Mateta levelled from the spot in stoppage time after Arnaud Kalimuendo was upended in the area.\n\nThere was still time for Spain's Benat Turrientes to hit the bar with a rasping drive before the game entered extra-time.\n\nLa Roja, however, would have the last word. Camello's ice-cold 100th-minute finish put them ahead and he struck again in the dying moments, rifling home after latching on to a wonderful long pass from goalkeeper Tenas.", "source": {"uri": "blueprint.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blueprint Newspapers Limited"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnau_Tenas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arnau Tenas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Millot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Millot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1lex_Baena", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1lex Baena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santi_Denia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santi Denia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Camello", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Camello"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thierry Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Philippe_Mateta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jean-Philippe Mateta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panagiotis_Kone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Panagiotis Kone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel_Ruiz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abel Ruiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Header (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be\u00f1at_Turrientes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Be\u00f1at Turrientes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghnes_Akliouche", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maghnes Akliouche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnaud_Kalimuendo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arnaud Kalimuendo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Olise", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Olise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://blueprint.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/France-v-Spain-Gold-Medal-Match-Men-s-Football-Olympic-Games-Paris-2024-Day-14-500x350.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805057", "eventUri": "eng-9805057", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

France coach Thierry Henry's squad was lifted to the gold medal match after Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta brought Les Bleus back from an early deficit against Egypt in the semifinals, while Spain needed a come-from-behind effort to get by Morocco the last time out.\n\nThe two nations both have star goal scorers leading the charge, as Mateta and Fermin Lopez, who both scored in the semifinals, have bagged four goals in this competition.\n\nAt the end of this match, a European nation is guaranteed to win an Olympic gold medal for the first time since Spain triumphed in 1992. The modern stretch of Olympic football has been dominated largely by Brazil and Argentina, with Cameroon and Mexico sprinkled in the mix as well. France last won gold at the 1984 games in Los Angeles, when Henry was just seven years old.\n\nThe Sporting News is following the France vs. Spain match live, providing score updates, commentary and highlights as they happen.\n\nFrance (4-3-1-2, right to left): Restes (GK) -- Sildillia, Bade, Lukeba, Truffert -- Akliouche, Diouf, Chotard -- Olise -- Mateta, Lacazette.\n\nSpain (4-2-3-1, right to left): Tenas (GK) -- Pubill, E. Garcia, Cubarsi, Miranda -- Barrios, Baena -- Oroz, F. Lopez, S. Gomez -- A. Ruiz.\n\n2 hours to kickoff: France head coach Thierry Henry has been a central figure in the enjoyable vibes this Bleus team has enjoyed. The Arsenal legend showed off his dance moves when he joined in the celebrations after the semifinal victory over Egypt, and the squad comes into this final flying high.\n\nThis gold medal match at the 2024 Summer Olympics kicks off from Parc des Princes on Friday, August 9 at 6 p.m. local time in Paris, France. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories around the globe:\n\nThierry Henry called in striker Alexandre Lacazette to carry the goal scoring load, one of just three players to have been capped by the senior squad.\n\nYet he's been outshined by Crystal Palace duo Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta. Mateta is the second-leading scorer in the competition with four goals, while Olise, who's on his way to Bayern Munich this summer, leads the team with six contributions.\n\nTheir starring performances have eased the loss of age-eligible Bradley Barcola who withdrew from the roster after securing solid minutes for the senior team at the Euros earlier this summer.\n\nFrance projected starting lineup (4-3-1-2): Restes (GK) -- Sildillia, Bade, Lukeba, Truffert -- Akliouche, Diouf, Chotard -- Olise -- Mateta, Lacazette.\n\nHe also brought in Fermin Lopez and Alex Baena who were part of the Euro 2024 squad but didn't play much, and therefore were fresh to perform big at the Olympics. Lopez in particular has been enormous, with four goals and an assist from his No. 10 position.\n\nSpain projected starting lineup (4-2-3-1): Tenas (GK) -- Pubill, E. Garcia, Cubarsi, Miranda -- Barrios, Baena -- Oroz, F. Lopez, S. Gomez -- A. Ruiz.\n\nSpain subs (7): (Lineups released one hour prior to kickoff)\n\nIf the France vs. Spain gold medal match is not available to watch live in your location, or if you're traveling abroad, you can use a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

France will feel unlucky not to have made a long spell of sustained pressure tell. The greatest compliment for this Spanish performance was that it was in its best moments just very Spanish.\n\nRelated: Paris 2024 Olympics day 14: Thiam beats Johnson-Thompson to heptathlon gold, USA edge out GB in women's 4x100m relay - live\n\nAt the end of which Spain's male footballers have now achieved something astonishing this summer, reeling off three titles in four weeks using three almost entirely separate teams. An Olympic gold medal here follows victory against France again in the final of the Uefa Under-19 tournament and victory at Euro 2024 in Germany. Those three titles can now and sit alongside the women's World Cup win last year. It is a startling run of success for everyone involved in the development and coaching of Spanish football.\n\nPart of the blueprint is the fact every one of those teams has essentially played, if not the same way, then with the same attributes: high technique, tactical awareness and above all the ability to see and make up and manage the game in front of them. Game intelligence has been the defining quality of Spain's summer of love, as opposed to some oppressive one-size tactical system.\n\nAs this game ran deep into the second half, Spain already 3-1 up there was the fascinating sight of six Spanish substitutes, basically another bunch of hyper-skilled young guys, not so much warming up as watching, chatting, pointing at the game, following every move. There is a great deal the English game could learn from this. Plus \u00e7a change.\n\nThe Parc des Princes was packed for this final, the Paris Saint-Germain ultras end a noticeably calmer environment than the usual pyro plus three-hour shirts-off knees-up. The pre-match ceremonials were an enjoyable ragbag.\n\nFirst there was a truly inane pre-match show that featured two men with very, very loud mics shouting tunelessly at the crowd, who ignored them and hoped they would stop, before seizing gratefully on a chance to sing along to Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, the de facto anthem of the Games.\n\nMiles, miles better, there was a live performance of Freed from Desire by the Actual Gala, an oddly moving moment for anyone who has seen this same modern terrace classic sung by so many stands full of drunken people, like finally seeing an actual Warhol. Gala was great. She danced. She went easy on the \"Na Na Na Na Na Na-Na\" bit. Hopefully this will turbo charge her downloads, Celine Dion-style.\n\nArs\u00e8ne Wenger came out and did the stick-banging ceremony to declare this final open, still looking perfectly trim and jaunty and lean. At which point the game kicked off and nothing happened for 11 minutes. Really, nothing at all.\n\nThen suddenly everything happened, four goals in 17 minutes, three of them to Spain. France scored first. It was a messy goal. \u00c1lex Baena scuffed his clearance close to the goal line. Enzo Millot took the ball and shot early, but Arnau Tenas will be hugely disappointed with his effort to keep it out of the Spain net. It went through his hands. Spain's goalkeeper is 23 and plays for Paris Saint-Germain. It was a deeply forgettable moment for him. But he would make up for it just on half-time with a wonderful one-handed save from Jean-Philippe Mateta.\n\nAnd six minutes later Spain were level via a brilliantly worked and very Spanish goal, Ferm\u00edn L\u00f3pez side-footing into the corner for his fifth of the tournament after an extended period of slick and purposeful possession. They were 2-1 up shortly after with another well-made goal, this time created by a driven cross from the left by Juan Miranda with L\u00f3pez in the right place to tap it in.\n\nSpain's third, on 28 minutes, was sensational. It came from a right-footed free-kick from the edge of the area, significantly to the left. Baena stepped back and floated the most delightfully delicate shot into the corner, Guillaume Restes static on his line, the kind of misdirection that makes a free-kick goal look so much more lovely.\n\nFrance have a stronger team on paper, arguably. But Spain just played like Spain in that first half, reeling off another exhibition of pure uncut Spain. The home crowd booed the referees off at half-time but Spain were well worth their 3-1 lead.\n\nThierry Henry brought on fresh legs shortly after the break, sending out Arnaud Kalimuendo in place of the largely invisible Alexandre Lacazette, and he hit the bar with a header just before the hour, the closest France got to pulling back a goal in that period. Les Bleus Olympiques were more patient on the ball, slicker through midfield, with Manu Kon\u00e9 an orderly influence.\n\nFrance began to make, if not chances, then chance-adjacent opportunities. Spain defended with skill and discipline, looking by now a little tired at the end of an intense and sappingly hot three weeks. Tenas made one astonishing right-handed save low down.\n\nSpain had very little control from half time onwards. France pressed, kept the ball, made chances, forced last-minute interceptions.\n\nAnd with 12 minutes to go they finally pulled one back, deservedly, as Michael Olise's low free kick was deflected in by Maghnes Akliouche. The final moments were gripping as France poured everything they had into chasing an equaliser. Henry can be proud of his team's spirit.\n\nAt which point, France's hopes of gold were preserved by a moment of incredible drama at the very last as they were awarded a penalty after a VAR check. It came from a grapple at the back post during a corner. Whether it was correct or not will depend on your opinion of such moments (needs stamping out v happens all the time). The replay showed poor old Miranda, who had a miserable second half, in a wrestle with Kalimuendo. The referee, Ramon Abatti, performed an extraordinary exhibitionist's strut back from his monitor, paused, then pointed to the spot like a man identifying the killer at the end of a particularly dramatic murder mystery.\n\nMateta buried it to make it 3-3 in the third minute of extra time. The Parc erupted. France had shown such heart to bring it back to 3-3 and deserved to take this final deep.\n\nBut it was Spain, for so long doggedly on the defensive, who produced the moment of incision on 99 minutes to make it 4-3. Again the goal came from a long spell of possession as they were finally able to get hold of the ball. The acceleration came with a wonderful little nudged reverse pass from Sergio Gomez into the cute diagonal run of Camello. France were sleeping, just enough. The finish was delightful, dinked over the advancing goalkeeper. Spain held on to take Olympic gold, their first in this event since 1992, the game ending in surreal fashion as Camello scored a second, awarded on the final whistle after a VAR check.", "source":

France will feel unlucky not to have made a long spell of sustained pressure tell. The greatest compliment for this Spanish performance was that it was in its best moments just very Spanish.\n\nAt the end of which Spain's male footballers have now achieved something astonishing this summer, reeling off three titles in four weeks using three almost entirely separate teams. An Olympic gold medal here follows victory against France again in the final of the Uefa Under-19 tournament and victory at Euro 2024 in Germany. Those three titles can now and sit alongside the women's World Cup win last year. It is a startling run of success for everyone involved in the development and coaching of Spanish football.\n\nPart of the blueprint is the fact every one of those teams has essentially played, if not the same way, then with the same attributes: high technique, tactical awareness and above all the ability to see and make up and manage the game in front of them. Game intelligence has been the defining quality of Spain's summer of love, as opposed to some oppressive one-size tactical system.\n\nAs this game ran deep into the second half, Spain already 3-1 up there was the fascinating sight of six Spanish substitutes, basically another bunch of hyper-skilled young guys, not so much warming up as watching, chatting, pointing at the game, following every move. There is a great deal the English game could learn from this. Plus \u00e7a change.\n\nThe Parc des Princes was packed for this final, the Paris Saint-Germain ultras end a noticeably calmer environment than the usual pyro plus three-hour shirts-off knees-up. The pre-match ceremonials were an enjoyable ragbag.\n\nFirst there was a truly inane pre-match show that featured two men with very, very loud mics shouting tunelessly at the crowd, who ignored them and hoped they would stop, before seizing gratefully on a chance to sing along to Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, the de facto anthem of the Games.\n\nMiles, miles better, there was a live performance of Freed from Desire by the Actual Gala, an oddly moving moment for anyone who has seen this same modern terrace classic sung by so many stands full of drunken people, like finally seeing an actual Warhol. Gala was great. She danced. She went easy on the \"Na Na Na Na Na Na-Na\" bit. Hopefully this will turbo charge her downloads, Celine Dion-style.\n\nArs\u00e8ne Wenger came out and did the stick-banging ceremony to declare this final open, still looking perfectly trim and jaunty and lean. At which point the game kicked off and nothing happened for 11 minutes. Really, nothing at all.\n\nThen suddenly everything happened, four goals in 17 minutes, three of them to Spain. France scored first. It was a messy goal. \u00c1lex Baena scuffed his clearance close to the goal line. Enzo Millot took the ball and shot early, but Arnau Tenas will be hugely disappointed with his effort to keep it out of the Spain net. It went through his hands. Spain's goalkeeper is 19 and plays for Paris Saint-Germain. It was a deeply forgettable moment for him. But he would make up for it just on half-time with a wonderful one-handed save from Jean-Philippe Mateta.\n\nAnd six minutes later Spain were level via a brilliantly worked and very Spanish goal, Ferm\u00edn L\u00f3pez side-footing into the corner for his fifth of the tournament after an extended period of slick and purposeful possession. They were 2-1 up shortly after with another well-made goal, this time created by a driven cross from the left by Juan Miranda with L\u00f3pez in the right place to tap it in.\n\nSpain's third, on 28 minutes, was sensational. It came from a right-footed free-kick from the edge of the area, significantly to the left. Baena stepped back and floated the most delightfully delicate shot into the corner, Guillaume Restes static on his line, the kind of misdirection that makes a free-kick goal look so much more lovely.\n\nFrance have a stronger team on paper, arguably. But Spain just played like Spain in that first half, reeling off another exhibition of pure uncut Spain. The home crowd booed the referees off at half-time but Spain were well worth their 3-1 lead.\n\nThierry Henry brought on fresh legs shortly after the break, sending out Arnaud Kalimuendo in place of the largely invisible Alexandre Lacazette, and he hit the bar with a header just before the hour, the closest France got to pulling back a goal in that period. Les Bleus Olympiques were more patient on the ball, slicker through midfield, with Manu Kon\u00e9 an orderly influence.\n\nFrance began to make, if not chances, then chance-adjacent opportunities. Spain defended with skill and discipline, looking by now a little tired at the end of an intense and sappingly hot three weeks. Tenas made one astonishing right-handed save low down.\n\nSpain had very little control from half time onwards. France pressed, kept the ball, made chances, forced last-minute interceptions.\n\nAnd with 12 minutes to go they finally pulled one back, deservedly, as Michael Olise's low free kick was deflected into his own goal by Miranda. The final moments were gripping as France poured everything they had into chasing an equaliser. Henry can be proud of his team's spirit.\n\nAt which point, France's hopes of gold were preserved by a moment of incredible drama at the very last as they were awarded a penalty after a VAR check. It came from a grapple at the back post during a corner. Whether it was correct or not will depend on your opinion of such moments (needs stamping out v happens all the time). The replay showed poor old Miranda, who had a miserable second half, in a wrestle with Kalimuendo. The referee, Ramon Abatti, performed an extraordinary exhibitionist's strut back from his monitor, paused, then pointed to the spot like a man identifying the killer at the end of a particularly dramatic murder mystery.\n\nMateta buried it to make it 3-3 in the third minute of extra time. The Parc erupted. France had shown such heart to bring it back to 3-3 and deserved to take this final deep.\n\nBut it was Spain, for so long doggedly on the defensive, who produced the moment of incision on 99 minutes to make it 4-3. Again the goal came from a long spell of possession as they were finally able to get hold of the ball. The acceleration came with a wonderful little nudged reverse pass from Sergio Gomez into the cute diagonal run of Camello. France were sleeping, just enough. The finish was delightful, dinked over the advancing goalkeeper. Spain held on to take Olympic gold, their first in this event since 1992, the game ending in surreal fashion as Camello scored a second, awarded on the final whistle after a VAR check.", "source":

France will feel unlucky not to have made a long spell of sustained pressure tell. The greatest compliment for this Spanish performance was that it was in its best moments just very Spanish.\n\nAt the end of which Spain's male footballers have now achieved something astonishing this summer, reeling off three titles in four weeks using three almost entirely separate teams. An Olympic gold medal here follows victory against France again in the final of the Uefa Under-19 tournament and victory at Euro 2024 in Germany. Those three titles can now and sit alongside the women's World Cup win last year. It is a startling run of success for everyone involved in the development and coaching of Spanish football.\n\nPart of the blueprint is the fact every one of those teams has essentially played, if not the same way, then with the same attributes: high technique, tactical awareness and above all the ability to see and make up and manage the game in front of them. Game intelligence has been the defining quality of Spain's summer of love, as opposed to some oppressive one-size tactical system.\n\nAs this game ran deep into the second half, Spain already 3-1 up there was the fascinating sight of six Spanish substitutes, basically another bunch of hyper-skilled young guys, not so much warming up as watching, chatting, pointing at the game, following every move.\n\nThe Parc des Princes was packed for this final, the Paris Saint-Germain ultras end a noticeably calmer environment than the usual pyro plus three-hour shirts-off knees-up. The pre-match ceremonials were an enjoyable ragbag.\n\nFirst there was a truly inane pre-match show that featured two men with very, very loud mics shouting tunelessly at the crowd, who ignored them and hoped they would stop, before seizing gratefully on a chance to sing along to Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, the de facto anthem of the Games.\n\nMiles, miles better, there was a live performance of Freed from Desire by the Actual Gala, an oddly moving moment for anyone who has seen this same modern terrace classic sung by so many stands full of drunken people, like finally seeing an actual Warhol. Gala was great. She danced. She went easy on the \"Na Na Na Na Na Na-Na\" bit. Hopefully this will turbo charge her downloads, Celine Dion-style.\n\nArs\u00e8ne Wenger came out and did the stick-banging ceremony to declare this final open, still looking perfectly trim and jaunty and lean. At which point the game kicked off and nothing happened for 11 minutes. Really, nothing at all.\n\nThen suddenly everything happened, four goals in 17 minutes, three of them to Spain. France scored first. It was a messy goal. \u00c1lex Baena scuffed his clearance close to the goal line. Enzo Millot took the ball and shot early, but Arnau Tenas will be hugely disappointed with his effort to keep it out of the Spain net. It went through his hands. Spain's goalkeeper is 23 and plays for Paris Saint-Germain. It was a deeply forgettable moment for him. But he would make up for it just on half-time with a wonderful one-handed save from Jean-Philippe Mateta.\n\nAnd six minutes later Spain were level via a brilliantly worked and very Spanish goal, Ferm\u00edn L\u00f3pez side-footing into the corner for his fifth of the tournament after an extended period of slick and purposeful possession. They were 2-1 up shortly after with another well-made goal, this time created by a driven cross from the left by Juan Miranda with L\u00f3pez in the right place to tap it in.\n\nSpain's third, on 28 minutes, was sensational. It came from a right-footed free-kick from the edge of the area, significantly to the left. Baena stepped back and floated the most delightfully delicate shot into the corner, Guillaume Restes static on his line, the kind of misdirection that makes a free-kick goal look so much more lovely.\n\nFrance have a stronger team on paper, arguably. But Spain just played like Spain in that first half, reeling off another exhibition of pure uncut Spain. The home crowd booed the referees off at half-time but Spain were well worth their 3-1 lead.\n\nThierry Henry brought on fresh legs shortly after the break, sending out Arnaud Kalimuendo in place of the largely invisible Alexandre Lacazette, and he hit the bar with a header just before the hour, the closest France got to pulling back a goal in that period. Les Bleus Olympiques were more patient on the ball, slicker through midfield, with Manu Kon\u00e9 an orderly influence.\n\nFrance began to make, if not chances, then chance-adjacent opportunities. Spain defended with skill and discipline, looking by now a little tired at the end of an intense and sappingly hot three weeks. Tenas made one astonishing right-handed save low down.\n\nSpain had very little control from half time onwards. France pressed, kept the ball, made chances, forced last-minute interceptions.\n\nAnd with 12 minutes to go they finally pulled one back, deservedly, as Michael Olise's low free kick was deflected in by Maghnes Akliouche. The final moments were gripping as France poured everything they had into chasing an equaliser. Henry can be proud of his team's spirit.\n\nAt which point, France's hopes of gold were preserved by a moment of incredible drama at the very last as they were awarded a penalty after a VAR check. It came from a grapple at the back post during a corner. Whether it was correct or not will depend on your opinion of such moments (needs stamping out v happens all the time). The replay showed poor old Miranda, who had a miserable second half, in a wrestle with Kalimuendo. The referee, Ramon Abatti, performed an extraordinary exhibitionist's strut back from his monitor, paused, then pointed to the spot like a man identifying the killer at the end of a particularly dramatic murder mystery.\n\nMateta buried it to make it 3-3 in the third minute of extra time. The Parc erupted. France had shown such heart to bring it back to 3-3 and deserved to take this final deep.\n\nBut it was Spain, for so long doggedly on the defensive, who produced the moment of incision on 99 minutes to make it 4-3. Again the goal came from a long spell of possession as they were finally able to get hold of the ball. The acceleration came with a wonderful little nudged reverse pass from Sergio Gomez into the cute diagonal run of Camello. France were sleeping, just enough. The finish was delightful, dinked over the advancing goalkeeper. Spain held on to take Olympic gold, their first in this event since 1992, the game ending in surreal fashion as Camello scored a second, awarded on the final whistle after a VAR check.", "source":

Substitute Sergio Camello ultimately decided it, running on to a beautiful pass from Adri\u00e1n Bernab\u00e9 in the 100th minute and delivering a feathery chip over the on-rushing goalkeeper to set off wild celebrations from the Spanish players as Henry turned on his heel in the technical area and the French players simply stared.\n\nTheir shock was understandable, as it certainly seemed that they might pull off a magical comeback to claim gold in their country's capital. Instead, it was Spain -- again -- who stood atop the medal stand. Ferm\u00edn L\u00f3pez scored twice with \u00c1lex Baena also converting a dipping free kick and Camello adding a second, with France pushed all the way forward, just before full-time to end it.\n\nThe Olympic gold, which is Spain's first since the home 1992 Summer Games in Barcelona, comes on the heels of Spanish trophies at the men's Euros earlier this summer as well as the Women's World Cup a year ago.\n\nAdd in titles at both the men's and women's U19 European Championships last month -- not to mention Spanish club teams winning the men's and women's Champions League trophies this season -- and the soccer universe is very clearly living through a near-total Spanish siege.\n\nThe French, though, clearly had designs on breaking the trend. After being booed off the field at half-time trailing by 3-1, France had hammered the Spanish goal over and over without reward before finally getting their breakthrough with 11 minutes to play in normal time.\n\nMichael Olise fired a free kick from the flank towards goal that took a deflection off Maghnes Akliouche and nestled into the bottom corner to cut the margin to just one.\n\nThen, off an 89th-minute corner kick, Juan Miranda dragged down Arnaud Kalimuendo at the back post. The ball had soared well beyond them and the referee initially waved away the French protests, but once the VAR suggested an on-field review, the French fans leapt to their feet in anticipation.\n\nJean-Philippe Mateta, wearing the captain's armband after Alexandre Lacazette was substituted before the hour as France looked for new energy, calmly drilled the penalty and France had earned 30 minutes more.\n\nOf course, even reaching that point was an ordeal. After falling behind when Arnau Tenas woefully misplayed Enzo Millot's shot in the 12th minute, Spain flipped the game completely around in the middle of the first half. In the space of just 10 minutes, L\u00f3pez, the Barcelona wunderkind, scored twice while Baena dipped a marvelous free kick over the wall to shock the French fans, which included France's senior national team coach Didier Deschamps as well as former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger.\n\nDeschamps could be seen dropping his head into his hands as France was cut open, but the French worked their way back into the game, surging in first-half stoppage time before continuing the press throughout the second half.\n\nOnce they reached extra time with the momentum fully in their favor, it felt as if completion of their fightback was inevitable. But then, in a flash, it happened: Bernape dropped his shoulder. Camello ran through. And the Spanish danced together once more.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_borden@espn.com", "name": "Sam Borden", "type": "author",

Against Spain, the Blues will have at least 90 minutes to make this dream come true.\n\nWithout a solution, France relies on long-range shots, Chotard tries his hand with his left but it's off target.\n\n6:40 p.m.\n\nMiranda moves into the area and his cross is shot at the near post and pushed back by the foot of Restes.\n\n6:39 p.m.\n\nThe Bleuets have lost their aggressiveness from the start of the match and are struggling to find solutions.\n\n6:35 p.m.\n\nFirst warning of the match for Kone for tripping Oroz, who remains on the ground.\n\n6:35 p.m.\n\nFermin is still on the ground after a little contact.\n\n18h31.\n\nLacazette is penalized for an unsportsmanlike foul on Barrios.\n\n18h27.\n\nBaena puts the ball over the wall and Restes doesn't flinch.\n\n18h26.\n\nBad\u00e9 puts his body in opposition to the edge of the area and the foul is whistled against him. Very good free kick for Spain.\n\n18h24.\n\nCubarsi launches Miranda behind Sildillia and crosses from the left, Ruiz manages to take it but Restes intervenes! Fermin followed and pushes into the goal. The defense is in great difficulty on the Spanish attacks.\n\n18h23.\n\nKon\u00e9 is caught out by Fermin, the referee who has let a lot of play since the start of the match has difficulty returning to the fault.\n\n18h22.\n\nGarcia makes a nice block on Mateta who is heading for goal. The referee gives the ball back to the Spanish goalkeeper.\n\n18h20.\n\nLacazette is launched by Bad\u00e9 in depth and tears himself away to have a corner. Mateta is found with his head but it is in the arms of Tenas.\n\n18h17.\n\nOn its first action, Spain comes back into the score. Baena finds Fermin at the penalty spot and deceives Remains with a cross shot that ends up in the side netting.\n\n18h16.\n\nSince the goal, Spain has taken possession of the ball and made it happen.\n\n18h13.\n\nMillot in the box makes a low cross, Mateta doesn't touch it and Tenas can grab it.\n\n6:11 p.m.\n\nLacazette presses along the line and the ball comes back to Millot 6m out who shoots first time. Tenas makes a handball and lets the ball go into the goal.\n\n18h10.\n\nOlise launches Millot behind the defense but it is deflected into touch.\n\n18h08.\n\nMateta is found deep on the right side but his dribble is cleared into touch.\n\n18h06.\n\nTenas's missed clearance leaves Olise unable to control the ball.\n\n18:04.\n\nThe French put a lot of intensity into their duel at the start of the match.\n\nChotard on the left side centers at the penalty spot but no Blue is present to take over.\n\nFrance will play this final in blue while Spain will play in very, very light yellow.\n\n5:42 p.m.\n\nFor the bronze medal, Morocco decimated Egypt (6-0) on Thursday, August 8. With a new double from Rahimi, which brings his number of goals in this tournament to eight, of which he will be the top scorer.\n\n17h30.\n\nThierry Henry keeps his classic team composition by recording the returns from suspension of Kon\u00e9 and Millot who take back a place in the starting eleven.\n\nSpain came out second in its group after two victories over the Dominican Republic and Uzbekistan and a defeat against Egypt in the group. In the quarter-finals, the \"Roja\" easily took out Japan (3-0) before a big battle against Morocco in the semi-finals (2-1).\n\n17h00.\n\nThe French team will try to win its second Olympic title after that of 1984. Forty years later, the Bleuets can join their illustrious elders by beating Spain. After having eliminated Argentina in the quarter-finals (1-0) and then Egypt in the semi-finals after extra time (3-1), the French team came up against Spain, crowned in 92 at home and beaten in Tokyo in the final by Brazil", "source": {"uri": "bobrtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bobrtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Les Bleus on Fire, more like.\n\nBut then it all began to unravel as Henry's France froze under the big stage lights and let their golden opportunity slip.\n\nFirst, Fermin Lopez levelled with a tidy low finish when found in far too much space in the box and just seven minutes later the Barcelona star grabbed his second, tapping in at the far post to silence the 50,000-strong crowd and give the hosts an uphill battle.\n\nThat soon turned into a mountain to climb when on 25 minutes, Alex Baena's brilliant free-kick sailed into the top corner and left Restes rooted to the spot.\n\nHenry's side did respond, however, with former Crystal Palace pairing - until the latter's move to Bayern Munich this summer - Jean-Philippe Mateta and Michael Olise combining fluently and Mateta, whose double against Egypt on Monday fired the French into the final, forcing a fabulous save from Tenas to maintain his side's two-goal margin.\n\nFrance emerged from the interval several minutes before their opponents and looked visibly up for it at the start of the second period.\n\nAnd they should have reduced the deficit when Manu Kone's near post header rattled Tenas' crossbar with the Spanish shot-stopper well-beaten.\n\nFrance continued to hammer the door down as Mateta, a nuisance all night, was thwarted and the steely Spaniards threw their bodies at everything as though their life depended on it.\n\nAnd goalkeeper Tenas, so badly at fault for the opening goal, was recovering to produce one of the performances of his life as he brilliantly denied Kone once again with a remarkable reaction save.\n\nIt was only a matter of time until the French pulled one back and it eventually happened with just 10 minutes remaining, when Maghnes Akliouche fired in to tee up a heart-thumping grandstand finale in the pouring Parc des Princes rain.\n\nAnd it firmly delivered as the dying stages beckoned when referee Ramon Abatti was dramatically sent to the VAR monitor for a potential Spanish foul in the box.\n\nSurrounded by an incensed Henry and dozens of members of the Spanish camp, the Brazilian - equipped with a microphone so he could communicate his decision to the crowd - held his nerve and pointed to the spot after he adjudged Benat Turrientes had hauled Arnaud Kalimuendo to the ground.\n\nThat set the stage for Mateta, second top scorer at these Games with four goals, to send the game to extra-time and he did so in nerveless fashion by sending Tenas the wrong way to prompt Parisian pandemonium with the full-time whistle looming.\n\nThere was nearly enough time for another sting in the tail as down at the other end, Turrientes hit the crossbar and was denied a remarkable redemption by the barest of margins.\n\nBut then came Camello to snatch it at the death, unerringly lobbing Restes either side of the extra-time interval to inflict heartbreak on Henry and dash his Crazy Boys' hopes of emulating those Wimbledon Wembley heroes of 1988.",

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nSo the Crazy Ones were unable to emulate the Crazy Gang.\n\nExactly 36 years since Vinnie Jones, Dave Beasant, Lawrie Sanchez and co ripped up the rulebook to fire Bobby Gould's Wimbledon to a storied FA Cup triumph, Thierry Henry's France could not repeat the trick as they fell agonisingly short of grabbing an emotional Olympic gold medal in front of a packed-out Parc des Princes in Paris.\n\nHenry, who coined the nickname the 'Crazy Ones' for his young French side because of their fun-loving nature, won virtually everything as a player and despite the stars seemingly aligning for a historic gold on home soil, the Arsenal legend was eclipsed by Santi Denia's slick Spaniards in a dramatic 5-3 extra-time defeat.\n\nRayo Vallecano's Sergio Camello was their unexpected late nemesis, audaciously dinking French goalkeeper Guillaume Restes with 100 minutes on the clock to stun a shell-shocked capacity crowd.\n\nAnd he produced a virtual carbon copy of that finish with the final kick of the game, rampaging in on goal as the French threw bodies forward to slot past Restes and cruelly deny Henry the most memorable of home triumphs.\n\nIt had started so well for the French, roared on by their legion of supporters who unfurled a rousing gold medal tifo before kick-off, when midfielder Enzo Millot's strike propelled them into an early lead.\n\nAfter a pre-match schedule that saw Arsene Wenger welcomed onto the pitch, Italian singer Gala perform her recently repopularised football anthem 'Freed from Desire' and a rousing rendition of La Marseillaise, the Stuttgart star sent the home crowd into raptures with what was a relatively fortuitous opener.\n\nSpanish goalkeeper Arnau Tenas, playing on his home ground after making six appearances for Paris Saint-Germain last season, made a complete meal of dealing with Millot's effort as the ball inexplicably slipped through his hands and triggered chaos in the frenzied French end behind the goal.\n\nFreed from Desire? Les Bleus on Fire, more like.\n\nBut then it all began to unravel as Henry's France froze under the big stage lights and let their golden opportunity slip.\n\nFirst, Fermin Lopez levelled with a tidy low finish when found in far too much space in the box and just seven minutes later the Barcelona star grabbed his second, tapping in at the far post to silence the 50,000-strong crowd and give the hosts an uphill battle.\n\nThat soon turned into a mountain to climb when on 25 minutes, Alex Baena's brilliant free-kick sailed into the top corner and left Restes rooted to the spot.\n\nHenry's side did respond, however, with former Crystal Palace pairing - until the latter's move to Bayern Munich this summer - Jean-Philippe Mateta and Michael Olise combining fluently and Mateta, whose double against Egypt on Monday fired the French into the final, forcing a fabulous save from Tenas to maintain his side's two-goal margin.\n\nFrance emerged from the interval several minutes before their opponents and looked visibly up for it at the start of the second period.\n\nAnd they should have reduced the deficit when Manu Kone's near post header rattled Tenas' crossbar with the Spanish shot-stopper well-beaten.\n\nFrance continued to hammer the door down as Mateta, a nuisance all night, was thwarted and the steely Spaniards threw their bodies at everything as though their life depended on it.\n\nAnd goalkeeper Tenas, so badly at fault for the opening goal, was recovering to produce one of the performances of his life as he brilliantly denied Kone once again with a remarkable reaction save.\n\nIt was only a matter of time until the French pulled one back and it eventually happened with just 10 minutes remaining, when Maghnes Akliouche fired in to tee up a heart-thumping grandstand finale in the pouring Parc des Princes rain.\n\nAnd it firmly delivered as the dying stages beckoned when referee Ramon Abatti was dramatically sent to the VAR monitor for a potential Spanish foul in the box.\n\nSurrounded by an incensed Henry and dozens of members of the Spanish camp, the Brazilian - equipped with a microphone so he could communicate his decision to the crowd - held his nerve and pointed to the spot after he adjudged Benat Turrientes had hauled Arnaud Kalimuendo to the ground.\n\nThat set the stage for Mateta, second top scorer at these Games with four goals, to send the game to extra-time and he did so in nerveless fashion by sending Tenas the wrong way to prompt Parisian pandemonium with the full-time whistle looming.\n\nThere was nearly enough time for another sting in the tail as down at the other end, Turrientes hit the crossbar and was denied a remarkable redemption by the barest of margins.\n\nBut then came Camello to snatch it at the death, unerringly lobbing Restes either side of the extra-time interval to inflict heartbreak on Henry and dash his Crazy Boys' hopes of emulating those Wimbledon Wembley heroes of 1988.",

The Spaniards overcame a spirited French comeback to claim their first Olympic title since 1992.\n\nThe hosts, managed by Thierry Henry, drew first blood early in the match, sending the Parisian crowd into raptures.\n\nHowever, Spain quickly responded, turning the tide with three quick goals before the half-time whistle. The 3-1 score line seemed to put the Spaniards in control, but France was not ready to surrender on home soil.\n\nIn the second half, France staged an impressive comeback, clawing their way back to 3-3, forcing the match into extra time. The momentum appeared to be with the French, but Spain's substitute, Sergio Camello, had other plans.\n\nIn the extra period, Camello scored twice, both times sparking wild celebrations among the Spanish players and fans. The Rayo Vallecano forward's decisive strikes ensured Spain's triumph and capped off a memorable tournament.\n\nThis victory adds to Spain's recent success on the international stage. Just over a month ago, they lifted the men's European Championship Euro 2924), defeating England in the final. Their youth teams have also shone brightly, with the men's under-19 squad claiming the European title last month, and the women's team winning the World Cup last year.", "source": {"uri": "socialnews.xyz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social News XYZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thierry Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Camello", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Camello"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_under-19_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy national under-19 football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayo_Vallecano", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rayo Vallecano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Conferences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA_Nations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA Nations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://boxoffice.socialnews.xyz/get_ians_img.php.jpg?url=Paris+Olympics%3A+Spain+clinch+gold+in+football+with+dramatic+extra-time+win+over+France", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805057", "eventUri": "eng-9805057", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-10", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 13}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

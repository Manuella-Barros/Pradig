{"id": 243359304, "title": "India vs South Africa: Harmanpreet Kaur and Co smash the record for highest ever total in women&#8217;s Test cricket", "text": "Records tumbled at Chepauk as Harmanpreet Kaur-led India became the first ever team to cross 600 in the history of women's Test cricket on Saturday. India declared on 603/6 after 115.1 overs, a few minutes after they broke the record set by Australia just earlier this year (575/9 in Perth). Unfortunately for South Africa, they were at the receiving end on both occasions, having now conceded 1178 runs in the two innings they have bowled in Tests this year. It was India's highest score already in Test cricket on the opening day, when they crossed 467 that they made against England in Taunton in 2002. There were two record-breaking partnerships in the innings as well. With an opening stand of 292 on Day 1, Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma recorded highest-ever partnership for the first wicket in women's Tests for India, and also the second highest partnership for any wicket by any team in this format. On Day 2, it was Harmanpreet and Richa Ghosh's turn as they posted 143 for the fifth wicket, once again the highest in women's Tests. On Friday, with her stunning 205, Shafali Verma became only the 2nd Indian to score a double ton in women's Tests, after Mithali Raj. The 20-year-old Shafali also became the 2nd youngest behind Mithali to achieve the feat, with the former captain scoring her famous 214 when she 19 years old. Reaching her double century off 194 balls, Shafali Verma smashes the record for the fastest double century in women's Tests, breaking the record set by Annabel Sutherland only earlier this year. (Once again, South Africa being at the receiving end in Perth). In what was perhaps the most stunning statistic to emerge from this match, Shafali Verma smashed 8 sixes in her innings of 205, more than any woman has managed in an entire career. Where data is available, Ash Gardner is second on the list of most sixes in women's Tests, with three to her name. Shafali now has 13 sixes to her name in Tests so far.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/india-vs-south-africa-harmanpreet-kaur-and-co-smash-the-record-for-highest-ever-total-in-womens-test-cricket-9422218/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Shafali-and-Smriti.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:05:40", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.252}

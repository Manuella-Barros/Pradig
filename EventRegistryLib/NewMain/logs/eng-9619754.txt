The Acolyte won't rely on characters or lore from the Skywalker saga, and will instead tell a mostly independent story. That independent story should be a great entry point for new Star Wars fans who don't have much knowledge of the franchise's extensive lore. SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nLeslye Headland, the showrunner for The Acolyte, recently explained that the new show will be a \"fresh entry point\" for new viewers to get engaged with the Star Wars franchise. Since it was announced, The Acolyte has promised to show a new side of Star Wars that had never been brought to live-action before. It promised a darker story than the franchise is used to, along with a whole new cast of characters for The Acolyte. Headland has now mentioned that she's using the newness of The Acolyte to make it one of the most accessible Star Wars projects to new viewers.\n\nIn an interview with GamesRadar+, Headland spoke about how The Acolyte's setting distanced it from the rest of the Star Wars movies and TV shows, and what challenges and benefits that distance brought.\n\n\"I think to draw audiences in and create a fresh entry point - meaning you don't need to know a lot about Star Wars in order to watch the show - it felt natural to move back in time and set the story there,\" Headland explains.\n\nA new era, though, comes with its own fresh challenges. A step away from the Skywalkers and Sith of it all poses an obvious roadblock. When pressed on the biggest limitations of placing The Acolyte in a new setting, Headland felt the lack of familiarity was an issue - but one she was willing to embrace.\n\n\"We don't have that immediate iconography of stormtroopers, for example. When you see a stormtrooper, you know you're in Star Wars... We had some things we got to not fall back on, but utilize. It was harder but, in a way, it was freeing and easier,\" Headland says.\n\nShe continues, \"When audiences watch it, there will still be that wish fulfillment of seeing the Jedi in action and that's what we get to do.\"\n\nIt's clear from Headland's comments that a main goal of The Acolyte was to break into an entirely new part of the Star Wars timeline. While that new era precluded her from using Star Wars staples like stormtroopers, it also opened up quite a few exciting opportunities. One of those opportunities is the chance to draw in new viewers to the franchise by telling a story that doesn't rely on the Skywalker saga, or much of Star Wars' backstory at all.\n\nRelated Everything You Need To Know Before Watching Star Wars: The Acolyte\n\nStar Wars' next TV show, The Acolyte, will come to Disney+ on June 4. Here's everything you need to know ahead of this epic Star Wars series.\n\nYou Don't Need To Know The Skywalker Saga To Appreciate The Acolyte Close\n\nThe Acolyte takes place during the High Republic era of the timeline, about 100 years before Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. That distances The Acolyte from the rest of the Skywalker saga, and the Star Wars movies and TV shows that came before it, in a few important ways. Notably, Headland has said that the show will not feature cameos from established characters like Yoda, and will instead focus on new, original characters who don't have as much lore and backstory. Viewers will instead be introduced to the characters in the show itself, rather than needing to know who they are beforehand.\n\nAlong with its new characters, The Acolyte will also present a new side of familiar groups, like the Jedi. The Jedi Order of the High Republic was very different from the Order featured in the prequel trilogy, and those differences will likely be explained in The Acolyte itself. Again, this means viewers don't need preexisting knowledge of the Jedi Order and what caused their downfall. It's essentially a different group, and while some audience members may have already been introduced to it through the High Republic novels and comics, everyone who watches The Acolyte will have a similar idea of the era by the end of the show.\n\nThe Acolyte could spark a Star Wars renaissance, and Headland made the right call in allowing new viewers to enjoy it.\n\nHeadland's approach to Star Wars is probably exactly what The Acolyte, and the franchise as a whole, needed. It can be daunting to try to engage with Star Wars for the first time while knowing that there are hundreds of stories to catch up on. It's a very big, multimedia franchise, and while it does a good job of letting anyone jump into its stories at any point, there's still quite a bit of lore that can make it feel intimidating. Even the Skywalker saga movies, where many viewers' love for Star Wars began, have 12 feature-length installments, which creates a sort of barrier to entrance.\n\nHeadland clearly understood that some people aren't familiar with the franchise's extensive lore but still want to enjoy Star Wars. Because she's crafted The Acolyte as a blank slate for new viewers to jump into, it could very well bring in a whole slew of new Star Wars fans. That would revitalize the entire franchise, and could even inspire those who were apprehensive about the amount of lore it has to engage with older Star Wars media. The Acolyte could spark a Star Wars renaissance, and Headland made the right call in allowing new viewers to enjoy it.\n\nThe Acolyte premieres on June 4 on Disney+.\n\nSource: GamesRadar+\n\nThe Acolyte\n\nThe Acolyte is a television series set in the Star Wars universe at the end of the High Republic Era, where both the Jedi and the Galactic Empire were at the height of their influence. This sci-fi thriller sees a former Padawan reunite with her former Jedi Master as they investigate several crimes - all leading to darkness erupting from beneath the surface and preparing to bring about the end of the High Republic.\n\nCast Dafne Keen , Lee Jung-jae , Amandla Stenberg , Jodie Turner-Smith , Joonas Suotamo , Carrie-Anne Moss , Margarita Levieva , Charlie Barnett , Dean-Charles

No mention of Star Wars. And in the lead-up to The Acolyte, Disney and Lucasfilm have emphasized how different this Star Wars show is from all the previous ones on Disney+. It is set 100 years before the prequels, in a time period never explored in live-action before. Instead of linking back to the films through preexisting characters and locations from earlier films or shows, The Acolyte introduces an entirely new cast, exploring a galaxy with no Empire, where the Jedi are in power and the Sith are virtually nonexistent. Where all of the previous shows were different blends of western, science-fiction, and fantasy, The Acolyte is mostly a mystery, with a group of Jedis investigating the murder of one of their own.\n\nAnd yet for all the supposed differences, The Acolyte still looks, sounds, and feels like pretty much every other Star Wars television show. It contains some fun moments, but at least in the first two episodes premiering today, it doesn't distinguish itself in any meaningful way. Even some of the subplots recall similar elements of other Star Wars productions like The Rise of Skywalker and Ahsoka.\n\nREAD MORE: 12 Times Star Wars Wasted Great Actors in Bad Roles\n\nThe idea of introducing totally new Star Wars cast that isn't beholden to the Skywalker mythology or the demands of existing continuity sounds refreshing and exciting. Unfortunately, The Acolyte's set of new Jedis and mystery villains, created by writer/producer/director Leslye Headland, don't really leap off the screen as compelling new wrinkles on old Star Wars types. Maybe the most interesting in the first two episodes is Mae (Amandla Stenberg) who is the title character and the figure hunting Jedi as the series begin. The mystery, then, is not who is the killer, but why. Early episodes hint at a tragedy in Mae's past and some sort of crime committed by the Jedi against her and her planet, an interesting idea given that the \"Light Side\" of the Force traditionally play the unequivocal (if often ineffective) heroes in this fictional universe.\n\nIf the rest of the season of The Acolyte will uncover some vast conspiracy amongst the Jedi -- or perhaps reveal previously undisclosed moral shadings to the evil Sith -- it only happens after the two-episode series premiere. The first two installments, which each run a little over 30 minutes, treat the Jedi as they are always treated: As badass warrior monks with incredible fighting skills, boundless wisdom, and few emotional attachments, That includes Master Sol (Squid Game's Lee Jung-jae) a stoic Obi-Wan Kenobi type who is charged with tracking down Mae after she kills another Jedi Master.\n\nThe first two episodes also introduce a cockier Jedi named Yord Fandar (Charlie Barnett) and a padawan name Jecki Lon (Dafne Keen) who serves as the equivalent of Chris Noth to Sol's Jerry Orbach -- or she would if The Acolyte felt more like a detective story and less like a Star Wars show where Amandla Stenberg tries to kill people while the Jedi follow her trail very deliberately.\n\nCarrie-Anne Moss also pops up as another Jedi master named Indara, casting that echoes with her role in The Matrix in some interesting ways. That includes her participation in the series' opening sequence, an elaborately choreographed martial arts fight. The notion of the former Trinity now standing as a member of the established Jedi Order fighting a mysterious insurgent could be interesting, but it's entirely left to the viewer to make those connections for themselves.\n\nThe fight choreography is solid and the shows look good -- or at least as good as pretty much all the Star Wars series look. And that's just it; it looks like Star Wars. Do you like Star Wars? Do you enjoy the other recent Star Wars TV shows? (At least the ones that weren't horrible?) Then you'll probably enjoy this one too.\n\nBut you may find, as I did, that there wasn't much here to distinguish it from those other shows. Headland previously co-created Netflix's Russian Doll, which had a bold premise, rich characters, and a ton of personality. That was a very memorable show. It stood out in a very crowded streaming landscape. I don't feel a ton of her unique perspective or voice in The Acolyte, beyond perhaps in centering this story on several female characters.\n\nThe Acolyte is professionally mounted and it's certainly possible that its characters will deepen and its mystery will grow more interesting over time. In the early going, it's just kind of a shrug. We've been lucky to live in a world where there are so many of these Star Wars series lately. But the more we get, the less special each one seems. One of the best parts of Star Wars was the fact that it used to be an event. Back then, it was easy to get excited no matter what the new Star Wars thing was. Now that it's this series an ongoing, ever-growing entity, I find it harder and harder to work up the same level of enthusiasm.", "source": {"uri": "b105country.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "B105"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_singer@b105country.com", "name": "Matt Singer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sith", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ahsoka (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_prequel_trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars prequel trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucasfilm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fantasy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_character", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Title character"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obi-Wan Kenobi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Barnett_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Barnett (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie-Anne_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carrie-Anne Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Orbach", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Orbach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Noth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Noth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dafne_Keen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dafne Keen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2024/06/attachment-PDX-058458_R.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

The first two episodes will air together on June 4, but what about the rest of the season? Here's what to know about The Acolyte Season 1 release schedule.\n\nPart of Lucasfilm's Star Wars franchise, The Acolyte takes place at the end of the High Republic era before the events of the main Star Wars movies. The sci-fi series explores how an esteemed organization like the Jedi Order could be at its peak and on the brink of turmoil as seen during the Skywalker saga. \"A former Padawan reunites with her Jedi Master to investigate a series of crimes but discovers the forces they confront are more sinister than they ever anticipated,\" the official logline reads.\n\nSeries showrunner Leslye Headland -- who was first introduced to the George Lucas films as a teenager -- chose to focus on personal conflicts and one-on-one battles to introduce the new characters in The Acolyte. \"If Star Wars is about the underdog versus the institution, [in The Acolyte] the Jedi are the institution,\" she told StarWars.com.\n\nThe director continued, \"I was so interested in a storyline where the Jedi were at the height of their power -- and I don't mean The Phantom Menace, because at that point, there's a Sith Lord in the Senate that they're not picking up on.\" Headland wanted to go even further, like when seeing a Sith seemed as likely as meeting a velociraptor. \"Like it's a thing I've heard of, but it's not a thing that you would ever consider you'd be interacting with.\"\n\nWhile carving her own path with The Acolyte, Headland wanted to weave her love for the Star Wars franchise, books, and Expanded Universe lore into the story. \"You'll see a half Theelin, half human Jedi, Jecki, played by Dafne Keen, which was always a dream of mine,\" Headland revealed. The series will also have \"some EU lore,\" introduce a Zygerrian Jedi and create a new species. \"There are a couple of really big EU ideas that are utilized both early on in the series and later in the series,\" she also teased to the Star Wars website.\n\nThe series stars Amandla Stenberg, Lee Jung-jae, Manny Jacinto, Dafne Keen, Charlie Barnett, Jodie Turner-Smith, Rebecca Henderson, Dean-Charles Chapman, Joonas Suotamo, and Carrie-Anne Moss.

For every Andor, there's a Book of Boba Fett. Even the former poster child for the service, The Mandalorian, has begun to lose audiences with its most recent season. This left all eyes on The Acolyte to impress fans and pull casuals back into the fold. But was it able to succeed?\n\nThe Acolyte has a much darker premise than most Star Wars shows. Taking place 100 years prior to the events of The Phantom Menace, the series follows a former Padawan (Amandla Stenberg) forced to ally with the Jedi Order and her former master Sol (Lee Jung-jae) after dark circumstances arise. However, things quickly take a turn for the worse as they realize they're dealing with forces far more sinister than they could have ever expected.\n\nThe time period alone already gives The Acolyte a leg up when compared to its fellow Disney Plus shows. There's been a push in recent years to connect many of the shows in the Star Wars universe, in no small part due to the influence of Lucasfilm's Chief creative officer Dave Filoni. While all the cameos and Easter eggs have been a joy to fans, it's left casual fans feeling like they need to play catch up in cases like Ahsoka.\n\nBy setting The Acolyte at the very end of the High Republic era, long before the name \"Skywalker\" ever graced the suns of Tatooine, the series is able to tell a story entirely detached from the established Star Wars canon fans have grown to expect from the Disney Plus shows. The series takes full advantage of this throughout its first few episodes, telling a truly unique story unable to be found anywhere else in the franchise.\n\nThis doesn't mean that The Acolyte is completely divorced from Star Wars lore. The series holds many secrets that hardcore fans will be overjoyed to see in live-action. However, those elements serve a unique role in the story that helps distance it from the films and other Disney Plus shows.\n\nThe first mistake of The Acolyte is that it doesn't take this premise far enough. Despite being set a century before the Star Wars films, the level of technology seen in the galaxy far, far away seems to be stagnant. Aside from a few architectural differences, nobody would be blamed if they thought the Disney Plus series took place only a handful of years prior to The Phantom Menace.\n\nThat all being said, the entire cast of The Acolyte gives their A-Game. With multiple big names on the roster, from Amandla Stenberg to Dafne Keen, it'd be easy to imagine some members of the cast could get drowned out. However, even minor characters such as Manny Jacinto's Qimir stand tall as worthy members of the ensemble.\n\nParticular flowers must be given to Lee Jung-jae, who gives one of the best performances of any Jedi in the history of the franchise. He's able to perfectly channel the tragedy and wisdom that Jedi Masters are known for with his portrayal of Sol, while still managing to make the role his own when compared to greats like Alec Guinness.\n\nAnother strength of the series is the choreography. Star Wars has never been able to satisfy everyone with its lightsaber duels in live-action, no matter how iconic. The prequels were lambasted in their day for feeling like there was no weight to anything that was happening. In contrast, some view the fights in the original trilogy that fell more in line with samurai duels as far too slow for a space opera.\n\nThe Acolyte strikes a balance that hasn't been found in any Star Wars project not made solely on a computer. It's thrilling and fast-paced, but still believable within the rules set by the series. This is largely achieved by a surprisingly sparring use of lightsabers, with the series preferring to use the Force and hand-to-hand combat for its most important scenes.\n\nThe dreaded Disney Plus pacing issues sadly drag the series down. Much like its Star Wars contemporaries, The Acolyte fares better than most six-episode Disney Plus shows. However, it's clear the company still struggles with pacing out their high-budget projects over six episodes, with the first four ranging from breakneck to a snail's pace.\n\nNot much can be said about the story of The Acolyte in this review. It's certainly good, perhaps one of the best of any Star Wars show on Disney Plus sans Andor. However, the mysteries inherent to its premise prevent much further discussion. What can be said is that the show respects the viewer's intelligence, and questions become answered before they become stale, allowing new ones to flow into their place at the end of every episode.\n\nThe Acolyte isn't a perfect show. It's also almost certain its best or worst parts stretch beyond the episodes graciously provided for this review. However, it's a refreshing change of pace that redefines how franchises like Star Wars should use Disney Plus (or other streaming services) to supplement their tentpole releases with standalone stories, not glorified side missions for their most popular characters to cameo in.\n\nRATING: 8/10\n\nThe Acolyte premieres June 4, 2024 on Disney Plus.

It allows us to dive into a very different galaxy, one where no one's heard the names Skywalker or Palpatine, and where a thriving Jedi Order functions more along the lines of what we know from the prequel trilogy. After five consecutive series set either in the midst of or in the aftermath of the Empire's rule, Disney+'s newest live-action Star Wars series changes things up from the get-go - there's no Stormtroopers in sight! - and that timeframe, along with some intriguing story ideas, provides a strong hook. But it's not quite enough to bring balance to the first four episodes, which, on a filmmaking level, feel more \"TV\" than Star Wars ever has - thus losing much of its defining epic quality.\n\nAmandla Stenberg does good work establishing twin sisters Mae and Osha as two distinct characters, imbuing each half of her dual role with different mannerisms and energies, without pushing things to extremes. Both sisters have been trained in the ways of the Force: Mae by a mysterious Sith master, and Osha at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant (before leaving the Jedi behind). It's a solid setup and also a nice spotlight for Stenberg, who's been an engaging onscreen presence since her breakout performance in The Hunger Games and up through projects like The Hate U Give and Bodies Bodies Bodies.\n\nThe Acolyte was created by Leslye Headland, best known for co-creating Netflix's excellent Russian Doll. You can tell she's a big Star Wars fan, and she does commendable work showing how your average Jedi Knight or Master does the job of keeping the peace during this era. Her new series follows characters who operate under the Jedi Council - which is referenced but unseen in the first four episodes - and must navigate both that power structure and the exterior element of the Republic Senate. The Acolyte finds another anchor in one such character: Jedi Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae), who draws Osha into the hunt for Mae after the assassination of a Jedi in a thrilling series-opening brawl. Lee gives a standout performance, exuding Sol's innate Jedi calm and wisdom mixed with regret. The Squid Game star conveys a lot through his facial expressions, giving us insight into Sol and the burdens he carries without saying a word.\n\nA big underlying element in George Lucas' Star Wars prequel trilogy was the arrogance and hubris of the Jedi, which built up within the Order to the point that it was weaponized against them. The Acolyte shows the emergence of these flaws, and finds some of its most interesting material in topics introduced in those movies. Turns out the Order's methods of finding and taking in Force-sensitive children aren't as universally beloved or accepted as Qui-Gon Jinn made them sound.\n\nThe franchise shouldn't be expected to maintain one specific approach for every project: The differences between The Mandalorian and Andor, for example, prove the benefits of exploring different genres of storytelling within this universe. Yet both of those shows still feel fundamentally Star Wars. In its visual style and storytelling, The Acolyte feels a bit off in this regard.\n\nThe Book of Boba Fett and Obi-Wan Kenobi each took knocks for their visuals and feeling more \"fake,\" but The Acolyte is the most a Star Wars show has felt like, well, a TV show. There's often an overt artificiality to the sets, costumes, and makeup that underline how this series lacks the cinematic production values we expect from Star Wars. (And before you point a finger at ILM's polarizing video walls, a.k.a. The Volume, those weren't used for The Acolyte.) To be clear, it's not that it feels low budget - this is obviously a very expensive series packed with special effects - but this is a franchise that has typically operated at a different and grander scale than this. In terms of the long-running sci-fi institution it most readily evokes, the flatter visual language and character interactions of The Acolyte often feel more like Star Trek than Star Wars. In addition, some of the plot points feel clunky - characters change their mind about something they were adamant about far too quickly or escape danger in a strangely convenient manner. Some attempts at humorous banter fail to earn a laugh.\n\nMore often than not, The Acolyte is at its best when dealing with the conflict between the two sisters and Sol's dynamic with them. Also, it has some great and innovative fight scenes. Early episodes hold off on traditional lightsaber vs. lightsaber battles, instead focusing on the knife-wielding Mae's one-on-one fights with various Jedi like Sol or Carrie-Anne Moss' Indara. This allows us to see Jedi characters using martial arts in an exciting and well choreographed way, underlining just how skilled they are in combat that doesn't involve laser swords. Moss puts her Matrix background to very cool use, showing Indara's nearly effortless counters to Mae's attacks.\n\nElsewhere, The Good Place's Manny Jacinto is fun as Qimir, who gets to represent the smuggler/scoundrel element of Star Wars, while Dafne Keen forges a warm rapport with Stenberg as Osha forms a bond with Sol's padawan, Jecki Lon. Charlie Barnett, who previously worked with Headland on Russian Doll, has a bit of a thankless role as the by-the-book Jedi Yord, who feels extraneous to the story in the first four episodes - but we'll see if that changes in the second half of the season.", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_prequel_trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars prequel trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_High_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: The High Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palpatine", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palpatine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormtrooper_(Star_Wars)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormtrooper (Star Wars)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Doll_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Doll (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_impact_of_Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cultural impact of Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui-Gon_Jinn", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qui-Gon Jinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sith", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coruscant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coruscant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Lucas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anchor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Barnett_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Barnett (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie-Anne_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carrie-Anne Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Light_&_Magic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Industrial Light & Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dafne_Keen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dafne Keen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Jacinto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manny Jacinto"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/04/theacolyte-review-blogroll-1717514898160.jpg?width=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 233, "textEnd": 239}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

(Getting too deep into plot details risks spoilers.)\n\nCarrie-Anne Moss of \"The Matrix\" makes for an ideal veteran Jedi, but in its first misstep, \"The Acolyte\" squanders that opportunity right out of the gate, setting viewers up for disappointment.\n\n\"The Acolyte\" shuns blasters for hand-to-hand combat and lightsaber battles but producers make some odd choices: From a spacewalk in a spacesuit to uniform-like Jedi tunics to cheap-looking planet exteriors, this is the first \"Star Wars\" series to give off a \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" vibe. (One character also resembles a Minbari from \"Babylon 5.\")\n\nIt doesn't help that the show's momentum can be slow, with too many dull exposition pitstops even as episodes clock in at a light 32 to 42 minutes.\n\n\"The Acolyte\" marks the first live-action \"Star Wars\" story set during the peaceful High Republic Era previously chronicled in comics and books, but the show gives almost no glimpses of High Republic society in the first four episodes (of eight) made available for review, a significant missed opportunity.\n\nWhile Stenberg handles the heavy lifting required to tell her portion of \"The Acolyte\" story, the show's MVP is actor Manny Jacinto (Jason Mendoza on \"The Good Place\"), who plays a good-natured, stringy-haired scoundrel in over his head. While most other characters are perpetually grim-faced with worry, Jacinto's Qimir is a rare \"Acolyte\" character who seems to be having fun.\n\nThe third episode of \"The Acolyte\" offers a necessary flashback that fills in a lot of blanks and introduces Osha's two mothers, including one played by Jodie Turner-Smith. Yes, this \"Star Wars\" will surely attract the attention of the Woke Police as it also turns its female gaze on the shirtless, ripped Jedi Knight Yord (Charlie Barnett, \"Russian Doll\"). But after Princess Leia's bikini in \"Return of the Jedi,\" it certainly seems like turnabout is fair play.\n\nHeadland explores themes of duality (light side/dark side; families divided by opposing belief systems) with little subtext as the conversations between characters spell everything out in the most concrete terms.\n\n\"Andor,\" like \"The Acolyte,\" also started slowly and gained narrative momentum. The fourth episode of \"The Acolyte\" ends on a cliffhanger that promises a big reveal to come, always a smart trick for keeping viewers hooked. But \"Andor\" felt and looked like a \"Star Wars\" story through and through even in its less exciting early episodes. \"The Acolyte\" veers more toward generic sci-fi set in any old galaxy far, far away or even one relatively close, close nearby.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rob_owen@seattletimes.com", "name": "Rob Owen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Boba_Fett", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Book of Boba Fett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Star_Wars:_The_Skywalker_Saga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Doll_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Doll (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Obi-Wan Kenobi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fan fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_High_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: The High Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Trek: The Next Generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie-Anne_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carrie-Anne Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Matrix (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lightsaber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaster_(Star_Wars)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blaster (Star Wars)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodie_Turner-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jodie Turner-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Barnett_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Barnett (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Jacinto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manny Jacinto"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/06032024_TZR_Disney-The_Acolyte_tzr_123202.jpg?d=1020x655", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 788, "textEnd": 795}], "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

The thing is, as much as the events of a galaxy far, far away are testing my patience in recent years, there are a couple of nice surprises that drop in now and then. Like Andor, for example. Now, maybe The Acolyte can also join Andor in being a not-so-bad Star Wars show. It is intriguing, it is suspenseful and it doesn't get ambitious for the sake of it, going by the first four episodes I have watched of the show. OTT Releases Of The Week: Akshay Kumar and Tiger Shroff's Bade Miyan Chote Miyan On Netflix, Dafne Keen's Star Wars - The Acolyte on Disney+ Hotstar & More.\n\nCreated by Leslye Headland, The Acolyte is set 100 years before the rise of the Empire going by the perfunctory Star Wars crawl that comes before the episode. In a bar, a Jedi Master named Indara (Carrie-Anne Moss) is assassinated by a rogue Jedi, who seems to have a past with the victim. Based on a sole eye-witness' testimony, Osha (Amandla Stenberg), a former Jedi reject and presently a space-ship mechanic, is arrested by Yord (Charlie Barnett), a temple guardian Jedi, as she matches the killer's description. She insists she has nothing to do with the killing.\n\nHer former master, Sol (Lee Jung-jae), also doesn't believe that Osha could kill Indara. It turns out that they were right, as the killer turns out to be her long-thought-dead identical twin sister Mae. What's more, she has been trained by a mysterious Jedi master, whose identity remains shrouded even after four episodes, though the person gets a badass sequence near the end of the fourth one.\n\nWhat I enjoyed about The Acolyte is that it has a very single-narrative-driven plot instead of taking a new adventure-a-week approach to The Mandalorian. There are very minimal fan baits. The show is also very contained, allowing us to follow only a handful of characters, most of whom have a shared history with each other, with the focus more on Osha/Mae.\n\nThe mystery around Mae's murderous intentions for her intended targets and her unknown mentor keeps the suspense alive, while the drama is reserved for the equation between Sol and Osha. Also, Amandla Stenberg (Bodies Bodies Bodies) and Lee Jung-jae (Squid Game) made their characters resonate with me. I hope Logan scene-stealer Dafne Keene, who plays Sol's present Padawan Jecki Lon, gets a bigger part to play in the final four episodes, and so does The Good Place scene-stealer Manny Jacinto (Qimir), who did crack me up with his goofy humour in the scene where he is confronted by Sol and his team. Andor Season Finale Review: Diego Luna's Star Wars Spinoff Concludes With a Spectacular Bang!\n\nThe third episode - some SPOILERS ahead - is a flashback one that does halt the pacing a bit, but then manages to offer some curious surprises towards the end. Also, the episode has the fine Jodie Turner-Smith, and that's always a win. Not all issues are smoothened out, though. Some plot points are confusingly dealt with. Like, Mae gets an opportunity to take on a target much earlier than expected, but she takes a less aggressive approach towards that. Perhaps that might be answered ahead.\n\nSimilarly, one character is shown okay to end their life of guilt for what happened to Mae, but I didn't see any profound reaction in that person when the incident actually happened. Again, hoping the rest of the episodes might answer that.\n\nTechnically, The Acolyte may not be the most polished Star Wars show out there, but I didn't mind the slight influence of Wuxia in the action choreography.\n\nYes, I am tired of Star Wars content being churned out nearly every month, but occasionally, the franchise also comes up with shows that soften my frustration with the series. The Acolyte worked for me because it doesn't aim for some far-reaching story that drops fan bait every now and then but rather serves an interesting mystery through a single-plot-driven narrative, which makes for a refreshing change. The Acolyte is streaming in India on Disney+ Hotstar.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Exhibiting influences that blend martial-arts movies, young-adult fiction and the detective genre, it's an intriguing if modest addition whose lack of connection to existing canon (through four previewed episodes, anyway) proves both an advantage and disadvantage.\n\nThe show certainly starts with a bang, as a masked assassin with Force-like powers wages an attack on a Jedi master, yielding a fight that owes as much to \"The Matrix\" as earlier \"Star Wars\" fare.\n\nSuspicion quickly turns to Osha (Amandla Stenberg, featured in \"The Hate U Give\" and \"Dear Evan Hansen\"), a young woman who trained as a padawan before leaving the Jedi order. Her sole ally seems to be her former master, Master Sol (\"Squid Game\" Emmy winner Lee Jung-jae), who saved Osha as a child after a tragedy that claimed her family, a bit of history that will figure in unraveling the plot and perpetrator.\n\nEven with an extended flashback episode, the story does move - a legitimate knock on some of the other live-action \"Star Wars\" series, including the well-regarded \"Andor\" - and technically speaking, the action is crisp and impressive.\n\nCreated by \"Russian Doll's\" Leslye Headland (who also directed the first two episodes), \"The Acolyte\" lands in an interesting middle ground in terms of the \"Star Wars\" output for Disney+, alternately feeling dark and edgy like \"Andor,\" action-oriented in a way that resembles \"Ahsoka,\" and awash in the minutia of Jedi politics and lore, a bit like the animated \"Tales of the Jedi.\"\n\nLee Jung-jae as Master Sol in \"Star Wars: The Acolyte.\"\n\nChristian Black/Lucasfilm Ltd.\n\nIf that combination of disparate elements benefits the show, the challenge involves having the audience come in with no familiarity or investment in these particular characters, other than a broad understanding of where they exist within the Jedi hierarchy. While Stenberg and Lee Jung-jae largely overcome those headwinds (and give the show a notably diverse foundation), most of the secondary players don't, feeling generic in the process.\n\nThe evolving nature of the theatrical business has shifted the calculus on developing series for streaming, as opposed to movies. Lucasfilm, as keeper of the \"Star Wars\" flame, appears to be gradually finding its way along with everyone else, as evidenced by its big-screen plans for \"The Mandalorian.\" In that context \"The Acolyte\" comes across as a calculated gamble that makes sense as a series and almost surely would have struggled to fill theater seats.\n\nMore than most of these shows, any review of \"The Acolyte\" at this stage feels incomplete. The final episodes will ultimately determine whether this amounts to a significant and perhaps fertile new avenue for \"Star Wars,\" or merely an interesting detour.\n\nUntil then, this tale of the Jedi is entertaining and mildly promising. Whether that opens new doors for Disney/Lucasfilm or leads to a dead end, as a wise little green fellow once said, always in motion is the future.\n\n\"Star Wars: The Acolyte\" premieres June 4 at 9 p.m. ET on Disney+.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_lowry@cnn.com", "name": "Brian Lowry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_adult_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Young adult fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dear_Evan_Hansen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dear Evan Hansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canon (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Matrix (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_the_Jedi_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tales of the Jedi (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ahsoka (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Doll_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Doll (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucasfilm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flashback (narrative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/pdx-053430-r.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 3209, "textEnd": 3215}], "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The Acolyte, created by Leslye Headland, occurs during the waning days of the High Republic era, about 100 years before Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, when both the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic were at the height of their power and influence. It also may reveal the first cracks in these institutions' foundations that would leave them vulnerable to exploitation and lead to their eventual falls. With this coming darkness looming, The Acolyte offers a different set of genre influences than Star Wars has typically hewn to, though perhaps not blended to maximum potency.\n\nWARNING: This review discusses plot points from the first four episodes of The Acolyte that could be considered mild spoilers\n\nStar Amandla Stenberg centers the series in the dual roles of Osha and Mae, twin sisters separated after a traumatic event that left their family dead. Osha went on to become a Jedi Padawan but left the Jedi Order when she proved unable to let go of her feelings about what happened that day.\n\nMae is presumed dead until she emerges in The Acolyte's opening scene, striding into a cantina to goad Jedi Master Indara (Carrie-Anne Most) into a fight. It's a stunning scene, with ambiance set nicely by the streams of light coming into the saloon from the setting sun outside, and combat that blends beautiful moves inspired by martial arts cinema with Indira's Force abilities to offer something fresh in a Star Wars fight sequence. It ends with a standoff befitting the clear Western influences and is a stellar opening salvo for the new show.\n\nMae's reemergence triggers an investigation that reunites Osha with Jedi from her past, including her old friend Yord Fandar (Charlie Barnett) and her former master, Sol (Lee Jung-jae). Since Mae was believed dead, Osha is at first a suspect, but it doesn't take long for them to figure out the truth and begin investigating what appears to be a revenge-fueled killing spree.\n\nBut revenge for what? The Acolyte is less adept at building tension around its central mysteries than it is at framing exciting action scenes, less keeping its secrets tightly under wraps and more keeping them behind a thin strip of sheer fabric, obscured enough to be frustrating. Mae is seemingly motivated by vengeance for something that happened during or around the event that separated her from her sister. Sol was there when it happened, as was Osha, and several of the supporting characters seem to have some idea of what transpired, leaving only the audience out of the loop. Eventually, the show does offer a first-hand account of what happened, but while it leaves crucial moments unseen, it isn't hard for anyone paying attention to figure out what they're not being told. (Presumably. I don't want to spoil too much by spelling out my theory, but if it turns out to be anything other than, broadly, \"The Jedi did something bad,\" I will stand corrected.)\n\nDespite its prestige thriller ambitions, The Acolyte leans into several tropes and some of Star Wars' most melodramatic impulses. Characters are transfixed by flames that remind them of their traumatic pasts. There are mistaken identities, evil twins, and mysterious masterminds. These devices can be fun in the right context, but the storytelling isn't leaning into it. For the cinematic splendor of that opening scene, the spaceship-bound scenes that follow are uninspired, oddly quiet, and awkwardly staged, feeling somehow like they're being shot at an immersive Star Wars theme park.\n\nThe plot suffocates the characters, who are often left with little to do but deliver whatever bit of dialogue is needed to push the plot to the next scene, leaving their characterizations one-note. Yord is a young, by-the-book goofball. Jecki Lon (Dafne Keen), Sol's current padawan, is smugly brilliant, Vernestra Rwoh (Rebecca Henderson) is a severe Jedi elder turned jaded by Coruscant politics. They're fine starting points, but the series seems uninterested in giving any character an arc outside of the twins and maybe Sol, leaving the rest of the ensemble feeling more like plot devices than people.\n\nDespite its flaws, The Acolyte offers some memorable moments. Anytime the series focuses on the unique practices of the Jedi of the High Republic era, it shines. The time spent with Mother Aniseya (Jodie Turner-Smith) and her coven of Force witches is fascinating and has some mesmerizing visual moments. While the series plays with certain familiar Star Wars themes (duality, chiefly), it also surprisingly elevates the type of Star Wars story previously confined to tie-in novels to live-action. As someone who has read a few Star Wars novels, I say that with affection, though it'll be interesting to see if it will lose more casual fans.\n\nStar Wars: The Acolyte stands apart from other Star Wars projects for its unique setting and for bringing new influences into the universe. It isn't executed to perfection, and there are moments when it can feel lifeless. However, there are others when it succeeds at showing that there are still unexplored corners of this Star Wars universe worth investigating. As a series built on mysteries - likely another polarizing point - much of its value will come from whether it has satisfying answers. We won't know that until the final episode. For now, it's an uneven experience likely to appeal most to those already swimming in the deep end of the Star Wars pool.\n\nRating: 3 out of 5\n\nThe first two episodes of Star Wars: The Acolyte premiere on Disney+ on June 4th.", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_in_other_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars in other media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_High_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: The High Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galactic Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Barnett_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Barnett (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Henderson_(actress)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebecca Henderson (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodie_Turner-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jodie Turner-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plot device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coruscant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coruscant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodrama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Melodrama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tie-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trope_(literature)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trope (literature)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dafne_Keen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dafne Keen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/US_Civil_War", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/US Civil War", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2024/06/01/90be3c2e-3721-412a-abc5-308865abd5fc/star-wras-the-acolyte-review.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 5693, "textEnd": 5701}], "sentiment": -0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The entire cast consists of standouts, particularly Amandla Stenberg, Manny Jacinto, and Lee Jung-jae. The series introduces new lore, diverse characters, and world-building that adds depth to the larger Star Wars universe.\n\nThe Acolyte hits the ground running with its two-episode debut, wasting very little time in showing the audience that the series isn't afraid to take risks, no matter how shocking they might be. Within the first few minutes, the series delivers some impressive high-flying choreography as two Force users face off (in a scene that has been teased relentlessly in the lead-up to the premiere) before veering into a nuanced howcatchem-style mystery.\n\nWhile the series boasts an impressive ensemble cast, Amandla Stenberg is The Acolyte's pitch-perfect lead. By design, the role of Mae demands that she taps into the duality that exists within all Force-users, and that comes into play within the first ten minutes of Episode 1. It is this delicate balance between the Light and the Dark side of the Force that makes Stenberg infinitely fascinating to watch as she engages with the two extremes. Stenberg may not be the first Star Wars actor to find themselves caught between the Sith and the Jedi, but she certainly is the first to explore it in such a cleverly conceived way.\n\nWhere Andor was a gripping spy thriller, The Acolyte turns Star Wars into a compelling murder mystery, much in the same way that the High Republic has explored the genre in the comic book miniseries Star Wars: The High Republic - Trail of Shadows. Set roughly 100 years before The Phantom Menace, The Acolyte showcases the Jedi as we have never seen them before. It's thrilling to see Star Wars not only break free of the monotony of the Original Trilogy era but also delve into new genres as overarching plot points, not just as one-off ventures. It's more than just the time period that feels new and exciting; Leslye Headland brings an entirely fresh approach to the franchise by allowing her characters to be imperfect. It helps that these first four episodes of The Acolyte range from 32 to 42 minutes, giving the characters a chance to breathe and feel settled within the fast-paced plots.\n\nThe Acolyte Sci-Fi\n\nThe Acolyte is a mystery-thriller that will take viewers into a galaxy of shadowy secrets and emerging dark-side powers in the final days of the High Republic era. A former Padawan reunites with her Jedi Master to investigate a series of crimes, but the forces they confront are more sinister than they ever anticipated.\n\nRelease Date June 4, 2024 Cast Carrie-Anne Moss , Amandla Stenberg , Lee Jung-jae , Manny Jacinto , Dafne Keen , Jodie Turner-Smith , Rebecca Henderson , Charlie Barnett , Dean-Charles Chapman Main Genre Sci-Fi Seasons 1 Studio Disney+ Franchise Star Wars Expand 'The Acolyte' Flips Star Wars Storytelling On Its Head\n\nPrevious installments in the Star Wars franchise, and modern-day storytelling as a whole, seem terrified of playing with extremes. So often, characters must remain pure as the driven snow, with morally righteous ideologies, personalities, and traits. Ahsoka was a perfect example of this very tired idea, made more obvious by the fact that these ideas were still being pinned to a character that had left the Jedi Order. Yet here, in The Acolyte, we have characters like Yord (Charlie Barnett), someone who is allowed to be full of himself, cocky, and a bit of a prick despite being a Jedi. This is only part of what has made the High Republic's storytelling so exciting; with the Jedi being at the height of their power, they're allowed to be flawed.\n\nThe Acolyte may be firmly rooted within the High Republic era, but it is the closest we've come to having the Expanded Universe on our screens. It manages to blend the diverse storytelling that is an integral part of the High Republic with the comfortable familiarity of what made the EU such a gateway for fans of yesteryear. The Acolyte may possess themes -- which must remain redacted at this time -- that are inherently linked to the framework of Star Wars storytelling, but Headland and her writers' room manage to flip those concepts on their heads. Everything feels fresh and unique here; especially as the series is unburdened by the pressures for cameos that other series have been saddled with. The series is bursting at the seams with exciting new locations, non-humanoid characters in the foreground, and perfectly-paced scripts that draw you in and take you along for the ride.\n\n'The Acolyte's Biggest Strength Is Its Cast Close\n\nIndara (Carrie-Anne Moss) is one of the first characters that audiences are introduced to, and Headland was smart to cast a familiar face in the role. Given the fast-paced nature of the series, Moss' previous work as Trinity in The Matrix serves as a sort of shorthand for viewers. Moss carries herself like someone you know can kick ass, and when she does, there is no explanation needed to understand that she is a character who has rarely been on the losing side of an argument or a fight. As the series unravels, we learn more about her past and her connection to Mae's revenge path, which helps to further flesh out the inciting action that sets the series into motion.\n\nThe Acolyte doesn't contain any cameos, but that doesn't mean that the series doesn't bring in familiar characters -- at least for readers of The High Republic. Once Mae's crimes are brought to the attention of the Jedi Order, Vernestra Rowh (Rebecca Henderson) steps in to launch an investigation. Over the last three years, readers have gotten to essentially watch Vern grow up from a Padawan prodigy who suffered tragic losses early in her training, to now, as a high-ranking official in the Order. Vern's even-keeled temperament makes her the perfect anchor point for both newcomers to the High Republic and fans who have been obsessing over the era for years. Knowing Vern's backstory from the novels sheds a lot of light on her decision to allow Sol (Lee Jung-jae) to set off in search of Mae, despite his connection to her. The Jedi in the High Republic novels may indulge in intimacies not previously seen on-screen, but the Order is still quite strict about attachments and that's something that does come into play here.\n\nBased on the first few episodes of the series, Sol is the kind of Jedi Master that fans have been clamoring for. Mae's crime spree and the ensuing investigation force Sol to interrogate some of his past actions and failures. He still carries a lot of regret about a former Padawan of his who left the Jedi order six years ago, and all of that comes to the surface in the present. Despite the franchise being inherently linked to the idea of the Master and Apprentice, Star Wars hasn't had very many opportunities to play with that dynamic outside a select circle of characters: Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, Obi-Wan and Anakin Skywalker, Obi-Wan and Luke Skywalker, even Anakin and Ahsoka. Here, The Acolyte presents a fresh take on the dynamic by showcasing a Jedi drop-out and the Master who still questions if he failed as a teacher. However, Sol's Master and Apprentice dynamic is not the only one that the series delves into. As with everything else, there is balance here as the series reveals a brand-new Sith Lord and his acolytes. While the first four episodes don't reveal much about who the Sith Lord is, they do serve up more than enough mystery to whet viewers' appetites.\n\nManny Jacinto's Qimir is another clear stand-out within the cast. While it is difficult to divorce him from his iconic breakout role on The Good Place, this actually works in his favor. From his first introduction as Mae's ally and fellow acolyte, there is a quiet current of dubiousness that makes his affable, good-natured personality feel like a fa\u00e7ade. After all, he is a smuggler who has gotten himself swept up in a murder-for-hire-style plot, and he's just along for the ride. Star Wars has a rich history with lovable scoundrels, and it seems that Qimir might succeed in climbing up the ranks as the series unravels. Jacinto and Stenberg have stellar scene chemistry, which makes their conflicting personalities and motives even more fun to see play out on screen.\n\n'The Acolyte' Brings New Lore and Much-Needed World-building to the Franchise\n\nWhen it comes to the Force, the Jedi have always been at the forefront of the conversation within the Star Wars universe. It is through their teachings that most of the galaxy has come to understand the energy that connects all living things together, but the Jedi are not the only beings that can tap into that energy -- despite how ardently they have tried to be the gatekeepers of the Force. The Nightsisters, or the Witches of Dathomir, have been an ever-present part of canon since their introduction in Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Now, Headland is bringing her own spin on the witchy Force users that the Jedi don't want you to know about. Mother Aniseya (Jodie Turner-Smith) is the leader of a coven of witches that live on the planet Brendok, who tap into the Force in ways that haven't previously been showcased in the franchise.\n\nIn addition to witchy covens and exciting new locations, The Acolyte doesn't shy away from being Star Wars in its purest form. There's a plethora of new (to live-action) species that get their moment in the spotlight, with non-Basic languages being communicated on-screen. The series feels most like a gathering of friends coming together to play in the Star Wars franchise -- except The Acolyte doesn't seem like a creator playing with their favorite action figures, but rather a writers' room of creatives playing an RPG with a fully realized and fleshed-out world, filled with characters with motives, trauma, flaws, and hope. As with Andor, it is great to see that Star Wars hasn't forgotten that you can give your characters full government names without fear of corporal punishment (or whatever was happening in The Mandalorian).\n\nThe Acolyte is undoubtedly one of the most exciting shows on Disney+ this year and one of the best Star Wars projects since 2022. Not only is it a visually engaging story, with stunning flora and fauna, but it is a beautifully-woven story that takes the very best aspects of the franchise and spins them into pure gold.\n\nThe Acolyte\n\nThe Acolyte, led by Amandla Stenberg, Lee Jung-jae, and Manny Jacinto is a surprising genre switch-up for Star Wars.\n\n810\n\nProsThe series benefits from a strong writers' room that is

On the other hand, the Leslye Headland-created show does a solid job of keeping its intrigue alive, as it is, at its core, a mystery.\n\nConsidering that \"Star Wars\" releases take place in various spots on a vast timeline, some background for \"The Acolyte\" is in order.\n\nThe series is set 100 years, give or take, before the events of 1999's \"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,\" which launched the \"Skywalker Saga.\"\n\n\"The Acolyte\" occurs late in \"The High Republic\" era. In this time of initially great prosperity -- which has been fleshed out in recent years in media such as young adult novels and comic books, with an overall storyline still being penned -- the Force-wielding Jedi Knights are many and, in essence, they are guardians of the galaxy.\n\nIn this first slice of High Republic live action, Mae is out to kill four of them, including Sol (\"Squid Game\" star Lee Jung-jae), who is tapped to lead the investigation into her by Master Vernestra Rwoh (Rebecca Henderson), a fan-favorite High Republic character.\n\nWhy is the Mae -- who wields the Force but not a lightsaber, the traditional weapon of a Jedi -- out for vengeance? That will be revealed by the third installment, an episode set 16 years earlier that introduces us to a coven of Force-sensitive witches on the planet Brendock who are led by Mother Aniseya (Jodie Turner-Smith).\n\nA more closely held secret is the identity of the dark-side Force user who has trained her, a masked figure we meet -- briefly -- at the end of the first episode. Even Mae may not know. Is he a Sith Lord? The Sith haven't been seen in ages, but we know they will return at some point before the events of the Prequel Trilogy. (Of course, you can find theories as to whom this menage may be online.)\n\n\"The Acolyte\" introduces myriad other characters, including Jecki (Dafne Keen), Sol's rigid Padawan, aka apprentice; Yord (Charlie Barnett'), another Jedi Knight taking part in the investigation; Jedi Wookie Kelnacca (Joonas Suotamo, no stranger to being one of the big, hairy creatures after having portrayed Chewbacca for much of the Sequel Trilogy and in 2018's \"Solo: A Star Wars Story\"); and Qimir (Manny Jacinto of \"The Good Place\"), an apothecary owner and associate of Mae.\n\nAs with many a \"Star Wars\" show or film, \"The Acolyte\" isn't exactly a showcase for topnotch acting, but Stenberg and Lee are reasonably compelling as the show's central figures.\n\nAnd although he doesn't appear in the first half of the season, it's possible we'll see a younger version of Jedi Master Yoda, whose species, as we know, enjoys lengthy lifespans. That would be nice.\n\n\"Nice\" is a rather appropriate word for what we've seen so far of \"The Acolyte.\" The enthusiasm for \"Star Wars\" from showrunner Headland, best known for co-creating the largely enjoyable and often trippy series \"Russian Doll,\" translates to the screen, especially in the first episode, which she both wrote and directed. However, like other \"Star Wars\" efforts -- most notably the previous live-action series, \"Ahsoka\" -- it frequently stagnates thanks to too many instances of characters talking without anything all that interesting to say.\n\n'Ahsoka' review: Disney+ 'Star Wars' series is often plodding but also promising\n\nWe do not want to be too quick to judge it, however. In 2022, we found the first four episodes of \"Andor\" to be a slog, only to conclude after seeing all 12 first-season installments that it was the best \"Star Wars\" project of the Disney era to date.\n\nGrown-up 'Star Wars' series 'Andor' struggles early on to find its dramatic thrill | TV review\n\nIt's tough to envision \"The Acolyte\" reaching that level of quality, but at the end of the fourth episode -- by which time just about every key moment from the trailers have played out -- we certainly are left wanting to see what comes next.\n\nThat's a good place to be.\n\nWhat: Eight-episode debut season of live-action series set in High Republic era.\n\nWhere: Disney+.\n\nWhen: First two episodes debut at 9 p.m. June 4;

The various Disney+ series have been a mixed bag, but one thing they all have in common is that, critically maligned or acclaimed, they all tend to start strong. The problem is that starting strong isn't enough, and more than a few of the series have fumbled their endings.\n\nThe other problem is that nearly all the Star Wars series have focused on the same period, set about a decade after The Return of the Jedi, and telling a story about a resurgent empire rebuilding itself under the nose of a na\u00efve, complacent New Republic. They're nearly all interconnected; they're all making references to the movies we grew up with, and they're all clearly headed to the same place. The issue is that, collectively, they almost exclusively serve to make the Star Wars universe -- a literal galaxy worth of stars -- smaller.\n\nEnter Star Wars: The Acolyte, the latest series headed to Disney+. This ambitious and expensive new entry in the franchise seeks to respond to at least one of these problems -- and it mostly succeeds. (In the first four episodes critics were given, anyways.)\n\nSet in the age of the High Republic, some 100 years before anyone had heard the name Skywalker, the series follows a small group of Jedi investigating a series of murders. At the centre of the mystery are twin sisters Osha and Mae, both played by Amandla Stenberg. One is angry and vengeful; the other wants to be left alone to live her life. It's a familiar setup with a few unique twists that I won't spoil here, but Stenberg is excellent in both roles, giving each sister a distinct personality and body language.\n\nAs Luke had Obi-Wan, Osha has a mentor in Lee Jung-jae's Sol, a wise older Jedi with ties to her past. Lee, made world-famous in the 2021 Netflix series Squid Game, is the clear standout of the cast. He embodies things about the Jedi that the best of the old masters also did: empathy and intuition. They play great roles in Sol's life, as do his memories and grief.\n\nIn a brief but memorable exchange with his Padawan learner Jecki (Dafne Keen), where she asks why he doesn't let go, Sol reminds her that memories are lessons to be learned from -- and it's clear he not only means it, but he feels it in a way that many Jedi we're familiar with did not. Sol's ties to Osha and Mae's past trouble him and inform his choice to reconnect with them and investigate the crimes at hand. Lee's performance is made all the more impressive considering that he also learned English for this role.\n\nThe rest of the cast members are memorable as well. Keen's Jecki forms a sisterly bond with Osha that gives them some nice material to work with and illuminates both of their characters and Sol. Charlie Barnett is on hand as Yord, a newly minted Jedi Knight who is so by-the-book it's a wonder he isn't literally carrying it around with him at all times. He serves as an excellent foil to other characters with more creative minds.\n\nAs Mother Aniseya, Jodie Turner-Smith maximizes her already otherworldly on-screen presence portraying the leader of a coven of force witches. Her character and the entire coven expand the lore of Star Wars in some new and exciting ways, even going so far as to offer a new perspective on the Force itself.\n\nUnfortunately though, aside from one memorable fight scene, Carrie-Anne Moss, playing the Jedi Master Indara, doesn't have much to do in the first four episodes. However, she's still Carrie-Anne Moss and she kicks ass.\n\nAs mentioned, Disney only provided four episodes of the eight-episode series for review, and while The Acolyte does start strong, a mystery such as this can be made or broken by its ending. Couple this with the uneven track record of Disney+'s Star Wars series, it's safe to say I have some trepidation going into the final four episodes.\n\nThe first half of The Acolyte is very good, with the third episode (directed by Kogonada) being a standout and providing the backstory that ties most of the characters together. And while there are familiar setups, the series is so far good enough to give me hope that it will subvert or even defy my expectations rather than simply fulfill them. Series creator and showrunner Leslye Headland is, if nothing else, keeping the series on track and consistent. When it comes to the multiple timelines the series plays out in, she has a clear vision of where she wants it to go.\n\nThere's a lot to celebrate in The Acolyte, as well. Namely, it's entirely separate from any existing Star Wars stories, meaning that, while it's recognizable as a Star Wars entity, there's no danger of a character we already know showing up just for synergy's sake. Since the story is a new style for this franchise, there are no Easter eggs to look out for either. As a result, the series truly stands on its own in a way that most of the Star Wars films and series do not.\n\nMoreover, The Acolyte introduces a new droid, Pip, who communicates with beeps like R2-D2 and BB-8, but is a hand-held mechanics multi-tool. Pip is adorable and has some great exchanges with Osha, and if Disney doesn't sell a million of them, then they aren't even trying.\n\nThe casting is also noteworthy, not just because the ensemble offer stunning performances but also because they represent the diverse world as it is today. There are already rumblings from small men online about woke-ness, but pay them no mind -- it's legitimately great to see the Star Wars universe truly become as diverse as our own.\n\nThe Acolyte seems tailor-made to address the recent problems of Star Wars directly. Its story is physically and temporally isolated from the rest of the universe, but unmistakably, it's still Star Wars. It opens up a whole new era for storytelling in some interesting ways, including our first good look at what the Jedi Order looks like in peacetime.

Live streams, TV channel, release dates and more for 2024 show", "body": "The Acolyte is finally here and Star Wars fans are surely wondering one simple question: can I watch it for free?\n\nDisney hit the jackpot when Lucasfilm sold Star Wars for $4.05 billion in 2012. The rich archive brought in old and new viewers and opened the door to endless creative options to explore. Star Wars fans have already seen that with The Mandalorian, Andor, and Ashoka.\n\nThe Acolyte, set to debut on June 4, will be another entry in the ever-expanding franchise, this time transporting fans 100 years before The Phantom Menace, prior to the introduction to any member of the Skywalker family.\n\nIt takes place at the tail end of the High Republic Era, when the Jedi were at the height of their power, and there was peace. It is considered a mystery-thriller that opens up secrets about the Jedi, perhaps even casting some doubts on the long-time Star Wars protagonists.\n\n\"I think [that's] the glory of (creator) Leslye's (Headland) writing,\" Charlie Barnett told Screen Rant regarding the show and his character, Yord Fandar. \"I've had a lot of fun being able to play him because every time I watched Jedi growing up, they were perfect. It was like, 'These are gods!' But seeing the raw edges of their humanity, even going back to some of the movies and seeing Anakin struggle with these things, and Obi-wan talking to him and expressing the same kind of feelings?\n\nWATCH: Star Wars The Acolyte on Disney+\n\n\"I love those blended, human dynamics. Those are the parts of Yord that I really had fun exploring.\"\n\nAlong with Barnett, the show features Lee Jung-Jae, Dafnee Keen, Amandla Stenberg, and Carrie-Anne Moss.\n\nHere is all you need to know about Star Wars The Acolyte, including the price.\n\nStar Wars fans can watch The Acolyte on Disney+.\n\nUnfortunately, Disney+ does not have a free trial. A free trial of seven days ended in June 2020, months after its initial launch.\n\n\"The service was set at an attractive price-to-value proposition that we believe delivers a compelling entertainment offering on its own,\" a Disney spokesperson told CNET at the time.\n\nAnd yet there are still plenty of options for Star Wars fans looking to explore the High Republic. Disney+ has three main plans - only Disney+, a duo with Hulu, or a trio with ESPN+.\n\nHere's a look at each subscription cost per month:\n\nPricing for each plan varies, as subscribers can also choose basic or ad-free plans.\n\nA new opportunity was recently revealed, as Disney+, Hulu, and Max will be offered as a streaming bundle for a single price this summer. There is currently no information on price yet.\n\nBUY NOW: Get the Disney+ bundle to see the latest shows, movies, and live sports\n\nThe first two episodes of The Acolyte airs on June 4 at 9 p.m. ET.

The gold-covered High Republic era has been explored in novels, but alongside Quantic Dreams' upcoming Star Wars Eclipse video game, The Acolyte lets us into the Jedi Order's most prosperous chapter.\n\nRead more: Every Star Wars movie in development\n\nWith a new story to tell and a typically all-star cast, here's everything you need to know about Star Wars: The Acolyte, including its release date, cast, plot, and more.\n\nThe first two episodes of The Acolyte will be released on Disney+ on Wednesday, 5 June, with the remaining episodes set to be released weekly.\n\nAt the 2019 premiere of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Variety asked Russian Doll's Leslye Headland whether she'd like to explore the High Republic era of Star Wars. Headland said she'd jump at the chance if Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy let her, and by Star Wars Day 2020, she was announced as the showrunner and writer of a female-centric Star Wars series.\n\nThe series was later confirmed as The Acolyte, with Headland serving as showrunner, writer, and executive producer on the eight-episode series. Other directors include The Witcher's Alex Garcia Lopez and South Korean-born American filmmaker, Kogonada.\n\nPrincipal photography took place using the StageCraft Volume technology made famous by The Mandalorian, while additional filming started in Portugal around March 2023.\n\nHeading up The Acolyte is The Hunger Games' Amandla Stenberg, who has come a long way from playing the tragic Rue in 2012's first movie. Stenberg appeared alongside the rest of the cast at Star Wars Celebration 2023 (SWC), but so far, we only know she's playing a former Padawan.\n\nFootage aired at the celebration honed in on The Matrix's Carrie-Anne Moss using Force powers, confirming she's some form of Jedi. We know slightly more about who Rebecca Henderson will be playing, with the Russian Doll alumni confirmed as Vernestra Rwoh. The character was created for 2021's The High Republic: A Test of Courage novel and is the youngest Jedi to achieve the rank of Jedi Master.\n\nElsewhere, Squid Game's Lee Jung-jae is an unnamed Jedi Master, who will be joining Logan's Dafne Keen and Russian Doll's Charlie Barnett as young Jedi. Rounding off the cast, there are mystery roles for The Good Place's Manny Jacinto, Revenge's Margarita Levieva, Games of Thrones' Dean-Charles Chapman, and Murder Mystery 2's Jodie Turner-Smith.\n\nThere's a familiar face in the form of Solo: A Star Wars Story's Joonas Suotamo. Although he's not reprising his role as Chewbacca, it looks like he'll be playing a much-hyped Jedi Wookiee.\n\nThe Acolyte's unique place around 100 years before the events of The Phantom Menace makes a cameo from a certain Master Yoda possible, although everyone is staying tight-lipped on that one.\n\nThe Acolyte takes place at an exciting point in the Star Wars timeline, and if you weren't already stoked for its arrival, Headland told fans at SWC 2023 how she pitched it as \"Frozen meets Kill Bill\" to Kennedy. The official synopsis (via Deadline) talks about a former Padawan reuniting with her Jedi Master to solve a series of crimes, which sounds a lot like CSI: Coruscant.\n\nDespite all the Jedi castings, The Acolyte is rumoured to be the franchise's first Sith-centric outing. The name hints at this, as while training Jedi are referred to as Padawans, the Sith equivalent is an Acolyte. Either way, Headland says the series takes place during a time \"the bad guys are outnumbered.\"\n\nRead more: Everything we know about Daisy Ridley's return as Rey\n\nObviously, The Acolyte's setting 100 years before The Phantom Menace takes us further back than we've been before -- until we get James Mangold's Jedi origin movie.\n\nExplaining why The Acolyte is something of an Episode I prequel, Headland told Vanity Fair, \"My question in watching The Phantom Menace was always like, 'Well, how did things get to this point?' How did we get to where a Sith lord can infiltrate the Senate and none of the Jedi pick up on it?\"\n\nHeadland has been heavily inspired by the nixed Expanded Universe of Legends canon, which was largely made redundant when Disney bought Star Wars in 2012. Then again, we've seen the likes of Boba Fett's survival, Grand Admiral Thrawn, and even Palpatine's resurrection (love it or loathe it) brought back into mainline canon, meaning this is an exciting time for fans of the old ways.\n\nIn the Vanity Fair interview, Headland described this period as an \"age of wealth and innovation for the galaxy, with white-clad Jedi inspiring awe and the dark side of the Force seemingly erased from existence.\" We all know how that goes, with Headland saying she was drawn to the idea of who was practising the dark side at this time.\n\nStenberg shed some light on what to expect, warning Collider how the Jedi might not be the heroes we think of them as: \"What does it look like when the Jedi have complete, unchecked power? What are their relationships like to government institutions, you know? And people who have issues with their power, what are they like?\"\n\nThe High Republic era has been growing since its inception in 2021, and with the third phase (Trials of the Jedi) kicking off in November 2023 with George Mann's The Eye of Darkness, there's plenty of reading to catch up on before Star Wars: The Acolyte releases.\n\nWith an all-star cast and new lore to explore, Headland's series will surely make up for the fumbles of George Lucas' prequels.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Not just for telling an original story, but a story devoid of the nostalgia prevalent in most Star Wars releases in general. Consider: every Disney+ Star Wars series to date has operated from a place of familiarity. The Mandalorian and Ahsoka are full of callbacks to and characters from Dave Filoni's wellspring of animated shows. They also consistently reference the original and prequel trilogies while setting up future events in the sequel era. Obi-Wan Kenobi appealed to fans who loved Ewan McGregor's prequel performance in the prequels. Even the critically acclaimed Andor, which prided itself on rejecting fanservice for grownup political melodrama, was still a Rogue One prequel. It used the familiarity of the Galactic Empire's oppressive regime to tell a wide-reaching narrative about rebellion and sacrifice that deepened characters like Cassian Andor and Mon Mothma beyond anyone's wildest expectations. But, at the end of the day, it was a familiar timeline all the same.\n\nThe Acolyte is different. A mystery-thriller created by Russian Doll showrunner Leslye Headland, The Acolyte sidesteps the usual franchise limitations by taking place independently of not only Star Wars events to come but its own source material's backdrop. For those unaware, this is Lucasfilm's first live-action show set in the High Republic era, an ongoing publishing initiative spanning several interconnected books, comics, and audio dramas exploring the Jedi at the height of their influence. Only in recent years has the High Republic been explored in non-literary media like the video game Star Wars Jedi: Survivor and the kids' cartoon Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures. Given its wealth of lore, backstory, and original Jedi/villain characters, it's not unreasonable to worry that such a timeline would be impenetrable to casual fans. Thankfully, The Acolyte is set long after the High Republic books' conclusion and, by extension, a century before Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace. Only Mirialan Jedi Vernestra Rwoh (played by Headland's wife, Rebecca Henderson) serves as the primary link between text and screen. This makes the show accessible to all. Unburdened by expectations of cameos and fanservice, the show can legitimately do things fans won't expect.\n\nThe Acolyte Takes Live-Action Star Wars Further Back Than It's Ever Gone Before\n\nThe Series Introduces Fans to the High Republic in All Its Glory and Darkness\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Acolyte Creator Comments on Yoda Cameo Rumors\n\nThe Acolyte creator comments on the possibility of cameos from Yoda and other Star Wars legacy characters.\n\nThe Acolyte's first two episodes tell an engaging story with fun, original characters. Even better, the premiere also poses a unique The Last Jedi-esque question that exposes the cracks in the Order and foreshadows the long-dormant Sith's plan to orchestrate its downfall: do the Jedi, as an institution, have any right to claim ownership over the Force? Though trailers (mostly) refrained from sharing The Acolyte's biggest reveals, a few major twists are confirmed by the end of the premiere's first episode that carry over into the second. Without spoiling too much, it's the twilight years of the High Republic, a time of peace and prosperity in the Galactic Republic maintained by its heroic and watchful guardians, the Jedi Order.\n\nBut that peace is threatened when a Jedi murder puts the Order on high notice. The culprit is a masked warrior named Mae (Amandla Stenberg), bearing a spiral face marking, a penchant for knives, and some unsanctioned Force-sensitive training. Believing her to be the former Padawan of esteemed Jedi Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae), Rwoh permits Sol, his alien Padawan Jecki Lon (Dafne Keen), and Knight Yord Fandar (Charlie Barnett) to investigate, only to realize things aren't as simple as they seem. Soon, the viewer learns Mae's connection to Sol, fellow Jedi Indara (Carrie-Anne Moss) and other Force-wielders via a childhood tragedy that's come back to haunt them. This is a tragedy key to her dark side rite of passage and a masked individual's goal of ending the Jedi's dominance through this acolyte. Or, at the very least, planting the seeds of their undoing that Darth Sidious will exploit a century later.\n\nCryptic as this synopsis is, it falls neatly in line with Headland's \"Frozen meets Kill Bill\" pitch for the show. Mae has a Jedi kill list she intends to carry out and, over time, viewers gradually learn pieces of the relationship driving this mission toward its endgame. Stenberg certainly rises to the challenge in these scenes, giving her performance enough layers that leave audiences wanting to see how she'll succeed even as the quest points toward a dark path. There's even some levity thrown in during her conversations with trader/potion maker Qimir (Manny Jacinto) in the second episode, which makes the darkness feel a bit less concerning, however temporarily.\n\nThe Jedi of The Acolyte Are Different, Yet Familiar Enough\n\nThe Jedi Are Even More Imperfect Than the Fans May Remember\n\nClose\n\nRelated\n\nStar Wars: Tales of the Empire Review: A Deep Dive into the Dark Side's Soul\n\nMorgan Elsbeth and Barriss Offee's stories take center stage in Star Wars: Tales of the Empire, another fun anthology addition to the franchise.\n\nWhat's more interesting is seeing how this era of Jedi operates. Here, they're less dogmatic than their prequel selves, at ease with discussing emotions and attachments, and more effective in manipulating the Force for combat and interrogation as seen when Sol wields its power on a prisoner in seconds. And yet, traces of that hubris are noticeable. A scene where Yord spooks a Neimoidian with a Mind Trick toes a fine line between being powerful and abusive, while the Jedi's covert approach to this mission reflects their desire to retain high political status within the Republic. They're still the immensely powerful beings of the High Republic novels who protect the innocent in the name of peace. However, the Jedi also have one foot placed in the \"deliberative-verging-on-arrogant\" mindset that fans of the prequels and Star Wars: The Clone Wars will recognize all too well.\n\nSuch Force mastery also leads to some incredible fight scenes. This is an era where Jedi were less inclined to use their lightsabers except as a last resort, and The Acolyte's Wuxia-inspired battles -- inspired as much by The Matrix and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as Genndy Tartakovsky's Star Wars: Clone Wars -- emphasize just how confident the heroes are in their abilities. There's a dance-like quality to Indara and Sol's battles against Mae, blocking and disarming opponents while controlling the combat flow to turn a battle in their favor. Backed up by kinetic and coherent cinematography, these are some of the most unique fights in recent Star Wars memory. They might not occur that frequently, but when a Jedi martial arts fight happens, it's hard not to cheer.\n\nAlongside Stenberg, Lee Jung-jae also delivers a standout performance as Sol. He really feels like a copy of Qui-Gon Jinn or, in the High Republic's case, Stellan Gios, of this era. Sol is wise and powerful yet warmhearted and empathetic. He's an embodiment of the Jedi's best qualities. Lee knows how to change the tone of his presence on a dime and, watching him perform, fans wouldn't believe this was his first English-language role or that Lee learned the language while filming the show. A lot of humor, meanwhile, comes from the back and forth between Jecki and Yord, the former regularly teasing the latter for how often he comes off as a well-intentioned yet prideful stick in the mud. Their character moments aren't quite as strong as Sol's, but they still highlight, once again, how different these Jedi behave compared to what they become in the future.\n\nThe Acolyte Offers a Solid Blend of Old & New Star Wars\n\nThe Series Pays Tribute to Star Wars Mythology While Forging Its Own Path\n\nClose\n\nRelated\n\nThe Acolyte Cast Talks About 'Force Meetings' and Constantly Playing with Lightsabers\n\nCharlie Barnett and Dafne Keen discuss what it was like using lightsabers on the set of The Acolyte and talking about the Force with co-stars.\n\nAesthetically, The Acolyte tries to strike a balance between Andor's grounded ecosystems and Ahsoka's high galactic fantasy. In effect, the premiere's locations are detailed, but not quite as lived-in as the environments of Andor's Ferrix or the Narkina 5 prison. And for a show featuring more Jedi and Jedi temples than any Star Wars project to date, it could benefit from more truly alien-looking background Jedi alongside the human extras. Thankfully, there are still original environments. Planets, starship interiors, robots like the Swiss Army repair droid Pip -- even familiar settings like the Mos Eisley-inspired bar where Mae and Indara duke it out -- all feel reminiscent of an older time and place in Star Wars history, many of which were filmed on location instead of the Volume. High Republic fans in particular will be pleased by Jennifer Bryan's costume design, as she successfully adapted the books' distinct golden Jedi robes while giving them a uniformity that, once again, signifies where the Order's choices are taking them.\n\nStar Wars fans of all eras will probably find something to like about The Acolyte. Despite enduring the usual pre-release outrage from bad-faith YouTubers, Headland's love for this source material is felt all over her early episodes. She sprinkles the adventure with deep nods to the Disney-era and the de-canonized Legends (aka the Star Wars: Expanded Universe) lore alike. For example, a Fugitive-like confrontation over an icy cliff bears a striking resemblance to a similar Ahsoka Tano moment in Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Similarly, Mae tries to fight a Jedi who swore the \"Barash Vow,\" an oath of solitude from the comics with direct ties to the High Republic. She and Qimir even say \"Peace is a lie\" verbatim. These are the opening lines to the Sith Code from the classic Star Wars game Knights of the Old Republic. Best of all, these Easter Eggs never feel overbearing. They are merely extensions of a story that, despite taking some time to show its cards, opens up the Star Wars galaxy in ways even Andor couldn't. Whether The Acolyte will surpass Andor as the best live-action Star Wars show is anyone's guess. That being said, it is a genuinely new show in all the ways that count. For that, fans should be excited.

Expect a fresh take on the Jedi in this series, set 100 years before the Skywalker Saga, where fear is embraced as a humanistic element by Master Sol. The series delves into a complex Jedi Master-Padawan relationship, promising evolving dynamics that will keep viewers hooked.\n\nSet at the end of the High Republic era, a time of peace and prosperity throughout the galaxy, The Acolyte brings a Jedi Master and his former Padawan together. When a new threat to the Jedi and the galaxy at large begins to sink its claws into the galaxy, this former Padawan and Jedi Master will have to work together to try and discover who is at the heart of this power. As they begin to uncover the truth of this insidious darkness, they discover that the power behind this threat is more dangerous than they ever could have predicted.\n\nThe High Republic era takes place long before the Skywalker Saga with the Jedi acting as the peacekeepers Obi-Wan Kenobi once described them to be. It has largely been explored through novels and comics, but The Acolyte will be the first time this new era makes the jump from page to screen. Leslye Headland is able to show her passion for and deep understanding of Star Wars in The Acolyte while also bringing a new genre, mystery thriller, into the franchise, while also delving into a different fighting style, with hand-to-hand martial arts being a prominent part of this series.\n\nRelated Why Do Jedi Wear White Robes In The Acolyte\n\nThe Acolyte's Jedi often wear white robes instead of the brown ones shown in the Star Wars prequel trilogy, and there's a good reason for the change.\n\nScreen Rant interviewed The Acolyte star Lee Jung Jae about his new Star Wars series. He broke down why he wanted to show a different side of the Jedi in The Acolyte with Master Sol and how he stands out from the other Jedi Masters that have been a part of Star Wars. He also teased the complicated relationship between Master Sol and his former Padawan.\n\nLee Jung Jae Explains Why He Wanted Master Sol To Feel Fear In The Acolyte\n\nThe Jedi have often been shown to be without emotion, with Anakin Skywalker being a prime example of how emotions can open them up to corruption from the dark side. However, The Acolyte is set during a time when the Jedi were at the height of their power as peacekeepers across the galaxy. This means that many Jedi are likely to follow the code, but from different perspectives, with Master Sol being a prime example of how the Jedi of this era are different from those during the Skywalker Saga.\n\nLee Jung Jae: I had so many thoughts going into preparing for my role as Master Sol. I initially thought, \"Should I mimic the preexisting Jedi Masters in this huge canon of Star Wars films and shows?\"\n\nBut also you have to realize that The Acolyte occurs in a timeline that's a hundred years previous to anything out right now, so Master Sol represents a past generation. If anything, the Jedi Masters that come after him are his younglings and Padawans. So, I wanted to express something different with Master Sol, and I think it's that he actually feels fear while he is in battle and while he's fighting. I wanted to add this humanistic element to him by expressing fear.\n\nLee Jung Jae Breaks Down The Acolyte's Complex Jedi Master-Padawan Relationship\n\nAt the heart of the story of The Acolyte is the complicated relationship between Master Sol and his former Padawan, who walked away from the Order. Lee Jung Jae teased how this relationship continuously evolved throughout the series and praised Headland's ability to develop this compelling dynamic.\n\nLee Jung Jae: I think director and showunner Leslye Headland does an incredible job developing the connection and the relationship between characters, and she does it with so much depth.\n\nIn terms of the relationship between [them], it develops and changes and morphs every episode. It's really difficult to predict, so when I first read the script, that was the part that I was most curious about. \"What is going to happen between Master Sol and his padawan?\" I think it's really going to make the audience want to binge the show.\n\nAbout The Acolyte Close\n\nA mystery-thriller that explores a new era in Star Wars, the end of the prosperous High Republic era.

The diverse cast and somewhat obvious political and cultural agenda here might raise concerns among fans who are already criticizing Disney's Star Wars . A lack of lightsaber battles and vehicle action in the first half of the season may disappoint viewers.\n\nStar Wars: The Acolyte unfortunately lives up to the hype as a series that will divide fans. Set 100 years before the rise of the Empire during the High Republic, an initially intriguing premise follows a group of Jedi as they investigate a dark Force apprentice targeting specific members of the order. Problems lie in the plot's execution, overall vision of the characters, Star Wars universe, and puzzling inconsistencies in the use of the Force.\n\nThese issues compound into a thornier argument that's sure to gain more traction. The Acolyte has almost no white male actors. A diverse cast primarily of women and people of color engage in storylines with veiled LGBTQ+ themes. This shouldn't matter, especially if the show was riveting. But it's not, and rabid naysayers will pounce on the show as the embodiment of Kathleen Kennedy's tenure as president of Lucasfilm.\n\nSetting Up The Acolyte The Acolyte ActionAdventureDramaSci-Fi 2/5\n\nStar Wars series that take viewers into a galaxy of shadowy secrets and emerging dark-side powers in the final days of the High Republic era.\n\nCast Dafne Keen , Lee Jung-jae , Amandla Stenberg , Jodie Turner-Smith , Joonas Suotamo , Carrie-Anne Moss , Margarita Levieva , Charlie Barnett , Dean-Charles Chapman Seasons 1 Studio Disney+, Lucasfilm Franchise Star Wars Number of Episodes 8 Streaming Service(s) Disney+ Franchise(s) Star Wars Directors Leslye Headland , Alex Garcia Lopez Showrunner Leslye Headland ProsIncredible production design and very cool new settings, ships, and details. ConsA lack of internal logic and a possible political / cultural agenda will surely annoy fans.There's a weird lack of action or excitement.\n\nJournalists were provided the first four of an eight-episode season. The two-episode premiere gives up a big reveal surprisingly early. It's difficult to discuss without spoilers, so we'll try to be vague regarding details. On the planet UEDA, a masked woman asks for the location of a powerful Jedi master. She walks into the bar and challenges her. Jedi don't attack first, so provocation is needed. The attacker doesn't wield a lightsaber. She's proficient in martial arts and throwing daggers. Their battle could have been taken from Wushu Kung Fu movies with wire work and elaborate fight choreography.\n\nThe outcome prompts the Jedi to board a Trade Federation ship in space. Osha (Amandla Stenberg), a former Jedi padawan, is the prime suspect in the crime. She's flabbergasted at the accusation, having left the order years ago. Meanwhile, on Coruscant, her former master, Sol (Lee Jung-jae), is apprised of the situation by Master Vernestra Rwoh (Rebecca Henderson). He can't believe Osha could commit such a crime. Vernestra orders Sol to retrieve Osha, but to do it discreetly. The Jedi Council must not be forced to reveal what happened to the Galactic Senate. Politics are part of the equation.\n\nA Disappointing Lack of Lightsabers and Spaceships\n\nAnyone thirsting for epic lightsaber battles is going to be sorely disappointed in the first four episodes. Showrunner and writer Leslye Headland (Sleeping with Other People, Russian Doll) is clearly a fan of Chinese martial arts cinema. Headland states a reason why the attacker doesn't use blasters or Jedi weaponry. This means the action looks like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which is cool, but has some flawed logic. The Jedi assassin is skilled but a Force neophyte. How can she fight Jedi who literally never have to touch her? Headland again sort of explains why, but it doesn't stand up to scrutiny. A Jedi can freeze your motion. What's the point of punching and kicking an adversary?\n\nThe Acolyte has blockbuster production design. Coruscant, the Jedi robes, and certain settings, like the younglings' training room, are familiar. Everything else should be brand spanking new to most fans. The ships and droids are markedly different. This makes sense because the series takes place before the streamlined vessels of the Clone Wars and geometrically shaped X-wings, TIE fighters, and Star Destroyers of the Empire. The rub is that these new vehicles don't do anything in the first half of the season. There are no dog fights or chases. That's a total letdown after The Mandalorian, Andor, The Book of Boba Fett, and Ahsoka. How can there be no vehicle battles? Headland may be building to some incredible scenes, but this is noticeably lacking.\n\nClose\n\nOsha and the killer have a duality in the Force akin to Star Wars' most popular characters. This is hinted at and then explored in a mystifying origin episode. The idea of light and dark, yin and yang, is a core Star Wars concept that's also central here. It's perplexing that these two primary characters can't sense each other in the Force, or at least not in the beginning. This feels like a bridge too far. Luke and Leia, Kylo Ren and Rey, these characters could feel a connection across time and space once they became aware of each other. How can people trained in the Force, at least to a degree, who are supposedly incredibly powerful, be so isolated? Fans are going to have a field day picking that logic apart.\n\nRelated Could a Legendary Star Wars Sith Lord Finally Make a Live-Action Appearance in The Acolyte? With The Acolyte taking place 100 years before The Phantom Menace, it means a legendary Sith figure might finally make his live-action debut. The True Villain Close\n\nThe Acolyte's open does very little to reveal the identity of the true villain. Master Sol must be a galactic Sherlock Holmes. The High Republic Jedi have no inkling of the Sith, but are capable of searching for younglings strong in the Force. This arrogance eventually gives birth to the Empire. But in this period, it is the driving question of the series. Who controls the assassin? This a-ha moment has to be a whopper and fit securely into Star Wars canon. Headland drops few hints in the first four episodes.\n\nThe show's entertainment value depends on perspective. Those looking for greater cultural representation and Kung Fu Jedi are going to be delighted. Others who foam at the mouth over diversity, equity, and inclusion will be apoplectic as the plot thickens, and when a character is referred to as \"they.\" Anyone watching with an open mind should generally be entertained, but probably find the dialogue a tad simplistic.\n\nThe biggest negative is quite simple -- no character really stands out. Stenberg is a decent actress, but honestly not extraordinary here. Michael Abels deserves a nod for his sinister score. There's definitely effort across the board. Let's hope the season's second half is more compelling.\n\nStar Wars: The Acolyte is a Lucasfilm production. The first two episodes premiere June 4th at 9PM exclusively on Disney+.

Some, like Andor and Ahsoka, actually managed to make it to the platform. Others, like Rangers of the New Republic and A Droid Story have been either canceled or indefinitely delayed. Some, like Lando, were transformed into future movies. Now, four years later, the last of these series is set to premiere -- and it's the most experimental and galvanizing of the lot.\n\nHelmed by Russian Doll co-creator Leslye Headland, The Acolyte finally explores a previously unseen time period in the franchise: the High Republic, which is set a century before everything else we've seen in Star Wars canon. The result is a noir-esque series that paints an entirely different light on the parts of Star Wars that seemingly had been unquestioned and redefines the very standards by which we define what makes Star Wars so good in the first place. It may be the last series in that presentation to come to fruition, but it's the start of a new Star Wars era -- and one that's more than welcome.\n\nFrom the very first second, The Acolyte takes a different approach from any other Star Wars project. Instead of the opening crawl of the movies or the blue maxim texts from The Clone Wars, The Acolyte instead displays two short paragraphs by way of prologue: \"A hundred years before the rise of the Empire, it is a time of peace. The Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic have prospered for centuries without war,\" it reads. \"But in the dark corners of the galaxy, a powerful few learn to use the Force in secret. One of them, a lone assassin, risks discovery to seek revenge.\"\n\nThat's all the hand-holding exposition the viewer gets. From that point on, you're discovering every element alongside these characters. Someone is killing Jedi, and Jedi Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae) is sent to find his former Jedi Padawan (Amandla Stenberg) to clear her name of the crime. The mission barely takes place within the high-powered worlds of the High Republic, so other than the welcome appearance of Vernestra Rwoh (Rebecca Henderson), knowledge of the books won't give you much of a leg up.\n\nInstead, The Acolyte takes after Andor and shows us the parts of Star Wars that are rarely seen: Normal people living their normal lives. When Sol seeks out his former Padawan, he finds her not operating some secret sect of Force training but working a blue-collar job that normally would be performed by a droid. Even as the characters do seek out Jedi, this is an era where even the most distant planets have Jedi stationed to act as a representative of the Republic, allowing for us to see all-new planets and culture, as opposed to just Coruscant. This setting also allows for one of the hallmarks of Star Wars to really be on display: a range of weird-looking aliens who show up only for a scene or two.\n\nWhile the series' marketing has teased the series would be a murder mystery, that isn't entirely true. Within the first five minutes, it's clear who is murdering all the Jedi. Much like an episode of Columbo, the intrigue comes from how the culprit manages to go about her mission, and how loyalties shift. It's a cat-and-mouse chase that is often far more rewarding than a whodunit, bringing to mind the most noir-influenced episodes of The Clone Wars. It isn't about who the killer is but how they are caught.\n\nThis shift in genre allows each character to really shine not as suspects, but as fully formed beings. Manny Jacinto is a particular standout as Qimir, a true neutral accomplice who completely flips the script of a henchman and provides plenty of quips to cut through the bleak tone.\n\nThe highlight of the first half of the season is Episode 3, which abandons the story the two-episode premiere established and instead devotes its runtime to a secluded location years earlier, depicting a part of Force-using culture that's unlike anything we've seen before and showing a part of the Jedi Order that goes even further than just \"training children away from their families.\"\n\nThe Acolyte understands that Star Wars isn't just a box of action figures to play with. It's a sandbox where original stories -- stories that would ostensibly be just as intriguing outside of the Star Wars franchise -- are heightened by the depth the setting brings to them and the depth they bring to that galaxy far, far away. It makes for a standalone story that establishes a new caliber of what Star Wars TV can do.", "source": {"uri": "inverse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inverse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_High_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: The High Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_(Star_Wars)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Droid (Star Wars)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Galactic Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ahsoka (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_in_other_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars in other media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Doll_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Doll (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Kennedy_(producer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kathleen Kennedy (producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Calrissian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lando Calrissian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_Wars_(Star_Wars)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clone Wars (Star Wars)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Henderson_(actress)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebecca Henderson (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_opening_crawl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars opening crawl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coruscant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coruscant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_figure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Action figure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extraterrestrial life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Jacinto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manny Jacinto"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/US_Civil_War", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/US Civil War", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2024/6/4/6a613495/acolyte.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-10", "textStart": 3, "textEnd": 16}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The Acolyte premieres on June 4th and promises to be a thrilling addition to Star Wars. Christensen's continued involvement in Star Wars is wonderful to see.\n\nBeloved Anakin Skywalker actor Hayden Christensen officially welcomed Star Wars: The Acolyte actress Amandla Stenberg to the Star Wars family, and both Christensen's message and Stenberg's reaction were perfect. The Acolyte, premiering on Disney+ on June 4th, is the newest of Star Wars' upcoming shows and will be a thrilling addition to Star Wars movies and TV shows. Set 100 years before the prequel trilogy in the Star Wars timeline, The Acolyte will uncover brand-new details of the Jedi's history, and it's clear the cast and crew are up to the challenge.\n\nThroughout interviews for The Acolyte, the cast and crew of the show have made the depth of their love for and knowledge of Star Wars quite clear, and Mae actress Amandla Stenberg is no exception. In fact, Stenberg is a long-time Star Wars fan, which explains her very sweet reaction to Hayden Christensen's welcome message, posted to Star Wars' official Instagram account.\n\nIn the video, Stenberg can be seen physically shaking, and she hilariously replays the part of the message when Christensen says, \"Hi, Amandla\" multiple times, which is a perfect reminder of how beloved Christensen has become in the Star Wars franchise.\n\nRelated\n\nWhat Time Star Wars: The Acolyte Premiere Releases On Disney Plus\n\nThe Acolyte begins on June 4 with a two-episode premiere, leading many to question when exactly the episodes will begin streaming on Disney+.\n\nIt's Wonderful To See Hayden Christensen As The Face Of Star Wars Again\n\nClose\n\nAnakin Skywalker/Darth Vader\n\nCreated By George Lucas\n\nCast Bob Anderson , Hayden Christensen , James Earl Jones , Matt Lanter , Matt Lucas , Jake Lloyd , David Prowse , Sebastian Shaw\n\nFirst Appearance Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\n\nAlliance Jedi, Sith\n\nHayden Christensen hasn't had the easiest road in Star Wars. Although the prequel trilogy movies, Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith in particular, are now considered among Star Wars' best movies, they received significant criticism when they were first released. In fact, Christensen, along with fellow prequel trilogy actors like Ahmed Best and Jake Lloyd, faced some very harsh backlash.\n\nThankfully, Hayden Christensen is finally getting the love he deserves from audiences, especially since he's reprised his role as Anakin Skywalker in the recent TV shows Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ahsoka. It's clear that Christensen maintained a great love for the franchise and for his character, so it's wonderful to see that he not only remains significantly involved in the franchise but also has in some ways become the face of Star Wars. In part, this video message from Hayden Christensen to Amandla Stenberg is because Stenberg has made her love for Hayden known.\n\nHowever, it also represents Christensen's role in the franchise. He has become such a core part of Star Wars over the years, that few people could be better to welcome newcomers. Stenberg certainly seems to agree, as she was absolutely overcome with emotion when she realized the video was a message from Christensen directly to her.\n\nThis video message was also a perfect way to usher in the newest Star Wars TV show. Although The Acolyte represents a new era of Star Wars, Christensen's well-wishes make it clear that the Star Wars universe will always be connected, even now that the Skywalker Saga has ended. While Star Wars: The Acolyte hasn't yet been released, this video message from Hayden Christensen to Amandla Stenberg was the perfect way to kick off the show's upcoming premiere.\n\nSource: Star Wars\n\nThe Acolyte premieres June 4th on Disney+.\n\nThe Acolyte\n\nSci-Fi\n\nFantasy\n\nThe Acolyte is a television series set in the Star Wars universe at the end of the High Republic Era, where both the Jedi and the Galactic Empire were at the height of their influence.

Exhibiting influences that blend martial-arts movies, young-adult fiction and the detective genre, it's an intriguing if modest addition whose lack of connection to existing canon (through four previewed episodes, anyway) proves both an advantage and disadvantage.\n\nThe show certainly starts with a bang, as a masked assassin with Force-like powers wages an attack on a Jedi master, yielding a fight that owes as much to \"The Matrix\" as earlier \"Star Wars\" fare.\n\nSuspicion quickly turns to Osha (Amandla Stenberg, featured in \"The Hate U Give\" and \"Dear Evan Hansen\"), a young woman who trained as a padawan before leaving the Jedi order. Her sole ally seems to be her former master, Master Sol (\"Squid Game\" Emmy winner Lee Jung-jae), who saved Osha as a child after a tragedy that claimed her family, a bit of history that will figure in unraveling the plot and perpetrator.\n\nEven with an extended flashback episode, the story does move - a legitimate knock on some of the other live-action \"Star Wars\" series, including the well-regarded \"Andor\" - and technically speaking, the action is crisp and impressive.\n\nCreated by \"Russian Doll's\" Leslye Headland (who also directed the first two episodes), \"The Acolyte\" lands in an interesting middle ground in terms of the \"Star Wars\" output for Disney+, alternately feeling dark and edgy like \"Andor,\" action-oriented in a way that resembles \"Ahsoka,\" and awash in the minutia of Jedi politics and lore, a bit like the animated \"Tales of the Jedi.\"\n\nIf that combination of disparate elements benefits the show, the challenge involves having the audience come in with no familiarity or investment in these particular characters, other than a broad understanding of where they exist within the Jedi hierarchy. While Stenberg and Lee Jung-jae largely overcome those headwinds (and give the show a notably diverse foundation), most of the secondary players don't, feeling generic in the process.\n\nThe evolving nature of the theatrical business has shifted the calculus on developing series for streaming, as opposed to movies. Lucasfilm, as keeper of the \"Star Wars\" flame, appears to be gradually finding its way along with everyone else, as evidenced by its big-screen plans for \"The Mandalorian.\" In that context \"The Acolyte\" comes across as a calculated gamble that makes sense as a series and almost surely would have struggled to fill theater seats.\n\nMore than most of these shows, any review of \"The Acolyte\" at this stage feels incomplete. The final episodes will ultimately determine whether this amounts to a significant and perhaps fertile new avenue for \"Star Wars,\" or merely an interesting detour.\n\nUntil then, this tale of the Jedi is entertaining and mildly promising. Whether that opens new doors for Disney/Lucasfilm or leads to a dead end, as a wise little green fellow once said, always in motion is the future.\n\n\"Star Wars: The Acolyte\" premieres June 4 at 9 p.m. ET on Disney+.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

As more clues emerge, they travel down a dark path where sinister forces reveal all is not what it seems....\n\nREVIEW: The reception for Disney-era Star Wars has been uneven, to say the least. While The Force Awakens broke box office records, The Last Jedi became the most divisive sequel of all time, and The Rise of Skywalker pooped the bed for most fans. Still, the anthology films Rogue One and Solo have dedicated fans, which is more than can be said for any of the Disney+ Star Wars series outside of The Mandalorian and Andor. Fans have been once again divided over Obi-Wan and Ahsoka, leading to a muted lead-up to the premiere of The Acolyte. Created by Russian Doll showrunner Leslye Headland, The Acolyte delves over a century before The Phantom Menace to the wholly Disney-created era known as The High Republic. Featuring a diverse cast led by Amandla Stenberg and Squid Game's Lee Jung-jae in his English language debut, The Acolyte benefits from not being held down by Skywalker mythology, which allows it to explore a unique angle to the space opera battles between the dueling sides of the Force, resulting in an exciting and action-packed series that is the most original Star Wars has been in decades.\n\nWhile Disney+ unveils the first two chapters of The Acolyte tomorrow, I have seen the first four episodes of the eight-episode series. Like prior Star Wars series, the episodes vary in length, from the premiere clocking in close to an hour to the fourth episode barely hitting thirty minutes. A lot is packed into each episode, which feels much more cohesive than in prior series, with no subplots or deviations from the main narrative outside of an episode comprised entirely of a flashback. The full trailer for the series gives a good idea of the overall concept of the series, which follows a mysterious warrior who is murdering Jedi and the knights on her trail. The trailer tease looks at the High Republic look, reminiscent of George Lucas' prequels, and what may or may not be a coven of Nightsisters. Much is revealed in the episodes I have seen, which seems to lead to the first canon appearance of a Sith Lord, something Disney took out of continuity when it absorbed Lucasfilm. I will not divulge how this reveal comes to pass, but the series does some great work leading up to the tense moment.\n\nBefore I discuss the show itself, let's talk about the setting of the High Republic. By taking the story back to before the prequel films, Disney and Lucasfilm are exploring an era never seen before the publication of a series of novels over the last few years. If you have read the books, they follow a conflict between the ruling Jedi and an army of pirates known as the Nihil. Rather than focus on that rivalry, The Acolyte is focused on the perception of the Jedi by the masses. Rather than mysterious warriors and mystics, the Jedi are looked at like a totalitarian regime, with many of the average denizens of the galaxy fearing them the way the Empire would eventually be feared. It is an intriguing perspective to see the tribe often seen as examples of the Light Side as villainous. There are elements of beauracracy and control that are seen in these episodes, but the main Jedi embodied in the form of Sol (Lee Jung-jae), his padawan Jecki Lon (Dafne Keen), and new knight Yord Fandar (Charlie Barnett) who are tasked with finding Amandla Stenberg's character. We see other Jedi, including masters Indara (Carrie-Anne Moss), Kelnacca (Chewbacca actor Joonas Suotamo), and Vernestra Rwoh (Rebecca Henderson), who are examples of the best the Order has to offer.\n\nAmandla Stenberg portrays twin sisters, something not revealed in the trailers but has since been made known through interviews, named Osha and Mae. The twins represent the two sides of the Force, one serving as Sol's padawan and the other a darker master. The sisters are the daughters of Mother Aniseya, the leader of a coven of Force witches who may or may not be Nightsisters. We also meet Qimir (Manny Jacinto), a smuggler connected to the Dark Side. All of these characters are immediately interesting to watch. Their introductions have similarities to Star Wars stories from the past with the signature scene wipes, an array of new alien designs as well as familiar ones (nice appearance by the Trade Federation in the first episode), new Droids like Pip, and planets like Coruscant as well as new worlds handily named with on-screen graphics, something rarely done in Star Wars projects before. The action is also quite something. While the Jedi are featured heavily, and we see a lot of lightsabers, the combat uses more martial arts than I was expecting, giving the series a break from the swordplay and gunfire that has consumed the franchise. The fight scenes are well-choreographed and complement the storyline and era.\n\nIn addition to creating the series and writing the first episode, Leslye Headland helmed the two opening chapters of The Acolyte before handing over directing duties to Kogonada (After Yang, Pachinko), Alex Garcia Lopez (Cowboy Bebop, The Witcher), and Hanelle Culpepper (Star Trek Discovery) who each direct two episodes. The cinematic quality of The Acolyte sometimes leaves something to be desired, with many outdoor scenes clearly shot on a soundstage, taking away from the scale Star Wars usually has. But, the directors evoke solid performances from the cast, who help make this fantastical science fiction world seem tangible. While Headland oversaw a writing staff of eleven scribes for an eight-episode series, some of their dialogue does not rise above what George Lucas penned himself on the prequel films. Yes, it can be a bit silly, but most of the dialogue works within the confines of this mythology. The solid score by Michael Abels and the cinematography by James Friend and Chris Teague accentuates this. This crew overcomes any limitations on the production design by focusing on the characters.\n\nThe Acolyte boasts a solid performance from Amandla Stenberg in the lead roles and an impressive English language debut for Lee Jung-jae. With supporting performances from Jodie Turner-Smitih and Margarita Levieva that I will not spoil here, The Acolyte has far different stakes than any Star Wars project before. By taking a darker angle that involves revenge and murder, this series explores sides of the galaxy we have not seen to this degree on screen before. Death is nothing new in Star Wars, but Leslie Headland's series looks at it in a unique way for the franchise. While I have only seen the first half of the series and have been burned by the back half of prior Star Wars shows, the consistency of these opening chapters has me more invested in what comes next. I appreciate that The Acolyte is a new era for live-action Star Wars that presents a challenge for audiences to invest in, but this is old school Star Wars: action-packed, full of unique and intriguing characters, and setting up a story that we do not know. The Acolyte represents a new chapter in the Star Wars mythos that will be very fun to explore.", "source": {"uri": "joblo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "JoBlo's Movie Emporium"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_maidy@joblo.com", "name": "Alex Maidy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_High_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: The High Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ahsoka (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Doll_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Doll (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Courtship_of_Princess_Leia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Courtship of Princess Leia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_opera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space opera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucasfilm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Barnett_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Barnett (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joonas_Suotamo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joonas Suotamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie-Anne_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carrie-Anne Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Lucas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dafne_Keen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dafne Keen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita_Levieva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Margarita Levieva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kogonada", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kogonada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Jacinto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manny Jacinto"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.joblo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/acolyte-review-starwars-fb.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Sometimes it's rousing, epic and feel-good (\"Return of the Jedi.\") And sometimes it's just weird, silly and unsatisfying (prequel \"The Phantom Menace\").\n\nSo perhaps it's only fitting that the prequel to that prequel, Disney+'s new series \"The Acolyte\" (streaming Tuesdays, 9 EDT/PDT, \u2605\u2605 out of four) falls into that last category. Full of logical fallacies, hokey dialogue and nonsensical plots, \"Acolyte\" feels entirely of a piece with the worst elements of the prequel trilogy, which many hardcore fans love to hate, even 25 years later. The series, created by \"Russian Doll\" producer Leslye Headland, certainly has ambition as it tries to tell a showy story about the mythology and magic of the Jedi and the Force. But even the best of intentions can go awry.\n\nAll the sci-fi/fantasy jargon, dramatic costumes, brightly colored lightsabers, fancy hairdos and ominous villains Headland can stuff into \"Acolyte\" can't make a good story on their own. There has to be some emotion and depth to the characters and their woes. There has to be more than perfunctory plot points. There has to be a sense of adventure and wonder. And there has to be something that captures the feeling of \"Star Wars,\" not just the aesthetics. \"Acolyte\" doesn't have it, no matter how hard it tries.\n\nA century before Obi-Wan (Ewan McGregor) and Qui-Gon (Liam Neeson) felt a disturbance in the Force in \"Phantom,\" a rogue \"Force-user\" is hunting and killing Jedi masters across the galaxy. At first thought to be former Jedi Padawan Osha (Amandla Stenberg), it turns out the Jedi killer is her twin sister, Mae (also Stenberg), long presumed dead after a mysterious fire when the two were children. The blaze resulted in the death of their family and Osha being taken into the Jedi order. (This \"twist\" is revealed in the first few minutes of the series premiere.)\n\nDetermined to bring in Mae or Osha (or both) and figure all this out is Jedi Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae, \"Squid Game\"), who trained Osha before she left the order. He's joined by a handful of other colorful and utterly forgettable Jedi: Is Mae out for revenge for what she believed happened to her family all those years ago? Or is there a more nefarious power brewing in the galaxy? There's the pickle, and a flashback episode featuring Jodie Turner-Smith as the girls' mother, Aniseya, and the leader of a \"witch coven\" doesn't provide many answers.\n\nIt's all a little too complex (witches, in this galaxy?) and a little too simple (ah yes, the old evil-twin twist). The reveal of Mae comes too early in the series, removing much of the mystery element that makes \"Acolyte\" unique in the ever-expanding \"Star Wars\" canon. There are too many characters with too many quirks to make them stand out from one another. You'll be hard-pressed to tell the difference between various aliens paired with Charlie Barnett's Jedi knight Yord.\n\nBut \"Acolyte\" has its moments. The final scene of Episode 4 (the last made available for review) captures a real sense of horror and fear when a villain is introduced. Perhaps that bodes well for the final four episodes in the season. Jung-jae and Stenberg make a great pair, and the former nicely proves his acting chops in English (he won an Emmy for \"Squid,\" which was entirely in Korean). And it's always nice to see \"Matrix\" star Carrie Ann Moss, who appears briefly in two episodes, wielding a lightsaber as if she's done it all her life.\n\nCertainly a segment of the \"Star Wars\" fandom will devour every frame of \"Acolyte.\" For them, the complex mythology is the meat of the meal, not a frilly and silly garnish. But superfans can forgive a lot of sins. Some genre TV series can make their mythology and internal world-building more interesting and engaging than this (Amazon's late, great \"The Expanse,\" among many others). As it stands, though, the Jedi lore is obtuse and dull. It needs spicing up.\n\nLike the young Padawans (the \"Star Wars\" term for students or apprentices) that are omnipresent in the series, \"Acolyte\" has a great deal of potential. \"The Mandalorian\" made \"Star Wars\" a Western. \"Andor\" made it a revolution. \"Acolyte\" could have made it a great work of fantasy and mystery.\n\nBut mostly it's a great big sigh.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acolyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Acolyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Doll_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Doll (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magic (supernatural)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lightsaber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(narrative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plot (narrative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galaxy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodie_Turner-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jodie Turner-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Neeson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liam Neeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewan_McGregor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ewan McGregor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Barnett_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Barnett (actor)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/n4DvrDU87fwbjcJc1fcqww--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzQ7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_entertainment_893/da8d46cd888387b1d3fbe9418383963f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Across books, comics, games, and shows we have seen the franchise engage with the road that brought us from the time of Revenge of the Sith to the start of A New Hope -- and a little beyond that, with The Mandalorian's exploration of the years after Return of the Jedi. Now, the saga is turning its eyes back further than it's gone on screen before: and in doing so, it's charting a whole new era of potential.\n\nThe first four episodes of The Acolyte take audiences back approximately 100 years before the events of The Phantom Menace, to a time that has been established, in Star Wars' vast chronology, as the tail end of a period known as the \"High Republic.\" Explored up to the point through a transmedia series of novels and comics (as well as the animated children's series Young Jedi Adventures), The Acolyte marks the first time this period of Star Wars has been depicted in live-action -- a time period defined by the socio-political apex of two of the most important institutions of Star Wars' prequel era, the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic. But the first immediately intriguing thing about The Acolyte is its relative disinterest in portraying that apex: instead, it is a show that lingers in shadow, and makes its heart in an exploration of how the apex of these increasingly twinned institutions can shape and push people down paths that will eventually lead to those institutions' decline and downfall as seen by the time of the prequel trilogy.\n\nIt wouldn't be fair to The Acolyte to cast it, based on that idea, as akin to some form of Andor for the prequel age. It's a show that pokes and prods at the systems that shape its setting in a similar manner as to how that particular series examined the structure of Empire and its impact upon the average citizen of the galaxy. But The Acolyte is much more interested in establishing a personal drama as it weaves mystery and intrigue around one very specific set of characters: a group of Jedi, targeted by a mysterious assassin named Mae (Amandla Stenberg), who seeks vengeance against the Order for reasons both systemic and personal. When an investigation is opened up into the murder of one of those Jedi, on the belief that the assailant was not just a wielder of the Force, but potentially a former member of the Order, the Jedi press Master Sol (Squid Game's Lee Jung-Jae) into action in an attempt to uncover the culprit before the Order's enemies -- perceived or otherwise -- can learn of this embarrassing vulnerability. The Acolyte sets the stage for what, on the surface, could be seen as any kind of typical Star Wars story of good and evil, light and dark, even in the relatively unexplored format of the mystery genre for the franchise. But where the series truly shines is the much greyer picture it paints, thanks to a cast of heroes and villains that are all similarly much more nuanced, flawed, and human than a descriptor like \"heroes\" and \"villains\" can really imply.\n\nEvery main character of The Acolyte, from the shadowy Mae and her allies in taking down the Jedi from their lofty perch, to the strongest and most noble members of that Order, is given the space and the exploration to be much more than just archetypes of Light and Dark. Mae is both the antagonist force that drives The Acolyte's central mystery -- why are these Jedi being targeted, and who trained her the ways of the dark side? -- and also a figure given space to be sympathetic and understood in her reasons for standing against the Order. The Jedi involved in bringing her in, from Master Sol and his apprentice Jecki (Logan's Dafne Keen), to the by-the-book Knight Yord Fandar (Charlie Barnett), are given space to be far from perfect members of their glimmering Order, whether haunted by events in their past or simply by being allowed to be brusque, annoying, or simply flawed in other way. Everyone in The Acolyte is given a depth and humanity that makes those flaws interesting catalysts for conflict, either as part of that central mystery, or among themselves, or in the service of the biggest question the show wants to ask: what is the nature of the Force as a power and spiritual identity, and who gets to dictate how it's wielded, interpreted, and ordained, Jedi or otherwise?\n\nBut while the series is certainly intrigued about those headier ideas -- and things like what it means that a Jedi can be a total asshole, or that a dark assassin can be driven by noble goals or by their love for family and friends -- and sets the stage across its front half to confront those ideas head on down the line, above all The Acolyte is a personal drama, made all the more compelling not by how it connects to the wider universe of Star Wars or these big picture ideas, but by its cast of compellingly messy central characters. It becomes clear early on that there is much more to both Mae's plans and Sol's investigations than either party is really aware of at first, and both characters are much more connected to the events driving the narrative than they initially thought -- and that realization pulls The Acolyte down from those macro-scaled questions of institutions and ideology into a tight, character-driven mystery. It's an early shift from what you expect the series is about into something else, but it's a shift that keeps you intrigued, especially when the mystery twists itself from having you ask why these characters are involved, but how they connect to each other, why they've been shaped into the people that they are, and really, just what their deal is as flawed and damaged people.\n\nThis intimate scale gives The Acolyte a feeling that is quite unlike anything else the prior Disney+ Star Wars series have had to offer, less keen as it is on answering questions about the setting and how one major event in the canon connects to the other -- for all the big deal that this is the first live-action Star Wars show set during the High Republic, the show is uninterested in trying to figure out how many of those books and comics you've read, and more concerned with introducing you to its characters than it is this particular era of the Star Wars world. While it remains to be seen just how compellingly the series ultimately answers the questions it raises of either its characters or the systems that have shaped them, the potential is here across these first four episodes to deliver an excellent first step into a wide new era of Star Wars ripe for exploration.", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Young_Jedi_Adventures", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_original_trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars original trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_(radio_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars (radio series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galactic Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sith", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Status quo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revenge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Barnett_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Barnett (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dafne_Keen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dafne Keen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/f79885422de46a24b87884213f1fd537.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Lead by a talented ensemble cast, the series blends traditional and contemporary fighting styles inspired by real-world martial arts. Despite facing backlash, The Acolyte is set to premiere on June 4, 2024, offering fans a fresh take on the Star Wars universe.\n\nThe upcoming Star Wars Disney+ series, The Acolyte, is looking to take the franchise's fight choreography to the next level, according to a new BTS featurette. Set 100 years before Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace, The Acolyte shows the end of the High Republic era, as a string of mysterious murders are tied to a young Padawan who abandoned the Jedi Order. The series features a whole new cast of characters, led by an ensemble cast including Carrie-Anne Moss, Lee Jung-jae, Amandla Stenberg, Manny Jacinto, Dafne Keen, and Dean-Charles Chapman. As well as new characters, The Acolyte also introduces audiences to a whole new kind of Jedi fight choreography.\n\nIn a BTS video shared on X/Twitter, showrunner Leslye Headland shared her excitement about audiences witnessing the show's impressive fights. She shared her vision for the show's action, saying \"It was very important to me that the show feel visceral and that the fight sequences feel jaw-dropping.\" The video features behind-the-scenes footage of the cast and crew shooting some fight scenes, including a tense duel between Indara (Moss) and Mae (Stenberg). Carrie-Anne Moss is no stranger to science fiction universes, famously portraying Trinity in the Matrix franchise, and some of her fights in The Acolyte feel reminiscent of The Matrix's iconic hand-to-hand combat. Moss described working on The Acolyte, saying:\n\n\"Training for The Acolyte was really challenging. Today I feel a tad like a truck hit me.\"\n\nRelated George Lucas Says Star Wars Changed Dramatically After the Sale to Disney: 'I Was the Only One Who Knew What Star Wars Was' George Lucas sold Lucasfilm to Disney back in 2012 for a staggering $4.05 billion which led to the Star Wars sequel trilogy and other titles.\n\n2nd Unit Director, Chris Cowen also outlined some of the real world influences on The Acolyte's fight scenes. Traditional martial arts have always been a staple of the Star Wars franchise, with the first duels in A New Hope being inspired by Samurai cinema and the Japanese art of Kendo. According to Cowen, The Acolyte blends traditional and contemporary fighting styles, featuring \"Tae-Kwon Do, Karate, Krav Maga, [and] Western Boxing.\"\n\nThe Acolyte Has Already Faced Backlash from Fans\n\nAs the old(ish) saying goes, no one hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans. This is especially apparent when it comes to female characters in the franchise. A portion of the fan base is convinced that a strong female character is the most absurd aspect of a franchise set in outer space with aliens, lightsabers, and space cults. Social media platforms like X/Twitter and Instagram have given these fans a platform to share their opinions, and they rarely hold back.\n\nLucasfilm president, Kathleen Kennedy (a frequent target of these disgruntled fans) recently addressed the pressure the show is under, and the unfair online abuse women working on Star Wars projects receive. Kennedy said:\n\n\"Operating within these giant franchises now, with social media and the level of expectation -- it's terrifying. I think Leslye [Headland] has struggled a little bit with it. I think a lot of the women who step into Star Wars struggle with this a bit more.

However, when they hit the mark, the result is sublime. Star Wars: The Acolyte exemplifies this, seamlessly blending traditional Star Wars elements with the limitless possibilities of the franchise -- read on for our full review of the first four episodes.\n\nStar Wars: The Acolyte review\n\nThe first episode of Star Wars: The Acolyte sets the tone with a strong action sequence between Indara (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Mae (Amandla Stenberg) that immediately captures attention. As the story unfolds, viewers are drawn into a mystery that pits the wise Jedi Master Sol against a formidable warrior from his past.\n\nThe storytelling leaves you eager to see what follows, skillfully hinting at potential plotlines while keeping the central mystery intact. Nonetheless, Sol emerges as a classic Jedi lead, balancing intense emotions with his deep compassion and formidable warrior skills.\n\nDiverse use of the Force\n\nEpisode 2 of The Acolyte shines a spotlight on the diverse ways the Force can be utilized, maintaining a well-paced narrative that continues to build intrigue.\n\nThe highlight of the episode is the tense standoff between Sol (Lee Jung-jae) and Mae, a mysterious young woman believed to be dead. Their encounter is charged with emotion and sets the stage for Mae's complex backstory. The episode concludes with the grand appearance of Kelnacca (Joonas Suotamo), a solitary Wookiee Jedi, adding to the series' rich character dynamics.\n\nUnveiling Mae's past\n\nIn Episode 3, the series delves into Mae's tragic past, providing much-needed context for her quest for vengeance. Also, this episode effectively fleshes out the character, revealing the motivations driving her relentless pursuit. Another thing is that the backstory is both compelling and heart-wrenching, making Mae a character you can't help but root for, despite her dark path.\n\nThe Looming Threat\n\nEpisode 4 escalates the stakes as a real threat looms over our protagonists. The introduction of Mae's mysterious trainer brings the traditional \"big baddie\" vibe, reminiscent of classic Star Wars villains.\n\nDespite their absence for the majority of the first 4 episodes, this shadowy figure adds a sense of urgency and danger, leaving viewers on edge and uncertain about who will ultimately prevail. Also, the episode masterfully builds tension, making it clear that the conflict is far from over and the journey ahead is fraught with peril.\n\nThe 5 characters that shine\n\nSol - As a wise and highly respected Jedi Master, Sol embodies the balance of intense emotions and deep compassion. His journey is a testament to the timeless appeal of the Jedi ethos, defending those who cannot defend themselves with unwavering resolve.\n\nIndara - Master Indara's presence exudes authority and control. Her command over her Force abilities and her reluctance to seek combat unless necessary make her a formidable and intriguing character.\n\nMae - A tragic figure swept into a sinister mystery, Mae's quest for vengeance is a central pillar of the series. Her backstory and motivations are intricately woven into the plot, making her a deeply complex and sympathetic character.\n\nKelnacca - The Wookiee Jedi Kelnacca, a loner living a solitary life, adds a unique dynamic to the series. His entrance at the end of Episode 2 is a moment of pure excitement for fans.\n\nYord Fandar (Charlie Barnett) - As a rule-following Jedi Knight and guardian from the Jedi Temple, Yord's discipline and dedication to the Republic highlight the different facets of Jedi life, adding depth to the narrative.\n\nShould you watch Star Wars: The Acolyte?\n\nThe Acolyte is a promising addition to the Star Wars saga, honoring the traditions of the franchise while introducing a refreshing spin.\n\nThe series captures the essence of classic Star Wars storytelling -- complete with action, mystery, and deeply complex characters -- while exploring new themes and character dynamics. The first four episodes lay a strong foundation, leaving fans eagerly awaiting the next chapter in this thrilling journey.\n\nFurthermore, with its compelling characters, intriguing plot, and seamless blend of tradition and innovation, The Acolyte is a must-watch for any Star Wars fan. Disney has once again proven that when it gets it right, the result is nothing short of spectacular.\n\nStar Wars: The Acolyte will premiere on June 4 on Disney+.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "burtland_dixon@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Burtland Dixon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie-Anne_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carrie-Anne Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joonas_Suotamo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joonas Suotamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wookiee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wookiee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Barnett_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Barnett (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_impact_of_Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cultural impact of Star Wars"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/The-Acolyte-review-Star-Wars-Disney-series-5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 4484, "textEnd": 4490}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

As more clues emerge, they travel down a dark path where sinister forces reveal all is not what it seems....\n\nWith this series being set hundreds of years before the events of \"The Phantom Menace\", it has a unique feel to it; on the one hand, it feels very fresh and exciting because it has all-new characters, visiting new locations and telling us an interesting new story. But on the other hand, it has that familiar vibe to it, in terms of how it looks like Star Wars. It takes many of the visual elements from the prequel trilogy, without feeling like they are on the volume the entire time.\n\nMoving the series away from the Skywalker Saga also completely frees up the storytelling to go in a different direction, and probably more importantly, it's a fresh slate. Anyone can come into this series without ever watching Star Wars before, and it's a self-contained story. There's the odd little Easter Egg here and there that fans are going to pick up on, but there's no big cameo of the week type deal that we saw with some of the other Disney+ shows. That's not to say they might not have a cameo or two later in the series (I'd be surprised if Yoda doesn't pop up at some point!), but in the first half of the series that I've seen, it has a very different vibe to \"Ahsoka\" or \"The Mandalorian\", which often felt like a little cameo heavy at some points.\n\nFans of \"Andor\", however, might be a little disappointed that the tone of \"The Acolyte\" feels more like the prequel trilogy; this isn't a gritty, down-to-earth, serious drama series.\n\n\"The Acolyte\" kicks off with an incredible fight scene involving Carrie-Anne Moss, who plays the Jedi Knight Indara, which blends the lines between a Jedi and the Matrix, as we've seen fight scenes in the past, but rarely ever involving lightsabers and the use of hand to hand combat. It's different but very cool. There is another fight later on in the series involving Sol, who fights similarly but also a little differently, which again highlights the difference between this series and other shows and films.\n\nOne thing I didn't want to get into too much in this early review is that not everything about \"The Acolyte\" is as it seems, and the marketing certainly is \"forcing\" you in one directly but moves in a slightly different way, and I love it! I've no clue where this story is going and that's so exciting. With the last few shows like \"Obi-Wan\", \"Andor\" and even \"The Mandalorian\", you know where the storyline is going to eventually end up, since they are all set between different movies.\n\nYes, we know what's going to happen to the Jedi and the Sith during the Clone Wars era, but with it being hundreds of years away from this series, the story can go wherever it likes, bring in villains and heroes, etc., with no regard to how it might connect to the Skywalker family. It's so refreshing!\n\nAmandla Stenberg is fantastic in this series and you'll see why when you see the show, as she's got plenty to work with, and it's fun to see Star Wars take a different approach, but without spoiling the first episode, it's hard to say why she's so good in it.\n\nThere are some issues with \"The Acolyte\" that I'd like to mention. The big one is that the episodes do feel rather short, with a couple barely half an hour long. This feels like a missed opportunity to expand the universe a little more, though it does mean the show's pace is pretty snappy. I don't usually like to complain about show lengths, especially for Star Wars or Marvel shows, as I'd rather they just be the length they need to be, rather than being forced to be 44 minutes or an hour long, but a little more would always be nice!\n\nI'm also going to complain about the cliffhanger at the end of the fourth episode, not because it was bad or anything, but just because it was so good I literally swore out loud seconds after the credits rolled because I suddenly realised I'd have to wait weeks to see what happens next! A good cliffhanger isn't easy to do, but when it's done right, it can be very powerful.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the first half of \"The Acolyte.\" It's so refreshing to have a completely new era for a Star Wars series to explore. I can't wait to see the rest of the series, and it's fun to feel there's something new happening in the world of Star Wars for the first time in a while that doesn't rely on everyone watching multiple animated series to know what's going on.\n\nRating - 4.5 Out Of 5\n\nThe first two episodes of \"Star Wars: The Acolyte\" arrives on Disney+ on Tuesday 4th June 2024 at 6pm PT/9pm ET, with a new episode being released each week.", "source": {"uri": "whatsondisneyplus.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "What's On Disney Plus"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_prequel_trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars prequel trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Easter egg (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ahsoka (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie-Anne_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carrie-Anne Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Matrix (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lightsaber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yoda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywalker_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skywalker family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_Wars_(Star_Wars)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clone Wars (Star Wars)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://whatsondisneyplus.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/acoylte-review.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

There isn't a Skywalker to be seen (at least in the four episodes I've watched), or any characters you've met before. It's not trying to fill gaps in pre-existing lore. It's simply a kickass Star Wars story, with perfectly executed action choreography, a bevy of talented actors and a story that feels genuinely fresh. And, best of all, you don't have to be caught up on The Book of Boba Fett or 208 episodes of animated shows to enjoy it.\n\nA major reason why The Acolyte feels so unique is that it comes from Leslye Headland, a writer and director with no prior association to Star Wars. As the co-creator of Russian Doll, she proved that she could juggle a fantastical premise with rich, multi-layered characters. Her outsider perspective is exactly what Star Wars needs to avoid feeling stale. It's the counterpoint to the obsessive world-building from Dave Filoni, the George Lucas disciple behind The Clone Wars and many of the franchise's TV shows.\n\nThe Acolyte begins with a scene right out of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: A lone warrior enters a bar, presents themself to the most powerful person there, and demands a fight. What follows is an expertly choreographed array of kicks, flips and Force-thrown knives, as the Jedi Master Indara (Carrie-Anne Moss), deflects her young attacker with effortless grace. \"Who trained you?\" She asks, echoing Michelle Yeoh's first confrontation with Zhang Ziyi in Ang Lee's film. (Yes, I got chills upon hearing that.)\n\nI won't say too much about the plot of The Acolyte, but briefly it involves a former Jedi trainee, Mae (Amandla Stenberg), who is suspected of committing a series of crimes. Her former Jedi Master, Sol (played by Squid Game star Lee Jung-jae), is tasked with tracking her down and figuring out what's really going on. They're also joined by his new padwan trainee, played by Dafne Keen (Logan), and the over-eager, by-the-book Jedi Master Yord (Charlie Barnett).\n\nWhat makes The Acolyte truly intriguing is the way it explores the role of the Jedi and their chokehold (heh) on Force powers in the Star Wars universe. Are they actually the keepers of the peace, or a group of fanatical monks aligned with whoever happens to be in power? Is there a legitimate path beyond the Jedi for someone Force-capable like Mae, without turning to the Dark Side? I don't know how the series will answer these questions, but their existence alone is fascinating, as the broader franchise has seemed incapable of interrogating itself in recent years.\n\nAfter The Rise of Skywalker brought the sequel trilogy to a disappointing close, Star Wars has mostly been mining nostalgia on Disney+ with varying levels of success. The Mandalorian started strong, but became bogged down with repetitive storytelling. The Book of Boba Fett was mostly forgettable, except for when it served as a bridge between season's two and three of The Mandalorian. Nobody needed the Obi-Wan series, but it was nice to see Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen back in action.\n\nAhsoka and Andor were the most uniformly successful of the Star Wars TV projects, but they both also had to wrestle with pre-existing storylines. To truly understand Ahsoka, you needed to have watched over 200 episodes of The Clone Wars and Rebels, as well as several shorts and episodes from other Star Wars shows. Andor was the most mature vision of the franchise we've ever seen, thanks to creator Tony Gilroy (Michael Clayton, The Bourne Identity), but it was also a slow burn narratively. (And it was still about a character we briefly met in Rogue One, itself a prequel story about finding the Death Star's blueprints.)\n\nThe only baggage The Acolyte has to deal with is the trail of middling Star Wars shows behind it. That alone may turn off some audiences. But I'm hoping people recognize it as a fresh start, a world beyond Skywalkers and nostalgia bait. The Acolyte is a reminder of what makes Star Wars great: exciting and pulpy storytelling on a cosmic scale.", "source": {"uri": "engadget.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "engadget"}, "authors": [],

Find out more about our reviews policy.\n\nFrom the start, The Acolyte has positioned itself as something brand new for Star Wars. Yes, it has all the hallmarks of the franchise - Jedi wielding lightsabers, the Force, and complicated Master-Padawan relationships. But it's also set 100 years before the prequels on the Star Wars timeline, is billed as a murder mystery, and promises to investigate the question of power and who can wield it, rather than the binary light vs. dark that much of Star Wars revolves around. You might, then, be expecting a Jedi show in the vein of Andor, Star Wars' gritty political thriller.\n\nUltimately, though, the first four episodes of The Acolyte play more like Andor meets Obi-Wan Kenobi. The new show revolves around dark sider Mae (an excellent Amandla Stenberg), who has a past with Lee Jung-jae's kindly Jedi Master Sol. Jedi are being killed off one by one, and it's up to Sol and a handful of others to get to the bottom of the crime spree.\n\nThe show opens with an impressive duel between Mae and Carrie-Anne Moss's Jedi character Indara. Rather than clashing lightsabers, though, we're instead treated to an inventive fight that involves knives, the Force, and some martial arts-inspired choreography. The sequence is a very effective hook, and a plot twist I won't spoil here soon flips the show on its head. It's an entirely engaging opening to a show that seems poised to question apparent truths about Star Wars as we know it.\n\nThe issue, though, is that it feels like The Acolyte is treading ground the prequels already decisively mapped. We know the Jedi are slow to act, indecisive, bogged down by bureaucracy, and can't handle Padawans struggling with grief and attachments (hello, Anakin Skywalker) - that's pretty comprehensively covered in episodes 1 to 3. So, what new ground is The Acolyte going to break? At the moment, it's not entirely clear. That's not to say the show won't forge its own identity going forward, of course - it's just that, from the first four episodes, it all feels a little familiar.\n\nStill, though, there's much to enjoy in the new show. Lee is a stand-out as the wise, gentle Sol, who seems to have his own, more unconventional ideas on attachment. Dafne Keen is also delightful as the matter-of-fact Jecki, Sol's Padawan, while Charlie Barnett is lots of fun as the cocky Yord. Stenberg, though, is clearly the star - a lot is required of her to make her character work, and her performance is seamless and utterly convincing.\n\nThe show's billing as a murder mystery is also something of a red herring, as viewers will soon discover, but the true mystery of the series revolves around the shadowy Sith training Mae. The only clue we have so far is that Mae and Manny Jacinto's Qimir refer to the figure as \"he,\" so let the theorizing commence. We catch only glimpses of him in the first four episodes, and he's a compelling mystery - mostly thanks to the tasks he's assigned Mae to complete (a masked, dark sider villain is nothing new for Star Wars, after all).\n\nMae is also an intriguing character in her own right, though an extended flashback to her past unfortunately rushes through a fairly pivotal moment in her turn to the dark side, which undermines her story a little. Still, what we do see of her backstory is intriguing, with Jodie Turner-Smith playing a fascinating mother figure - not only of Mae, but of a coven of Force-using witches (and they have their own, intriguing ideas about Star Wars' cosmic energy).\n\nThe Acolyte also just looks excellent, with its commitment to sprawling practical sets creating worlds that feel real and lived-in, as opposed to the sometimes shallower backgrounds of the Volume.\n\nThough we go to the familiar Coruscant, too, the visual language of the planet and the Jedi Order is different - the Jedi look much cleaner and shinier than we're used to, and even the Jedi Temple looks lighter from the outside. Lightsabers are not drawn very often, but when they are, they look excellent. This gives the iconic weapon a certain weight, too - when a lightsaber ignites, you know the situation is serious.\n\nAll in all, The Acolyte gets off to a solid start. While it loses some momentum, it quickly regains its footing with a seriously agonizing cliffhanger arriving at the midpoint of the series. Time will tell if The Acolyte manages to stick the landing throughout the back half of the season, but, for now, it's an engrossing - if not as original as promised - adventure in the galaxy far, far away.\n\nThe Acolyte arrives on Disney Plus with a double season premiere this June 4 in the US and June 5 in the UK.

Enter The Acolyte.\n\nPart mystery, part thriller, part crime procedural, the new series starring Amandla Stenberg and Lee Jung-jae is galaxies away from any recent Star Wars show - and all the better for it.\n\nIt's no secret now that Stenberg plays two different characters, Osha and Mae, sisters who were separated by tragedy when they were young.\n\nWhen tragedy also hits the Jedi Order, Jedi Master Sol (Lee) is charged with investigating - leading him to reunite with Osha, his former Padawan who left the Jedi Order. Despite such a long time apart, the pair have to work together - and soon discover they're dealing with very sinister forces.\n\nThe Acolyte would work on its own as a mystery thriller, but is made all the more interesting by being embedded into an important but as of yet unexplored part of Star Wars history.\n\nShowrunner Leslye Headland is the perfect choice to helm the show, having proven her skills in the likes of Russian Doll. She masterfully crafts a suspenseful tale, while easily taking on the terrifying task of setting her story in uncharted territory: a period of Star Wars history that's never been put to screen before.\n\nOf course, it's not just Headland's story that sets The Acolyte apart. Stenberg, who's no stranger to a sci-fi hit after her role in The Hunger Games, is a force of nature as she seamlessly brings to life two polar opposite sisters, both still reeling from the trauma of their childhoods.\n\nSquid Game star Lee is another standout as the sensitive and protective Jedi Master desperate to get to the bottom of what's happening. Both actors have made it clear that they're huge Star Wars fans, and it's a treat to welcome them to the franchise.\n\nThe cast also boasts talents like Charlie Barnett (Yord), Manny Jacinto (Qimir) and Dafne Keen (Jecki), as well as the great Jodie Turner-Smith (Mother Aniseya). At the halfway point, Turner-Smith is somewhat underused, but here's hoping that's rectified in the remaining instalments.\n\nAs opposed to the sprawling nature of a series like The Mandalorian, The Acolyte is more of an intimate, character-driven show (although that's not to say we don't see plenty of the galaxy along the way). The glimmers of Osha, Mae and Sol's backstory only add to the depth of the characters and the tale, and every episode is gripping.\n\nFour episodes in, the series so far has none of the pacing issues that often plague Star Wars live-action outings, either.\n\nIt's pacy but still takes the time to beautifully flesh out each of our leading characters. It's serialised but doesn't feel formulaic. It can be enjoyed as a standalone series for newcomers to Star Wars but still has plenty to enjoy for die-hards.\n\nOf course, as with every Star Wars series, The Acolyte is still under a lot of pressure to stick the landing. It's one thing to provide a gripping first half, but it's how things wrap up that the show will truly be judged on.\n\nFour episodes in, it's a very promising start but, while the comparisons to Andor are understandably coming thick and fast, it hasn't yet done quite enough to outdo the Diego Luna series.\n\nCould the remaining four push it over the edge? Absolutely. But that's all down to what Headland and her stellar cast have in store.", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "louise_griffin@radiotimes.com", "name": "Louise Griffin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_procedural", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police procedural"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Doll_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Doll (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Barnett_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Barnett (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunger_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hunger Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodie_Turner-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jodie Turner-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Luna", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diego Luna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dafne_Keen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dafne Keen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Jacinto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manny Jacinto"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2024/06/The-Acolyte-Amandla-Stenberg-7ec0e26.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The Acolyte 's action sequences are a breath of fresh air for Star Wars, offering slick, fluid choreography without a reliance on lightsabers. Amandla Stenberg and Lee Jung-jae stand out among The Acolyte 's cast, offering the two most compelling characters of episodes 1 and 2. SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe Acolyte, Star Wars' latest live-action TV show, begins with a promising, dark mystery at its center. Almost immediately, The Acolyte pulls us into the show's section on the franchise's timeline. Star Wars' High Republic Era is a delight to see onscreen, especially as someone who is a fan of the various books set before Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. With slick fight scenes, a good cast, an enticing mystery, and a perfect visual style, The Acolyte episodes 1 and 2 kick the series off to a promising start.\n\nThe Acolyte Sci-FiFantasy\n\nCast Dafne Keen , Lee Jung-jae , Amandla Stenberg , Jodie Turner-Smith , Joonas Suotamo , Carrie-Anne Moss , Margarita Levieva , Charlie Barnett , Dean-Charles Chapman Seasons 1 Streaming Service(s) Disney+ Franchise(s) Star Wars Writers Leslye Headland , Charmaine De Grate , Kor Adana Directors Leslye Headland , Alex Garcia Lopez Showrunner Leslye Headland Expand The Acolyte's Mystery Is Introduced Immediately & Is Incredibly Compelling The Acolyte's pacing helps the central mystery feel incredibly important Close\n\nAs soon as The Acolyte's opening text fades away, the show drops us straight into the heart of its plot. Instantly, The Acolyte's script offers everything we need to know: Mae (Amandla Stenberg) is seeking revenge against the Jedi and will stop at nothing to kill those on her hit list. The Acolyte is careful about what it does and does not reveal, aided by showrunner Leslye Headland's experience with writing mysteries that slowly unravel, such as Netflix's Russian Doll.\n\nRelated When Is The Acolyte Set In The Star Wars Timeline?\n\nThe Acolyte will introduce viewers to a whole new part of the Star Wars timeline - but how does this next Disney+ TV show fit with the Skywalker saga?\n\nThese teases help to make The Acolyte so compelling. Why Mae is killing Jedi, who she works for, and what her motivations are lie at the center of The Acolyte, and are stretched across the opening two episodes. As The Acolyte episode 2 came to a close, I was satisfied with what the show's mystery had presented thus far. Some hints about Mae's history with the Jedi are provided, though not too much to quell anticipation for the coming installments. Just as any good mystery box show should, The Acolyte's answers come with an equal number of intriguing questions.\n\nThe identity of The Acolyte's mysterious Sith villain remains the most exciting part of the show, creating a looming sense of dread that permeates proceedings.\n\nThe Acolyte's Action Sequences Are A Breath Of Fresh Air For Star Wars Great choreography, long take, and storytelling weave perfectly to craft fantastic action scenes\n\nAside from the mystery at its center, The Acolyte's other shining highlight is its dedication to action sequences. With stunt coordinators like Chris Clark Cowan, formerly of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings fame, involved, I was sure The Acolyte's action sequences would live up to the hype. As of The Acolyte episode 2's ending, I was incredibly happy with how the show presented such moments. Not only are they expertly choreographed and shot, but they aid in storytelling by providing character beats, proving they are not only there for show.\n\nIt is an even greater testament to The Acolyte then, that even without the iconic weapons, The Acolyte 's fight sequences still soar.\n\nOne aspect I specifically loved about The Acolyte's fight scenes was the unwillingness of the Jedi to use lightsabers. Ironically, for a Star Wars show, the lightsabers are only used as a last resort, and this ties into the Disney+ series' storytelling. These Jedi are at the height of their powers, and the use of a lightsaber is reserved solely for the strongest of enemies. It is an even greater testament to The Acolyte then that, even without the iconic weapons, fight sequences still soar.\n\nThe Acolyte's ensemble cast is brilliant, as are their stunt doubles, in committing to the long takes of fluid choreography. The blending of martial arts, the Force, and storytelling works perfectly, summed up by The Acolyte's opening fight between Mae and Indara (Carrie-Anne Moss), and episode 2's clash between Mae and Sol (Lee Jung-jae). If these two confrontations are anything to go by -- and I believe they are -- The Acolyte's action sequences will go down as some of Star Wars' best.\n\nAmandla Stenberg & Lee Jung-jae Stand Out Among The Acolyte's Cast Stenberg's dual role and Jung-jae's Jedi Master are highlights in a mixed bag of characters\n\nUndoubtedly, the standouts of The Acolyte's cast are Amandla Stenberg and Lee Jung-jae. Stenberg's surprising dual role offers a greater depth of performance than I thought Stenberg would have to work with based on The Acolyte's trailers. Having to swap between Mae and her twin sister Osha, Stenberg offers subtle but believable differences that help the characters feel distinct. As Mae, Stenberg commands every scene she is part of, driven by revenge, anger, and fury.\n\nThis makes Sol an incredibly compelling Jedi, one that stands tall above The Acolyte 's other Jedi cast...\n\nOpposite her is Jung-jae as the steadfast Jedi Master Sol. Jung-jae imbues Sol with an undercurrent of grief, linked to his past with Osha and Mae. This makes Sol an incredibly compelling Jedi, one that stands tall above the other Jedi cast. Unfortunately, The Acolyte first two episodes do not balance every member of the cast efficiently. While Dafne Keen, Charlie Bennett, and Manny Jacinto do well in their roles as Jecki Lon, Yord Fandar, and Qimir, respectively, The Acolyte's focus on other characters makes them fall short, though there's promise for the future.\n\nThe Acolyte's Production & Lore Make It A Worthy Inclusion In Star Wars Canon Everything that forms a good Star Wars story is present in The Acolyte Close\n\nAs someone who has no real preference over a Star Wars style -- be it the CGI-laden vistas of the prequels or the practical-heavy visuals of the originals -- I was hoping The Acolyte would employ a healthy mix of both. As was the case with the sequel trilogy, Disney thankfully answered my calls. The Acolyte's visuals are a perfect blend of practical and visual effects. The ships, landscapes, planets, and accompanying otherworldly elements are realized beautifully with unnoticeable CGI, while the aliens, props, sets, and costumes are tangible and practical in the best way.\n\nWhile these elements help The Acolyte feel inherently like a show set in the Star Wars universe, I was pleased to experience how much the showrunners are including from the wider lore. Hints at the Sith ways, the Jedi Order's slow fall from grace, and High Republic designs are all part of The Acolyte's first two episodes. These elements allow the show to hold a worthy place in the vast pantheon of Star Wars canon.\n\nUltimately, these aspects work together to make The Acolyte episodes 1 and 2 an enticing beginning. The mystery at the show's center is intriguing and gives the series a welcome sinister tone. This mystery is elevated thematically and visually by brilliant action sequences and quieter moments, both of which are done well, despite the feeling that some characters are underserved. While episode 1 suffers from slower pacing and some wooden dialogue, episode 2 reveals more about the Sith mystery, and in an era of light and life, The Acolyte's darkness makes it a worthy installment in Star Wars canon.\n\nThe first two episodes of The Acolyte debut on Disney+ at 9pm ET on June 4. The remaining 6 episodes will be available to stream weekly every Tuesday thereafter.\n\nThe Acolyte\n\nThe Acolyte is a television series set in the Star Wars universe at the end of the High Republic Era, where both the Jedi and the Galactic Empire were at the height of their influence. This sci-fi thriller sees a former Padawan reunite with her former Jedi Master as they investigate several crimes - all leading to darkness erupting from beneath the surface and preparing to bring about the end of the High Republic.\n\nPros Cons", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lewis_glazebrook@screenrant.com", "name": "Lewis

(Andor remains the exception to the rule.) Instead, creator Leslye Headland (Russian Doll) takes advantage of The Acolyte's new time period, building out a tense thriller in a chunk of the Star Wars timeline that most viewers won't be too familiar with.\n\nThe new time period in question is the High Republic Era, a stretch of peace roughly a century before the events of The Phantom Menace. While there are several multimedia projects set in the High Republic Era, including novels and graphic novels, The Acolyte marks the first time we see this period onscreen in live action. That offers Headland a greater amount of freedom to build something original. The Acolyte is stronger for it, all while remaining an undeniably Star Wars story.\n\nOf course, there are still familiar Star Wars elements on display in The Acolyte. The series focuses on the Jedi Order, so get ready to venture back to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, witness lightsaber battles, and hear all about how emotional attachment can make a Jedi weak. (Oh, and you know there's a \"may the Force be with you\" or two in the show's future.)\n\nBut while we've seen variations on these storylines and set pieces before, The Acolyte's High Republic setting lends them all an entirely new context. As the series opens, the Jedi are at the height of their power, keeping peace all across the galaxy. They prefer to fight hand-to-hand, resulting in stylized martial arts sequences that set The Acolyte's combat apart from works that come later in the Star Wars timeline. A lightsaber is a last resort against a formidable foe -- a far cry from the colorful flashing Jedi battles we're more accustomed to, and a telling detail about the peaceful state of the galaxy.\n\nYet that peace may soon be at an end. Dark forces gather against the Jedi, among them young warrior Mae Aniseya (Amandla Stenberg, Bodies Bodies Bodies). Her mysterious master -- sporting a black helmet carved with a wide, spooky smile -- has tasked her with killing key Jedi Masters from her own past. It's not long before word of Mae's murder spree reaches the Jedi Order, where Jedi Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae, Squid Game) will assemble a team to hunt her down.\n\nTo reveal much more about The Acolyte's plot would be to spoil its biggest -- and most rewarding -- bombshells. But for all its twists and turns, The Acolyte's first four episodes (all that were made available to critics) never once drag out a predictable surprise, trusting the audience with secret after secret, while still promising several down the road.\n\nOn top of being an enthralling thriller, one of The Acolyte's greatest strengths is how it deepens our understanding of the Force -- its uses, its boundaries, and who gets to wield it.\n\nEarly on in the series, we encounter a coven of Witches on the planet Brendock. While they are what the Jedi would call \"Force sensitive,\" they certainly don't refer to themselves as Jedi. Nor do they even conceptualize what we think of as \"the Force\" in the same way. Their community is just one of many fascinating worldbuilding details that color The Acolyte's views on the Force: What happens when the Jedi butt heads with people who have a totally different take on the power that binds the galaxy together?\n\nThese kinds of confrontations may chafe against some viewers' ideas of the Jedi, and it's clear The Acolyte relishes that complication. The Jedi we meet -- an ensemble that includes Charlie Barnett, Dafne Keen, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Dean-Charles Chapman -- all have vastly different relationships to the Order. Some are the most devout of rule followers, relishing the Order's strict structure. Others have left the Jedi entirely, only to return when needed.\n\nThe Acolyte's characters' varying ties to and perceptions of the Jedi create vast grey areas for them to navigate, bookended (naturally) by the Light and the Dark. While the ensemble is great across the board, it's Stenberg's performance that most embodies this conflict, zipping up and down the Force's legendary gradient at a moment's notice. At times chilling in her determination, at others charming in her interaction with allies, Stenberg delivers an instantly memorable Star Wars anti-hero. (Or maybe even a hero?)\n\nCharacters like Mae (or Sol, or Keen's Jecki, or Barnett's Yord) are perhaps The Acolyte's greatest gift. These are new people to meet, with new inter-personal relationships to explore. Why does Sol feel a strange regret and obligation to Mae? What lengths will Jecki and Yord go to to serve the Jedi? What turned Mae to the Dark Side in the first place? The Acolyte fleshes out these questions -- and then some -- to deliver a strong ensemble. And the fact that this ensemble is new is just what Star Wars needs.\n\nStar Wars is not about how many times Luke Skywalker can pop up unannounced, or about how many Easter eggs you can cram into an episode. It's about the many denizens of the galaxy answering the call to fight for what they believe in, as messy and daunting as it may seem. Whether they serve the Jedi or the Dark Side, every one of The Acolyte's characters have answered that call in a way that feels specific and real and propulsive. They are definitive proof that Star Wars series shouldn't be drawing time and again from the same well of nostalgia, that they should be willing to try something new and complicate what came before. Star Wars encompasses an entire galaxy, after all! The Acolyte proves you reap the rewards when you actually explore that vast expanse.", "source": {"uri": "mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_High_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: The High Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lightsaber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ahsoka (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Doll_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Doll (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coruscant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coruscant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_novel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphic novel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multimedia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Barnett_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Barnett (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean-Charles_Chapman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dean-Charles Chapman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie-Anne_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carrie-Anne Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Worldbuilding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Skywalker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Skywalker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dafne_Keen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dafne Keen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05eL4xaiMyP7IByTvDQu3y4/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1717470771.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

One might say a Padawan is a perfect example and we all know there are plenty of those in the numerous movies, TV shows, graphic novels, etc. in the Galaxy. However, Disney+ is now offering an alternative with their new limited series called The Acolyte. What might that be, you wonder? Well, if you look up the meaning of an acolyte, you find the following definitions: a person assisting the celebrant in a religious service or procession; an assistant or follower. Having seen the first four episodes, I can tell you the description fits the premise of the show perfectly.\n\nWhen we meet Osha (Amandla Stenberg; The Hate U Give) she is working on a cargo ship that is boarded by Jedi Masters. The Jedi are there to arrest her for the murder of a Jedi named Indara (Carrie-Anne Moss; The Matrix Series). Insisting she is not guilty; she is still sent to the Jedi central location to stand trial. However, on the way there the transport she is in crashes, and while she looks for shelter, she sees an image of her deceased twin sister, Mae. Discovering Mae is alive, it soon becomes apparent who killed Indara.\n\nStenberg is a smart casting choice, as she is a terrific actor and does a great job playing two, identical sisters with very different agendas. Lee Jung-Jae (Squid game) portrays Osha's former Jedi Master, Sol, as she had once been a trainee in the ways of \"the force\". Jodie Turner-Smith (Queen and Slim) plays the twins' mother and the leader of a coven of witches. Charlie Barnett (Chicago Fire) is Yord Fandar, a Jedi Master and former friend of Osha, and Dafne Keen (Logan) is Sol's current Padawan. Together this ensemble works well to create a completely immersive world.\n\nOf course, with anything Star Wars, there are always special effects including odd creatures, ships flying through space at warp speed, no less, and light sabers used during fight sequences. These effects are decent for the most part with the occasional slip up such as when Osha frees another prisoner from a parasite rendering him immobile. As the creature flies off his face the special effects are obvious which is distracting and takes the viewer out of the moment. Yet other scenes, such as a giant, flying, forest bug, are well done and unique.\n\nWhile a part of the Star Wars saga, The Acolyte takes place one hundred years before Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace so it takes the audience further back than ever before and depicts a time when the Jedi were thriving and the Sith don't yet exist. However, Mae (who I can only assume is considered the Acolyte) has a dark master who has trained her like a Jedi but whose face she has never seen. This fact, at least at this point, brings up numerous questions that will hopefully be answered by the end of the limited series. Who is this dark master? What do they want with Mae? How does the witches' coven play into the force and the realm of the Jedi and the future \"Empire\"?\n\nThe basic themes of The Acolyte have their origins in the Star Wars world, but it is definitely its own entity. This makes the show both familiar and unique at the same time which helps keep the audience interested. The various questions asked are also a draw as one will most likely want to find out the answers and see what other questions those answers might raise.\n\nThe Acolyte brings a fresh, new, and exciting dimension to the \"Star Wars Verse\" that hopefully will continue for a second season.", "source": {"uri": "flickdirect.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FlickDirect"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_series_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limited series (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hate_U_Give", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hate U Give"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie-Anne_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carrie-Anne Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acolyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acolyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Matrix (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_novel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphic novel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodie_Turner-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jodie Turner-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Barnett_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Barnett (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Fire_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Fire (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Witchcraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dafne_Keen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dafne Keen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_(season_2)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian (season 2)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images.flickdirect.com/cache/movies/acolyte/06600-acolyte-poster.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

It's the furthest in the past live-action Star Wars has ever gone, giving us our first live-action look at the High Republic -- an era a century before the prequels when the Jedi were at their peak.\n\nNow, it's finally time to see just what's going on with the mysterious assassin Mae and the golden-robed Jedi of the era, and Lucasfilm is giving this series the special release it deserves. Here's everything you need to know about tuning into this series.\n\nThe Acolyte premieres Tuesday, June 4, on Disney+. This is unusual for Star Wars series, but is getting more and more commonplace. Ahsoka, for example, was announced to premiere on Wednesday, August 23, 2023, but a week before release, the premiere was moved up six hours. That The Acolyte getting the same release strategy as Ahsoka, without being a spinoff, shows how confident Disney+ is in the series.\n\nThe Acolyte is one of the few Disney+ original series to get a prime-time release. While Disney+ originals usually premiere at midnight PST/3 a.m. EST, certain high-profile releases like Ahsoka or Loki Season 2 are released at 6 p.m. PST/9 p.m. EST, allowed for a more traditional late-night watch instead of fans watching first thing in the morning or risking being spoiled.\n\nThe Acolyte is being released in this experimental prime-time window, suggesting that this is the new norm for Star Wars series going forward.\n\nThe Acolyte is getting a double-length premiere, so block out your schedule for both Episode 1 and Episode 2 on the 4th. Thankfully, this series is eight episodes long, so the series will release new episodes every Tuesday until July 16.\n\nYes! This jam-packed trailer establishes a dark murder mystery and a tale of mistaken identity between a Jedi and his former Padawan -- plus a lot of impressive action.

There's the kind where you write whatever you want and call it Star Wars--a common occurrence with the many novels released in the 1990s. There's the kind where you recycle already existing Star Wars stories into something familiar--this has been Disney's primary way of doing things. But, lastly, there are the stories that enthusiastically make use of Star Wars as a setting to create something fresh. There have been a number of novels that fit that bill, as did the first season of Andor--and now, through four episodes, it seems that the new Star Wars series The Acolyte, set a century before the movies, also falls into that category.\n\nThe Acolyte centers on a pair of twins, Osha and Mae (both played by Amandla Stenberg). The girls were raised by an unaffiliated coven of female Force-users, but despite living outside the Republic, the Jedi-- including Carrie-Ann Moss's Indara--poked their noses into these women's affairs, leading to disaster. As a result, the sisters are separated for decades, each thinking the other dead--Osha ends up training to be a Jedi before washing out after a few years, and Mae, while everyone thinks she's dead, trains under a secret Sith master. When Mae emerges to hunt and kill the Jedi who made the incursion to her coven, Osha takes the blame and gets pulled right back into Jedi business as they go after her sister.\n\nOne thing that sets The Acolyte apart is the way it doesn't dilly dally with the reveal that Osha and Mae are separate people--the show begins by inferring that Osha has a normal life and moonlights as an assassin, but we learn the truth about Mae before the end of the first episode. A lesser Star Wars story would have tried to milk that mystery for several episodes at least.\n\nBut that's one of the many common franchise pitfalls that this series from showrunner Leslye Headland avoids several times during the episodes that were screened for critics. For example, every time it looks like we're about to be embroiled in some obnoxious and tropey contrivance, such as when the Jedi walk in on Osha standing over a dead body that she had discovered 15 seconds earlier, some character will quickly set the record straight so we don't have to waste several scenes dealing with nonsense. It's a beautiful thing, considering how much of the modern Star Wars franchise is built on that kind of wheel-spinning.\n\nLikewise, they've managed something interesting with the aesthetic here. The Acolyte has all the same visual trappings of Star Wars and Marvel shows that use heavy doses of CGI, but avoids looking overly-reliant on that aesthetic by shooting on a lot of practical sets, dialing up the film grain, and going with a very dark look. The result isn't shockingly beautiful or anything like that, but it looks nice and the dark graininess hides the CGI pretty effectively.\n\nMuch more striking to me, though, is how neutral the tone of this series is, something that was likely made possible because of how far removed it is from the main franchise. This is a show that has a lot of familiar iconography but isn't reverent about it. The Jedi are just magic cops, and not treated as inherently good--you may bring that presupposition with you when you watch The Acolyte, but the series itself is not reinforcing that idea.\n\nIt can't, in fact, because it doesn't want to treat Mae as the villain. She's not going to have the Darth Vader/Kylo Ren redemption arc here, because she's a victim of circumstance just like her sister, both of whom were 8 years old when they were caught in between multiple groups of Force-users who wanted to control their future. The Acolyte isn't about Osha vs Mae--it feels much more like Osha and Mae vs everyone else.\n\nThe \"everyone else\" also includes some interesting figures, like Dafne Keen's Jedi apprentice Jecki, who Osha seems to develop a bit of a bond with, and Manny Jacinto's Qimir, who helps Mae on her hunts. But the most memorable of these others is Jedi Master Sol, played by Squid Game's Lee Jung-jae--Osha's former master, who has an earnest desire to make up for the mistake he and the other Jedi made with the coven. He knows that he and his co-workers were the original cause of this situation, and he feels responsible for handling the mess that has resulted in the present. Even though Lee apparently didn't know English before taking the role, he gives what is probably this show's best performance.\n\nWhile I'm really digging the direction the show is taking through the first four episodes, there's reason to fear how this will tie into the main franchise plot eventually--the third episode plants the seeds for The Acolyte to serve as a direct precursor to the movies, but if that's going to happen, it'll be later on in the episodes I haven't seen yet. Could that end up ruining The Acolyte, if it does happen? It definitely could, yes. But the first four episodes are strong enough that I actually believe that Headland and co. might be able to make it work regardless.", "source": {"uri": "gamespot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GameSpot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "phil_owen@gamespot.com", "name": "Phil Owen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...?_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "What If...?

Of course, these time zones only apply to the continental United States, and the two-episode premiere will happen a day later, on Wednesday, June 5, 2024, in countries like Great Britain.\n\nLike most live-action Star Wars shows, The Acolyte's first season consists of eight episodes. As I mentioned above, the first two episodes will premiere back-to-back on Tuesday, June 4. The rest of the episodes will follow a weekly release schedule, with new episodes airing one week after another.\n\nHere's the breakdown of The Acoylte's release schedule so you can know exactly when each episode premieres. If even a few of the rumors swirling around the series' mysterious villain are even remotely true, The Acolyte will feature some mind-bending twists, so you'll want to be there as soon as the episodes are out if you want to avoid spoilers.\n\nThe Acolyte is set during the final years of the High Republic era of the Star Wars timeline, which is set a few centuries before the events of Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace and depicts the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic at the height of their power. This means you probably won't miss out on anything if you've only watched the mainline Star Wars movies.\n\nIf you want to know everything that happened in the High Republic era, we have an excellent reading order guide for the many Star Wars: The High Republic books and comics.

You can watch \"The Acolyte\" on Disney Plus around the world.\n\nHot off the heels of \"Ahsoka\", \"The Acolyte\" takes us back to the High Republic era, a time when the Jedi Order were at the peak of their powers. There we find Jedi Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae of \"Squid Game\") investigating a series of crimes that lead him back to his own prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Mae (Amandla Stenberg). This former Padawan is now a warrior in her own right, but is she friend or foe?\n\nPerhaps the most eye-catching detail of the \"The Acolyte\" trailer is Carrie-Anne Moss -- a.k.a.

Since then, the franchise has had a cult-like following. Several movies and TV shows later, nothing appears to stop its journey as a true force in a galaxy far, far away.\n\nThe franchise's latest show, The Acolyte, looks to continue its momentum. The Acolyte makes its debut on June 4. The eight-episode show, lasting from June to July, will focus on The High Republic Era, when the Jedi were at the height of their power, and there was peace.\n\nHowever, not all is what it seems. The trailer features the rise of a mysterious and sinister character with the promise of -- obviously -- epic lightsaber battles and force-driven fight sequences. The all-star cast features the likes of Lee Jung-Jae, Carrie-Anne Moss, Dafnee Keen, and more.\n\nTime will tell but early glimpses of The Acolyte foreshadow a different perspective than the typical themes family and hope found throughout various Star Wars arcs. And unlike previous acclaimed series The Mandalorian, Andor and Obi-Wan Kenobi, The Acolyte explores a different time period that until now has been left mostly to books and video games.\n\nThis isn't your Skywalker-adjacent story and its certainly not your father's Star Wars story, either. Here's a breakdown of the ways you can watch The Acolyte.\n\nIn addition to The Acolyte, Disney+ is your home for all things Star Wars. In addition to the original trilogy, prequel trilogy and most recent reboot, Disney+ also features animated shows, live action series, kid-friendly shorts and documentaries in addition to other full-length features like \"Rogue One\" and \"Solo\".\n\nUnfortunately, Disney+ does not have a free trial. There are, however, multiple options that offer Star Wars fans plenty of choices.\n\nDisney+ has three main plans - only Disney+, a duo with Hulu, or a trio with ESPN+.\n\nHere's a look at each subscription cost per month:\n\nPricing for each plan varies, as subscribers can also choose basic or ad-free plans.

(Indeed, her major follow-up to \"People\" was co-creating the Netflix series \"Russian Doll,\" as well as directing various episodes of series she did not create or write.) Given that, seeing such a tart, talented filmmaker and playwright absorbed by a force as galactic as the \"Star Wars\" universe, even the corners shrunken down for Disney+ shows, should be an exercise in surrendering to the depressing inevitable.\n\nAnd maybe it is, in the sense that the characters on Headland's new \"Star Wars\" series \"The Acolyte\" don't speak with the rueful wit, playful banter, or all-out bile that characterizes her best work as a writer. Instead, they split the difference between Headland's bite and the faux-Marvel cutesiness that's become Disney's de facto house style - looser and less formal than George Lucas/Dave Filoni fundamentalism without quite nailing that Rian Johnson-style zippy sincerity. And, to be clear, not as full of weak joke soundalikes as so many other Disney shows.\n\nBut as with Headland's understated but exceedingly well-directed films, her secret weapon in \"The Acolyte\" is attention to visual detail. In the first four of the season's eight episodes, the first two of which Headland directed herself, \"Star Wars\" feels a bit more vibrant that it typically has on television. In place of the quasi-western spareness of \"The Mandalorian\" or the seemingly stretched-thin budget of \"Obi-Wan Kenobi\" is a colorful sort-of mystery series that takes off like a rocket.\n\nSet close to a century before the events of \"The Phantom Menace,\" previously the earliest live-action media on the \"Star Wars\" timeline, the show opens with a vaguely \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\"-like sequence in a watering hole. A mysterious, half-masked young woman (Amandla Sternberg) approaches a Jedi and challenges her to a duel to the death. It's not in a Jedi's nature to accept such aggression, but the challenger persists in placing others in harm's way, the Jedi rises to defend and soon the masked woman is on the run for murder. The initial mystery, dispatched relatively quickly, has to do with whether ex-Jedi-in-training Osha (also Sternberg), who matches the assailant's description exactly, is actually guilty of the crime. (Her manner as a freelance mechanic, performing duties usually and legally assigned to droids, doesn't much suggest a simmering, murderous rage.)\n\nThrough an entertainingly loopy series of circumstances that include an accidental spaceship prison break, Osha winds up alongside Sol (Lee Jung-jae from \"Squid Game\"), a composed Jedi master; his new Padawan trainee Jecki (Dafne Keen from \"Logan\"); and stern Jedi temple protector Yord (Charlie Barnett) as they investigate this potential assassin and her \"Kill Bill\"-ish Jedi death list. The bad-guy POV is amply represented, too; the assassin seems driven by personal animosity, yet she also appears to be taking orders from another, more shadowy figure, unrevealed in the first half of the season. To say more would probably constitute spoilers for the first \"Star Wars\" series since \"Mandalorian\" that isn't a prequel, midquel or sequel to franchise-famous characters and pre-existing stories. As such, the new show has its own sui generis urgency, derived from the fun hook of the premise rather than outside knowledge of where the characters are going.\n\nAt the same time, \"The Acolyte\" does have prequel vibes, in a different sort of way. Headland has professed a love for the once-unfashionable \"Star Wars\" prequel trilogy released from 1999-2005, and her show often plays specifically like a remix of \"The Phantom Menace,\" the first entry. Sol's quiet confidence recalls Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn; an alien race prominently featured in the earlier movie turns up early on here; and another episode runs through some of the early Jedi tests we saw young Anakin go through in \"Phantom Menace,\" with similarly lingering questions about whether Jedi practices are all that healthy for those chosen to join their ranks.\n\nThis creates some neat thematic continuity with the George Lucas-directed movie on the occasion of its 25th anniversary, celebrating its simultaneous sense of planet-hopping, world-building wonder and growing skepticism over the \"Star Wars\" good-and-evil binary. But for prequel agnostics, \"The Acolyte\" still has plenty to offer, especially in terms of design. Even further removed from the aesthetics of the original \"Star Wars\" while staying true to its overall sensibility, the show's sets are more overtly colorful in potentially familiar locations like ships' interiors, and the various planetary locations are more distinguishable than a lot of its TV cousins (save \"Andor,\" which remains an outlier in terms of sophisticated craft).\n\nThe assassin's attacks, too, have more verve than what we've been accustomed to seeing on the TV version of \"Star Wars,\" probably because they incorporate hand-to-hand fighting and knifework rather than lightsabers (though multicolored blades do make their obligatory appearances). Older and more jaded fans will probably still grumble that the fights aren't intense or violent enough. But at its frequent best, \"The Acolyte\" feels like solidly constructed YA: snappy, well-paced and attentive to the choices we make when coming of age. (If this sounds disappointing, maybe you haven't yet keyed in to how much of \"Star Wars\" works as children's entertainment.)\n\nWith only half the season available for review, of course, it's hard to say whether Headland and her staff will stick the landing, or whether \"The Acolyte\" has its eye on an extension beyond these eight episodes. But this is also the rare-so-far \"Star Wars\" show that doesn't feel like its first job is to revive a bunch of beloved iconography. Those returns and callbacks can be plenty of fun for the initiated; it's even more exciting, though, not having much of an idea as to where \"The Acolyte\" is headed.", "source": {"uri": "thewrap.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheWrap"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Doll_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Doll (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Lucas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Filoni", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dave Filoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playwright", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playwright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crime fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prostitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandalorians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mandalorians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_(Star_Wars)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Droid (Star Wars)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Barnett_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Barnett (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dafne_Keen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dafne Keen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Neeson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liam Neeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darth Vader"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/the-acolyte-amandla-stenberg.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

However, another major feature of the series is its elaborate and rip-roaring action choreography, which rivals the best moments of the Star Wars franchise.\n\nA recent post on X, formerly known as Twitter, shows behind the scenes clips from The Acolyte which feature the cast and crew developing and shooting its exciting action sequences. The series is set in the later days of the High Republic era, a time period that has previously remained unexplored in the Star Wars universe. Another novelty of the series is its fight choreography, which has been compared to Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace in terms of its fast-paced fights - Obi-Wan and Qui-Qon's fight against Darth Maul has gone down in history as one of the best in the franchise. However, The Acolyte's other similarity to Episode I is how innovative it is, completely changing the way in which characters incorporate the Force into their combat.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Acolyte Trailer Teases Mysterious New Sith Lord\n\nThe Acolyte could introduce one of the Jedi Order's greatest enemies, as teased in the latest trailer.\n\n\"We took the heavy martial arts, the hand-to-hand combat, all the different styles, and mixed them together for these sequences,\" explains stunt coordinator Mark Ginther. Chris Cowen, the show's 2nd unit director broke down The Acolyte's fighting style further, saying, \"We used taekwondo, karate, krav maga, and Western boxing.\" The combination of these real-world martial arts with Force abilities creates visceral and jaw-dropping action scenes, which creator Leslye Headland made a priority.\n\nMartial Arts Has Been Prevalent in Star Wars\n\nPrevious installments of the Star Wars franchise, whether film, television, or video games, have included martial arts, of course. The sword fighting of Obi-Wan Kenobi is deeply influenced by the Japanese art of Kendo. There also exists an in-universe martial art system known as Echani, developed by a near-human species of the same name. However, the behind-the-scenes clip from The Acolyte reveals a style of combat much more reminiscent of The Matrix than previous Star Wars films.\n\nRelated\n\nCarrie-Anne Moss Rediscovered Her Passion for Action Filming The Acolyte's Fights\n\nActor Carrie-Anne Moss reveals what she loves most about performing The Acolyte's action scenes and why she had to get lightsaber moments just right.\n\nCarrie-Anne Moss, who rose to stardom through her role as Trinity in The Matrix saga, stars as Jedi Master Indara. Her casting was very purposeful, as series creator Leslye Headland was inspired by her iconic character when writing Indara. Headland wanted fans to see Moss in the show and feel as though they were seeing \"Trinity with a lightsaber.\" Moss, for her part, feels that The Acolyte reignited her love for action media, despite the grueling work. \"Training for The Acolyte was really challenging. Today, I feel a tad like a truck hit me,\" explained the actress. Amandla Stenberg, who plays Mae and Osha, the twins, and two of the show's protagonists, expressed her admiration for Moss, saying, \"If I had been told that I was gonna fight Carrie-Anne Moss... I probably would've had a heart attack.\"\n\nClose\n\nAside from Moss and Stenberg, who both play original characters, The Acolyte's cast also features Squid Game alumnus Lee Jung-jae, who plays Jedi Master Sol, a wise and respected member of the Order. Charlie Barnett plays Yord Fandar, a newly knighted Jedi. Logan's Dafne Keen plays Jecki Lon, a Jedi Padawan of Master Sol's. Jodie Turner-Smith will play Mother Aniseya, the leader of a coven of Force Witches.\n\nThe Acolyte premieres tomorrow, June 4, 2024, on Disney+.\n\nSource: X, formerly known as Twitter\n\nThe

You have a divided fandom working against you and years of lore that people will nitpick given the option. The Acolyte, however, has the perfect recipe to make it one of the best Star Wars shows yet.\n\nSet during the High Republic era, the series (which was created by Leslye Headland) is not burdened by characters beloved by fans. In fact, they are all new characters to the live-action franchise. Littered with the wipes made famous by George Lucas in the original trilogy, so much of this show feels like a love letter to the series as a whole. But it still brings to life vibrant characters and a story that will keep you hooked.\n\nI have seen the first four episodes of the season, the third having a special place in my heart, but all four manage to tell you everything you need to know about these characters without giving away all their secrets. Mae Aniseya (Amandla Stenberg) is a woman who is trying to find justice for her family. The issue is that to many, she looks like her Jedi trained twin sister Osha (Stenberg) and it results in Osha being taken in by the Jedi.\n\nOsha trained to be a Jedi Master until she left the order six years ago and is now mechanic (essentially doing the job of an astromech droid). Trying to keep to herself and hide away on the freighters she's working on, you can quickly see the difference between these two sisters when we see Mae fighting Master Indara (Carrie-Anne Moss) versus Osha's joy over seeing the Jedi once more.\n\nWhile Osha and Mae's story is at the heart of The Acolyte, it still has all of those elements that make it so very Star Wars.\n\nWhen you think about this franchise, the original trilogy is about Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader with other characters littered in. Leia Organa becomes important once you see her connection to Vader and Luke but the series is, for the most part, centered on that family dynamic and the issues there. There is a reason we all make fun of the Skywalkers and their drama. Even the prequels had Anakin and his family nonsense (his family being both Padm\u00e9 and Obi-Wan Kenobi).\n\nSetting The Acolyte in the golden age of the Jedi and yet still having the core issue center around these two sisters is exactly what makes this franchise so special. Yes, the wipe edits help and the general feel of the show and look of it reminds me so much of the Prequels and what I loved about them but the Star Wars-isms of The Acolyte all stem from the show having themes that have always worked within the universe.\n\nIt isn't easy to make a Star Wars character that instantly grabs the attention of the audience at this point. Those characters that do are our beloved ones. Characters like Han Solo made a lasting impression, we all love Lando Calrissian and fans won't ever forget how Finn and Poe Dameron first met. Cassian Andor made a lasting impact enough to have his own show but they are not always stand outs.\n\nWith The Acolyte, there's not a character I dislike. Every new character I meet makes me want to spend a lifetime with them. Yord (Charlie Barnett) is a beloved Jedi Knight who is more of a himbo than anything else. Jecki Lon (Dafne Keen) can come across as a Theelin-human hybrid know-it-all but she's always right in what she's saying.\n\nMaster Sol (Lee Jung-jae) is powerful, intelligent, but has an emotional connection to Osha that defies the ways of the Jedi and yet still is someone you know will protect those he cares about. Vernestra Rwoh (Rebecca Henderson) feels cold but can see reason and logic and it makes her an important part of the Jedi.\n\nThey all have aspects of them that are very much connected to characters we know and love in Star Wars while still being unique and new.\n\nWe have seen the destruction of the Jedi, the absence of the Jedi, and then the attempt to rebuild them in all of the major Star Wars trilogies. While we have movies like Rey's standalone coming out (which will be another attempt at rebuilding the Jedi), we have never seen them in all of their glory.\n\nThe Acolyte has the Jedi at their most powerful, their most together, and still, we see how the ways of the Jedi get in their own way. Sol wants to believe Osha when she says that she didn't do the crime against her. But he has to do as the council says and that is the crux of all issues with the Jedi.\n\nThe Acolyte had a lot of things that could have worked against it. A new era for the franchise, all new characters, and a small portion of the Star Wars fanbase who hates anything not straight, white, and male all were pushing back on the show before it even started it. But the first four episodes of The Acolyte tell a story I cannot get enough of.\n\nHeadland and her writers' room did an incredible job of finding the balance between the story they were telling and honoring the universe that George Lucas created at the same time and I loved every second of it.", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mary Sue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_leishman@themarysue.com", "name": "Rachel Leishman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_original_trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars original trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Darth Vader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_High_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: The High Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Skywalker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Skywalker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fandom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_prequel_trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars prequel trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_(Star_Wars)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Droid (Star Wars)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie-Anne_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carrie-Anne Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obi-Wan Kenobi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padm\u00e9_Amidala", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Padm\u00e9 Amidala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Lucas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Leia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Princess Leia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Barnett_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Barnett (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassian_Andor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cassian Andor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_(Star_Wars)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finn (Star Wars)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_impact_of_Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cultural impact of Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe_Dameron", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poe Dameron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lando_Calrissian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lando Calrissian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Solo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Han Solo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dafne_Keen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dafne Keen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Characters", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Characters", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/The-Acolyte-e1716570452895.jpeg?fit=1200%2C674", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

In The Acolyte, that division remains, but the stability of it seems a bit shaky. Light and dark are, if not only a matter of perspective, at least a little hard to discern here. Yet what sets it apart also makes The Acolyte feel a little squishy, at least in the first four episodes of this eight-episode first season.\n\nSo does the question of what sort of show it wants to be. The series opens with a promising jolt as a character described in the opening titles as \"a lone assassin\" seeks out and kills a Jedi Master played by an immediately recognizable actor (whom we'll leave unnamed, though this would only spoil the opening scene). This, the series will soon reveal, is Mae, and the assassination attempt is just the first step in a larger plan. Suspicion quickly falls on Osha, who's left the path that would have allowed her to become a Jedi Knight to work instead as a mechanic on a trade ship. She's arrested by Yord Fandar (Russian Doll's Charlie Barnett), an old, disapproving Jedi Academy friend, and Jecki Lon (Logan's Dafne Keen), a Padawan to the Jedi Master Sol (Squid Game's Lee Jung-jae). Osha has history with Sol as well, as subsequent episodes will reveal. Yet while the first episode sets up a mystery-thriller -- maybe The Fugitive but in the Outer Rim -- subsequent episodes veer away from this setup.\n\nThis would be exciting if it didn't feel haphazard. And, perhaps, the season's back half will reveal an elegant grand plan. In this first half, however, The Acolyte mostly lurches from scene to scene and setting to setting as Sol's investigation follows Mae's trail. The narrative, if not always smooth, is rarely dull. The first episode teases a puppet master villain (if that's the right word) whose identity remains unknown even to the puppets being controlled, a mystery that pulls the plot along. But, despite a solid cast, The Acolyte suffers from a near absence of compelling characters and some dramatic lapses of subtlety. \"The Jedi are bad,\" one character says, to which another replies, \"The Jedi are good.\" That these are children arguing doesn't make the moment clang any less.\n\nAgain, a strong back half might smooth all of this over. Until then, these first four episodes offer other reasons to tune in. Headland's series is set near the end of the High Republic, about a hundred years before the events of The Phantom Menace. Star Wars has made a concerted attempt to build out this era in the past few years, largely through novels and comic books. The Acolyte is the first live action look at the High Republic period, and it fittingly makes the period feel like a corner of Star Wars history we haven't seen before. From new ships to unexplored planets to knick knacks like Osha's assistant, a cute handheld droid with many functions, there's always something new to check out, including some cool, practically rendered creatures from Neal Scanlan.\n\nMore streaming TV:\n\nThe Acolyte also makes the era feel like a rich place for storytelling. Both the Republic and the Jedi are at their height, but there's a sense that won't last for long. The best episode so far -- despite containing the dialogue referenced above -- is the third, which offers a flashback to Mae and Osha's childhood amidst a coven of Force witches led by Mother Aniseya (Jodie Turner-Smith). Outcasts who've fled for a remote planet, they have seemingly every reason to mistrust the Jedi when they show up. Though the Jedi claim to have arrived by accident, it becomes clear they're there to seek out any children being illegally trained in the ways of the Force.\n\nThe moment smacks of religious persecution, particularly given the matriarchal structure of the society they're infiltrating. This episode, the complex drama between Osha and Mae (who have different takes on the incident that separated them), and other elements suggest a series interested in complicating, if not upending, the fundamental nature of the Star Wars universe. What it's yet to find -- unlike the similarly morally ambiguous Andor -- is a way to convert the boldness of those ambitions into storytelling that's just as bold.", "source": {"uri": "tvguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TVGuide.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Doll_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian Doll (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...?_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "What If...?

It leaves Stenberg shaking as a result.\n\n\"I just wanted to send you a quick message to say congratulations. I'm very excited for the show and wanted to wish you all the best and welcome you to our Star Wars family,\" he began. \"Hopefully, I'll get to meet you soon -- maybe at a Star Wars Celebration or something.\"\n\nAs she was shaking, Stenberg responded to the heartwarming gesture. \"Hayden, I am currently still shaking a little bit from receiving this video, but I just wanted to extend all my gratitude for your love and support. It means the world to me 'cause I'm so honored to step into this universe,\" she said. \"And the path that you carved in it means so much to me.\"\n\nShe proceeds to replay the video, specifically Christensen's greeting, over and over again.\n\nWho do Hayden Christensen and Amandla Stenberg play in Star Wars?\n\nThis was a heartwarming move from Hayden Christensen to Amandla Stenberg. The former is known for playing Anakin Skywalker in the prequel trilogy of Star Wars films.\n\nNearly two decades later, Christensen made his triumphant return to the franchise. He starred in the Disney+ series, Obi-Wan Kenobi and would subsequently appear in Ahsoka as well.\n\nWhat the future holds for Christensen remains to be seen. It is possible that Star Wars finds a way to bring Christensen back into the fold. After all, they have done it twice now in live-action form.\n\nHe was made a star thanks to his part in the Star Wars films. His other notable projects include The Virgin Suicides, Shattered Glass, Jumper, and The Last Man. She also appeared in Beyonc\u00e9's music video for \"Lemonade.\"\n\nIn The Acolyte, Stenberg has dual roles as Osha and Mae. She leads the latest Star Wars Disney+ series.\n\nEarlier in their career, Stenberg gained notoriety for their role in The Hunger Games. She played Rue in the first film and also starred in several episodes of Sleepy Hollow around this time. She would go on to star in Rio 2, The Hate U Give, Dear Evan Hanse, and Bodies Bodies Bodies.\n\nAdditionally, in 2023, Stenberg voiced a character in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. She voiced Margo Kess/Spider-Byte in the hit animated film. Across the Spider-Verse grossed nearly $700 million at the box office.\n\nWhat is The Acolyte about?\n\nStar Wars: The Acolyte is the latest series in a galaxy far, far away from Disney+. It takes place before the events of the main Star Wars films and at the end of the High Republic era. The series depicts a Jedi investigation of a series of crimes.\n\nLeslye Headland, known for creating Russian Doll, created the series. Lee Jung-jae, Manny Jacinto, Dafne Keen, Charlie Barnett, and Jodie Turner-Smith also star in the series.\n\nThe first two episodes of The Acolyte will premiere on Disney+ on June 4.

In the time of the High Republic, someone is murdering Jedi, and it is up to the Order to find the culprit.\n\nOnly a few tidbits have so far been circulated about the series, which stars Amandla Stenberg in dual lead roles. Luckily for you, we've put together a quick top 10 list of things that you should know before diving into a story of a new era, new characters, and a new form of Jedi.\n\nEverything that has taken place thus far in the Star Wars movies and TV shows has been set during the \"Skywalker Saga,\" which encompasses the timeframe covering the fall of the Republic (Episodes 1-3), the reign of the Empire (4-6), and the new Republic (7-9). The Acolyte takes place 100 years before The Phantom Menace in an era newly dubbed by Disney as \"The High Republic\" -- so this will be a brand new setting that we haven't seen before on screen.\n\nWhile this is the first time we are seeing the High Republic on screen, there have been multiple comic books and novels that were first released in 2021 that take place during this era. These stories go even further back in time, occurring 200 years before Phantom Menace. Since The Acolyte will feature references to these stories and characters, you might want to pick one up for a broader understanding of the world. We recommend this Marvel set of comic books to start.\n\nThe people behind The Acolyte have stressed that this will be a contained story that will not require audiences to be familiar with High Republic lore. Unlike some Marvel projects and previous Star Wars saga entries, you will not have to look to other comics or TV shows to understand what is going on. Yes, reading some of the High Republic literature will give you some context of the time period, but going into the series cold will not impact your understanding of the plot and the characters surrounding it.\n\nThe plot of The Acolyte surrounds a crime spree involving the murder of Jedi and it's up to the Order to discover the culprit of these murders and bring them to justice. It's important to note that the Sith are still very much operating in the shadows, actively practicing the \"Rule of 2,\" which allows for only a master and an apprentice to be active at one time. The Sith very well could be behind all these murders, but we will have to wait for the show to run its course to know for sure.\n\nIn the Acolyte series we will see the arrival of Kelnacca, a Jedi Master of the High Republic era. Not much is known about the character yet other than that he is \"a loner who lives a solitary life.\" Regardless, the idea that we will finally get to see a Wookie wield a lightsaber is something all Star Wars fans have been clamoring for.\n\nThroughout Star Wars history we have seen a variety of different lightsabers: the traditional single blade, the dual blade first introduced by Darth Maul, the cross guard wielded by Kylo Ren, and -- my personal favorite -- the curved hilt used by Count Dooku. (And let's not forget the wide spectrum of colors used by the different Force wielders.) In The Acolyte we will see a new type of weapon, which is basically a lightsaber with a fluid blade -- essentially a whip. We have only seen a brief glimpse of this weapon but Star Wars fans are eager to see how this new form of combat will come into play.\n\nBy and large, all the characters in The Acolyte will be new, but we can't leave out the fact that Yoda lived to be 900 years old before he passed in Return of the Jedi. The era that The Acolyte takes place in definitely falls within Yoda's lifetime, plus he's mentioned sparsely in the High Republic literature, so it wouldn't come as that much of a surprise to see a younger version of everyone's favorite green little friend.\n\nIn Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith, Darth Sidious tells the story of Darth Plagueis, who was a very powerful Sith Lord who apparently had the power to stop death itself. Ever since that creepy meeting at the theater between Sidious and his future apprentice, we have always wanted to know more about this legendary Sith. It has been established that Plageuis was active during the High Republic timeframe, so it's entirely possible that we may finally get a live-action representation of the character.\n\nIn the movies and TV shows set during the Skywalker era, the Jedi order is viewed as a very strict and specific way of life without much leeway or room for interpretation from its members. To deviate from it meant being branded a member of the Dark side. During the High Republic era, the Jedi order was much more flexible with its rules and practices. Each member had the freedom to interpret and practice the code in their own way, so far as it didn't result in acts of cruelty or wickedness. It will be interesting to see a new form of Jedi that we haven't seen on screen before.\n\nBecause this was a time of peace and prosperity for the Jedi, members were more in tune with the Force than we've seen in previous iterations. In The Acolyte we will see powers wielded by the Jedi that we haven't seen before such as telepathy and an ability to know how a piece of technology works at first glance.

A step away from the Skywalkers and Sith of it all poses an obvious roadblock. When pressed on the biggest limitations of placing The Acolyte in a new setting, Headland felt the lack of familiarity was an issue - but one she was willing to embrace.\n\n\"We don't have that immediate iconography of stormtroopers, for example. When you see a stormtrooper, you know you're in Star Wars... We had some things we got to not fall back on, but utilize. It was harder but, in a way, it was freeing and easier,\" Headland says.\n\nShe continues, \"When audiences watch it, there will still be that wish fulfilment of seeing the Jedi in action and that's what we get to do.\"\n\nIt's the Jedi, for so long on the run or in hiding for the bulk of Star Wars' on-screen history, that were able to flourish in The Acolyte.\n\n\"I think in other Star Wars media, the Jedi are either the underdogs or, in some of the Disney Plus shows, you don't see them at all,\" Headland notes. \"You get to see a lot of Jedi fighting adversaries [in The Acolyte] but, unlike the prequels, they're at their height; they don't expect any sort of conflict. It's all these little bits that were more freeing and then also inhibiting. It was about picking and choosing [those elements].\"\n\nThe Acolyte is streaming exclusively on Disney Plus from June 4 in the US and June 5 in the UK.", "source": {"uri": "gamesradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "gamesradar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bradley_russell@gamesradar.com", "name": "Bradley Russell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_High_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: The High Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GamesRadar+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GamesRadar+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Hollywood_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classical Hollywood cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_prequel_trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars prequel trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sith", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormtrooper_(Star_Wars)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stormtrooper (Star Wars)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_in_other_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars in other media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LbkjJpkot5EMQX9m9eW4GA-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 2407, "textEnd": 2413}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 2428, "textEnd": 2434}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Is It Delayed?", "body": "With The Acolyte (also known as Star Wars: The Acolyte) set to premiere soon, viewers are wondering about the exact release time. Created by Leslye Headland, the sci-fi series takes place in the High Republic era's last days in the Star Wars universe. The story centers around a respected Jedi Master who finds himself entangled in the investigation of mysterious crimes. Alongside his former Padawan learner, they set out to uncover the truth.\n\nHere is everything to know about the release time of The Acolyte on Disney Plus.\n\nWhat time do The Acolyte Episode 1 and 2 come out on Disney Plus?\n\nThe Acolyte Episodes 1 and 2 will come out together on June 4, 2024, at 6:00 P.M. PT and 9:00 P.M. ET. Viewers in the U.K. will be able to stream the episodes on June 5, 2024, at 2:00 A.M. BST.\n\nAfter premiering two episodes on June 4, the series will release subsequent episodes at the same time every week. Consequently, the series finale is set to air on July 16, 2024.\n\nIs The Acolyte Episode 1 delayed?\n\nNo, the release of The Acolyte Episode 1 is not delayed. It is simply adopting a new release time of 6:00 P.M. PT instead of the usual 12:00 A.M. PT slot.\n\nThe new adjustment in the release time is due to the success of the shows with the nighttime release slot, such as Loki. It aligns with the trend observed for Star Wars' live-action Disney Plus shows, and the animated projects within the Star Wars universe, such as The Bad Batch, will likely maintain their current release times. Meanwhile, the flagship shows like The Acolyte will be released earlier in the day, similar to the release schedule for Ahsoka.\n\nViewers can expect a captivating journey as The Acolyte Season 1 delves into the new mysteries and the ominous rise of the dark side.", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "disheeta_maheshwari@comingsoon.net", "name": "Disheeta Maheshwari", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_High_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: The High Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_finale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Series finale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ahsoka (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Bad_Batch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: The Bad Batch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loki (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Media_Conglomerates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Media Conglomerates", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/MixCollage-04-Jun-2024-04-20-AM-8910_03520f.jpg?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 823, "textEnd": 829}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-07-", "textStart": 953, "textEnd": 960}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Abrams' \"The Force Awakens,\" the strongest entries in the franchise have had one trait in common. Rian Johnson's \"The Last Jedi\" and Tony Gilroy's \"Andor\" both opted to take the franchise in bold new directions, opening up exciting new possibilities for what a \"Star Wars\" story could be. \"The Last Jedi\" steered the core narrative away from the Skywalker family, implying that anyone could become a Jedi and, therefore, a hero. \"Andor\" used familiar settings as the backdrop for an adult political drama about rebellion and imperial administration, rejecting heroes entirely in favor of the individuals who make up mass movements. Fans may not always have seen them as such -- \"The Last Jedi\" faced an infamous fan backlash, while \"Andor\" Season 1 paled in viewership to the likes of \"The Mandalorian\" -- but these projects offered a lifeline to a saga that's struggled to find a way forward, especially at the multiplex. Longevity requires vitality, which in turn requires flexibility.\n\n\"The Acolyte\" is not \"Andor\" or \"The Last Jedi,\" nor is it trying to be. (In fact, it's practically the inverse of Gilroy's show; where \"Andor\" eschews the supernatural in favor of foot soldiers, \"The Acolyte\" goes all-in on the Jedi order and its Force-wielding space wizards.) But the latest \"Star Wars\" series, created by Leslye Headland of \"Bachelorette\" and \"Russian Doll,\" shares with these predecessors a willingness to put its own spin on hallowed lore. In the four episodes -- of an eight-episode season -- shared with critics in advance, \"The Acolyte\" combines the classical elements that give \"Star Wars\" an evergreen appeal with new additions to the canon, a strong core cast and a brisk pace. The show also underscores a lesson \"Star Wars\" has taught itself in the past, though hasn't quite taken to heart: you don't need to recycle elements from the master narrative to make its offshoots compelling. In fact, the opposite approach is often more rewarding.\n\nSet a century before the collapse of the Republic in a kind of prequel to George Lucas' prequels, \"The Acolyte\" begins as a mystery. In the cold open, Jedi Master Andara (Carrie-Ann Moss) is confronted by a warrior (Amandla Stenberg) who appears to hold a personal grudge against Andara specifically and the Jedi writ large. Their deadly confrontation then cuts to a ship mechanic, Osha (also Stenberg), an ex-Jedi trainee who left the order six years earlier. Osha doesn't seem like the type to assault anyone with knives, but the Jedi sent to investigate a suspect matching her description, including her former classmate Yord (Charlie Barnett, in a \"Russian Doll\" reunion with Headland), have their doubts.\n\nYet \"The Acolyte\" is quick to explain the relationship between Stenberg's two characters, both to the audience and Osha's investigators. The show, it turns out, has more interesting topics to turn to, like the relationship between Osha and her onetime mentor Sol (\"Squid Game\" star Lee Jung-jae). Along with Andara, Sol was once stationed on Osha's home planet, where a fire took the lives of her entire family -- including, or so she thought, her twin sister, Mae. A then eight-year-old Osha went to Coruscant with Sol, who retains a guilt-inflected soft spot for his erstwhile student, while Mae trained with an anonymous master. No one says the words \"dark side\" or \"Sith,\" but the red lightsaber speaks for itself.\n\nThere are obvious echoes of Luke and Leia in the story of twins separated as young children, and Darth Vader in a villain who wears a mask and speaks with a distorted voice. But later episodes contain revelations that subvert, and even threaten to upend, our notions of the Jedi and binary conception of the Force.\n\nThe Jedi's fallibility has long been one of the most interesting, and underexplored, \"Star Wars\" themes. In their pursuit of a chosen one, the warrior monks inadvertently planted the seeds of their own destruction; Luke Skywalker grew so disillusioned with his life's work that he vowed the order would die with him. \"Star Wars\" has always, on some level, been a Greek tragedy disguised as a children's blockbuster. But while a slew of spinoffs can dilute a brand's cachet, as they have for corporate sibling Marvel, they can also allow for a narrow focus. When not forced to share (literal) space with armies and outlaws, the Jedi have never been as centered, nor as scrutinized, as they are in \"The Acolyte.\"\n\nLee's Sol emerges as the empathetic face of this ambivalence. Viewers familiar with the actor's work in South Korea won't be surprised to see him as an action hero with a heart, but to Americans who know him solely from the Netflix sensation, the role is a show of range on one of the biggest stages in English-language media. Stenberg, of course, gets to embrace her dual role, developing Mae and Osha's physicalities as well as their differing points of view on the Jedi. (Though it says something that even defender Osha chose not to join their ranks because she couldn't let go of emotion in her unprocessed grief.) Manny Jacinto plays Mae's accomplice, a performance that recalls his bumbling, goofy \"The Good Place\" character with more sinister undertones, and Dafne Keen of \"His Dark Materials\" conveys her sharply inquisitive young Padawan from under a mountain of makeup and CGI. Together, the ensemble riffs on established \"Star Wars\" types while making marks of their own.\n\n\"The Acolyte\" is propelled by plentiful action, much of it hand-to-hand combat heavily inflected with martial arts. (When Moss elegantly bounds up a railing in the opening scene, presumably assisted by wires, you could easily be watching a wuxia film.) But the action itself is rooted in conflict with stakes both large and small for characters we quickly come to care about. Whether Osha and Mae can come to some form of understanding is tied up in existential questions about whether the Jedi can be trusted, or trust themselves, as arbiters of justice. In giving itself permission to poke at \"Star Wars\" mythology, \"The Acolyte\" cultivates the same sense of curiosity it exhibits about its own universe. Too often, franchise series feel like a perfunctory exercise in expansion.

The series, created by Russian Doll co-creator Leslye Headland, is the latest entry in Disney+'s increasingly long line of live-action Star Wars shows. The Acolyte nonetheless has an identity all of its own -- one that allows it to exist both alongside and completely separate from every other Star Wars TV show and film that has come before it.\n\nSet around 100 years before the events of 1999's Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace, it's unburdened by the same unnecessary connections, Easter eggs, and timeline constraints that have dragged down so many of its fellow Disney+ shows, including Obi-Wan Kenobi, Ahsoka, and the most recent season of The Mandalorian. This makes watching the new series a refreshingly easy and -- most importantly of all -- genuinely fun experience.\n\nDespite dealing with darker material than The Mandalorian and Ahsoka (i.e., the potential reemergence of the Sith at the end of the High Republic era), The Acolyte balances its heaviest and lightest moments with relative ease and develops its characters so efficiently that becoming invested in its story and key relationships takes little to no effort on the viewer's part. The economy of storytelling on display and earnest performances given by its cast make it even easier to look past The Acolyte's few flaws.\n\nThe first thing that stands out about The Acolyte is its pace. The series wastes little to no time. Its first episode, written and directed by Headland, throws you headfirst into its story with a thrillingly staged fight sequence that not only serves as a dramatic starting point for its story but also concisely alludes to important past events that The Acolyte begins to fill in throughout its subsequent episodes. The show makes a forgivable blunder early in its season when it pauses its momentum in order to dedicate an entire installment to a prolonged flashback that's necessary to understand the full scope of its story but could -- and likely should -- have been cut down or interspersed with more present-day scenes.\n\nFor the most part, though, The Acolyte keeps itself and its story moving at a healthy clip by rooting its central mystery firmly in the relationships between its leads. Tasked with investigating the murder of a fellow member of the Jedi Order, the series follows Sol (Squid Game star Lee Jung-jae), a respective and contemplative Jedi Master, as he tracks down one of his former students and his case's No. 1 suspect, Osha (Bodies Bodies Bodies star Amandla Stenberg). Before long, Sol discovers that the crime he's investigating is connected to a larger conspiracy involving a vengeful Force user and at least one masked individual wielding a red lightsaber.\n\nAs Sol begins looking into the dark forces now surrounding the Jedi Order, he takes the chance to reflect not only on the fallout of his and Osha's relationship but also the tragedies that brought them together in the first place. Their story, one of deep regrets, miscommunications of the utmost importance, and shared guilt, is immediately reminiscent of past Star Wars relationships -- namely, those shared by Obi-Wan and Anakin, Anakin and Ahsoka, and Ahsoka and Sabine. Together, Lee and Stenberg breathe new life into Sol and Osha's bond, though, communicating deep emotions even in the most succinctly written of scenes.\n\nLee, in particular, shines as a Jedi Master grappling with the stoicism demanded by his occupation and the emotional intensity of his own personal connections, while Stenberg turns in a double-sided performance that only seems to grow more impressive the longer one spends with it.\n\nAcross The Acolyte's first four episodes, which were the only installments provided early to critics, Headland and her fellow writers surround Sol and Osha with a suitably ragtag group of memorable heroes and villains. Dafne Keen makes a memorable impression as Jecki Lon, Sol's smart and inquisitive young Padawan, while Jodie Turner-Smith brings considerable warmth and power to her performance as Mother Aniseya, a witch with a mysterious connection to Stenberg's Osha.\n\nOf the show's other noteworthy faces, Carrie-Anne Moss strikes an impressive figure as a Jedi Master named Indara and Manny Jacinto similarly stands out as Qimir, a rogue whose dislike for the Jedi seems to go further than he lets on. The Acolyte doesn't always succeed at casting its oddest characters, including Aniseya and her fellow witches, in the most convincing light, but its actors and consistently brisk pace always prevent it from losing complete control of its tone and sprawling narrative.\n\nVisually, The Acolyte's reliance on warm, golden hues and vibrant purples, yellows, and reds helps it stand apart from its fellow Star Wars shows. The washed-out exterior scenes of The Mandalorian and the steely blues and grays of Andor are nowhere to be seen here. The series' use of steady pans and static shots throughout its hand-to-hand fight scenes similarly make its debt to martial arts-inspired genre films like The Matrix explicitly clear and also give The Acolyte's action sequences a refined edge that both elevates it and further reinforces the polished nature of its High Republic setting. The show, notably, succeeds at simultaneously communicating the Jedi Order's power at the time of The Acolyte and hinting through key details and procedural rules how the organization will go on to change for the worse in the intervening years between its story and the events of The Phantom Menace.\n\nIn addition to the flashback-driven miscalculation it makes early in its season, The Acolyte stumbles over a few gaps in logic that are all but guaranteed to pull you out of it at different points -- if only momentarily. The series lacks Andor's sharp wit and constant thrum of tension and, therefore, falls short of that show's high standards. It is, however, more focused than The Mandalorian, more original than The Book of Boba Fett, better paced and performed than Ahsoka, and freer to actually do what it wants than Obi-Wan Kenobi ever was. Whether it will ultimately stick the landing remains to be seen, but it does enough right in its first four episodes to inspire confidence in this writer that it will. The series reminds you how vast and inviting the Star Wars universe once felt before it was rendered stale by so many uninspired movies and TV shows. That in and of itself is an achievement.\n\nThe first two episodes of The Acolyte premiere Tuesday, June 4, on Disney+. New episodes release weekly on Tuesdays.

The show explores themes of trauma and corruption and takes place at the end of the High Republic era. Stenberg plays Mae, a character with a strong connection to the Force and complicated family dynamics.\n\nFor Amandla Stenberg, the \"Star Wars\" franchise is about how trauma affects everyone and how the inability to accept and process it makes people more vulnerable to corruption.\n\nThe \"Hunger Games\" actor stars in the new eight-episode Star Wars series \"The Acolyte\" on Disney+ as Mae, a character with complicated family problems and a strong connection to the Force. There is \"a lot of family drama,\" Stenberg said in an interview.\n\n\"The Acolyte\" takes place at the end of the fictional High Republic era, about 100 years before the events of the 1999 film \"Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace.\" Things take a turn when Mae is accused of murder and a Jedi master named Sol, played by Lee Jung-jae, is sent to investigate - but finds out there are greater powers at work.\n\nMae becomes allies with the former smuggler Qimir, played by Manny Jacinto, and together they embark on a journey. \"Well, the show is anchored in a murder mystery, for one, and you layer that with the action of the lightsaber fights, you layer that with the practicality of the sets, I think all of these elements combine to just offer something different for the fans,\" Jacinto said in an interview at the show's premiere.\n\n\"The Acolyte\" begins streaming on Disney+ on Wednesday. Series creator Leslye Headland praised George Lucas for doing a brilliant job of telling the story of the fall of the Jedi, which set the groundwork for this science-fiction series.\n\nThe show reveals a different iteration of the Force than that which the Jedi use, a form used by a coven of witches from the planet Brendock, who raised Mae. \"As far as the witches of Brendock are concerned, the Jedi don't necessarily feel that they should be using The Force, right?\" said Jodie Turner-Smith, who plays Mae's mother, Aniseya, who is known for the movie \"Queen & Slim.\"\n\n\"So, they represent people that exist outside what is supposed to be allowed or OK, right? And so that presents its own conversations, so then what does that mean and what does that say about the world? And what does that say about the Jedi?\" she added.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_High_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: The High Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lightsaber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smuggling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smuggling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Jacinto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manny Jacinto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodie_Turner-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jodie Turner-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Lucas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast syndication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Witchcraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/01_04_2019_19_29_06_9517358.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Lucas eventually went back on his own rule by including the animated Wookiee Jedi named Gungi, though he still held off on including them in live-action. Through The Acolyte's portrayal of a Wookiee Jedi, depth is added to the Jedi Order of the High Republic Era, while offering compelling story potential and expanding the Star Wars universe. SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe Acolyte's Wookiee Jedi breaks one of the oldest rules formed by Star Wars creator George Lucas. Set in Star Wars' High Republic Era, The Acolyte takes place around 100 years before Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. This means that the show adds a lot to the earliest parts of Star Wars' chronological timeline, aligning with the canon stories told in the multimedia initiative of The High Republic.\n\nFurthermore, The Acolyte serves as a prequel to George Lucas' prequel trilogy, exploring the rise of Sith-aligned power that led to the emergence of the Galactic Empire. The Acolyte's cast of characters is placed at the center of this story, thus meaning they feed heavily into the story, themes, and depiction of the galaxy shown in Lucas' prequels. Although The Acolyte slots seamlessly into the Star Wars timeline, the inclusion of one specific character proves the show is going against one of Lucas' oldest rules for the Star Wars saga.\n\nRelated Star Wars: Every Major Event Of The High Republic Era\n\nThe High Republic Era is full of significant events, both for the Jedi Order and the Republic it sought to protect long before the prequels.\n\nGeorge Lucas Forbade Wookiee Jedi (For A Time) The Concept Of Wookiee Jedi Was Something Lucas Did Not Wish To Focus On\n\nThe rule in question is that, for a time, George Lucas denied the creation of Wookiee Jedi in Star Wars. In The Acolyte, one of the show's main characters goes directly against this rule. This character is Kelnacca, a Wookiee Jedi who is central to the plot of The Acolyte's Jedi murders and a well-respected Master in the High Republic's Jedi ranks.\n\nMaster Kelnacca is portrayed by Joonas Suotamo, the actor who took over the role of Chewbacca from Peter Mayhew in the Disney era of Star Wars.\n\nKelnacca will be the first Wookiee Jedi ever depicted in live-action Star Wars, proving how deep-rooted George Lucas' rule went. Despite live-action Star Wars consisting of several stories over four decades, Wookiee Jedi have remained absent until the story of The Acolyte. That said, The Acolyte is not completely rejecting Lucas' vision, as the director did become more lenient about the concept over time. Eventually, Lucas approved Star Wars' Wookiee Jedi Gungi, who appeared in animated projects like The Clone Wars and The Bad Batch.\n\nStar Wars Has Officially Given Up On Lucas' Wookiee Jedi Rule Force-Sensitive Wookiees Are Now A Part Of Star Wars Lore\n\nThanks to Gungi's reappearance in Star Wars: The Bad Batch and Kelnacca's role in The Acolyte, Lucas' Wookiee Jedi rule has been completely shattered. For some, this may seem like flagrant disrespect of Lucas' vision despite the director reversing the rule himself in The Clone Wars. However, the rule was admittedly thin upon its creation, with Lucas never providing any compelling reason as to why Wookiee Jedi could not be created.\n\nRelated Star Wars: The Acolyte's Wookiee Jedi Explained: Who Is Kelnacca?\n\nJedi Master Kelnacca is the first Wookiee Jedi ever depicted in live-action Star Wars, but there's so much more to his character and personality.\n\nGiven the flimsy foundations of Lucas' forbidden Jedi rule, Star Wars reversing this makes a lot of sense. Moreover, the story potential that is raised with Wookiee Jedi is incredibly compelling. Gungi became a fan-favorite Star Wars character fairly quickly, and many are excited to see more of Kelnacca in The Acolyte. Seeing a Star Wars species that is not typically associated with the Force being a Jedi will always be intriguing, something the High Republic understands. Through The Acolyte, Star Wars' first live-action Wookiee Jedi is here, breaking Lucas' rule and, hopefully, paving the way for many more.\n\nThe Acolyte\n\nThe Acolyte is a television series set in the Star Wars universe at the end of the High Republic Era, where both the Jedi and the Galactic Empire were at the height of their influence. This sci-fi thriller sees a former Padawan reunite with her former Jedi Master as they investigate several crimes - all leading to darkness erupting from beneath the surface and preparing to bring about the end of the High Republic.\n\nCast Dafne Keen , Lee Jung-jae , Amandla Stenberg , Jodie Turner-Smith , Joonas Suotamo , Carrie-Anne Moss , Margarita Levieva , Charlie Barnett , Dean-Charles

Like Kylo Ren says in The Last Jedi, sometimes we have to let the past die -- but that can also be a good thing, as The Acolyte proves.\n\nThe new Star Wars series is set in a time long before Anakin Skywalker fell to the dark side, before Order 66, and long before Luke Skywalker rose up to meet his destiny and save the galaxy from the Empire's clutches. Instead of that story, or anything with loose ties to it like The Mandalorian, viewers will get to explore a world that is familiar but also different through Mae and Osha (played by Amandla Stenberg).\n\nSet against the backdrop of the High Republic era, viewers will examine a time of peace and prosperity for the Jedi Order and how everything is threatened when an ominous darkness begins to rise. Our story opens with Mae, the titular Acolyte who is out for blood against the Jedi over a past transgression.\n\nHer sister Osha used to be part of the order, but now lives a quiet life as a mechnic on the outer rim of the galaxy. A quiet life, that is, until Mae sets out on her quest for revenge, leading Osha's former Jedi Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae) to investigate.\n\nStenberg leads the cast well in both roles, lending each character their own quirks and habits. Similar they may be, but Stenberg never feels like she is phoning it in with either role. Mae and Osha aren't the same even if they look it, and it's intriguing to see how Stenberg approaches the light and dark in both characters.\n\nRead more: The Acolyte cast hail Amandla Stenberg as an 'amazing leading woman'\n\nThe actor is supported by a large ensemble cast, including Lee Jung-jae, Manny Jacinto, Dafne Keen and Charlie Barnett. Lee slots easily into the typical father figure we've often seen in the franchise as Master Sol, and is an apt scene partner to Stenberg. While Jacinto, who stars as smuggler Qimir, suits the role he's been given because he provides a similar level of entertainment value as he did in his star-turning role in The Good Place.\n\nKeen and Barnett's Jecki and Yord also feel right at home in this time period, even if it may take time to really get to know their characters and warm up to them.\n\nFrom the four episodes given to press, it's clear that The Acolyte has an old school Star Wars feel to it, helped no doubt by the fact creator Leslye Headland is a fan and wanted to come into the series from a fan's perspective. It's obvious from the cinematography to the characters and the script that a lot of thought has been put into the series to make it pay homage to George Lucas' iconic films, but still ensure that it stands on its own merit.\n\nThere's no over-reliance on fan service or callbacks (or should we say foreshadowing) in the first half of the season, and The Acolyte fits into the franchise while also adding something new to it. There's some excellent action sequences -- though they feature sparingly in the show -- and there are also interesting beats to the narrative.\n\nEpisode 3 is the only one that feels a touch out of place, not because it doesn't do interesting things to Star Wars lore (it most certainly does) but as a flashback episode it feels like its shown to viewers a little too soon to have as much of an impact as it could.\n\nRegardless, The Acolyte relies on one large mystery: who is pulling Mae's strings? By this, we mean the masked Sith leading her down a dark path. The character only makes brief appearances in the first four episodes, and though they're intriguing enough to want to know more about they're also hard to judge when there's so little to go on.\n\nHopefully Headland's decision to play the long game with viewers will ultimately play off.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_High_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: The High Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylo_Ren", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylo Ren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acolyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acolyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Skywalker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Skywalker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darth Vader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Barnett_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Barnett (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Place", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Good Place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_figure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Father figure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_cast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ensemble cast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smuggling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smuggling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dafne_Keen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dafne Keen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Jacinto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manny Jacinto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Lucas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flashback (narrative)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Roleplaying", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wAyUzNVLficE9f8ye2IXNA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04Nzg7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-06/15ecf530-21b6-11ef-bbbf-e2ab5be9472e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Of the cast, my favorite characters so far are Jedi Master Sol and the Padawan Jecki Lon, both of whom seem to have the best heads on their shoulders.\n\nAs for the story itself, in the first two episodes we learn of the assassin and her mission, but we don't ever fully understand what happened in her backstory that makes her so vulnerable to the Dark Side and to her mysterious Master.\n\nThe show itself is certainly a step up in quality from Obi-Wan or Boba Fett, but I wouldn't call it great -- though I'm only two episodes in. It could go either way. I like that you don't need to have as much knowledge of previous animated shows like you did in Ahsoka, though overall I'd probably put this series about on the same level as that show. It's fine -- leagues better than the third season of The Mandalorian -- but not as good as the first two seasons of Mando, and certainly nowhere near as impressive or compelling as Andor, though there is a lot more Jedi fighting, and the Jedi fighting is pretty fun.\n\nIt's also quite obviously the most diverse Star Wars show so far, though at times it can come across as as almost parodical, and I suspect that we'll get lots and lots of YouTube content about this in the coming weeks. Personally, I think Andor handled diversity the best of any Star Wars show so far, creating a more diverse series with nuance and authenticity.\n\nFundamentally, my mind is just not made up one way or another at this point. I am enjoying The Acolyte, but it's far from great. Maybe it builds into something truly phenomenal -- the \"Frozen meets Kill Bill\" its co-creator Leslye Headland sold it as. Maybe it follows the dark path so many Disney Star Wars series have followed. We shall see.\n\nI'm two episodes in and will have further thoughts later on, as well as recap/reviews for each of the coming six episodes (for a total of eight).

The Acolyte is the latest show set in the Star Wars universe and has something quite new to offer. While every live-action Star Wars movie and show has been set in the same general time period (all surrounding the Skywalkers), this show is set 100 years before the rise of the Galactic Empire. It is a time of peace during the High Republic era, and the Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic have coexisted without war for centuries. But a series of crimes threatens to unravel it all in this perfectly watchable series.\n\nThe first four episodes of The Acolyte generally provide what we are expecting from this show. It's nice to have a show that's set so far away from the Skywalker Saga that it can't rely too heavily on familiar faces. All this show can do is provide a decent story. Leslye Headland, director of films like Bachelorette and Sleeping with Other People and the TV show Russian Doll, makes her Star Wars debut here. She brings a unique perspective to this galaxy, taking a somewhat familiar idea and bringing it into this world.\n\nThe show begins with a crime that kicks off the events of the rest of the episodes. The fight scene at the beginning is well-choreographed. It's clear that there was a lot of care that went into crafting engaging fights, which was occasionally missing from Obi-Wan Kenobi and Ahsoka. It's filmed in wides and there are elements of martial arts in it, while also drilling home Yoda's lesson: \"A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.\" From there, we follow Osha (Amandla Stenberg), a former Padawan who left the Jedi Order. She is the prime suspect for the crime and finds herself on a prison transport.\n\nAfterwards, we have an entertaining prison break sequence that feels somewhat more fresh for Star Wars. There are a few elements that work well, like the occasional psychological thriller elements that may remind one of the cave sequence in The Empire Strikes Back. The ending of the first episode features a strong hook and sets up an excellent premise for the rest of the show. Even though there is an element that we have seen before in other films and shows, it's an idea that fits very well into this galaxy. The Acolyte is more of a mystery crime drama than any other Star Wars show.\n\nAt the beginning of the show, it can feel a bit like The Fugitive set in the Star Wars galaxy. However, as revelations are made, some of those elements get lost a bit too early. We are also introduced to Sol, a Jedi Master who used to train Osha. Sol is portrayed by Lee Jung-jae, a South Korean actor who recently gained international recognition for his lead role in Squid Game. He fits into the galaxy very well and he portrays a tenderness that is necessary for the character. Each of the first four episodes are fine, but none reach a level of greatness that can be expected from one of the most well-known media franchises of all time.\n\nThere are several crimes committed and we know they are all driven by revenge. But the weight of these crimes can ring hollow because we don't see what led to the revenge first. Episode 3 is crucial to developing the backstory of the characters we see on screen, with the majority of the runtime being a flashback. There's a sequence surrounding witches that feels a little bit wacky for this universe, but it's not a bad idea. Furthermore, the visuals can be a bit bland and desaturated at times. Some of the character relationships don't feel as lived in as they could, and some of that lies with the writing and direction.\n\nThe Acolyte works least when it's going for comedy. It's not a comedy show, of course, but all Star Wars has its moments of levity. This one doesn't work. One episode features possibly the least funny execution of a Gilligan cut I've ever seen. To define the term, this is when a character says, \"there is no way I'm doing this!\" and then we cut to them doing it with the occasional accompaniment of \"I can't believe I'm doing this!\" It doesn't work because it's such a comedic clich\u00e9 that the punchline is predictable, and rather than a hard cut, there's an establishing shot between setup and punchline. Another moment nearby isn't very funny, but the light music seems to be signaling the audience to laugh.\n\nThere's a bit of a compelling mystery surrounding who the big bad is. We have a few antagonists that we follow, but much like the Emperor, there is a looming villain in charge of everything behind the scenes. My only guess is that the villain is Darth Plagueis, but that's the mystery that will get Star Wars fans like me to keep watching. This is not the worst we've seen from Star Wars TV, nor is it the best. There are some practical sets, but a few of the character relationships and backgrounds are not as compelling as they could be. It's not the most impressive thing we've seen in this galaxy, but it's got something going.\n\nSCORE: 6/10\n\nAs ComingSoon's review policy explains, a score of 6 equates to \"Decent.\" It fails to reach its full potential and is a run-of-the-mill experience.", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_sim@comingsoon.net", "name": "Jonathan Sim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Galactic Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Doll_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Doll (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(Star_Wars)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galactic Empire (Star Wars)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ahsoka (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fugitive_(1963_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Fugitive (1963 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Empire_Strikes_Back", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Empire Strikes Back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obi-Wan Kenobi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_thriller", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychological thriller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yoda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Galaxies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Galaxies", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/PDX-058458_R.jpg?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Leslye Headland, the creator and show-runner of the Star Wars series, set 100 years before the Skywalker saga, was apparently impressed with Moss's work in The Matrix movies; she has been quoted describing Indara as \"Trinity with a lightsaber!\"\n\n\"Carrie-Anne Moss felt like an essential part of establishing, first of all the tone of the show, and also to pull you in to the universe that we were establishing,\" Leslye said over a video call from Los Angeles. \"Without her power and skill, I'm not sure we would have been able to achieve the magnetic energy of starting the show, of getting the ball rolling.\"\n\n'Ahsoka' series review: Rosario Dawson's 'Star Wars' spin-off is bright, tight and terribly thrilling\n\nThe show, which follows an investigation into the killing of Jedi masters, also features Manny Jacinto as a retired smuggler living the good life, Dafne Keen as a young padwan, and Jodie Turner-Smith and Rebecca Henderson as differently powerful Jedi masters, among others. \"I was lucky as the cast were all my first choices. I didn't have any other ideas besides the actors that ended up being in the show, so I'm grateful they agreed to do it.\"\n\nWhen pitching the series to Lucasfilm, the 43-year-old co-creator of Russian Doll described The Acolyte as \"Frozen meets Kill Bill.\" \"The Kill Bill inspiration obviously comes from a lot of martial arts films, which includes the Shaw Brothers, Kurosawa and others.\" Ang Lee's martial arts drama Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (2000) was also a muse for The Acolyte, Leslye said.\n\n\"It was an inspiration not just for the fighting, but also for the sweeping epic-ness, which felt like something that was worth modelling ourselves after. Kill Bill gives you a sense of the genre you are watching. And Frozen represents the relationship between the two girls and how complicated that is.\"\n\n'Star Wars: Visions' Volume 2 review: Nine pint-size powerhouses, including one from India, sparkle in this 'Star Wars'-inspired anthology\n\n(L-R): Director Leslye Headland and Lee Jung-jae on the set of Lucasfilm's THE ACOLYTE, exclusively on Disney+. \u00a92024 Lucasfilm Ltd. & TM.

It's almost like Star Wars has been in my life since I was a little kid. Each part of my life, my childhood, my adolescence, my young adulthood, all had a version of Star Wars to hang on to and love. From the original trilogy, Special Editions to the prequels, every time there was a new piece of Star Wars media, there was something else to love.\"\n\n(L-R, front row): Yord Fandar (Charlie Barnett), Jedi Padawan Jecki Lon (Dafne Keen) and Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae) in Lucasfilm's THE ACOLYTE, exclusively on Disney+. \u00a92024 Lucasfilm Ltd. & TM.

One of them I can't say because it's a little bit of a spoiler (laughs). I felt giving the show a provocative name, identifying a role or position would make the audience wonder, which one of these characters is the acolyte? It would add to the mystery and hopefully get people to tune in and keep watching to have more revealed.\"\n\nThe first two episodes of The Acolyte drops on Disney+ Hotstar on June 5 with weekly

Instead of expanding the universe in new ways, the corporate dream machine plugged into familiar characters and artifacts. Recent series hinged upon the adventures of young-ish Obi-Wan Kenobi and younger Leia, adult Ahsoka, and an unmasked Boba Fett.\n\nAt least \"The Mandalorian\" expands the culture behind some very familiar armor using characters most viewers knew nothing about before watching it.\n\n\"Star Wars: The Acolyte\" does something similar with the franchise's most emblematic figures, which would be a snooze if not for their role in a story that asks us to question our presumed faith in their righteousness.\n\nGenerations who came of age with George Lucas' fantasies had the light versus dark side, Jedi versus Sith dichotomy drilled into us along with the assurance that Force-wielders, besides being special, belonged to one team or the other. The first six movies packaged this alongside an unsubtle version of misogyny: nearly all human Jedi with lines were white guys until Samuel L. Jackson.\n\n\"Acolyte\" creator and showrunner Leslye Headland wipes those images away within the opening frames of the series when a young woman (Amandla Stenberg) rolls up to Master Indara (Carrie-Anne Moss) in a tavern and challenges her to fight. The ensuing battle is a slice of straight-up action movie fan fic, pitting Trinity from \"The Matrix\" movies against an ace fighter with a vendetta a la \"Kill Bill\" - except, again, this is \"Star Wars.\"\n\nHeadland, who co-created \"Russian Doll,\" knows exactly which buttons she's pushing by leading with this scene in the same way Disney and Lucasfilm are cunning to use an economic montage of its highlights to promote the show.\n\nBoth women are unknown characters, with one of them representing an unknown faction. The show itself arrives in a cloud of mystery, limiting which specifics we can detail.\n\nWhat I can say is that Headland takes a relatively ordinary plot device and uses it as a vehicle to do some quietly revolutionary storytelling - again, by \"Star Wars\" standards.\n\nLee Jung-jae and Carrie-Anne Moss in \"Star Wars: The Acolyte\" (Lucasfilm/Disney+)\n\nLiberated from most aspects of the Skywalker saga, she and her writers take a relatively simple fugitive mystery tale and use it to remind us of the patriarchal and spiritual colonialism inherent to the galaxy's foremost religious order.\n\nIt's also a ripping, nimbly paced action series that knows its audience and knows how to exploit this fandom's strengths and weak spots. Let's just say that Moss isn't the main star here. That honor goes to Stenberg, who plays two roles, Osha and Mae, along with \"Squid Game\" star Lee Jung-jae as Sol, a Jedi Master tasked with finding a rogue Force user whose skills are formidable and troubling.\n\n\"The Acolyte\" is set a century before the rise of the Empire when the Jedi Order managed the galaxy - meaning, lots of rough robes, humming lightsabers and battles between opponents who fling each other around without touching. But it also pre-dates many other traditions which may be why Lee and other stars seem freer to emote.\n\nNo new addition to this entertainment catalog can be entirely divorced from everything we've already seen. In the slightest details of that opaque description, we recognize a few repeating refrains: Osha and Mae are twins. The Jedi's adversary is presumably evil; we already know of such a group. Perhaps this show explores their origins, but the four episodes provided for review don't show anything definitive that would indicate that.\n\nDriving the season is a straightforward crime-solving arc that seems simplistic next to the do-or-die sagas driving nearly every other installment in this library besides \"Andor.\" The ticking time bomb in \"The Acolyte\" ostensibly comes down to saving a group of individuals that the galaxy probably wouldn't miss from a nobody with an axe to grind. There are no planets at stake, no rebellion whose survival teeters on a knife's edge.\n\nSome people are going to absolutely hate that.\n\nBut in the same way that \"Andor\" used its title character to navigate a parable about how fascism has a way of rising from rampant corporate greed, \"The Acolyte\" is at its best when it asks both its protagonists and the audience to question our blind faith in the concept of so-called law and order.\n\nIt hints that in an opening title card that forgoes the long crawl to simply describe the era as a time of peace, explaining that The Jedi Order and the Galactic Republic \"have prospered for centuries without war.\" For such a political arrangement to prosper, there must be the necessary tension of an antagonist being kept at bay. As a perfectly reasonable character points out in an upcoming episode, some conflicts don't originate from which side is \"good\" and which is \"bad\": \"This is about power,\" they say, \"and who is allowed to use it.\"\n\nCharlie Barnett and Dafne Keen in \"Star Wars: The Acolyte\" (Lucasfilm/Disney+)\n\nMoss may beckon viewers to \"The Acolyte,\" but beyond her role, the show places the most weight on Stenberg, who evokes a natural duality in her sisters that sidesteps the usual pitfalls of such performances.\n\nThe opening quartet of installments doesn't feature her acting against herself yet, which is the real test of how well an actor pulls off believably playing her double. But she plays the more shadowed of the siblings without any of the flat spikes and splinters of pure evil that inform most of the hostile beings in this universe.\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nLee balances this with a performance soaked in empathy and regret, granting his physical confrontations with the lost soul he's tracking a hint of operatic pathos. Setting this bar allows the actors playing other knights of his order and his padawan Jecki Lon (Dafne Keen) to accordingly relax or stiffen up.\n\nCharlie Barnett's Yord Fandar is wound especially tight when it comes to dealing with Osha, which doesn't allow for the actor to showcase the admirable range and subtleties of which he avails himself in \"Russian Doll.\" Mae, on the other hand, has a lazy and barely trustworthy smuggler pal Qimir (Manny Jacinto), making it tough to determine which sister is on the less desirable team.\n\nUltimately these characters' personalities matter less than what they represent on the moral scale instead of how closely they hew to established \"Star Wars\" canon. \"The Acolyte\" carries fewer of those weights, allowing it the space to reconsider our dogmatic devotion to one of cinema's exemplary institutions of heroism.\n\nThere's much to appreciate about a show that cunningly strives not only to be deemed good but to make us redefine what that means. And it only took looking farther into this saga's distant past to move ahead in ways its storytelling can challenge us.", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie-Anne_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carrie-Anne Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucasfilm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ahsoka (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canon (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Obi-Wan Kenobi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acolyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acolyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Matrix (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sith", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Lucas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galaxy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boba_Fett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boba Fett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Leia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Princess Leia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_L._Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samuel L.

Is this even a movie? It was something that I had never seen before,\" Lee tells NextShark. \"It really piqued my curiosity.

The primary suspect in the Jedi murders is Osha, played by Amandla Stenberg, a former Padawan and Sol's student turned freighter mechanic. As Sol delves deeper into the investigation, the boundaries between good and evil blur, forcing him to resurrect a dark family secret to catch the killer.\n\nAccording to Lee, he had to thoroughly understand the Jedi's golden age and the ensuing turmoil in order to perfectly integrate into the \"Star Wars\" universe. He wanted to capture the nuances of being a Jedi master within the Jedi society, aiming to convey both the seriousness of the ongoing investigations and the peacefulness of the Jedi environment.\n\nTrending on NextShark: Interview: 'Atlas' star Simu Liu reflects on AI technology and his 'terrifying' turn as a robot villain\n\nWhen it came to the action scenes, Lee's fight training and choreography was designed to feel grounded in reality. This approach involved realistic fight scenes rather than fantasy-driven moves, adding authenticity to the show's action sequences.\n\nLee, who was already a famous actor in South Korea before reaching global stardom following his lead role in \"Squid Game,\" did not experience significant culture shock transitioning from the Korean entertainment industry to a Hollywood production, as he says the systems of shooting and actor preparation are quite similar. However, Lee was surprised by the immense scale and detailed focus of the \"Star Wars\" production, noting that it stands out as its own unique experience compared to typical Korean and American projects.\n\nTrending on NextShark: Heartfelt Film Reveals Hidden Struggles of Child Translators in Immigrant Families\n\nThe 51-year-old actor expressed immense gratitude for being able to be part of the iconic franchise, feeling particularly grateful for the opportunity to represent the Asian community.\n\n\"I still had doubts of whether I could pull off this role, but Leslye really gave me a lot of courage,\" Lee says. \"I feel very honored to be part of the 'Star Wars' franchise. I mean, it's hard for me to believe it even now. There's so much to be thankful for.\"\n\nHe also appreciated working with Stenberg, praising her leadership and performance, and the enthusiasm and positivity that the child actors brought on set.\n\nTrending on NextShark: Remembering Tenzing Norgay, the unsung trailblazer of Mount Everest\n\n\"While accomplishing their roles excellently, they were having so much fun on set,\" Lee says. \"I learned a lot from them. I realized that even if it's a very difficult scene that you have to go through, if you have a positive attitude, then it can be really fun as well.

Not only is this Star Wars series a crime thriller about a dangerous assailant taking out Jedi -- it's also set about 100 years before The Phantom Menace. Free from the shackles of the Skywalker Saga, Disney had a chance to reassess this beloved fictional universe that is creaking under the weight of its canon.\n\nThere are traces of that potential throughout this series, which takes place in an age when the Jedi Order is at its most powerful, patrolling the galaxy to right wrongs for the Galactic Republic. The Acolyte comes near the end of the High Republic era, following Jedi Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae) as he attempts to unravel the mystery behind an ongoing murder spree which threatens to destabilize the Jedi Order and sow discord with the public.\n\nI had a chance to watch the first four episodes ahead of The Acolyte's premiere, and I walked away with more questions than answers. Unfortunately, those questions had nothing to do with the actual plot or the murder mystery at the heart of the show. Rather, I wondered how this was the show that so many incredibly talented people decided to make.\n\nLeslye Headland, who previously co-created Netflix's brilliantly funny sci-fi dramedy Russian Doll, serves as creator and executive producer on The Acolyte. She also has writing credits on two episodes and directed two more. In Russian Doll, Headlead and her collaborators dreamed up some deeply weird, unique, and relatable characters, including Natasha Lyonne as a game developer stuck in an endless time loop on her 36th birthday.\n\nSave for a mystery driving its plot, The Acolyte has very little in common with Russian Doll. That includes the characters, few of whom are imbued with an ounce of ingenuity. Amandla Stenberg, who plays twins Mae and Osha, is charismatic, and does her best to serve as the show's dueling emotional cores, but she's fighting an uphill battle. Yes, the Jedi are under attack, but in this era, the Jedi appear to be overstepping the limits of their responsibility. So we're not really meant to root for the Jedi, but we don't want to see them murdered in cold blood, either.\n\nThe muddled messaging made it fairly difficult to invest in any of these characters, which was compounded by the uninspired writing. Dialogue is often dull and repetitive, characters change their minds (and occasionally their entire personalities) on a whim whenever the story calls for it, and the archetypes are so familiar and played out that none of our heroes or villains feel new or different from any other live-action Star Wars show.\n\nOne annoying question I've been guilty of asking in the past: Who is this show for? The Acolyte is clearly for Star Wars fans. There are Jedi, lightsabers, crazy alien species, intergalactic travel, and dangerous villains in formidable helmets. The problem is that, much like in Ahsoka or The Book of Boba Fett, they aren't put to good use.\n\nFour episodes in, I'm struggling to connect. I am excited about the doors that this series opens for relationships and characters that have never gotten their time in the sun(s) of the Star Wars universe, but I'm frustrated that this is where they're being rolled out. I want to send Sol, Osha, and Mae on an urgent, thrilling adventure, not an overstuffed miniseries bogged down by lore and flashbacks and Easter eggs we've seen too many times before.\n\nThere are still four episodes I haven't seen, so I'm holding out hope that the back half of this series can kick on the hyperdrive and give me something to cheer about.", "source": {"uri": "bgr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BGR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_siegal@bgr.com", "name": "Jacob Siegal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Doll_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian Doll (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crime fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_High_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: The High Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canon (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galactic Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedy drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_loop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Time loop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natasha_Lyonne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natasha Lyonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Science fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ahsoka (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Boba_Fett", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Book of Boba Fett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyperspace"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Murder_Mystery", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Murder Mystery", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/The-Acolyte.jpg?resize=1200%2C628", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Over the last few years, Lucasfilm has toyed with different answers to that question. The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Andor have found, to varying degrees of success, that nostalgia can only take you so far. Why play in this IP sandbox if not to reframe what's come before and reshape what's yet to happen?\n\nWith The Acolyte, which premieres June 4 on Disney+, writer-director Leslye Headland (Russian Doll) has crafted an intriguing entry into this decades-spanning franchise that thrills precisely for the way it repurposes well-worn Star Wars tropes all while threading a brand-new tale anchored by a slew of fresh characters. On its surface, Headland thrusts into a Jedi noir tale: Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae) along with his Padawan Jecki Lon (Dafne Keen) and young Jedi Knight Yord Fandar (Charlie Barnett) are tasked with solving a case involving the rare murder of a Jedi master. Yet the more Sol and these Jedi investigate what and who is behind this killing (and the threat of more deaths to come), they uncover a history Sol thought he and his brethren had buried long ago.\n\nFrom its very first scene, The Acolyte is intent on cheekily nudging to long-storied images and set pieces from Stars Wars of yore. We're in a cantina and a mysterious, robed character arrives in search of a Jedi master whom she intends to fight. She's laughed at and mocked on sight. Battling any Jedi is a fool's errand, especially since our mysterious figure refuses to wield a weapon. The Jedi are trained to never partake in such combat. But soon, and without a weapon to show, the robed figure causes enough of a ruckus to merit the impatience if not ire of the Jedi at hand whose physical appearance and fight-like reflexes will have you thinking of The Matrix's Trinity. But such winking casting is helping in setting the scene: Carrie-Anne Moss would play the kind of Jedi you'd never want to be up against. The fight that ensues -- not to mention the glint of recognition Master Indara voices when she realizes who's come to hurt her -- is enough to pique audience interest. The Jedi won't face the threat of the Sith for another hundred years. So who could be trying to settle scores with them so many generations before the Skywalker saga is set in motion?\n\nThat's the question that drives Master Sol, who finds himself embroiled in this entire affair when he learns a former Padawan of his may have been involved. Again, there's no way to hear of such a premise without it echoing the intertwined fates of, say, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker, or, later still, of Luke Skywalker and Kylo Ren. The vexed relationship between mentor and mentee, between Master and Padawan, is as old as Star Wars itself, and such twinned stories have long been fertile ground for the series. But in Headland's hands, such a connection feels less like a capitulation to only ever telling one kind of Star Wars story and more like a sense that such cyclical tragedies are inherent in spaces where youth and its attendant obstinance are treated with unwavering hostility.\n\nThe Jedi order depends on a strict kind of obedience. Theirs is a community built on the removal of individuality for the sake of the whole. It's why feelings and attachments are so looked down upon. As The Acolyte unspools its intricately woven storyline around who's behind these mysterious Jedi murders and what they have to do with a confrontation between several Jedi and an order of a different kind many years before, Headland and her cast and crew create competing and complementary ways of examining what that kind of obedience (to fate, to the Force, to family) can do to folks who feel hamstrung by such demands. That's what Amandla Stenberg, arguably the lead of the show, is called to play. On screen, the Hate U Give actor offers viewers plenty of textured examples of what it means to try to pave a path for yourself against those who wish to trace it for you.\n\nAnd really, once The Acolyte begins broadening its mythology, with awe-inspiring flashbacks (and by episode four, a shocking cliffhanger of a reveal), you have to admit that even as it toys with familiar beats (betrayal! revenge!) and expected characterizations (there may only be one way to play a weathered old Jedi Master), this latest Star Wars series has big ambitions in bridging the franchise into a whole new world -- and, perhaps, attract a new audience in the process. After all, you don't cast the likes of Barnett (the sexiest Jedi since Ewan McGregor?), Manny Jacinto (a charming former smuggler who lights up the screen whenever he shows up), and Jodie Turner-Smith (a witchy mother figure who's as transfixing as you'd imagine) to merely play into just well-known franchise types.\n\nWhat perhaps makes The Acolyte such an engaging and addictive watch (over the first four episodes screened for critics, at least) is its commitment to not treating the Jedi (or the Star Wars franchise writ large) as untouchable. If anything, Sol, Indara, and the like become figures through which the series pokes holes at the revered Jedi Order in a way that feels necessary if you're to think of this world as an ethically ambiguous morass where everyone is trying to do their best and finding, in due time, that, yes, even Jedi are fallible.", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nAs the latest Star Wars spin-off, The Acolyte, arrives on Disney+, it's worth considering if we have all been too harsh towards the entertainment giant's stewardship of the franchise from a galaxy, far, far away. Yes, some of Disney's contributions to the saga have been ricketier than the Millennium Falcon halfway through The Empire Strikes Back. But it wasn't as if Star Wars creator George Lucas was without blemish. He gave us psychopathic teddy bears the Ewoks, the apocalyptically irritating Jar Jar Binks and, in Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen, the on-screen couple with the worst chemistry in cinema history. Star Wars had been misfiring on all cylinders long before the Mouse House caught the saga in its tractor beam.\n\nIt should be acknowledged that, at its best, Disney Star Wars has been the equal of anything that went before. Rosario Dawson's Ahsoka and Ewan McGregor's Obi-Wan Kenobi might have been resounding damp squibs, but The Mandalorian years one and two were a lark. Prequel movie Rogue One is meanwhile generally agreed to be the third best Star Wars film after the original and Empire. And Tony Gilroy's Andor is one of the most outstanding TV shows of the past five years. It's easy to hate on the Magic Kingdom (it's also obviously great fun). Amid the schadenfreude, though, perhaps there is space to recognise the Disney Wars era hasn't been an unmitigated flop.\n\nRefreshingly, The Acolyte attempts to remove itself from Disney discourse entirely, by rewinding to the glory days of the Old Republic and the pre-Darth Vader Jedi - aeons before the events chronicled in the hacky, hamfisted JJ Abrams/Rian Johnson sequel trilogy of Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver etc. It also tries to expand the Star Wars universe by introducing the new concept of \"Force-Fu\" - the use of the mystical Force as a martial art. Sadly - and despite the best intentions of all involved - it doesn't quite work. One issue is that it suffers from atrociously creaky dialogue (\"We have unfinished business, attack me with all your strength\"). Another is that the plot, while clearly fancying itself as deep and mysterious, falls into the now-familiar Star Wars pitfall of zipping exhaustingly from planet to planet, to the point where it all becomes a blur.\n\nThere are also moments of (presumably) unintentional hilarity. A ceremony involving a renegade coven that taps into the Force appears to have been intended as a comment on how feminine power is controlled by the patriarchy (the Jedi, male and female, are horrified by the idea of these women using their Force as they see fit). But the depiction of the \"witches\" is far too hokey. It falls somewhere between a Bat for Lashes video, the Hellblade video games and a parody of Ari Aster's Midsommar.\n\nThe martial arts element is introduced right at the top in a bracing scene, in which rogue Force user Mae (Amandla Stenberg) tangles with Jedi master Indara (Carrie-Anne Moss). Showrunner Leslye Headland has been upfront about Indara being a tribute to Trinity, Moss's high-kicking cyberpunk hero from The Matrix. The Acolyte isn't shy about the reference - a sequence in which Indara bends in slow motion to avoid a killing blow could have come straight from the Wachowski blockbuster.\n\nHeadland has also described The Acolyte as a mix of Frozen and Kill Bill - a comparison that just about holds water. As with Frozen, the series is, at its heart, about two sisters who don't get along. Stenberg plays both: the seemingly villainous Mae and her twin Osha, a former trainee Jedi who flunked out of Force school.\n\nMae and Osha haven't seen each other for more than a decade, after Mae committed a terrible act that changed her sister's life forever. Osha had assumed Mae was dead. But no, she's alive and now - as \"an acolyte\" with illicit Force training - is hunting down Jedi Knights, starting with Indara (much as Uma Thurman's Bride took her revenge in Kill Bill).\n\nYou can see why the showrunner would cite Frozen and Kill Bill, each having a major cultural footprint. However, a more accurate comparison might be the Netflix animated binge-watch Arcane, in which two estranged sisters are on opposite sides of a conflict between good and evil.\n\nInitially, the audience's sympathies are supposed to lie with Osha. She is introduced as a tomboy-ish grease monkey trying to put her Jedi past behind her while making a living repairing starships. Stenberg does well playing both characters - fleshing out Osha's trauma and Mae's justified (in her eyes) resentment against the Jedi. She is joined by a solid support cast. They include Lee Jung-jae as Osha's old Jedi mentor, Dafne Keen (Lyra in the BBC's His Dark Materials) as his sarcastic student, The Good Place's Manny Jacinto as an idiot smuggler and Jodie Turner-Smith as a mystical figure from Mae and Osha's past.\n\nPraise must also go to Headland - a co-creator of Netflix's quirky time-travel drama Russian Doll - for trying to do something different with Star Wars, with the concept of a community of female dissidents accessing a forbidden side of the Force. Yet despite a reported $25m per episode budget, the series suffers from the same flat, \"cheap\" look that was an issue with Obi-Wan Kenobi, while the pacy action scenes never compensate for the clunking dialogue. It's a spirited effort, but in the continuum of Disney's Star Wars hits and misses, The Acolyte lands bang in the middle.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ahsoka (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rogue Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Empire_Strikes_Back", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Empire Strikes Back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractor_beam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tractor beam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jar_Jar_Binks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jar Jar Binks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ewok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayden_Christensen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hayden Christensen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natalie Portman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosario_Dawson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rosario Dawson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Millennium Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Lucas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_bear", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teddy bear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewan_McGregor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ewan McGregor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magic Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychopathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Star", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney Star"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie-Anne_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carrie-Anne Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rian_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rian Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Driver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Driver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Abrams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

All five live-action series that have premiered on the streamer have attempted -- to varying degrees of success -- to translate the spectacle of the big-screen \"Skywalker Saga\" and push the boundaries of what to expect from the universe George Lucas created in 1977. Some ventured into new territory creatively (\"Andor\"), while others seemed to lack ambition (\"The Book of Boba Fett\").\n\nNow comes \"The Acolyte.\" Created by Leslye Headland (\"Russian Doll\"), this latest excursion takes viewers further into the past than any previous live-action iteration -- about a 100 years before \"Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,\" which has been dubbed the \"High Republic\" era by Lucasfilm.\n\nAs the series begins, the titular Acolyte, a masked assailant with preternatural mastery of the Force, is casually picking off Jedi masters one after another. What follows is essentially a \"Star Wars\" murder mystery, where figuring out the why is more important than the who. (While established lore says the villainous Sith hadn't been heard from for 1,000 years at the time of \"Episode I,\" that doesn't mean there weren't other kinds of scum and villainy to deal with in the interim.)\n\nThe Jedi -- depicted at their peak with ostentatious gold-and-white robes and yellow lightsabers -- are undoubtedly essential here, but the focus is on Osha (Amandla Stenberg), a former Padawan apprentice-turned-mechanic pulled into this web of murders. Working with her former mentor, Jedi Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae), she soon learns of a broader and more personal conspiracy.\n\nA lifelong franchise devotee, Headland brings a fan's eye to the proceedings while taking a dive into \"Star Wars\" arcana that feels familiar (there are lightsabers and laser guns aplenty) and fresh (Carrie-Anne Moss as a Jedi doing \"Matrix\"-style martial arts while wielding a lightsaber? How was this never a thing until just now?).\n\nStenberg (\"The Hate U Give\") makes for an effective audience surrogate, but making even more of a mark is Kim, effortlessly charismatic from his first appearance as Master Sol. The South Korean actor first came to prominence stateside a few years ago thanks to his memorable turn in \"Squid Game\" and is just as captivating a presence here.\n\nContemplative and serious, but with a twinkle in his eye, Sol evokes Liam Neeson's Qui-Gon Jinn from \"The Phantom Menace,\" embodying the same spirit of lived wisdom in service of occasional disagreements with his colleagues. Sol also has an added element of loss and regret that I look forward to seeing play out over the remainder of the show's eight-episode first season (Headland has a multi-season arc mapped out, should the opportunity arise).\n\nThe various plot mechanisms take about one and a half episodes to fully build up momentum, but once that happens, \"The Acolyte\" becomes a lot more intriguing. Still, the question remains: Do fans have the appetite for yet another \"Star Wars\" spinoff only fleetingly connected to the galaxy they know?\n\nIf this series follows through on its initial promise, it could end up enlisting a whole slew of new acolytes.", "source": {"uri": "datebook.sfchronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Datebook | San Francisco Arts & Entertainment Guide"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acolyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Acolyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Boba_Fett", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Book of Boba Fett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Doll_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Doll (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lightsaber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Lucas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_High_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: The High Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sith", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucasfilm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie-Anne_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carrie-Anne Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Neeson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liam Neeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/sfc-datebook-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/featured_event3347849--700x500.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

I really kind of tried to find the connective tissue between him and my character, Master Sol.\" While many actors choose to find inspiration from other performances outside the world they are inhabiting or even from real-life people, Lee wanted to keep his focus inside the world of Star Wars. \"I didn't really want to be influenced by anything outside of the Star Wars world,\" Lee said.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Acolyte Creator Comments on Yoda Cameo Rumors\n\nThe Acolyte creator comments on the possibility of cameos from Yoda and other Star Wars legacy characters.\n\nQui-Gon, stands out in some ways, from many of the Jedi that appear throughout the films. Luke Skywalker, was destined to be something greater, much like his father, both yearning for an adventure much bigger than themselves. Obi-Wan Kenobi, was a by the book Jedi who was as reliable as he was strong with the force. Qui-Gon, was unique in that he seemed in conflict with the Jedi Council, and was able to separate his beliefs in the force, from the bureaucratic doctrines established by the Jedi. Qui-Gon was also more cerebral, seemingly in control at all times. How Lee incorporates Qui-Gon into his own performance of Master Sol, will be interesting to see.\n\nWhat Drew Lee Jung-jae to the Role of Master Sol\n\nWhile Lee may have been inspired by Neeson's portrayal of Qui-Gon, it was the script penned by Leslye Headland, that excited Lee. \"He is a Jedi master, but the more I saw the script, I realized that there were more of these humanistic elements to him,\" Lee said. His emotions are constantly in flux. And also, when he's in battle, he actually does feel that element of fear. And I think because of that, [showrunner Leslye Hedland] really created a Sol that was extremely humanistic.\"\n\nRelated\n\nRosario Dawson and Hayden Christensen Reveal Initial Reactions to Star Wars Reunion\n\nReflecting on their Star Wars reunion, Rosario Dawson and Hayden Christensen praise Dave Filoni's Ahsoka scripts and use of a certain Jedi nickname.\n\nClose\n\nHowever, the actor wanted to flat out have some fun too.

Six years later, she's working as a space mechanic when a shocking death on the other side of the universe brings trouble to her door, and she's forced to not only face her past, but figure out her real place in the universe...\n\nWhile the new Disney+ series might technically be a prequel, thanks to its time setting The Acolyte is deliciously unburdened from the problems that most prequels face. Unlike Obi-Wan Kenobi, a show where we literally knew how everyone would eventually die, this series is free to tell its own story, featuring a new ensemble of fascinating characters tackling a murder mystery with potentially galactic implications.\n\nAnd, based on the first four episodes provided to critics, it does this while still managing to feel like Star Wars, thanks to the lived-in details of its various remote settings, the impressive action sequences, and the exploration of universal themes like power and corruption and loyalty and betrayal. Someone even says \"I have a bad feeling about this!\" The only thing that makes it stand out from past Star Wars stories is that it has a lot of women in it, actively participating in the story. (What a concept.)\n\nThe Acolyte comes from creator Leslye Headland (Russian Doll), marking the first Star Wars adventure made for the screen that's fully the creation of an actual woman -- significant because up until about 10 years ago, the only women to have any real behind-the-camera impact on Star Wars were the iconic Leigh Brackett co-writing The Empire Strikes Back, and the ghost-writing Carrie Fisher did over the years.\n\nThe last few years in particular have featured numerous women making in-roads when it comes to telling stories in this universe: Beyond Kathleen Kennedy now serving as president of Lucasfilm, animated series including the Tales shorts and Star Wars Resistance have featured female writers, with Jennifer Corbett serving as the head writer for The Bad Batch. Plus, directors including Deborah Chow, Susanna White, Bryce Dallas Howard have helmed episodes of The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Andor.", "source": {"uri": "consequence.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Consequence of Sound"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liz_shannon_miller@consequence.net", "name": "Liz Shannon Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darth Vader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obi-Wan_Kenobi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obi-Wan Kenobi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Bad_Batch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: The Bad Batch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_of_Boba_Fett", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Book of Boba Fett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Chow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deborah Chow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Resistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars Resistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Doll_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Doll (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Kennedy_(producer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kathleen Kennedy (producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leigh_Brackett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leigh Brackett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Empire_Strikes_Back", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Empire Strikes Back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryce_Dallas_Howard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryce Dallas Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie_Fisher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carrie Fisher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susanna_White", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Susanna White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghostwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ghostwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adventure fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucasfilm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_writer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head writer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/the-acolyte-amandla-stenberg-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

The series is set in the High Republic era, about 100 years before the events of Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. Fans get to see a part of the universe that hasn't been seen, and maybe even a peek at the early days of the Sith.\n\nIf you're looking to keep up with the new Star Wars show, read on.

Showrunner Leslye Headland has set out to deliver the full Star Wars experience, cramming in everything that makes the franchise great.\n\nIf there's one thing that goes hand in hand with the Star Wars franchise (besides lightsabers), it's prequels. To that end: The Acolyte is the most prequel of prequels - it's such a prequel it's actually set 100 years before The Phantom Menace in the High Republic era. That means we won't get any cameos from our favorite characters.\n\nBut this fresh setting means the show gets to pull influences from literally every era of Star Wars. Fun! Early reviews say The Acolyte is grounded and relatable and doesn't rely on a hacky hero character who has to save the entire universe.\n\nWith all the freedom to pull in from anywhere, Headland has said she wanted to \"get in as much Star Wars\" as possible. She wanted to \"shoot her shot\" she said, adding that sometimes when she watched the show she would wonder \"is it just a bunch of fanfiction?\" because she just wanted to cram everything in there she could.\n\nWhat does that mean? Well, there are practical sets and puppeteering lifted from the original trilogy and and then there's depicting the \"Jedi at their height\" as they are in the prequels. \"I wanted to give a fresh, new take on it, which the sequels have.

After all, this particular series is set in the final days of the franchise's High Republic era, bringing this period to live-action for the very first time. It's also set over 100 years before the prequel trilogy, as Anakin Skywalker is still a long way's off from being born at this point in the timeline.\n\nFor Leslye Headland, getting to explore this all new era of Star Wars was one of the most appetizing elements of the project.\n\n\"It was totally freeing. It's one of the reasons I set the show there, so that I wouldn't feel constrained,\" Headland explained to GameSpot. \"However, it was a lot of responsibility for sure to be the first person playing in that time period.\"\n\nLuckily, Headland says, she was able to glean information from the prequels, allowing her to move backwards in time for the galaxy from there. Of course, it also helped that the High Republic publishing initiative--which has expanded to books, comics, an audio drama, and web series--was announced while she was developing the show.\n\n\"It started just after I had pitched the show,\" she revealed. \"So it was nice to then have a reference of things that were before my show. It was a nice bookend.\"\n\nAnd while The Acolyte may be at least partially inspired by a popular Star Wars video game, there are still nods to the original trilogy, though more in the craft of making the series, and even a look toward The Phantom Menace and the other prequels.\n\n\"We want to make this feel like the first live-action High Republic show, but at the same time, make it feel like that original trilogy in terms of utilizing practical sets, puppetry rather than CGI,\" Headland said. \"But then also make sure that we bring in a little bit of the foreshadowing of where, where we're going to end up in the prequels.\"\n\nThe Acolyte premieres its first two episodes on Tuesday, June 4 on Disney+.", "source": {"uri": "gamespot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GameSpot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_e_hayner@gamespot.com", "name": "Chris E.

Wookiees are rarely shown to be Jedi in Star Wars, partially because George Lucas made a rule against showing them in the Order, and partly because they were just rare in general. Kelnacca has sequestered himself at the remote location Khofar, but the reason for his isolation remains unknown. SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nJedi Master Kelnacca is one of the most prominent characters in The Acolyte, and there are quite a few things that make him interesting both on-screen and from behind the camera. Based on the confirmed details about The Acolyte, the upcoming Star Wars show will break quite a bit of new ground for the franchise. It's set to tell one of the darkest stories in Star Wars, but it should also introduce exciting new pieces of lore, and it will be the first time several different parts of the franchise appear in live-action.\n\nPart of the reason The Acolyte will be the first Star Wars show to introduce so many concepts is because it will be the first live-action appearance of the High Republic era. Set 100 years before the events of Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, both the High Republic and The Acolyte feature a very different Jedi Order and galaxy from the ones shown in the Star Wars movies. One such exciting part of The Acolyte is Kelnacca, the show's Wookiee Jedi. He seems to be one of the show's most exciting characters, both because of his characterization and how he came to be.\n\nRelated Everything You Need To Know Before Watching Star Wars: The Acolyte\n\nStar Wars' next TV show, The Acolyte, will come to Disney+ on June 4. Here's everything you need to know ahead of this epic Star Wars series.\n\nKelnacca Is Star Wars' First Live-Action Wookiee Jedi There Have Been Other Wookiee Jedi In Animation, Novels, & Comics\n\nKelnacca is a unique Jedi Master for a number of reasons. There have been Wookiee Jedi in both Star Wars Legends and canon before, but they've mostly appeared in animated shows like Star Wars: The Clone Wars, novels, and comics like the High Republic phases I and III. Kelnacca is therefore the first Wookiee Jedi in live-action, which means The Acolyte is already making Star Wars history. He won't be the only new addition to the franchise made by The Acolyte, but Kelnacca will fulfill something fans have wanted to see for a very long time, which is a very exciting prospect.\n\nKelnacca\n\nKelnacca, a Wookiee Jedi, is a loner who lives a solitary life on a jungle world.\n\nCreated By Leslye Headland Cast Joonas Suotamo First Appearance The Acolyte Alliance Jedi Race Wookiee Who Plays Jedi Master Kelnacca In The Acolyte? Joonas Suotamo Plays Kelnacca In The Acolyte Close\n\nKelnacca is played by actor Joonas Suotamo, who has a long history with the Star Wars franchise. Suotamo has also played another Wookiee, the famous Chewbacca. Suotamo began portraying Chewbacca in 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens, as he acted as a double for Peter Mayhew, the original Chewbacca actor. Mayhew retired from the role for health concerns prior to Star Wars: The Last Jedi, and Suotamo has been the main Chewbacca actor in every Star Wars movie since. Kelnacca marks the first time he has played a Wookiee who wasn't Chewie, and he first played the role during Star Wars Celebration Europe in 2023.\n\nChewbacca\n\n200 years old by the time of the Star Wars original trilogy, the mighty Chewbacca is best known for swearing a life debt to Han Solo. Chewie accompanied Han through countless adventures, choosing to battle against the Empire for the freedom of his homeworld Kashyyyk. He remained with Han and the Solo family even after the Empire's fall, becoming a crucial ally of the Resistance to the First Order. The sequels seemed to end with Chewie remaining co-pilot of the Millennium Falcon - but now to Rey.\n\nCreated By George Lucas Cast Peter Mayhew , Joonas Suotamo First Appearance Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope Alias Chewie Race Wookiee\n\nOutside of Star Wars, Suotamo has had a few different roles. He played The Scourge in Disney+'s Willow, and he's also set to play a role, likely Lurch, in Netflix's Wednesday season 2. Suotamo has not only been an actor in his professional career, though. He also played basketball for the Penn State Nittany Lions in college, and he briefly played professionally in his home country of Finland. Ultimately, Suotamo left basketball behind, and he ended up bringing some of the most important and beloved characters in Star Wars to life.\n\nWhy Wookiee Jedi Are So Unusual In Star Wars George Lucas Didn't Want There To Be Many Wookiee Jedi Close\n\nWookiees are one of the most prominent alien species in Star Wars, so it's odd that they so rarely are shown to be Jedi. The reason there are so few Wookiee Jedi in Star Wars canon is because George Lucas had a rule that banned Wookiees from being Jedi after a few Wookiee Jedi were created in Star Wars Legends. That's why there are no Wookiee Jedi in the Star Wars prequel trilogy, despite their homeworld of Kashyyk being so prominently featured. Eventually, though, Lucas repealed that order, and there have since been Wookiee Jedi in canon, including one created during his tenure, Gungi, who was featured in The Clone Wars.\n\nWookiee Jedi in Star Wars Canon\n\nName\n\nFirst Appearance\n\nGungi\n\nThe Clone Wars\n\nBurryaga\n\nLight of the Jedi\n\nArkoff\n\nLight of the Jedi\n\nKelnacca\n\nThe Acolyte\n\nIn the years since Lucas' rule banning Wookiee Jedi was undone, Star Wars has begun depicting more members of the species as Jedi. There are two other Wookiee Jedi in the High Republic era, Burryaga and Arkoff in addition to Kelnacca. Still, though, Wookiee Jedi remain exceedingly rare, with only four examples in Star Wars canon. It's likely that this is simply a product of how little time there has been to introduce new Wookiee characters, but it could also be a continuation of Lucas' rule and an effort to show that Wookiees rarely become Jedi, something that Huyang established in The Clone Wars season 5, episode 7.\n\nKelnacca Is Living In Seclusion On A Jungle World Little Is Known About Khofar Or Kelnacca's Sequestration\n\nThere isn't much known about Kelnacca's personality or his role in The Acolyte, but the details that have been revealed about him offer a very interesting glimpse into the Jedi Master's life. According to The Acolyte's character posters, Kelnacca was \"a loner who lives a solitary life,\" and it was explained that he had \"sequestered himself in the tangled jungles of Khofar.\" Those descriptions don't offer much insight into Kelnacca or his role in The Acolyte, but they may have some clues about his true nature.\n\nIt's especially strange that a Wookiee would sequester themselves, as the species is generally well known for creating long-lasting and extremely loyal bonds to others.\n\nIt isn't clear whether Khofar is a planet itself or a region within a larger world, but either way, it's a location that has not yet been seen in Star Wars. There's not much to go on with Khofar itself, but the pictures that have been made available of the location give some clues about what Kelnacca is up to. One picture showed Kelnacca next to a Jedi speeder bike, and also featured a wall in the foreground. Those details could be evidence that there was a Jedi Outpost on Khofar, and that Kelnacca was possibly stationed there.\n\nWhile those clues give some indication of Khofar, it remains unclear why Kelnacca has sequestered himself. It's especially strange that a Wookiee would do so, as the species is generally well known for creating long-lasting and extremely loyal bonds to others. It's possible that Kelnacca's sequestration is connected to the dark past hinted at in The Acolyte, and that one of its flashback scenes will explain why Kelnacca felt the need to isolate himself. Another possibility is that Kelnacca was a Jedi Wayseeker, a type of Jedi who operated according to their own interpretation of the will of the Force, not the Council's.\n\nWhatever role Kelnacca ends up playing in The Acolyte will likely bring him to the center of attention, given his prominence in the show's promotional materials. It remains to be seen how he'll be drawn out of isolation, but the central mystery of the show will likely be a major reason for it. Now, though, the only way more will be revealed about Kelnacca is through The Acolyte itself.\n\nThe Acolyte premieres on June 4 on Disney+.\n\nThe Acolyte\n\nThe Acolyte is a television series set in the Star Wars universe at the end of the High Republic Era, where both the Jedi and the Galactic Empire were at the height of their influence.

Where Andor, Ahsoka, The Mandalorian and most of the upcoming films and shows in the franchise continue to fill in as many mid-saga blanks as possible, Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy's Rise Of Skywalker sequel is picking up the next generation just as James Mangold's origin movie is taking things back to the beginning. Before that, though, now sits The Acolyte - the youngest Star Wars story in more ways than one.\n\nSet 100 years before Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace, Disney's latest chapter is also its freshest. Cut free of the franchise rules by the fact that no one else we've ever met has even been born yet, The Acolyte feels like a welcome reset. There's no pop-up cameos to google. No hidden easter eggs to miss. The planets are untrodden. The creatures look new. At least until the next one comes along, this is now officially the best place to start.\n\nCreated by Russian Doll's Leslye Headland, The Acolyte was pitched as \"Frozen meets Kill Bill\", which makes absolutely no sense at all. Yeah, it's a revenge story about sisters, but the rest is a bit of a stretch... and a weird flex considering the show's originality is its biggest strength. Amandla Stenberg (The Hate U Give, Bodies Bodies Bodies) plays both Osha and Mae - raised by a coven of witches (led by the incomparable Jodie Turner-Smith) and separated by tragedy to push them both down very different paths. Osha trained as a Jedi before lapsing, while Mae turned to the dark side - now working for a shadowy master and on the run for a string of murders.\n\nBeing a time of peace - long before Anakin Skywalker and Darth Maul and all the Sith stuff - the Jedi operate here more like annoying new-age cops. This is a renaissance period where the bad guys are now the rebels; in hiding and outnumbered while Osha and the other Jedis (including Squid Game's Lee Jung-jae, The Matrix's Carrie-Anne Moss and one lightsaber-wielding Wookie, in a franchise first) over-parent the galaxy with a lot of chin-strap beard-stroking.\n\nCutting through the Patchouli funk from both sides, Stenberg is The Acolyte's biggest weapon - playing both sisters at once and giving us one of Star Wars' most conflicted family sagas in two winning dual performances. For once, here we have a hero (and a villain) who isn't pushing middle-age, as well as a nice through-line to some of the weightiest themes across the expanded universe in one star-making twofer turn.\n\nAs with everything in Star Wars, balance is everything - but it feels like Headland has managed to walk a finer line than most with The Acolyte. It's new, without feeling unconnected. Pristine, but not too shiny. Fun, but still substantial. It feels like a place to grow from, as well as a worthy stand-alone story in its own right.\n\nWas this what George Lucas had in mind when he made The Phantom Menace; wanting to prologue his own original trilogy with richer, younger, cleaner stories? Probably not, but as retconned first chapters go, it's hard not to think that this one is going to age better.", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_bradshaw@nme.com", "name": "Paul Bradshaw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darth Vader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ahsoka (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Episode_I_\u2013_The_Phantom_Menace_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mangold", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "James Mangold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharmeen_Obaid-Chinoy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yoda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodies_Bodies_Bodies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bodies Bodies Bodies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodie_Turner-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jodie Turner-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Doll_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Doll (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Easter egg (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_Bill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kill Bill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Witchcraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_original_trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars original trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_in_other_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars in other media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie-Anne_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carrie-Anne Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Maul", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darth Maul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Lucas"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/The_Acolyte_Star_Wars.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

In it, Amandla tries her best to \"be cool\" while Christensen welcomes her into the Star Wars franchise.\n\n\"I just wanted to send you a quick message to say congratulations. And I'm very excited for the show, and wanted to wish you all the best and welcome you to our Star Wars family,\" Christensen said in the video.\n\nChristensen concluded his heartfelt welcome by suggesting that the on-screen Sith duo would one day meet in person at a Star Wars celebration event.

Nicholson, who paid over $1,600 a night for her stay, chalks the hotel's failure up to numerous factors -- the 246-minute runtime leaves room to point a lot of fingers -- but sums up by tying her pricey but lackluster stay to a larger Disney trend: charging more for luxury-branded products while providing less and less. It's actually in the company's interest, she argues, to allow the baseline experience of visiting their theme parks to become a little worse, because it coaxes those who can afford it into paying more to skip the lines, with added surcharges for the most popular rides.\n\nBy toggling between early promotional materials and her own experience, Nicholson pinpoints several places where the grand visions of the hotel's conceptual stage were whittled down to an underwhelming nub, and others where nifty aspects that were originally pitched as part of the related Galaxy's Edge theme park were relocated inside the much pricier confines of the Galactic Starcruiser. In essence, she argues, the hotel functioned as a \"paywall\" for experiences -- such as a nightclub act with an alien singer -- that were placed beyond the reach of ordinary parkgoers, while at the same time shunting participants into interactive storylines so hemmed in by the larger chronology of the Star Wars universe that their outcome was doomed to be inconsequential. In essence, the Star Wars hotel overpromised and underdelivered.\n\nThe Acolyte, which premieres on Disney+ today, suffers from a similar fate. The eight-episode series, created by Russian Doll showrunner Leslye Headland, starts off playing with some invigoratingly big ideas, but by the midway point (four episodes were given to critics in advance), they're apparently all but abandoned, because pursuing them would mean unsettling the branded cosmos we're already familiar with. Set 100 years before the rise of the Empire, the series follows Osha (Amandla Stenberg), a former apprentice Jedi who dropped out of her training and now works as a meknek, essentially an interstellar grease monkey, doing tasks so low that they're only supposed to be performed by droids. It's disorienting to come across Osha at first, swapping banter with her co-mechanic and taking pleasure in her unglamorous tasks, because we've already seen her, in The Acolyte's opening scene, fight a Jedi master to the death.\n\nThe guilelessness with which Osha greets the Jedi who show up to question her, including Russian Doll's Charlie Barnett as the strait-laced if occasionally shirtless Yord, seems to rule her out as a suspect, but that leads to more questions. Was the Osha we saw wielding the Force with deadly accuracy cloaked in some sort of holographic disguise? Perhaps so adept she can hypnotize a bar full of hardened lowlifes, and even viewers at home, into seeing her as someone else? The fact that the actual solution to this conundrum is the simplest and most obvious one is encouraging in its own way, a sign that Headland is not afraid of Star Wars' inglorious roots in low-budget serial adventures. (If Flash Gordon doesn't help you figure it out, General Hospital will.) But The Acolyte isn't a larkish adventure series in the vein of The Mandalorian. It's heavy with mythic resonances, or at least the hope of them, the sense that it wants to be telling a grand story about destiny and choice, vengeance and forgiveness.\n\nWe know from the beginning that Osha's doppelg\u00e4nger is out to kill Jedi -- four of them in particular, including one played by Matrix star Carrie-Anne Moss, although she doesn't seem unduly concerned about how many other bodies she drops along the way. And for a while, The Acolyte indulges the idea that her quest might be a just and even righteous one. A century before the rise of the Empire, as the series' opening crawl tells us, the Jedi are scouring the universe looking for potential padawans, children to take in and teach their ancient ways. But the lack of a clear and commensurate enemy seems to have allowed a bit of mission creep. If the Jedi aren't fighting a force of equal and opposite strength, they're just the space police, and that leaves open the possibility that they might occasionally be on the wrong side. When the story takes us back to Osha's childhood, in a flashback episode helmed by After Yang and Columbus director Kogonada, we're teased with a truly radical idea, maybe the most potentially world-shifting since The Last Jedi: What if the Jedi aren't the only ones capable of harnessing the Force, and what if there are other, equally valid, ways of drawing the line between light and dark? Could the Jedi be ... the bad guys?\n\nUnfortunately, the answer, at least thus far, seems to be no. The show pulls back from its most audacious possibilities in a way that suggests the heavy hand of brand management, chipping away at anything that might rock the boat. There's a pattern here, a desire to shake things up followed by a fear of the consequences. It's how you get the audacity of The Last Jedi followed by the reversion to mean of The Rise of Skywalker, how you go from Phil Lord and Chris Miller's Solo to Ron Howard's Solo. It's how The Mandalorian starts off as an adventure-of-the-week show blissfully unencumbered by lore, only to accrue more and more of it; how it wound up surrounded by prequels and spinoffs instead of self-contained stories. Overpromise, underdeliver. (May the Force be with Andor Season 2.)\n\nThe Acolyte tries to carve out its own territory. There are some cool fight scenes, including one centered on the Jedi master Sol, played by Squid Game's Lee Jung-jae, but despite the reported $180 million budget, it's a show that shrinks the world rather than expanding it, blowing its money on lavish set pieces rather than building out environments for us to inhabit. The Acolyte acts like it's swinging for the fences, but when the time comes, the best it can manage is a bunt.", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_adams@slate.com", "name": "Sam Adams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amusement park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Galactic_Starcruiser", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Doll_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian Doll (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Galaxy's_Edge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extraterrestrial life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightclub", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nightclub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_(Star_Wars)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Droid (Star Wars)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Barnett_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Barnett (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(narrative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plot (narrative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monkey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Flash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie-Anne_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carrie-Anne Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kogonada", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kogonada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Howard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Columbus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/417d3c4c-c108-4138-b7c6-446be4e6d7ff.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Obi-Wan and Yoda are both hermits hiding from their own failures in distant corners of the galaxy, and both die after teaching Luke Skywalker a bit about the Force. Luke himself never technically completes his training, though he gets close enough to be considered a Jedi master in later films. So the Jedi exist more as a exciting symbol in those early films, as well as a mystery: How could a group of people so wise and powerful have just ceased to exist?\n\nThe solution to that mystery unfortunately robbed the Jedi of most of the mystique that Obi-Wan and Yoda gave them in the early movies. It turns out the Jedi got wiped out because they were soft, self-congratulatory, and far too hung up on rules that did more harm than good. If Mace Windu had just told young Anakin that he was allowed to go kiss Padme, for Pete's sake, the Empire never would have been created. The Clone Wars and Rebels cartoons did a bit better by the Jedi, but on the whole, they are, like Boba Fett(*), a George Lucas creation where the more they get to do, the less thrilling they become.\n\n(*) A.K.A. the guy who turned out to be so boring, his own show had to morph into a Mandalorian bonus season partway through.\n\nThe newest Disney+ Star Wars series, The Acolyte, at least attempts to openly confront the reality that the Jedi are smug, complacent, and kind of terrible. But the execution of that idea is spotty throughout the four episodes given to critics. And the decision to set it a century before the rise of the Empire seems to defeat the purpose of the whole thing, because the Jedi of The Phantom Menace have learned exactly zero lessons.\n\nThe Acolyte was created by writer-director Leslye Headland, who was one of the co-creators of Netflix's great sci-fi comedy Russian Doll(*). Headland has built her whole story around the institutional failings of the Jedi. A young woman named Mae (Amandla Stenberg) is seeking revenge on a quartet of Jedi masters -- the wise Sol (Lee Jung-jae), the stoic Indara (Carrie-Anne Moss), Wookiee master Kelnacca (Joonas Suotamo), and young Torbin (Dean-Charles Chapman) -- for a family tragedy. And the more we learn about the history, the clearer it becomes that Jedi law -- and questions of who is and isn't allowed to study the Force -- played an unfortunately huge role. Meanwhile, Mae's twin sister Osha (Stenberg again) is working as a mechanic after washing out of Jedi training, and she has to again speak with her former teacher, Sol.\n\n(*) Two of that show's actors play Jedi here. Rebecca Henderson is Vernestra, a green-skinned, high-ranking member of the order. Charlie Barnett is Yord, a Jedi nerd with an unfortunate rooster haircut.\n\nLee Jung-jae, the Emmy-winning star of Squid Game, isn't fluent in English, and as a result his line readings can be halting at times. But he otherwise brings a necessary amount of gravitas, warmth, and regret as Sol. His relationship with Osha is easily the best and most fully-realized aspect of The Acolyte. Stenberg, Headland, and their collaborators regrettably struggle to differentiate Osha and Mae from one another, even when they're wearing different clothes and pursuing different agendas. (It's even worse in the third episode, a listless flashback where the two girls, played by Leah and Lauren Brady, are styled identically.)\n\nMost of the pieces are uneven at best, if not simply underwhelming. Carrie-Anne Moss is used well in an opening action set piece (once again getting to work with bullet-time effects, 25 years after the first Matrix) but is otherwise wasted, and the later fight scenes aren't as dynamic. There are some amusing bits of business regarding interpersonal dynamics among the Jedi -- Yord is so disrespected that even Sol's padawan, Jecki (Dafne Keen, from Logan and His Dark Materials), feels comfortable acting superior to him -- but not a lot. And the idea of seeing a Wookiee Jedi in action is more exciting than the little that Kelnacca actually gets to do.\n\nManny Jacinto injects some welcome scoundrel energy as Mae's ally, Qimir. Like Han Solo and Finn, he doesn't care much about the Force, which is an element the prequels badly lacked. It's especially helpful in a story that is so much about the Force, and which people the Jedi believe should be allowed to wield it. This was, of course, a key theme of the sequels, both within the story and within the awkward baton-passing between writer-directors J.J. Abrams and Rian Johnson.\n\nJohnson's The Last Jedi goes out of its way to democratize the Force, rather than treating it as something worthy only of characters with noble bloodlines. It positions Rey as the child of nobodies, and its final scene features an orphaned boy casually using the Force to grab a broom and sweep out a stable on Canto Bight. In The Rise of Skywalker, Abrams retcons things so that Rey is the granddaughter of Emperor Palpatine, and he has zero interest in Broom Boy.\n\nWithout having seen the back half of the season, it's hard to know for sure where Headland stands in this debate, but The Acolyte certainly seems pro-Broom Boy so far. Even so, the particular moment in which Headland has chosen to tell this story seems too confined. In The Phantom Menace, the Jedi have been overseeing a peaceful, Sith-free galaxy for a thousand years. They are confident in the rightness of all their decisions. The situation with Mae, Osha, and Mae's mysterious, seemingly-Sith Lord master, raises questions that fly in the face of where the Jedi are, philosophically, when Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon find little Anakin in the sands of Tatooine.\n\nIn other words, this feels like a narrative dead end. That doesn't automatically preclude a good series: The fact that no one learns anything here could be the whole tragic point of the story Headland and company are telling. It's good to see another Star Wars project that, like Andor, interrogates some of the franchise's fundamental assumptions. Entertainment-wise, though, the first half of The Acolyte is unfortunately a lot closer to The Book of Boba Fett.\n\nThe first two episodes of The Acolyte begin streaming tonight at 9 p.m. ET, with additional episodes releasing weekly.

Reaching for something in the vain hope that it will pop up into your palm is a fairly universal way to explore fantasy. As an adult, though, it can feel a little bit silly -- and Star Wars: The Acolyte star Lee Jung-jae felt the same. He told ComicBook that he had a hard time dialing in exactly how to manage his use of The Force on the show, but it was better when he realized it was more about the intentionality and emotion of the story than the actual physical acting.\n\nLee Jung-jae plays Sol, a respected Jedi Master in The Acolyte. In addition to learning English for the part, he had to learn how to use The Force. We asked him about the experience.\n\n\"It felt a little awkward at first,\" the star said with a laugh. \"There's no set answer to how to do it....I thought it was really the pose that was very important at first, but then I realized it was really the emotion behind it, how much emotion I'm using for that specific scenario, and the level of emotion that I'm expressing. So at first I was like, 'Do I hold my hand like this? Do I do this?' I was really focused on the gestural aspect of it, but with more practice and understanding of my character, I really was just focusing on expressing the emotion rather than how I looked using the Force.\"\n\nSet during The High Republic, Star Wars: The Acolyte delivers an investigation into a mysterious string of crimes, which pits a Jedi master against his former apprentice in a race to uncover the truth. The more that the pair learn about the situation, the darker their journey becomes, as they confront things that darker than either of them could have imagined.\n\nThe series stars Amandla Stenberg, Lee Jung-jae, Manny Jacinto, Dafne Keen, Charlie Barnett, Jodie Turner-Smith, Rebecca Henderson, Dean-Charles Chapman, Joonas Suotamo, and Carrie-Anne Moss.

One of those stories comes to us via The Acolyte, a new tale set at the end of the High Republic era, about a century prior to the events of Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace. The story focuses on a former Jedi master's investigation into a series of murders, which brings him back into contact with a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and a new threat.\n\nAhead of the series' June 4 premiere on Disney+, RT correspondent Perri Nemiroff sat down with stars Amandla Stenberg, Lee Jung-jae, Manny Jacinto, Dafne Keen, Rebecca Henderson, Jodie Turner-Smith, Charlie Barnett, and executive producer Leslye Headland to talk about the series, sharing details on new lightsabers, droids, and more.\n\nPerri Nemiroff for Rotten Tomatoes: More often than not, when it comes to live-action Star Wars, we're used to learning new things about the Jedi via the Skywalker era. You veer towards the High Republic; why did you make that choice and what new layers do you add to the Jedi by approaching it from that specific time period?\n\nLeslye Headland: That's a great question. I think that the time period we're in, which is between the High Republic and the prequels, find the Jedi at a point in their power where they are completely unchallenged and they're getting into a place of safety. They're the guardians of peace and justice throughout the galaxy, and they're doing a very good job of that, if I do say so myself. A threat like [Amandla Stenberg's] Mae is something they're not prepared for. It's something that, as high through the ranks as [Rebecca Henderson's] Vernestra Rwoh, they have to essentially take care of it and not let the general public know that they are vulnerable in that particular way.\n\nWhat I thought was really rife for drama was how does an institution, even a good one, respond to a small threat, but a serious one at that? So that seemed like fertile ground for me in storytelling.\n\nWatch the video for the full interview with Amandla Stenberg, Lee Jung-jae, Manny Jacinto, Dafne Keen, Rebecca Henderson, Jodie Turner-Smith, Charlie Barnett, and Leslye Headland.\n\nStar Wars: The Acolyte: Season 1 (2024) premieres on Disney+ on June 4, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "editorial.rottentomatoes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rotten Tomatoes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_High_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: The High Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rotten Tomatoes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Henderson_(actress)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebecca Henderson (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodie_Turner-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jodie Turner-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_(Star_Wars)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Droid (Star Wars)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Barnett_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Barnett (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lightsaber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dafne_Keen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dafne Keen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Jacinto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manny Jacinto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_prequel_trilogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars prequel trilogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Storytelling", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Storytelling", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://prd-rteditorial.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/03110805/Star_Wars_Acolyte_Interviews-Rep.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 613, "textEnd": 619}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

They share a tragedy in their childhoods that has left them with very different feelings about the Jedi knights, who in the High Republic time frame are comfortably ascendant across the galaxy, before their later tribulations in the \"Star Wars\" films.\n\nThat critical moment, revealed in the season's first half (four of eight episodes were available for review), involves one of Headland's more noticeable creations: a coven of witches who tap into the Force with a holistic, communitarian ethos. (They feel borrowed from an early episode of \"Star Trek,\" with a swerve into unintentionally hilarious musical theater when they perform one of their ceremonies.) The nature-principle witches and the power-principle Jedi converge, spawning a vendetta plot centered on the grown twins that allows for plenty of planet hopping action. The fights are copious, and in another new twist for \"Star Wars,\" many of them take the form of balletic martial arts face-offs.\n\nBut the storytelling force is not strong. Putting more female characters, and a stronger female point of view (even if it is sometimes redolent of 1960s earth mother), into an otherwise traditional \"Star Wars\" framework is worth the attempt. \"The Acolyte\" doesn't bring enough energy or invention to the task, though.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_High_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: The High Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Silmarillion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Lucas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucasfilm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_story", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Short story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hobbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Lord of the Rings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi_census_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jedi census phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_(Star_Wars)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Droid (Star Wars)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Doll_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Doll (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lightsaber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Skywalker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Skywalker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R2-D2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "R2-D2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tragedy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/04/multimedia/04acolyte-lmqw/04acolyte-lmqw-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

However, new comments from showrunner Leslye Headland (via SFFGazette.com) suggest we should temper expectations about him or any other well-known Star Wars characters making cameo appearances.\n\n\"Can you imagine? Can you imagine if they were like, 'No problem. You can use Yoda. Not a big deal. Go for it.' No, there is not [a Yoda cameo],\" she admitted. \"We are pulling characters from the High Republic, and characters from [EU [Expanded Universe]. That's it.\"\n\nThe mention of the Expanded Universe is bound to draw some interest, particularly if it means Lucasfilm plans to address the lineage of Sith Masters who eventually led to Emperor Palpatine. It's also not outside the realm of possibility that there was an offshoot of Dark Side users unrelated to the Skywalker Saga.\n\nUltimately, it seems part of the appeal for Headland was telling a story in an era not filled with familiar faces from the wider Star Wars franchise.\n\n\"There were two reasons I wanted to set it in that particular time period and that far away from the prequels,\" she previously said. \"One, I didn't want to mess with any canon. The other thing that I loved about this period was the lack of legacy characters.\"\n\n\"I was too nervous to take them on, but also, I feel like we've seen a lot of that. [The High Republic] felt like a sandbox that I could easily jump into,\" Headland concluded.\n\nA new featurette for The Acolyte has also been released which explores the show's action sequences. You can check that out in the players below.\n\nIn The Acolyte, an investigation into a shocking crime spree pits a respected Jedi Master (Lee Jung-jae) against a dangerous warrior from his past (Amandla Stenberg). As more clues emerge, they travel down a dark path where sinister forces reveal all is not what it seems...\n\nThe series stars Amandla Stenberg, Lee Jung-jae, Manny Jacinto, Dafne Keen, Charlie Barnett, Jodie Turner-Smith, Rebecca Henderson, Dean-Charles Chapman, Joonas Suotamo, and Carrie-Anne Moss.\n\nThe next Star Wars TV series comes from creator and showrunner Leslye Headland (Russian Doll), who also serves as executive producer alongside Kathleen Kennedy, Simon Emanuel, Jeff F. King, and Jason Micallef.

Those who are interested, and those who feel as though a greater affront to Star Wars has never happened in the history of Star Wars.\n\nWhile the usual complaints (too \"woke,\" too many POCs, too many women) are circling in the social media spheres, one \"true cause\" for alarm has cropped up. While The Acolyte promises to be newcomer-friendly regarding the lore of Star Wars, actor Charlie Barnett doesn't seem to have picked up on the tie-ins.\n\nBefore we jump down Barnett's throat, it's important to remember that those characters mentioned don't even exist in the new series' timeline. The Acolyte is set one hundred years before the Prequel trilogy even starts, during the High Republic, an era when the Jedi were at the height of their power.\n\nThe conversation around The Acolyte has mirrored that of Andor. Fans questioned every aspect of the series until it hit streaming and rocketed to top-tier media for most viewers. But one of the biggest things that Andor had going for it that The Acolyte apparently lacks is a cast that knows enough about the lore to discuss it during interviews.\n\nWhile promoting the series, Charlie Barnett who plays the Jedi Yord Fandar, misspoke multiple times about the series lore. His minor faux pas saw him mixing up Luke and Anakin Skywalker while speaking on the morally grey writing of The Acolyte.\n\nWhile trying to keep things vague about his character he told Collider that Yord is committed to leading the people he protects down the path of good. But as Barnett says, \"life is much more complicated.\" With online movements like The Empire Did Nothing Wrong, it only makes sense for Star Wars to explore moral ambiguity, which was where Barnett was headed with he fumbled his words.\n\n\"Darth Vader is a bad person, it's very clear. But if you can't look and see that Anakin blowing up the Death Star possibly killed millions and millions of people...\" He doesn't quite manage to finish his sentence as co-star Dafne Keen gently squeezes his wrist and pleads with him to, \"just shut up.\"\n\nIts a truly embarrassing moment for the cast, though Manny Jacinto quickly laughs it off while Dafne \"I saw the movie you should shut up\" Keen suffers through the mortifying mistake. While it was clearly a slip of the tongue, some fans took it as a sign of disrespect or as outright proof that the series was going to suffer from the actor's lack of background knowledge.\n\nOne Redditor took to the site to voice their concerns culminating with, \"It's really concerning when main characters don't really know some key elements to a franchise.\"\n\nCommentors on TikTok saw the slipup as a sure sign of Disney's money-grubbing nature as if the company doesn't make $5 billion dollars in toys, apparel, games, and accessories yearly.\n\n\"It's Disney they don't care MCU writers Star Wars writers they have no idea what the hell they're talking about they're just looking to get money,\" one ranted.\n\n\"Are there actual Star Wars fans at this point,\" asked another, \"It kinda feels like dead internet theory.\"\n\nFor the most part, the less vitriolic side of the fandom sees no problem with actors who don't know the lore, or directors willing to take risks in new areas of the galaxy. For every enraged or disheartened message there were 2 more siding with Barnett and asking their peers to give the series a chance.\n\n\"He's an actor. As long as he can act well, I don't care how much Star Wars he knows.\" One Reddit user countered. \"in fact, Harrison Ford barely knows anything about the franchise and he played one of the most beloved characters ever.\"\n\n\"To be fair,\" a Toktokker replied, \"Walton Goggins never played Fallout before and intentionally didn't play or learn anything about the series and it was fantastic.\"\n\nThe \"controversy\" has generated a ton of hilarious responses in addition to the vitriol. Some of the highlight mass multiple pop-culture references together like, \"My favorite Anakin scene is when him and Optimus fight Dominic Torreto.\" Or \"Obi-wan always says.

During that period of prosperity, Headland crafts a Star Wars story that follows an investigation into a shocking crime spree against Jedi.\n\nThe mystery at the heart of the series pits a respected Jedi Master, played by Lee Jung-jae, against a dangerous warrior from his past, played by Amandla Stenberg.\n\nSince this era hasn't been seen in live action before, that gave Headland leeway for creative freedom.\n\n\"We actually can explore something new here and we don't have to worry about stepping on anything else and preserving something else,\" Headland said. That allowed her to tell \"a version of Star Wars from the bad guys' perspective.\"\n\nHowever, one challenge did present itself to Headland as the show came together.\n\n\"There's a lot tonally to try to accomplish,\" Headland explained. \"I was hoping to have a combination of a darker tone, but still there would be a decent amount of fun and games, and then also an intriguing mystery.\"\n\nHeadland worked closely with action designer and second unit director Chris Cowan to make sure that each fight was -- first and foremost -- \"an emotional scene.\"\n\nShe added that the fights would be broken down into sequences, so that by the third part of a confrontation \"something is revealed, and you have a shift in who's in control, who's in power.\"\n\nThat lends narrative propulsion to each action sequence, rather than stopping the development of the characters and plot. The fight scenes are also often depicted in wide shots where the actors' entire bodies can be seen executing the fight choreography, lending real-world weight and plausibility to those moments.\n\nCreating an eight-part installment in one of the most well-known franchises in this or any galaxy was a significant change for Headland, who had mainly worked in independent films prior to collaborating with the teams at Lucasfilm and Disney.\n\nHeadland described being \"overwhelmed by the support that I got from Lucasfilm,\" adding that due to her time making smaller projects, she was \"always fighting uphill to get something made. I had never been in the position where there were a dozen people cheering you on.\"\n\nShe added that she had \"a lot of people at Lucasfilm supporting me, my designers, my writers, my cast.\"\n\n\"I felt like I had a vision and I had something that had a lot of merit and could work really well in this world,\" Headland noted. \"But I think without that level of support, it would have been difficult to walk that that tightrope.\"\n\nAt the end of the first episode of The Acolyte, the first name in the credits is Headland's. The second is that of Disney Legend and Star Wars creator George Lucas.\n\n\"Don't think I didn't notice that,\" Headland, who is a long-time Star Wars fan, said. \"When I first saw that, my heartbeat quickened. That was one of the moments where it really felt real.\"", "source": {"uri": "thewaltdisneycompany.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Walt Disney Company"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sith", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Skywalker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luke Skywalker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_High_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: The High Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Solo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Han Solo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Leia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Princess Leia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucasfilm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_impact_of_Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cultural impact of Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Legends", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney Legends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Lucas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Disney", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Disney", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Media_Conglomerates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Media Conglomerates", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/app/uploads/2024/06/PDX-058458_R-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

And that audience will lap up The Acolyte because, above all else, it's very, very Star Wars.\n\nFrom the panoply of impressive prosthetics - who knew there are so many things you could do with a forehead? - to the galaxy of place names that look like a bad hand at Scrabble, as soon as a mysterious masked stranger marches into one of those dusty space-cafes, you are plunged right into the odd post-industrial/medieval mash-up aesthetic the franchise has made its own.\n\nThat mysterious stranger is Mae (Amandla Stenberg) and she's not shy about making her presence felt. Less than two minutes in, out come the lightsabers and we're into a full-on fight sequence, part martial arts, part contemporary dance, in which Mae sets out her stall: she's here on a revenge mission, to track down and kill the four Jedis who destroyed her family.\n\nIt's a strong opener, but it's only one half of the story. The narrative, set 100 years before the rise of the Empire (ie 100 years before The Phantom Menace), leans heavily on a clash between twins - one good, Osha; one bad, Mae - as they are forced to confront what happened to destroy their charmed childhood. Stenberg makes a fine fist of this double role, though she looks like she's having more fun when Mae is at her meanest.\n\nIf only creator Leslye Headland (Russian Doll) had found the courage to dig a little deeper into the psychological potential of the twins' clash. Unlike Andor - easily the best of the Star Wars spin-offs - The Acolyte is a pulled punch, too eager to play the story out in a series of five-minute jeopardy riffs rather than trust that the audience might have an attention span.\n\nThere are teasing hints of what it could be. Whenever Lee Jung-jae (Squid Game) appears as Jedi Master Sol, the character who promises to unlock the story's big secret, The Acolyte steps up a gear in terms of gravitas. The Good Place's Manny Jacinto is also good value as a dodgy pharmacist aiding and abetting Mae's mission.\n\nBut they're all hamstrung by a script that dares to deliver homilies such as \"We're not defined by what we lose, we're defined by what we survive\" with a straight face.\n\nUltimately, however, this is nostalgia sci-fi, a kids' TV show aimed at 50 year olds who, in the UK, grew up in the days when Doctor Who-style adventure meant wobbly sets and creatures made out of polystyrene. The Acolyte has many times that production budget, but its heart, rather charmingly, is hewn from that awestruck past that had space as an endless adventure playground, not one long dark dystopia.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Claus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosthesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lightsaber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scrabble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mashup (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contemporary dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle Ages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aesthetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Doll_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Doll (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Place", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Good Place"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Jacinto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manny Jacinto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5eMt32q4KiMilNJLJJzLSQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTI-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/475e52071a36bee642565af53b11e116", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Way back in 2020, which feels almost as long ago now as the High Republic era, Russian Doll showrunner Leslye Headland was announced to be working on a Star Wars TV show. Finally, four years later, the resulting series has hit streaming.\n\nUnfortunately, despite its long uphill battle to reach our screens, it seems some are already wishing it away. Rumors have swirled that Lucasfilm had secretly already pulled the plug on The Acolyte before its first season had even begun airing. But is there any truth to this? Could the series be heading for the fastest canceling in the Star Wars universe since Gina Carano?\n\nAs of the time of writing, no, The Acolyte is not cancelled. At least, not according to any reliable or confirmed reportage. The murmurings that the series -- starring Amandla Stenberg as a Sith apprentice and set 100 years before The Phantom Menace -- is already over come from That Park Place. The rumor claimed that \"an alleged insider at Lucasfilm\" directly told them that Disney is not moving forward with future seasons.\n\nThis would certainly contradict Headland's plans for The Acolyte, as the writer/producer pitched a full series bible to Lucasfilm when getting the show greenlit in 2020 and has been open about her plans to expand on her love letter to the Star Wars mythos if she gets the chance. Early reviews aren't entirely positive, however, and the fan reaction is equally mixed, although much of the negative noise is being generated by the sort of fans who've complained about everything released since 1999.\n\nDisney Plus is certainly no stranger to betraying Lucasfilm shows -- R.I.P. Willow -- so we'll have to wait until The Acolyte concludes airing its eight-part season in July before any official word comes out on its potential second season. Will it be a one-off wonder like Obi-Wan Kenobi or a returning fave like The Mandalorian?

You won't have to wait long to find out, but we expect there's a reason why actor Manny Jacinto referred to the iconic Duel of the Fates clash between Darth Maul and Qui-Gon Jinn a year ago.\n\nThe Acolyte is streaming exclusively on Disney Plus from June 4 in the US and June 5 in the UK.\n\nFor more, check out The Acolyte release schedule, The Acolyte episodes 1-4 review, and our interview with creator Leslye Headland on why she chose The High Republic era as the setting for the Star Wars series.

Gizmodo reports that Joonas Suotamo plays the character who took over the role of Chewbacca for the live-action part. However, once this new comic hits shelves, the Wookiee will also be depicted as drawings.\n\nThe Jedi Master will be featured in the High Republic era of the SWU, which is set 100 years before the events of Star Wars: Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace. What makes the Wookiee so unique is the first Wookiee Jedi in a live-action setting.\n\nThat said, it's such an essential character that it's getting the comic book treatment from Marvel.\n\nWhat Marvel's Kelnacca comic will include\n\nThe comic book will give us all more insight into the character and where he came from. It's a one-shot comic written by Cavan Scott and featuring art by Marika Cresta. The new comic is set to fill in the gap between The High Republic novels and comics to The Acolyte.\n\nScott told i09, \"It's been so exciting to draw a line from The Acolyte back to The High Republic era we've been building in comics, books, audio and animation.\"\n\nHe added, \"Kelnacca is the perfect character to bridge the gap between the time of Leslye Headland's spectacular series to the age of Starlight Beacon, the threat of Marchion Ro, and the marauding Nihil. In this comic, we will learn more about one of the most intriguing aspects of Kelnacca's design: the meaning behind those mysterious tattoos. Along the way we'll see the struggle of a Padawan and a master who is stoic, wise, and ultimately, a true practitioner of Light and Life.\"\n\nA neat aspect of the new Star Wars Kelnacca comic is that it will have one main cover and two variant covers from artists Phil Noto, Bj\u00f6rn Barends, and Takashi Okazaki. One features the character closer up; another features him further back in a battle stance, and the other has a more abstract look at him with a lightsaber.\n\nWith the new series now available and comics on the way, it begs the question: What order do you view the Star Wars franchise? Is it best to watch when things are released? Or chronologically? Maybe read everything that's out there before even watching anything?\n\nOne thing to note is The Acolyte takes place before anything else in Star Wars live-action history, replacing The Phantom Menace. This new eight-episode series focuses on the hunt for an assassin lurking around the galaxy intending to kill a set of Jedi. Plus, the assassin could be associated with the Sith, who was considered dead.\n\nUltimately, it's up to you, the viewer, to decide how to consume everything. There doesn't seem to be a wrong way of going about it. It's just a matter of putting all of the piecing together at some point and knowing where things land so they make sense as you move along.\n\nWhatever order you watch Star Wars in, it's great to have the world ever-expanding, even though it's getting farther away from the Skywalkers storyline. It seems it can go anywhere, with intriguing characters like the Wookiee Jedi.\n\nBe sure to check out The Acolyte on Disney+ and grab a copy of Kelnacca when it hits the shelves on September 4.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nathanael_fakes@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Nathanael Fakes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_High_Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars: The High Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wookiee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wookiee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joonas_Suotamo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joonas Suotamo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavan_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cavan Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewbacca", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chewbacca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gizmodo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gizmodo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-shot_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "One-shot (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io9", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Io9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Noto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Noto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lightsaber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sith"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "wgt": 44}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan Pages", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Comics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Comics", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/The-Acolyte-news-Star-Wars-series-gets-shocking-comic-book-update.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-04", "textStart": 3304, "textEnd": 3315}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

That embargo lifted just hours before the show's premiere, meaning audiences don't have to wait long to see what the hype is about.\n\nThe first two episodes of The Acolyte are set to premiere on Disney+ on June 4th at 6 PM PT/ 9 PM ET. For a franchise that loves midnight releases, I, for one, am happy that the show is on at a time we can all watch together. The rest of the season will premiere weekly on Tuesdays with the finale airing on July 16th.\n\nThe series is promising to introduce us to all new characters. The official synopsis says \"The Acolyte examines a galaxy of secrets and dark-side powers, and all is not what it seems.\" Exciting! And the reviews for the show should have fans hyped.\n\nHaving the reviews drop the same day as the show is a nice gift to fans. Everyone is going to spend the day reading about it and talking about it and typically, fans have to wait weeks (or longer) to see the show for themselves. With The Acolyte, fans only have to wait a few hours. And given how long we've been waiting for a new Star Wars show on Disney+, it is nice to know that the wait is almost over.\n\nSo each Tuesday, tune in for the latest adventure of the new Jedi we are going to be meeting, starting with the first two episodes of the Leslye Headland-created series on June 4th!", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mary Sue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_leishman@themarysue.com", "name": "Rachel Leishman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Abrams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Abrams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adventure fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/DVD", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events_and_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Events and Shows", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/the-jedi-all-together.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 506, "textEnd": 514, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 742, "textEnd": 751}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Some entries, like \"Ahsoka\" and the later seasons of \"The Mandalorian\" (and, frankly, \"Star Wars, Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker\"), view the universe through an endless parade of cameos, fan service, and appeals to nerd nostalgia. Others, like \"Andor,\" \"Visions,\" and now \"The Acolyte,\" make merry play with the potential of a galaxy far, far away, telling new stories that ask interesting questions about the very principles that undergird the \"Star Wars\" universe.\n\nCreated by Leslye Headland (\"Russian Doll\"), \"The Acolyte\"'s greatest strength lies in its time period: The High Republic, a solid century before the events of the Skywalker saga. It's a time of prosperity, peace, and complacency; the Jedi are in grander form than ever, with their pristine white and yellow robes and sense of smug superiority to their benevolent mission to save the galaxy. But resentment brews on the Outer Rim, and dark forces conspire to strike a blow against these so-called guardians of peace and justice at the height of their powers.\n\nA Jedi has been murdered: Master Indara (Carrie-Anne Moss), dispatched while engaging in a rousing mixture of Force powers and martial arts in the premiere's thrilling opening sequence. (Adding more explicit kung fu choreography to the mix is a lovely move to bring more dynamism to a fighting style that's long grown stale in the series, and a cameo from one of the stars of \"The Matrix\" helps sell this as the style moving forward.) The apparent culprit, as Indara's wise colleague Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae) quickly deduces, is Osha (Amandla Stenberg), Sol's former apprentice who quit the Order six years ago and now spends her time as a mechanic (\"meknek\") for the Trade Federation. There's just one wrinkle: Osha was half a galaxy away from Ishara when she died. So, who killed her, and why does she look exactly like Osha?\n\nWhat starts as a case of wrongful accusation unravels into a tale of twins separated at birth and the nagging rise of a Sith on the outer edge of the galaxy. And, in the case of \"The Acolyte,\" a fascinatingly complex attitude toward good and evil, religious subjugation, and the morality of vengeance.

Andor is not The Last Jedi and The Last Jedi is not The Phantom Menace, and each is more interesting for the new paths they cut across familiar territory. In broad strokes, though, a whole lot of them seem to come down to the same trusty formula: heroic Jedi freedom fighters versus dark-side imperialists, on and on across the galaxy for decades.\n\nIn that light, Disney+'s The Acolyte represents an intriguing shakeup. The spinoff, set roughly a century before the events of the films, finds the Jedi not as scrappy underdogs but as entrenched establishment. How precisely they've wielded that influence remains murky in the four 40ish-minute episodes sent to critics. But there are worse qualities for a new series to have than an overabundance of potential -- and wherever this one ends up, it's got enough on its mind to make the journey worthwhile.\n\nWhile the opening text indicates a time of peace and prosperity, the premiere, directed by creator Leslye Headland, makes clear that those blessings are not shared equally by all.\n\nOur protagonist is Osha (Amandla Stenberg), a former Padawan who washed out of the academy before reaching full-fledged Jedi status. Now she works as a \"meknik,\" doing outer-ship repairs for wealthy clients who don't care that the job has been deemed too dangerous for anyone but R2 droids. (That her name happens to be the acronym for the agency that regulates workplace safety in our own reality seems a sardonic joke.) But when Mae (also Stenberg), the twin she believed died 16 years earlier, resurfaces as a killer of Jedi, Osha reluctantly teams with her old master (Lee Jung-jae) to find her sister and bring her to justice.\n\nWhile Mae's spree has political implications for the Jedi, The Acolyte concerns itself with its more personal impact, with uneven results. Stenberg makes restraint her weapon as Osha; the more she turns her rage inward, the more we feel for the anguish bottled up inside her. Lee does similarly subtle work as Sol, conveying more tenderness with a single facial expression than could be explained in any clunky speech. (Though he's very smooth at delivering necessary chunks of exposition, too.)\n\nBut the series doesn't quite seem to know what to do with more marginal members of its ensemble, like Jedi Knight Yord (Charlie Burnett) or criminal supplier Qimir (Manny Jacinto). And while there are plot reasons to keep Mae difficult to pin down, the effect is a main character who feels distant, murky in her motivations and random in her choices.\n\nAs Osha slowly pieces together the truth about her and Mae's shared history, The Acolyte takes on the grim momentum of a conspiracy thriller: every answer seems to raise more unsettling questions, until it feels impossible to know whom to trust. The Jedi's role in the sisters' childhood starts to look less benevolent than Osha had always assumed it to be, though perhaps also less malicious than Mae had.\n\n\"This is not about good or bad. It's about power and who gets to wield it,\" their mother (a regal Jodie Turner-Smith) says in a flashback -- and indeed, the closer the series stares at the line between the two sides, the blurrier it becomes.\n\nA standout third episode, directed by Kogonada (Columbus, After Yang), embeds itself with a coven persecuted for their \"unnatural\" use of the Force. Yet what we see of their ways hardly seems sinister; they seem like women who want only to be left alone to practice their traditions in peace.\n\nFrom their perspective, the Jedi are the persecutors who barge in where they're not wanted, imposing their traditions on others with the full might of their institutional power. \"Thank you for your cooperation,\" the Jedi add after their most unreasonable demand, a fig leaf of courtesy to reframe their intervention as a civil exchange.\n\nThe Acolyte does not throw out the Star Wars playbook entirely. It's faithful to the charms that have carried this series for so many decades: strange planets, weird creatures, lightsaber battles with a fresh wuxia flair. Mae's murderous quest is backed by a mysterious figure whose helmet, weapon and mechanical voice recall Darth Vader, suggesting this narrative could yet come down to another Sith-versus-Jedi battle. And though I have yet to catch any famous last names or obvious Easter eggs, I would never put it past this franchise to circle back to Skywalkers or Palpatines at the last second.\n\nBut in its willingness to challenge our assumptions, The Acolyte finds its own place. It's one deep in the gray, between the poles of light and dark that have defined so much of its galaxy.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "angie_han@hollywoodreporter.com", "name": "Angie Han", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simu_Liu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Simu Liu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imperialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lopez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droid_(Star_Wars)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Droid (Star Wars)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acronym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Jacinto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manny Jacinto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_Yang", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "After Yang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodie_Turner-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jodie Turner-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lightsaber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wuxia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kogonada", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kogonada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Easter egg (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flashback (narrative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darth Vader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Star-Wars-The-Acolyte-Disney-Plus-H-MAIN-2024.jpg?w=1296", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

An adventure concerning a young woman with deep ties to the Jedi she once sought to join, it's the umpteenth example of the fact that not all sagas need to go on indefinitely -- and especially not via formulaic prequels.\n\n(Warning: Some spoilers ahead.)\n\nOne hundred years before the rise of the Empire, the Galactic Republic rules the universe with the aid of the Jedi Order. Despite their position, the lightsaber-loving good guys are hardly invincible, as is proven when a masked figure enters a watering hole on the planet of Ueda and demands a fight with Jedi Master Indara (Carrie-Anne Moss).\n\nThis unknown female warrior wields the Force, and her actions don't go unnoticed by the rest of the Jedi, who subsequently identify the combatant as Osha Aniseya (Amandla Stenberg). The only catch is, Osha is working as a meknek (i.e., a mechanic who repairs spaceships' outer-hull problems) on a freighter, and she denies having anything to do with the crime. Even so, she's arrested by a group of Jedi led by Yord Fandar (Charlie Barnett), who knows Osha from her prior time spent training to become a Jedi.\n\nAs is soon revealed, Osha was rescued 16 years earlier by the Jedi from her home world of Brendok, where her family died in a terrible fire started by her twin sister Mae. Osha was then groomed to be a Jedi by Master Sol (Squid Game's Lee Jung-jae) until she realized that she couldn't do the one thing -- get over her past trauma -- necessary to fulfill her education. Sol is presently teaching little kids how to harness the Force (\"a power we must respect\"), and he's stunned to hear that his former padawan was responsible for the recent attack.\n\nStill, he has little means of refuting the charges, especially once he learns that there was a mutiny aboard her prison transport ship and that Osha was the sole person who didn't make it off the craft before it crashed. Convinced she's alive, he takes his current padawan Jecki (Dafne Keen) to wintery Carlac. There, they find and rescue Osha, who's now having visions of her dead sibling, who claims to have slain Indara and pledges to \"kill them all.\"\n\nWhile there might be multiple potential explanations for these events, The Acolyte doesn't bother teasing its central mystery, instead divulging that Mae (Sternberg) survived the murderous conflagration she started as a kid. Working with an accomplice named Qimir (Manny Jacinto), whose weirdo shadiness isn't nearly weird or shady enough to be interesting, Mae serves a cloaked master whose identity is hidden from us as well as her.\n\nWhy she does this is anyone's guess, but her dark lord has taught her the ways of the Jedi and has goaded her into seeking revenge against the four masters who were present on Brendok when her clan perished. A flashback-heavy third episode details the specifics of that calamity: Born to a coven of witches ruled by Mother Aniseya (Jodie Turner-Smith), Mae and Osha were destined to follow in their ancestors' footsteps until Osha decided she didn't want to be permanently paired with her clingy sister. The Jedi's arrival, and Osha's interest in enlisting with them, was the spark that ignited the tragedy.\n\nThe Acolyte dramatizes all of this with a preponderance of exposition (marked by the usual silly sounding names) vocalized by people in typical Star Wars alien make-up, all striped skin, horned faces, and strange eye colors.\n\nCreated by Leslye Headland, who shares directing duties with Kogonada, Alex Garcia Lopez, and Hanelle Culpepper, the series looks the same as every preceding Disney+ effort, meaning it's full of CGI that's both technically assured and largely flat and lifeless. Its diverse environments are generally drab, and no matter how well it blends its foreground characters and artificial backgrounds, it feels stagey and small. That should come as a surprise, considering The New York Times reported that the series' budget was a whopping $180 million -- more than most major blockbusters. It also comes across as more than a bit redundant; if you were betting that Osha would have a unique pint-sized droid companion who bleeps, bloops and blurps in a language that only she can comprehend, it's time to collect your winnings!\n\nSternberg is more comfortable playing the furiously vengeful Mae than the blandly upright Osha, while Lee does a riff on a tired type as the noble and kind-hearted Sol. The Acolyte's main problem, however, isn't acting but basic conception. Considering how lethargically it's laid out and how dreary its early surprises prove to be, there's simply no great reason to care about this pre-Luke and Leia story.\n\nThat goes for its combat as well; although Sternberg and Moss's initial scuffle is energized by the latter's stoic martial-arts techniques, any thrills are undercut by derivativeness. Cantinas, Jedi temples, oceanside cliffs, Wookiees, and grungy starship interiors are all part of this regurgitated package, and the familiarity of so many of these elements is not just dispiriting but borderline puzzling, since they indicate that this sprawling fictional world has undergone no evolution -- of culture, technology, fashion, etc. -- between this show and the ensuing series installments.\n\nOver the course of its first four episodes (which were all that were provided to press), The Acolyte offers a few modest reasons to stay tuned, beginning with the secret identity of Mae's puppetmaster, who's discussed in ominous terms and who demonstrates his formidable powers during his big on-screen introduction. Yet at this late phase in Star Wars history, that's hardly enough to warrant weeks upon weeks of investment in a show that exists less because it has a novel tale to tell than because Disney believes the franchise brand must be perpetually extended -- and that accomplishing that goal requires merely a grab bag of colorful light sabers, bizarre E.T.s, and sinister baddies.", "source": {"uri":

An adventure concerning a young woman with deep ties to the Jedi she once sought to join, it's the umpteenth example of the fact that not all sagas need to go on indefinitely -- and especially not via formulaic prequels.\n\n(Warning: Some spoilers ahead.)\n\nOne hundred years before the rise of the Empire, the Galactic Republic rules the universe with the aid of the Jedi Order. Despite their position, the lightsaber-loving good guys are hardly invincible, as is proven when a masked figure enters a watering hole on the planet of Ueda and demands a fight with Jedi Master Indara (Carrie-Anne Moss).\n\nThis unknown female warrior wields the Force, and her actions don't go unnoticed by the rest of the Jedi, who subsequently identify the combatant as Osha Aniseya (Amandla Stenberg). The only catch is, Osha is working as a meknek (i.e., a mechanic who repairs spaceships' outer-hull problems) on a freighter, and she denies having anything to do with the crime. Even so, she's arrested by a group of Jedi led by Yord Fandar (Charlie Barnett), who knows Osha from her prior time spent training to become a Jedi.\n\nAs is soon revealed, Osha was rescued 16 years earlier by the Jedi from her home world of Brendok, where her family died in a terrible fire started by her twin sister Mae. Osha was then groomed to be a Jedi by Master Sol (Squid Game's Lee Jung-jae) until she realized that she couldn't do the one thing -- get over her past trauma -- necessary to fulfill her education. Sol is presently teaching little kids how to harness the Force (\"a power we must respect\"), and he's stunned to hear that his former padawan was responsible for the recent attack.\n\nStill, he has little means of refuting the charges, especially once he learns that there was a mutiny aboard her prison transport ship and that Osha was the sole person who didn't make it off the craft before it crashed. Convinced she's alive, he takes his current padawan Jecki (Dafne Keen) to wintery Carlac. There, they find and rescue Osha, who's now having visions of her dead sibling, who claims to have slain Indara and pledges to \"kill them all.\"\n\n'Clipped': Donald Sterling's Racist Comments Get the Prestige TV Treatment\n\nWhile there might be multiple potential explanations for these events, The Acolyte doesn't bother teasing its central mystery, instead divulging that Mae (Sternberg) survived the murderous conflagration she started as a kid. Working with an accomplice named Qimir (Manny Jacinto), whose weirdo shadiness isn't nearly weird or shady enough to be interesting, Mae serves a cloaked master whose identity is hidden from us as well as her.\n\nWhy she does this is anyone's guess, but her dark lord has taught her the ways of the Jedi and has goaded her into seeking revenge against the four masters who were present on Brendok when her clan perished. A flashback-heavy third episode details the specifics of that calamity: Born to a coven of witches ruled by Mother Aniseya (Jodie Turner-Smith), Mae and Osha were destined to follow in their ancestors' footsteps until Osha decided she didn't want to be permanently paired with her clingy sister. The Jedi's arrival, and Osha's interest in enlisting with them, was the spark that ignited the tragedy.\n\nThe Acolyte dramatizes all of this with a preponderance of exposition (marked by the usual silly sounding names) vocalized by people in typical Star Wars alien make-up, all striped skin, horned faces, and strange eye colors.\n\nEven the Hallucinations Are Horny on 'Interview With the Vampire'\n\nCreated by Leslye Headland, who shares directing duties with Kogonada, Alex Garcia Lopez, and Hanelle Culpepper, the series looks the same as every preceding Disney+ effort, meaning it's full of CGI that's both technically assured and largely flat and lifeless. Its diverse environments are generally drab, and no matter how well it blends its foreground characters and artificial backgrounds, it feels stagey and small. That should come as a surprise, considering The New York Times reported that the series' budget was a whopping $180 million -- more than most major blockbusters. It also comes across as more than a bit redundant; if you were betting that Osha would have a unique pint-sized droid companion who bleeps, bloops and blurps in a language that only she can comprehend, it's time to collect your winnings!\n\nSternberg is more comfortable playing the furiously vengeful Mae than the blandly upright Osha, while Lee does a riff on a tired type as the noble and kind-hearted Sol. The Acolyte's main problem, however, isn't acting but basic conception. Considering how lethargically it's laid out and how dreary its early surprises prove to be, there's simply no great reason to care about this pre-Luke and Leia story.\n\nThat goes for its combat as well; although Sternberg and Moss's initial scuffle is energized by the latter's stoic martial-arts techniques, any thrills are undercut by derivativeness. Cantinas, Jedi temples, oceanside cliffs, Wookiees, and grungy starship interiors are all part of this regurgitated package, and the familiarity of so many of these elements is not just dispiriting but borderline puzzling, since they indicate that this sprawling fictional world has undergone no evolution -- of culture, technology, fashion, etc. -- between this show and the ensuing series installments.\n\nOver the course of its first four episodes (which were all that were provided to press), The Acolyte offers a few modest reasons to stay tuned, beginning with the secret identity of Mae's puppetmaster, who's discussed in ominous terms and who demonstrates his formidable powers during his big on-screen introduction. Yet at this late phase in Star Wars history, that's hardly enough to warrant weeks upon weeks of investment in a show that exists less because it has a novel tale to tell than because Disney believes the franchise brand must be perpetually extended -- and that accomplishing that goal requires merely a grab bag of colorful light sabers, bizarre E.T.s, and sinister baddies.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

Some of that may be due to the fact that it's not based on an established character like a Cassian Andor or an Ahsoka Tano. Meanwhile, it also does not have a Grogu-like figure front and center for a cuteness factor. This is a show that is doing a few things different, and that may make its run a little unique, as well.\n\nIs this a Star Wars show that could actually get more attention the longer the season goes? One of the things that is pretty great so far is that a lot of the reviews are overwhelmingly positive. So long as that remains the case in the weeks ahead, Disney could be onto something here!\n\nThe need for word-of-mouth is probably one of the reasons why Disney thankfully scheduled out the rest of The Acolyte the way that they have. The first two episodes are designed to get you hooked and moving forward, there are installments coming once per week from now until mid-July.\n\nWell, let's just say that there are not going to be a lot of spoilers or details released over the course of the next few weeks. This is a show that is going to be kept as under wraps as possible, largely for one reason -- what incentive is there for the powers-that-be to give things away? So much about Star Wars is the thrill of the unknown, and with this series in particular venturing pretty far from the Skywalker saga, there's a chance that all of this story is a great unknown.\n\nBe sure to share right now in the attached comments!

When I went to the premiere of The Acolyte at the Callao Cinema in Madrid the other day, I wondered if Leslye Headland's idea would be the breath of fresh air it promises to be and, particularly, how much it would be able to tell if each episode is only half an hour long. Having seen the first two episodes, I can answer some of these questions and raise others.\n\nThe most vaunted thing about the show is that it is primarily about a serial murder mystery. And that it takes place in the time of the High Republic, a century before The Phantom Menace. And that it will supposedly be somewhat darker, both in terms of the murder theme and the emergence of the dark side of the Force.\n\nI'm not going to gut the events of these episodes here, but I have to share my main impression already: The Acolyte must be holding its cards close to really surprise me towards the end of the season. I say this because, while it starts off mysterious, much of the mystery is resolved or diluted already in these first two acts, so I imagine it's playing a game of misdirection to surprise me later on. In fact, if you haven't read into any of the series, I recommend that you continue like this, because the mystery that it tries to raise right from the start is already gutted in the synopsis itself.\n\nIn any case, someone has commissioned a series of murders among the highest ranks of the Jedi Order, and it is up to the Order itself, with Lee Jung-jae's Sun Master at the helm for personal reasons, to do the investigation work in the purest CSI style. The who and how of the first two murders are resolved seemingly instantly, so the most interesting thing for now will be to find out the why. That's the real intrigue of this series: the Jedi did something very bad when the protagonist was a child, and the real curiosity lies in discovering what happened then and how those acts put in check everything the reputed Order stood for in these times.\n\nI like the narrative pace, especially in the first episode, and the contrast between the roles of the different characters. Master Indara (Carrie-Anne Moss) comes across a little too \"Trinity with a lightsaber\" to me, although that's exactly what the showrunner and director of these two episodes wanted, but at one point I thought, \"if she does the scorpion kick, I'm up and leaving\". That said, she does give a good example of her power and more of a martial artist style.\n\nMy favourite, however, is Dafne Keen's Padawan Jecki Lon, a very young apprentice who is as cunning as she is wise, somewhere between the younger Ahsoka from The Clone Wars and Omega from The Bad Batch, but with her own charm and more accurate observations. Plus, she always knows how to contain Charlie Barnett's Yord Fandar, her abundant, rule-obsessed Jedi sidekick, who starts off as a clown but quickly works with this show's sense of humour too (I admit it: I giggled at the \"who is he?\" bit).\n\nIn fact, in these two episodes the cast is starting to come together really well, led by a chameleon-like Amandla Stenberg who, by the looks of things, must have had a big part to play in resolving her dual performance and coming out on top. We'll see as the episodes go on.\n\nAnother note that the start of The Acolyte leaves us with is that it is well made. It's not another Obi-Wan Kenobi case, at least for now. The scenery, the shots, the lighting, the choreography, and even the somewhat repetitive music, also borrowed from The Matrix in each fight, are convincing in its more confined scales. Of course, they also suffer in the wider scales, especially on Coruscant, which is a bit too CGI.\n\nThe series also makes an effort to show new or different things from the beginning, even if sometimes in a somewhat strange way. In barely an hour it has time to travel around planets like Ueda, Olega, Brendok or Khofar, and to show (almost) never-seen-before extras, like the work of the meknek or the Wookie-jedi Kelnacca. Some, I get the impression, will come off as pastiche. There is also some peculiar technology used now in this style of crime, although again some gadgets seem more modern than those available a hundred years later, a typical temporal paradox in this universe.\n\nAnd what about the dark side? Disney promises a tougher, more mature plot, while Headland adds that it will have a good deal of passion and love. Of all this, we have seen little. It's true that these are murders, after all, and that the apparitions that Osha sees in the dark generate bad blood, but so far, apart from the temporal and therefore socio-cultural and political leap, there's nothing that hasn't been seen in some of the subplots of The Clone Wars.\n\nThis brings me to the big question: will this murder mystery be intriguing enough on its own given its compact format, or will it rely on the wider Star Wars lore? And if so, will we see Darth Plagueis the Wise dealing with death, or even Yoda? Will this 'eat' into the rest as it sometimes does in the Filoniverse?\n\nIn any case, it left me with a good taste in my mouth and a desire for more, especially for those more refreshing touches.

An adventure concerning a young woman with deep ties to the Jedi she once sought to join, it's the umpteenth example of the fact that not all sagas need to go on indefinitely -- and especially not via formulaic prequels.\n\n(Warning: Some spoilers ahead.)\n\nOne hundred years before the rise of the Empire, the Galactic Republic rules the universe with the aid of the Jedi Order. Despite their position, the lightsaber-loving good guys are hardly invincible, as is proven when a masked figure enters a watering hole on the planet of Ueda and demands a fight with Jedi Master Indara (Carrie-Anne Moss).\n\nThis unknown female warrior wields the Force, and her actions don't go unnoticed by the rest of the Jedi, who subsequently identify the combatant as Osha Aniseya (Amandla Stenberg). The only catch is, Osha is working as a meknek (i.e., a mechanic who repairs spaceships' outer-hull problems) on a freighter, and she denies having anything to do with the crime. Even so, she's arrested by a group of Jedi led by Yord Fandar (Charlie Barnett), who knows Osha from her prior time spent training to become a Jedi.\n\nAs is soon revealed, Osha was rescued 16 years earlier by the Jedi from her home world of Brendok, where her family died in a terrible fire started by her twin sister Mae. Osha was then groomed to be a Jedi by Master Sol (Squid Game's Lee Jung-jae) until she realized that she couldn't do the one thing -- get over her past trauma -- necessary to fulfill her education. Sol is presently teaching little kids how to harness the Force (\"a power we must respect\"), and he's stunned to hear that his former padawan was responsible for the recent attack.\n\nStill, he has little means of refuting the charges, especially once he learns that there was a mutiny aboard her prison transport ship and that Osha was the sole person who didn't make it off the craft before it crashed. Convinced she's alive, he takes his current padawan Jecki (Dafne Keen) to wintery Carlac. There, they find and rescue Osha, who's now having visions of her dead sibling, who claims to have slain Indara and pledges to \"kill them all.\"\n\n'Clipped': Donald Sterling's Racist Comments Get the Prestige TV Treatment\n\nWhile there might be multiple potential explanations for these events, The Acolyte doesn't bother teasing its central mystery, instead divulging that Mae (Sternberg) survived the murderous conflagration she started as a kid. Working with an accomplice named Qimir (Manny Jacinto), whose weirdo shadiness isn't nearly weird or shady enough to be interesting, Mae serves a cloaked master whose identity is hidden from us as well as her.\n\nWhy she does this is anyone's guess, but her dark lord has taught her the ways of the Jedi and has goaded her into seeking revenge against the four masters who were present on Brendok when her clan perished. A flashback-heavy third episode details the specifics of that calamity: Born to a coven of witches ruled by Mother Aniseya (Jodie Turner-Smith), Mae and Osha were destined to follow in their ancestors' footsteps until Osha decided she didn't want to be permanently paired with her clingy sister. The Jedi's arrival, and Osha's interest in enlisting with them, was the spark that ignited the tragedy.\n\nThe Acolyte dramatizes all of this with a preponderance of exposition (marked by the usual silly sounding names) vocalized by people in typical Star Wars alien make-up, all striped skin, horned faces, and strange eye colors.\n\nEven the Hallucinations Are Horny on 'Interview With the Vampire'\n\nCreated by Leslye Headland, who shares directing duties with Kogonada, Alex Garcia Lopez, and Hanelle Culpepper, the series looks the same as every preceding Disney+ effort, meaning it's full of CGI that's both technically assured and largely flat and lifeless. Its diverse environments are generally drab, and no matter how well it blends its foreground characters and artificial backgrounds, it feels stagey and small. That should come as a surprise, considering The New York Times reported that the series' budget was a whopping $180 million -- more than most major blockbusters. It also comes across as more than a bit redundant; if you were betting that Osha would have a unique pint-sized droid companion who bleeps, bloops and blurps in a language that only she can comprehend, it's time to collect your winnings!\n\nSternberg is more comfortable playing the furiously vengeful Mae than the blandly upright Osha, while Lee does a riff on a tired type as the noble and kind-hearted Sol. The Acolyte's main problem, however, isn't acting but basic conception. Considering how lethargically it's laid out and how dreary its early surprises prove to be, there's simply no great reason to care about this pre-Luke and Leia story.\n\nThat goes for its combat as well; although Sternberg and Moss's initial scuffle is energized by the latter's stoic martial-arts techniques, any thrills are undercut by derivativeness. Cantinas, Jedi temples, oceanside cliffs, Wookiees, and grungy starship interiors are all part of this regurgitated package, and the familiarity of so many of these elements is not just dispiriting but borderline puzzling, since they indicate that this sprawling fictional world has undergone no evolution -- of culture, technology, fashion, etc. -- between this show and the ensuing series installments.\n\nOver the course of its first four episodes (which were all that were provided to press), The Acolyte offers a few modest reasons to stay tuned, beginning with the secret identity of Mae's puppetmaster, who's discussed in ominous terms and who demonstrates his formidable powers during his big on-screen introduction. Yet at this late phase in Star Wars history, that's hardly enough to warrant weeks upon weeks of investment in a show that exists less because it has a novel tale to tell than because Disney believes the franchise brand must be perpetually extended -- and that accomplishing that goal requires merely a grab bag of colorful light sabers, bizarre E.T.s, and sinister baddies.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

The series explores how that happened. \"Where are the cracks?\" Headland asked. \"Is the call coming from inside the house?\"", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jung-jae", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jung-jae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Squid Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodie_Turner-Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jodie Turner-Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Doll_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Doll (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrie-Anne_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carrie-Anne Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0j1bdv5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

And that audience will lap up The Acolyte because, above all else, it's very, very Star Wars.\n\nFrom the panoply of impressive prosthetics - who knew there are so many things you could do with a forehead? - to the galaxy of place names that look like a bad hand at Scrabble, as soon as a mysterious masked stranger marches into one of those dusty space-cafes, you are plunged right into the odd post-industrial/medieval mash-up aesthetic the franchise has made its own.\n\nThat mysterious stranger is Mae (Amandla Stenberg) and she's not shy about making her presence felt. Less than two minutes in, out come the lightsabers and we're into a full-on fight sequence, part martial arts, part contemporary dance, in which Mae sets out her stall: she's here on a revenge mission, to track down and kill the four Jedis who destroyed her family.\n\nIt's a strong opener, but it's only one half of the story. The narrative, set 100 years before the rise of the Empire (ie 100 years before The Phantom Menace), leans heavily on a clash between twins - one good, Osha; one bad, Mae - as they are forced to confront what happened to destroy their charmed childhood. Stenberg makes a fine fist of this double role, though she looks like she's having more fun when Mae is at her meanest.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "keith_watson@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Keith Watson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-off_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spin-off (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lightsaber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Claus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scrabble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mashup (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle Ages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosthesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosthesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aesthetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_dance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contemporary dance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martial arts"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/tv/2024/06/04/TELEMMGLPICT000379183306_17175067891070_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqNLFz2QTH6RCwPE4UPA-sBf4Xpit_DMGvdp2n7FDd82k.jpeg?impolicy=logo-overlay", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619754", "eventUri": "eng-9619754", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

Abrams' The Force Awakens in 2015, the franchise's best installments have one common feature. Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi and Tony Gilroy's Andor both chose to take the series in bold new directions, opening up exciting new possibilities for Star Wars storytelling. The Last Jedi shifted the core story away from the Skywalker family, suggesting that anyone could be a Jedi -- a hero. Andor used the familiar setting as the backdrop for an adult political drama about rebellion and imperial rule, eliminating heroes entirely in favor of individuals who make up a mass movement. Fans may not have always thought so. The Last Jedi faced a notorious fan backlash, and Andor season 1 paled in viewership to the likes of The Mandalorian. But these projects provided a lifeline for a saga that was struggling to find a way forward, especially at multiplexes. Longevity requires vitality, and that requires flexibility.\n\n\"The Acolyte\" is not \"Andor\" or \"The Last Jedi,\" nor does it try to be. (In fact, it's effectively the opposite of Gilroy's show, with \"Andor\" eschewing the supernatural for its foot soldiers, while \"The Acolyte\" goes all-in on the Jedi Order and Force-wielding space wizards.) But the latest \"Star Wars\" series, created by \"Bachelorette\" and \"Russian Doll\" star Leslye Headland, is as willing as those predecessors to put its own spin on sacred legends. In the four episodes of its eight episodes previewed to critics, \"The Acolyte\" combines the classic elements that give \"Star Wars\" its enduring appeal with new additions to the canon, a strong central cast and snappy pacing. The show also underscores a lesson that \"Star Wars\" has taught itself in the past but has rarely heeded: You don't need to reuse elements of the main story to make a derivative work appealing. In fact, the opposite approach is often more rewarding.\n\nSet a century before the fall of the Republic in the style of a George Lucas prequel, \"Acolyte\" begins as a mystery. It opens with Jedi Master Andara (Carrie-Anne Moss) facing off against a warrior (Amandla Stenberg) who seems to harbor a personal grudge against Andara and the Jedi as a whole. Their deadly showdown then cuts to starship mechanic Osha (also Stenberg), a former Jedi trainee who left the Jedi Order six years ago. Osha doesn't seem like the type to attack someone with a knife, but the Jedi are suspicious when they are sent to investigate a suspect who matches her description, including her former classmate Yord (Charlie Barnett, reuniting with Headland from \"Russian Doll\").\n\nStill, \"Acolyte\" gives both the audience and Osha's investigators a quick rundown of the relationship between Stenberg's two characters. In the end, the show turns out to have more interesting topics, such as Osha's relationship with her former master, Sol (\"The Squid Game\" star Lee Jung-jae). Sol was once stationed on Osha's home planet with Andara, when a fire broke out and her entire family died. At least, she thought that included her twin sister, Mei. Osha, who was eight years old at the time, was stationed on Coruscant with Sol, and Sol continues to harbor guilt-ridden tender feelings toward his former student. Meanwhile, Mei was training under an anonymous master. No one ever utters the words \"dark side\" or \"Sith,\" but the red lightsaber says it all.\n\nWhile there are obvious echoes of Luke and Leia in the tale of twins separated at an early age and Darth Vader in the masked, distorted-voiced villain, later episodes contain revelations that threaten to upend and subvert our notions of the Jedi and dualistic notions of the Force.\n\nThe mistakes of the Jedi have long been one of the most intriguing and underexplored themes in Star Wars. In their pursuit of the Chosen One, the warrior priests inadvertently sowed the seeds of their own downfall. Luke Skywalker became disillusioned with his life's work and vowed to perish the Jedi Order along with him. Star Wars has always been, in some ways, a Greek tragedy disguised as a children's blockbuster. But as in the case of its corporate sibling Marvel, a plethora of spinoffs can dilute the brand's reputation while also narrowing its focus. Never before have the Jedi been so front and center and scrutinized as they are in The Acolytes, unless they're forced to share the same space (literally) with military and outlaws.\n\nLee's Sol emerges as a sympathetic expression of these conflicting emotions. Viewers familiar with the actor's work in Korea won't be surprised to find him an action hero with a heart, but for Americans who only know him as a Netflix personality, the role showcases the range he can perform on the English-speaking media's biggest stage. Stenberg, of course, plays two roles, developing Mei and Osha's physical characteristics and different perspectives on the Jedi (though it's telling that even Osha, the defender, can't let go of her emotions in the midst of unprocessed grief and chooses not to join the Jedi). Manny Jacinto plays Mei's accomplice, and his performance recalls his awkward, bumbling character in \"The Good Place,\" but with more sinister nuances. And Dafne Keen from \"His Dark Materials\" manages to express a keen, inquisitive young apprentice beneath a ton of makeup and CGI. The ensemble mimics established \"Star Wars\" types while also making its own mark.\n\n\"Acolyte\" is rich with action, much of it hand-to-hand combat with a strong martial arts twist. (An opening scene, in which Moss leaps gracefully over a railing with the aid of a wire, feels like a martial arts movie.) But the action scenes themselves are rooted in conflicts with big and small stakes for characters we quickly become interested in. Whether Osha and Mei can somehow understand each other is tied to an existential question about whether we can trust the Jedi as arbiters of justice, or even whether we can trust the Jedi themselves. By allowing itself to pry into the \"Star Wars\" mythology, \"Acolyte\" cultivates the same curiosity it shows about its own world. Too often, franchises feel like perfunctory exercises in expansion. When the \"Acolyte\" screener cut, I wanted to know what happened next, even if I already knew where the Republic was headed.\n\nThe first two episodes of \"The Acolyte\" will be available on Disney+ on June 4 at 6pm PST, with the remaining episodes streaming every Tuesday.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Acolyte_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Acolyte (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andor_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andor (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Star Wars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Doll_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian Doll (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amandla_Stenberg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amandla Stenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bachelorette_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bachelorette (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canon (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skywalker_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skywalker family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rian_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rian Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acolyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Acolyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslye_Headland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leslye Headland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Abrams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

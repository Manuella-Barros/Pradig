Platkin on Monday announced a 13-count racketeering indictment against South Jersey power broker George E. Norcross III and other members of his Democratic political machine, alleging they wielded their influence to corruptly obtain real estate along the Camden waterfront.\n\n\" READ MORE: South Jersey power broker George Norcross, allies charged in sweeping racketeering case\n\nThe state grand jury's 111-page indictment against Norcross and five codefendants -- including his brother Philip, his longtime lawyer William Tambussi, and former Camden Mayor Dana Redd -- accuses them of racketeering, financial facilitation, and misconduct by a corporate official.\n\n\"The indictment unsealed today alleges that George Norcross has been running a criminal enterprise in this state for at least the last twelve years,\" Platkin said in a statement.\n\n\"On full display in this indictment is how a group of unelected, private businessmen used their power and influence to get government to aid their criminal enterprise and further its interests. The alleged conduct of the Norcross Enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, non-profits, the people of the state of New Jersey, and especially the city of Camden and its residents.\"\n\nThe charges come days after Platkin's office charged two Norcross allies on the board of South Jersey Transportation Authority with misusing their positions to exact revenge on a Norcross foe.\n\nGeorge Norcross, 68, now of Palm Beach, Fla., is executive chairman of insurance firm Conner, Strong & Buckelew and chairman of the board at Cooper Health. He was a co-owner of The Philadelphia Inquirer for about two years until he sold his interest in 2014.\n\n\" READ MORE: Who is George Norcross? A look at the indicted South Jersey power broker\n\nPhilip A. Norcross, 61, of Philadelphia, is Norcross' brother and managing shareholder and CEO of the law firm Parker McCay.\n\nWilliam M. Tambussi, 66, of Brigantine, is Norcross' longtime attorney and lawyer for the Camden County Democratic Committee.\n\nDana L. Redd, 56, of Sicklerville, is a former Camden mayor and current CEO of the Camden Community Partnership, formerly known as Cooper's Ferry Partnership -- a nonprofit engaged in redevelopment.\n\nSidney R. Brown, 67, of Philadelphia, is the CEO of NFI, a trucking and logistics company who also serves on the board at Cooper Health.\n\nJohn J. O'Donnell, 61, of Newton, Pa., is an executive at the Michaels Organization, a residential development company, and partner in groups that owned several of the Camden buildings at the center of the allegations.\n\nProsecutors said George Norcross and his allies raked in millions, thanks to their control over city government and their efforts to muscle their way into the waterfront's redevelopment.\n\nAs of 2023, Norcross' insurance brokerage received $8.6 million in redevelopment tax credits from the state, which it sold for $7.9 million. From 2012 to 2023, Norcross collected more than $29 million in wages from the firm.\n\nMeanwhile, Cooper Health received $27.1 million in tax credits between 2016 and 2022 and sold them for $25 million -- an amount that allowed it to completely offset what it owed in rent at its headquarters building, which it partially owns.\n\nProsecutors said Norcross also benefited from $3.5 million in tax credits won by the residential building 11 Cooper, which is owned by an entity in which he and others hold a financial stake. The ownership group sold those tax credits for $4.3 million, according to the indictment.\n\nProsecutors also said Norcross threatened one developer who held property rights to land eventually used to build the tallest building on Camden's waterfront -- the Triad 1828 Centre and current headquarters of Norcross' insurance brokerage -- as well as 11 Cooper.\n\nThough he was not identified by name in the charging document, The Inquirer reported last year that rival was Philadelphia real estate developer Carl Dranoff.\n\nWhen Dranoff refused to relinquish his rights to the property, Norcross, according to the indictment, threatened he would \"f -- you up like you've never been f -- before.\" He also vowed the developer would never do business in Camden again, according to the indictment.\n\nLater, in a recorded phone call, Norcross allegedly acknowledged making those threats, saying he told Dranoff that if he didn't play ball \"it [would] have enormous consequences.\"\n\nDranoff asked whether Norcross was threatening him.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Norcross responded: \"Absolutely.\"\n\nSome of the most serious charges carry a maximum sentence 20 years in state prison.\n\nGeorge Norcross and his allies showed up at Attorney General Platkin's news conference, and Norcross sat in the front row as Platkin spoke to the media.\n\nAfterward, Norcross and his lawyer accused Platkin of pursuing a political vendetta against the South Jersey businessman.\n\nMichael Critchley, an attorney for Norcross, said the criminal charges filed against his client were not the result of a \"fair, impartial proceeding but rather the culmination of a political vendetta that Mr. Platkin personally has against\" Norcross.\n\nNorcross traced Platkin's ill will back to the New Jersey Senate's 2018 investigation of sexual misconduct allegations against a staffer on Gov. Phil Murphy's 2017 campaign for governor. Platkin was a top aide on the campaign and joined Murphy's administration as chief counsel.\n\nA Senate committee alleged Murphy's team mishandled an internal investigation into rape allegations and criticized Platkin for \"sloppy\" legal decisions and cast doubt on the credibility of his testimony before the legislature.\n\nNorcross said Monday that Platkin was \"humiliated\" by the episode -- and that Platkin blamed South Jersey Democrats for how he was portrayed. At the time, Norcross ally and childhood friend Steve Sweeney served as Senate president.\n\nPhilip Norcross' attorney called the extortion allegations against his client \"outrageous\" and said the prominent lawyer had an \"unblemished\" legal career.\n\n\"Mr. Platkin is going to find out in this case, what it really means to have those who really are in power to be held to account,\" lawyer Kevin Marino said.\n\nWilliam Tambussi said he's proud of the legal work he's done for the city of Camden -- conduct that's now part of an alleged conspiracy.\n\nTambussi said he was \"astounded\" by the charges. He said his efforts benefited the city because litigation with Dranoff ended in a settlement that paid Camden millions of dollars.\n\nSome New Jersey Democrats cheered the racketeering indictment against Norcross, who has made a lot of enemies as a political boss.\n\nThe South Jersey Progressive Democrats scheduled an \"indictment celebration\" for Monday night. \"We are raising a glass to celebrate the 111 page indictment ... against George Norcross and collaborators. Join us!\" they wrote.\n\nJersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, who is running for governor in 2025, said in a statement it \"is a good day for South Jersey and importantly it's a good day for the future of New Jersey.\"\n\nAmong the other Democrats running for governor, with Norcross' backing, is Sweeney.\n\nSue Altman, who is running against Republican Rep. Tom Kean in New Jersey's 7th Congressional District, called the news of Norcross' indictment \"a major step toward rooting out the rampant corruption that led to the abuse of taxpayer dollars and Camden residents.\"\n\nA union representing more than 6,000 full-time faculty members at Rutgers called for Tambussi to resign or to be removed from the university's board of governors after he was charges as part of the indictment involving George Norcross.\n\n\"How can the Board of Governors claim to be legitimate in overseeing the university's mission -- including serving the people of Camden and New Jersey -- when the person who's supposed to represent Camden on the board stands accused of enriching himself at the expense of the city and its campus?\" Todd Wolfson, president of Rutgers AAUP-AFT, said in a statement.\n\nRacketeering laws were enacted to address organized criminal activity and schemes involving multiple criminal acts. State laws, such as in New Jersey, are similar to the original federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act enacted in 1970. New Jersey's racketeering law also was enacted in 1970.\n\nOrganized criminal activity under racketeering laws can be applied to violent crimes, but are typically prosecuted to cover multiple acts related to schemes to unlawfully make money. Racketeering laws can be used to charge people who are connected to schemes, though they may not have directly committed certain acts.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It alleges Norcross once threatened a developer that he would \"f**k you up like you've never been f**ked up before.\"\n\nPlatkin said Monday that Norcross and his allies manipulated government programs designed to attract development and investment to instead suit their own financial desires.\n\n\"Instead of contributing to the successes of the city of Camden, through a series of criminal acts alleged in the state's case, the Norcross enterprise took the Camden waterfront all for themselves,\" the attorney general said.\n\nThe charges come during a turbulent year in New Jersey politics. In March, Democratic Party bosses lost the chance to use county-line ballots to push their favored candidates during primaries, and in May, U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez's second corruption trial in the last seven years began in a federal courthouse in Manhattan. Menendez, a Democrat, has indicated he will seek reelection as an independent in November if he is not convicted, a move that is certain to harm the chances of the Democratic nominee to succeed him, Rep. Andy Kim.\n\nNorcross' co-defendants are his brother Philip Norcross, who runs the Parker McKay law firm; Dana Redd, the former Camden mayor; Bill Tambussi, Norcross' attorney; Sidney Brown, the head of trucking company NFI and a Norcross business partner; and John J. O'Donnell, a real estate developer and president of The Michaels Organization. There are also several unnamed co-conspirators, Platkin added.\n\n\"This alleged conduct of the Norcross enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, nonprofits, the people of the state of New Jersey, and especially to the city of Camden and its residents,\" Platkin said. \"That stops today.\"\n\nWhen a reporter asked about Norcross' presence at the press conference, Platkin refused to comment.\n\nThe charges including racketeering, official misconduct, conspiracy to commit theft, financial facilitation of criminal activity, and misconduct by a corporate official.\n\nNorcross denies the allegations. Norcross, an insurance executive and chairman of the Camden-based Cooper University Health Care, has long maintained great political power in Camden and in greater South Jersey. His brother Donald is a member of the House of Representatives.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the charges were released, Norcross suggested the case is Platkin's payback for being \"humiliated and exposed\" in front of a legislative committee that investigated rape allegations of a campaign staffer for Gov. Phil Murphy (the staffer has said she told Platkin about her claims and he mishandled them). Norcross also suggested Platkin's political ambitions are to blame -- Norcross called Platkin a politician \"masquerading as an attorney general.\"\n\n\"I want to go to trial in two weeks. I want Matt Platkin to come down here and try this case himself, because he's a coward, because he has forced people in this building to implement his will,\" Norcross said.\n\nPlatkin's announcement comes on the heels of charges his office filed Friday against two South Jersey Transportation Authority board members who are alleged to have used their positions to punish a Norcross foe.\n\nThe new allegations stretch back to at least 2012.\n\nNorcross and his allies wielded their political influence -- at the time, Norcross was aligned with the state Senate president, Stephen Sweeney -- to tailor economic development legislation to their preference before extorting and coercing landowners to obtain property rights in Camden to benefit Norcross and his allies, Platkin alleges.\n\n\"As George Norcross himself allegedly said, 'This is for our friends,'\" Platkin said.\n\nPlatkin alleges Norcross and his allies helped pass a state law in September 2013 called the Economic Opportunity Act. Norcross, in a meeting with allies ahead of the law's enactment, said he wanted to use the new legislation to construct an office building for free, according to the indictment.\n\nThe indictment says the Norcross team exchanged emails with top political leaders at the time, including then-Gov. Chris Christie and Sweeney, sending talking points in support of the bill. And following the law's enactment, lawyers lobbied to amend it in a way that would benefit Cooper hospital, according to the indictment.\n\nAuthorities allege Philip Norcross touted the law -- even while noting \"this probably is not such a good thing\" -- because the state would cover tax credits for all capital and related costs for developers coming to Camden with jobs.\n\n\"Over ten years, it's a hundred percent, and ... it will cause real havoc, it's unlimited,\" he said in a recorded conversation, according to the indictment.\n\nOverall, the law doled out lucrative tax breaks to businesses in the form of billions of dollars. Later, Murphy's administration would establish a task force to investigate how the awards were granted.\n\nThe charges announced Monday include allegations surrounding the L3 complex, two three-story buildings and surface parking on a 21-acre lot near the Camden waterfront. The claims offer an illustration of how Platkin's office alleges the Norcross team operated.\n\nCooper's Ferry Partnership, a nonprofit redevelopment organization, was seeking to purchase the L3 site. Norcross allies intervened, according to the indictment, by having the Camden mayor's office instruct the nonprofit's leaders to meet regularly with Philip Norcross \"so the Norcross Enterprise could monitor what the nonprofit was doing,\" the indictment says. Philip Norcross then told the nonprofit it would suffer repercussions if it chose their own developer instead of one of the Norcross team's choosing, according to the indictment.\n\nIn the end, Cooper's Ferry -- which could have partnered with a developer and earned millions from shared profits -- instead sold the property at a \"discounted price\" to the Norcross-chosen developer, the indictment says. Cooper University Health Care then bought a substantial ownership share in the developer and over the next four years, won $27 million in state tax credits, the indictment says.\n\nThe state also claims that after this episode, a Norcross ally threatened the Cooper's Ferry CEO, forcing him to resign. Cooper's Ferry became Camden Community Partnership in 2021. Redd is now its president and CEO.\n\nNorcross' appearance at Platkin's press conference -- he was not invited -- caused a stir. When a member of Platkin's team asked him to move, a lawyer for one of the defendants defended him.\n\n\"Is there someone more significant than the lead defendant in the case to have a seat in the front row while he's being excoriated by the attorney general of the state?\" the lawyer asked.", "source": {"uri": "newjerseymonitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Jersey Monitor"},

Norcross III was charged Monday with operating a racketeering enterprise, threatening people whose properties he sought to take over, and orchestrating tax incentive legislation to benefit organizations he controlled.\n\nNorcross, seated in the front row during a news conference by Attorney General Matt Platkin, angrily denounced the charges, later calling Platkin a \"coward\" and demanding a speedy trial.\n\nThe charges against the 68-year-old Norcross and five others come as New Jersey is already under a political and legal microscope, with Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez on trial in New York on federal corruption charges. Platkin, also a Democrat, cast the charges as law enforcement cracking down on wrongdoing.\n\n\"When we say no one is above the law, we mean it and we will continue to hold accountable anyone who puts their interest above the public interest, no matter how powerful they may be,\" Platkin said.\n\nIn a 111-page indictment unsealed on Monday, the attorney general alleges a scheme reaching back to 2012 in which the defendants -- called the \"Norcross Enterprise\" in the indictment -- used his political influence to craft legislation that served their own interests.\n\nAmong the allegations against Norcross are charges that he threatened a developer who would not relinquish his rights to waterfront property in Camden, New Jersey, on Norcross' terms. The indictment cites a profanity-laden phone recording of Norcross in which he tells the developer he will face \"enormous consequences.\" The person asks if Norcross is threatening him, according to the indictment. \"Absolutely,\" Norcross replies.\n\nThe indictment also said Norcross and the co-defendants extorted and coerced businesses with property rights on Camden's waterfront and obtained tax incentive credits, which they then sold for millions of dollars. Platkin described Camden as long suffering from economic decline.\n\nDefense lawyer Michael Critchley accused Platkin of having a \"vendetta\" against Norcross, noting that the waterfront development had been investigated for years by several agencies, including federal prosecutors in Philadelphia and New Jersey, as well as Platkin's predecessor.\n\n\"And every agency that looked at this matter for the past seven years ... came up with nothing,\" he said at a news conference.\n\nNorcross, the executive chairman of the insurance firm Connor Strong & Buckelew, had been widely viewed as among the most influential unelected Democrats in the state.\n\nHe was a Democratic National Committee member until 2021 and previously served as the head of the Camden County Democratic Party. A close friend to the former state Senate president, he was a behind-the-scenes power player and well-known financial backer to Democrats in the state and nationwide.\n\nNorcross, a resident of Palm Beach, Florida, once listed as a member of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club, cast the prosecution as politically motivated. He said Platkin blamed southern New Jersey Democrats for fallout from allegations that a staff member on Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy's 2017 gubernatorial campaign had been sexually assaulted. It wasn't immediately clear what that fallout was. Platkin was Murphy's general counsel when the Legislature investigated the allegations.\n\n\"I want Matt Platkin to come down here and try this case himself, because he's a coward, because he has forced people in this building to implement his will,\" Norcross said Monday outside the attorney general's office.\n\nNorcross explained why he appeared at the news conference.\n\n\"I want to witness an extraordinary embarrassment and outrageous conduct from a government official who stands up there and tries to act like he's holier than thou,\" Norcross said.\n\nIn addition to Norcross, the defendants are: his brother Philip A. Norcross, 61, of Philadelphia, a New Jersey lawyer; George Norcross's longtime lawyer William M. Tambussi, 61, of Brigantine, New Jersey; Camden Community Partnership chief executive and former Camden Mayor Dana L. Redd, 56, of Sicklerville, New Jersey; Sidney R. Brown, 67, of Philadelphia, chief executive of trucking and logistics company NFI; and development company executive John J. O'Donnell, 61, of Newtown, Pennsylvania.\n\nAn attorney representing Philip Norcross called him a stellar lawyer with an \"unblemished reputation.\"\n\n\"The notion that he would be charged with crimes is simply outrageous,\" Kevin Marino told The Associated Press. Marino declined to address specific allegations in the indictment.\n\nPhilip Norcross, the attorney, and U.S. Rep Donald Norcross, are all brothers of George.\n\nU.S. Rep. Donald Norcross said in a statement that he looks forward to his brothers telling their side of the story.\n\n\"I love my brothers,\" he said in a statement. \"I believe in the rule of law, and they will have the opportunity to defend themselves during their day in court.\n\nHenry Klingeman, Redd's attorney, said she was surprised by the charges.\n\n\"She's done nothing wrong,\" Klingeman said. \"What she has done is serve the Camden community in public and not-for-profit roles for more than three decades. She has cooperated fully with the grand jury investigation for over a year and is unaware of evidence of wrongdoing by her or others.\"\n\nMessages seeking comment were left with a lawyer for Tambussi.\n\nBrown and O'Donnell had no attorneys yet, according to the attorney general's office.\n\nMonday's indictment wasn't the first time the tax incentive has come under scrutiny. Murphy's administration ordered a task force to investigate tax incentives not long after he took office in 2018. In 2019, Norcross disputed resulting allegations that there was anything corrupt about the incentives that benefited his companies.", "source": {"uri": "trentonian.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

(AP) -- New Jersey Democratic power broker George E. Norcross III was charged Monday with operating a racketeering enterprise, threatening people whose properties he sought to take over, and orchestrating tax incentive legislation to benefit organizations he controlled.\n\nNorcross, seated in the front row during a news conference by Attorney General Matt Platkin, angrily denounced the charges, later calling Platkin a \"coward\" and demanding a speedy trial.\n\nThe charges against the 68-year-old Norcross and five others come as New Jersey is already under a political and legal microscope, with Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez on trial in New York on federal corruption charges. Platkin, also a Democrat, cast the charges as law enforcement cracking down on wrongdoing.\n\n\"When we say no one is above the law, we mean it and we will continue to hold accountable anyone who puts their interest above the public interest, no matter how powerful they may be,\" Platkin said.\n\nIn a 111-page indictment unsealed on Monday, the attorney general alleges a scheme reaching back to 2012 in which the defendants -- called the \"Norcross Enterprise\" in the indictment -- used his political influence to craft legislation that served their own interests.\n\nAmong the allegations against Norcross are charges that he threatened a developer who would not relinquish his rights to waterfront property in Camden, New Jersey, on Norcross' terms. The indictment cites a profanity-laden phone recording of Norcross in which he tells the developer he will face \"enormous consequences.\" The person asks if Norcross is threatening him, according to the indictment. \"Absolutely,\" Norcross replies.\n\nThe indictment also said Norcross and the co-defendants extorted and coerced businesses with property rights on Camden's waterfront and obtained tax incentive credits, which they then sold for millions of dollars. Platkin described Camden as long suffering from economic decline.\n\nDefense lawyer Michael Critchley accused Platkin of having a \"vendetta\" against Norcross, noting that the waterfront development had been investigated for years by several agencies, including federal prosecutors in Philadelphia and New Jersey, as well as Platkin's predecessor.\n\n\"And every agency that looked at this matter for the past seven years ... came up with nothing,\" he said at a news conference.\n\nNorcross, the executive chairman of the insurance firm Connor Strong & Buckelew, had been widely viewed as among the most influential unelected Democrats in the state.\n\nHe was a Democratic National Committee member until 2021 and previously served as the head of the Camden County Democratic Party. A close friend to the former state Senate president, he was a behind-the-scenes power player and well-known financial backer to Democrats in the state and nationwide.\n\nNorcross, a resident of Palm Beach, Florida, once listed as a member of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club, cast the prosecution as politically motivated. He said Platkin blamed southern New Jersey Democrats for fallout from allegations that a staff member on Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy's 2017 gubernatorial campaign had been sexually assaulted. It wasn't immediately clear what that fallout was. Platkin was Murphy's general counsel when the Legislature investigated the allegations.\n\n\"I want Matt Platkin to come down here and try this case himself, because he's a coward, because he has forced people in this building to implement his will,\" Norcross said Monday outside the attorney general's office.\n\nNorcross explained why he appeared at the news conference.\n\n\"I want to witness an extraordinary embarrassment and outrageous conduct from a government official who stands up there and tries to act like he's holier than thou,\" Norcross said.\n\nIn addition to Norcross, the defendants are: his brother Philip A. Norcross, 61, of Philadelphia, a New Jersey lawyer; George Norcross's longtime lawyer William M. Tambussi, 61, of Brigantine, New Jersey; Camden Community Partnership chief executive and former Camden Mayor Dana L. Redd, 56, of Sicklerville, New Jersey; Sidney R. Brown, 67, of Philadelphia, chief executive of trucking and logistics company NFI; and development company executive John J. O'Donnell, 61, of Newtown, Pennsylvania.\n\nAn attorney representing Philip Norcross called him a stellar lawyer with an \"unblemished reputation.\"\n\n\"The notion that he would be charged with crimes is simply outrageous,\" Kevin Marino told The Associated Press. Marino declined to address specific allegations in the indictment.\n\nPhilip Norcross, the attorney, and U.S. Rep Donald Norcross, are all brothers of George.\n\nU.S. Rep. Donald Norcross said in a statement that he looks forward to his brothers telling their side of the story.\n\n\"I love my brothers,\" he said in a statement. \"I believe in the rule of law, and they will have the opportunity to defend themselves during their day in court.\n\nHenry Klingeman, Redd's attorney, said she was surprised by the charges.\n\n\"She's done nothing wrong,\" Klingeman said. \"What she has done is serve the Camden community in public and not-for-profit roles for more than three decades. She has cooperated fully with the grand jury investigation for over a year and is unaware of evidence of wrongdoing by her or others.\"\n\nMessages seeking comment were left with a lawyer for Tambussi.\n\nBrown and O'Donnell had no attorneys yet, according to the attorney general's office.\n\nMonday's indictment wasn't the first time the tax incentive has come under scrutiny.

He made headlines in November for being forcibly removed from a Philadelphia Eagles game for displaying a banner featuring the American and Israeli flag together.\n\nOutside of the justice complex in Trenton, New Jersey, on Monday, Mr. Norcross told the press that he wanted to \"go to trial\" and added that Mr. Platkin \"doesn't want to try anything\" and that the attorney general should \"get down here and back up [his] words.\"\n\nThe 13-count indictment unsealed on June 17 alleges that Mr. George Norcross and his associates -- dubbed the \"Norcross Enterprise\" -- obtained property and property rights on the Camden Waterfront which allowed them to collect millions of dollars in government-issued tax credits, and controlled and influenced government officials to further the interests of the enterprise.\n\nThe indictment claims that from as early as 2012 to the present, the enterprise used \"its power and influence over government officials to craft legislation tailored to serve the interests of the enterprise, and with the cooperation of then-Camden Mayor Dana Redd and other officials, used parts of the city's government to aid the enterprise in acquiring property and property rights for itself and others through coercion, extortion, and other criminal acts.\"\n\nMr. George Norcross allegedly threatened a developer to relinquish property rights, enabling his associates to construct a residential building and obtain millions in tax credits in Camden.\n\nThe attorney general said in the press conference that Mr. George Norcross threatened a developer, telling the developer he would \"[expletive] you up\" if he didn't relinquish his property rights so the Norcross Enterprise could build on the waterfront.\n\nThe Norcross Enterprise then allegedly conspired to have the city of Camden use eminent domain against the developer to gain leverage in negotiations.\n\nMr. Philip Norcross is also accused of pressuring nonprofits to partner with developers chosen by the Norcross family.\n\nAnother brother, U.S. Rep. Donald Norcross (D-N.J.), was not charged in the case.\n\n\"The alleged conduct of the Norcross Enterprise has caused great harm,\" Mr. Platkin stated in a news release. \"That stops today. We must never accept politics and government -- that is funded with tax dollars -- to be weaponized against the people it serves. Today we reaffirm that no one in our state is above the law -- period.\"\n\nThe defendants are also charged with multiple counts of conspiracy, financial facilitation, misconduct by a corporate official, and official misconduct.\n\nThe years-long investigation included the attorney general's office alongside the FBI's Newark and Philadelphia field offices and other federal, state, and local law enforcement entities.\n\nThe defendants will be arraigned July 9 in Mercer County. They face up to 20 years in prison if convicted on the most serious charges.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Five alleged co-conspirators were also indicted.\n\nMichael Critchley, Norcross' attorney, called the indictment a political vendetta.\n\n\"What they did is they relied on some political adversaries\" and that \"resulted in this tortured and unfair prosecution,\" Critchley said.\n\nThe charges stem in part from 2012-13, when Norcross, 68, sought to redevelop the waterfront in Camden, New Jersey, which overlooks Philadelphia. Camden at that point had among the highest crime rates in the nation. The 111-page indictment unsealed Monday alleges that he threatened a developer who would not relinquish his rights to waterfront property and that Norcross used political influence to orchestrate tax incentives to benefit organizations he controlled.\n\nMembers of the alleged conspiracy also got a government development agency to help them get leverage in private negotiations, said Platkin, who is also a Democrat.\n\nProsecutors said the 13-count indictment outlined how the group flexed political influence and acquired property and property rights through coercion, extortion and other criminal acts. All six defendants are accused of first-degree racketeering, financial crimes, misconduct by corporate officials and conspiracy.\n\nNorcross and his associates \"used their political influence to tailor New Jersey economic development legislation to their preferences,\" the indictment says.\n\n\"The alleged conduct of the Norcross Enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, non-profits, the people of the State of New Jersey, and especially the City of Camden and its residents. That stops today. We must never accept politics and government - that is funded with tax dollars - to be weaponized against the people it serves. Today we reaffirm that no one in our state is above the law - period,\" Platkin said in a statement.\n\nThe defendants are scheduled to be arraigned July 9 in Mercer County, New Jersey.\n\nIn remarks outside the justice complex that includes the attorney general's office, Norcross demanded a trial in two weeks and called Platkin a coward. He said he was left thinking, \"Where's the beef?\"\n\nThe other defendants are Norcross' brother Philip Norcross, a New Jersey lawyer; William Tambussi, George Norcross' longtime lawyer; Dana Redd, Camden Community Partnership chief executive and former Camden mayor; Sidney Brown, chief executive of trucking and logistics company NFI; and development company executive John O'Donnell.\n\nAn attorney representing Philip Norcross called him a stellar lawyer with an \"unblemished reputation.\"\n\n\"The notion that he would be charged with crimes is simply outrageous,\" lawyer Kevin Marino said. Marino declined to address any specific allegations in the indictment.\n\nPhilip Norcross, the attorney, and Rep. Donald Norcross of New Jersey are brothers of George. A message left for the congressman was not immediately returned.\n\nHenry Klingeman, Redd's attorney, said she was surprised by the charges.\n\n\"She's done nothing wrong. ... She has cooperated fully with the grand jury investigation for over a year and is unaware of evidence of wrongdoing by her or others,\" Klingeman said. \"She looks forward to fighting these false allegations in the courtroom before a judge and jury, so she can reclaim her good name that has now been tarnished by the Attorney General's unjust and unjustified action.\"\n\nMessages seeking comment were left with a lawyer for Tambussi.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@yahoo.com", "name": "Associated Press",

Norcross is charged alongside his brother, Philip Norcross, as well as William Tambussi, Dana Redd, Sidney Brown and John O'Donnell, Platkin's office announced. Norcross' brother, Rep. Donald Norcross, a Democrat who represents New Jersey's 1st Congressional District, was not implicated or charged.\n\nNorcross has been under scrutiny from officials for years and was seated front row at a press conference convened to announced the charges in Trenton on Monday afternoon.\n\n\"It's often said that in New Jersey, politics is a blood sport, and what's meant by that is that if you don't go along with the demands of those in political power, you'll get hurt, you might lose your job, might lose your business, maybe you lose your reputation, or maybe government, the very government that you vote for, that you support with your tax dollars, that exists to serve you will instead be weaponized against you,\" Platkin said. \"All of these consequences are on full display in this indictment, but there is nothing inherent in our state's culture that requires us to accept politics and government that functions in this way, and as we show clearly in this indictment, there's nothing legal about it either.\"\n\nThe 13-count indictment alleges Norcross and his associates obtained both property and property rights on the waterfront in Camden, collected millions of dollars in government-issued tax credits and controlled and influenced government officials to further their own interests for property and property rights through coercion, extortion and other criminal acts.\n\nUnsealed by Platkin's office on Monday, the 111-page indictment claims that, for more than a decade, Norcross and his associates used their power and influence on government officials to craft legislation with the help of Camden officials.\n\nPlatkin spoke for about 20 minutes, detailing specific examples from the indictment about actions taken by Norcross and his co-defendants to benefit what officials referred to as the Norcross Enterprise.\n\n\"At least as early as 2012 through the present, the state alleges that the Norcross enterprise used its power and influence over government officials to craft legislation tailored to serve the interests of the Norcross enterprise,\" Platkin said during the press conference.\n\nWhile announcing the charges, Platkin said that Norcross enterprises unlawfully intervened in the purchase of the L3 complex by a nonprofit redevelopment organization and that the Camden Mayor's Office directed the nonprofit's leaders to meet regularly with Philip Norcross, a lawyer in private practice, who \"did not hold elected office or any governmental position within the city of Camden.\"\n\nPlatkin said that the \"alleged objects and purposes of the Norcross enterprise\" were to preserve and build on the power, reputation and profits of the enterprise, to protect and promote George Norcross, to control access to the local political party apparatus, to direct appointments to government positions and to exert influence and control over government agencies to cause opponents to lose government contracts which would enrich and reward the Norcross enterprise members and allies as well as influencing the New Jersey Legislature to pass legislation to increase tax credit awards for projects in Camden and advance the interests of the Norcross enterprise by concealing, misrepresenting and hiding the illegal operation of the Norcross enterprise.\n\n\"Through their alleged acts, the Norcross enterprise was able to obtain the rights to build multiple buildings, obtain hundreds of millions of dollars in government, issued tax credits, among other benefits,\" Platkin said. \"They allegedly did this with the complicity and acquiescence of various state and local elected and appointed officials who turned a blind eye to their duties and obligations to the people of New Jersey to instead serve the interests of a powerful few.\"\n\nThe defendants also face charges of financial facilitation, misconduct by a corporate official, and official misconduct and conspiring to commit theft by extortion, criminal coercion, financial facilitation, misconduct by a corporate official and official misconduct.\n\nAn arraignment for the defendants is scheduled for 10 a.m. on Tuesday, July 9, before Superior Court Judge Peter E. Warshaw Jr. in Mercer County.\n\nA task force formed by Gov. Phil Murphy early in his administration found that the state doled out tax breaks focused on the Camden companies tied to Norcross.\n\nMurphy hired the team of lawyers in January 2019, after the state comptroller's audit showing loose oversight and management of tax incentives.\n\nThe task force recommended in July 2020 that the EDA freeze the incentive awards for a dozen companies totaling $578 million. It also made unspecified criminal referrals.\n\nMurphy started his tenure in Trenton at odds with Norcross, but has been building bridges in recent years. He has headlined fundraisers held by Norcross's PAC in recent years.", "source": {"uri": "courierpostonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Courier-Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He was also accused of collecting millions in tax credits and engaging in an extortion plot involving government officials to maintain power.\n\nThe sprawling indictment is a shocking development for Norcross who was once considered the most powerful non-elected political official in the state.\n\nShortly before Platkin's press conference began, staffers in the AG's office asked Norcross to move from the \"reserved\" seating in the front row -- which the businessman firmly declined to do.\n\n\"Is there someone more significant than the lead defendant in the case to have a seat in the front row while he's being excoriated by the attorney general of the state?\" Norcross said to the staffers.\n\nHe sat in the reserved seat for the rest of the presser, keeping his head forward as Platkin announced the charges and answered questions from the press.\n\nNorcross, 68, is an insurance executive and former member of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) who spent decades influencing state legislation and politicians, especially in South Jersey.\n\nAfter a series of political losses in 2021, Norcross moved to Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nNorcross and his associates have been under investigation by the state attorney general for years, specifically for his influence on politicians and how it may or may not have benefitted him financially.\n\nIn the 111-page indictment, Platkin accuses Norcross of running a criminal enterprise, referred to as the \"Norcross Enterprise,\" and using threats and coercion to push a developer into relinquishing property rights on the Camden waterfront. He's also accused of coercing a nonprofit into giving up its property rights at a discounted price.\n\nPlatkin said the property along the Camden waterfront came with state-incentivized tax credits as well as views of the Delaware River and Philadelphia skyline that made the location desirable.\n\nThe others indicted alongside Norcross include his brother and lawyer Philip Norcross; William Tambussi, Norcross' longtime personal lawyer; Dana Redd, the CEO of Camden Community Partnership and former mayor of Camden; Sidney Brown, the CEO of a trucking and logistics company; and John O'Donnell an executive at a residential development company.\n\nThe indictment alleges Norcross told one developer he would \"f*** you up like you've never been f***ed up before\" and threatened that he would never do business in Camden if he did not give him the property rights.\n\nMembers of the Norcross Enterprise also allegedly conspired to manufacture a smear campaign of sorts by getting the mayor of Camden to stop communicating with the developer.\n\nNorcross and his co-defendants are also accused of extorting and coercing a nonprofit organization into partnering with the developer of their choice and selling the rights to a complex for a heavily discounted price.\n\nAs a result, they obtained millions of dollars worth of tax credits, prosecutors said.\n\n\"On full display in this indictment is how a group of unelected, private businessmen used their power and influence to get government to aid their criminal enterprise and further its interests,\" Platkin said in a press release.\n\nHe added, \"The alleged conduct of the Norcross Enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, non-profits, the people of the State of New Jersey, and especially the City of Camden and its residents. That stops today. We must never accept politics and government - that is funded with tax dollars - to be weaponized against the people it serves. Today we reaffirm that no one in our state is above the law - period.\"\n\nNorcross is charged with racketeering, two counts of conspiracy to commit theft by extortion in the first degree, conspiracy to commit theft by extortion in the second degree, six counts of financial facilitation of criminal activity, two counts of misconduct by a corporate official in the second degree and official misconduct.\n\nWhen asked how he felt about Norcross' presence at the end of the press conference, Platkin responded, \"No comment.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Norcross III, an insurance executive who for decades has been one New Jersey's most powerful Democratic kingmakers, was charged Monday with racketeering in what prosecutors say was a 12-year scheme that involved his brother, his lawyer and a former mayor of Camden, New Jersey.\n\nThe 13-count indictment unsealed by New Jersey's attorney general, Matthew J. Platkin, accused Norcross and five co-defendants of unlawfully obtaining property and property rights along Camden's waterfront, fraudulently collecting millions of dollars in government-issued tax breaks and influencing government officials.\n\n\"Instead of contributing to the successes of the city of Camden,\" Platkin said as he announced the charges, Norcross led a \"criminal enterprise\" that \"took the Camden waterfront all for themselves.\"\n\nThe indictment accuses Norcross of bullying rival developers who were also trying to capitalize on a push to revitalize the waterfront in Camden, a poor city outside Philadelphia long plagued by violent crime.\n\n\"Are you threatening me?\" one developer asked, according to a recorded telephone call mentioned in the indictment.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Norcross replied.\n\nNorcross' brother, Philip A. Norcross, CEO of a Camden-based law firm, and the city's former mayor, Dana L. Redd, were also charged with racketeering in the first degree, a crime punishable by up to 20 years in prison.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, George Norcross, 68, who now lives in Florida, showed up, uninvited, to a news conference Platkin held in Trenton, New Jersey.\n\nDressed in a suit and loafers without socks, he stared from the front row of the room as the attorney general described the charges contained in a 111-page indictment.\n\nNorcross' team of lawyers and at least one co-defendant, William Tambussi, a lawyer who has represented Norcross and the city of Camden, sat behind him.\n\nSoon after, in an impromptu news conference, Norcross accused Platkin of carrying out a personal vendetta, calling him a \"coward\" and a \"politician masquerading as an attorney general.\"\n\n\"He's innocent,\" his lawyer, Michael Critchley, added. \"He's not afraid of the accusations.\"\n\nKevin H. Marino, a lawyer for Philip Norcross, called the allegations \"bogus\" and said Platkin had been \"blindsided by his own ambition.\"\n\nThe charges against George Norcross, a feared political survivor, immediately served to further tarnish the already blemished reputation of New Jersey politics.\n\nThe state's senior senator, Democrat Bob Menendez, is in his sixth week of a corruption trial, charged by federal prosecutors with accepting cash, gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for doling out favors for allies.\n\nNorcross, who was a member of the Democratic National Committee until 2021, was for decades the most powerful unelected political official in New Jersey.\n\nHe formed alliances that often blurred the lines between the Democratic and Republican parties. For years he was both a close friend of the former House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and a member of former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club.\n\nBy donating generously to political campaigns and assembling an ironclad voting bloc of South Jersey lawmakers, he was instrumental in selecting governors, steering bills through the Legislature and influencing state policy.\n\nAbout a year ago, Norcross suggested he was stepping back from politics after a series of embarrassing legislative defeats.\n\nHis public statements coincided with news reports that the attorney general's office had revived its investigation into more than $1 billion in tax breaks awarded to South Jersey companies through legislation backed by former Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican and close ally of Norcross.\n\nGov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, had railed against that tax incentive program during his first term and sparred openly with Norcross -- tension that defined much of his first two years in office.\n\nPlatkin was Murphy's chief counsel when the state began investigating the program, the Economic Opportunity Act of 2013, and was later tapped as attorney general.\n\nCrafted with help from a well-connected Democratic lawyer, the program gave out nearly $7 billion in tax breaks but provided few guardrails to protect the state against fraud.\n\nControversy over the corporate tax breaks prompted legislative hearings and subpoenas to companies and at least one state agency, but charges were never filed.\n\nPlatkin, Norcross said, carried his \"agenda\" with him to the attorney general's office, where he \"forced people in his building to implement his will.\"\n\nThe friction between Norcross and the Murphy administration peaked in 2019, when Sue Altman, then the leader of the left-leaning Working Families Alliance and closely aligned with the governor, was forcibly removed from a standing-room-only hearing on corporate tax breaks after troopers indicated she had caused a disruption.\n\nShe was led past Norcross, who was at the hearing to testify in support of the economic incentive program that Altman had criticized harshly.\n\nAltman, a Democrat who is now running for Congress against Rep. Tom Kean, called the indictment \"monumental.\"\n\n\"Like Donald Trump,\" she said in a statement, \"George Norcross and his South Jersey cronies are finding out that breaking the law for personal gain has consequences.\"\n\nThe feud between Murphy and Norcross began to ease as the governor was running for reelection in 2021. Murphy signed off on his own $14 billion tax incentive package in late 2020, and he and Norcross began appearing together in public, a scenario that for years was unheard-of.\n\nLast year, as Murphy's wife, Tammy Murphy, was vying to run for U.S. Senate, the Camden County Democratic Committee, an influential group controlled by Norcross, was one of the first political organizations to back her.\n\nThe endorsement came at a crucial time for Murphy, a first-time candidate, helping to bestow an air of inevitability to her campaign.\n\nMurphy dropped out of the race in March, days before a crucial building block of Norcross' success -- a practice unique to New Jersey in which party leaders gave preferential treatment to their favored candidates on primary election ballots -- was declared unconstitutional, first by Platkin and then by a federal judge.\n\nAs a result, Platkin's relationship with Murphy, once one of his closest allies, has since frayed.\n\nOn Monday, in an odd twist to an already stunning series of events, Norcross heaped praise on Murphy, his former archenemy who in 2019 he called a politically incompetent \"liar\" who \"thinks he's the king of England\" in an interview with a reporter for nj.com.\n\nHe said the governor had been \"incredibly supportive\" and \"generous\" toward the city of Camden.\n\nA spokesperson for Murphy said the governor had no comment about the indictment.\n\nIn addition to Norcross and his brother, the others charged are:\n\n-- Tambussi, 66, of Brigantine, New Jersey, the longtime personal lawyer for Morcross.\n\n-- Redd, 56, of Sicklerville, New Jersey, chief executive officer of Camden Community Partnership and former mayor of Camden.\n\n-- Sidney R. Brown, 67, of Philadelphia, chief executive of NFI, a trucking and logistics company.\n\n-- John J. O'Donnell, 61, of Newtown, Pennsylvania, who has been in the executive leadership of the Michaels Organization, a residential development company.\n\nTambussi, who was part of the large group that joined Norcross, Critchley and Marino at Platkin's news conference, said he was \"proud of the work\" he had done for the city of Camden.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news",

(AP) -- New Jersey Democratic power broker George E. Norcross III was charged Monday with racketeering and other crimes in connection with a waterfront redevelopment and the use of government-issued tax credits.\n\nAt a news conferenced in Trenton, New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin accused Norcross, a former Democratic National Committee member and onetime head of the Camden County Democratic Party, of leading a criminal enterprise. Five alleged co-conspirators also were indicted.\n\nMichael Critchley, Norcross' attorney, called the indictment a political vendetta.\n\n\"What they did is they relied on some political adversaries,\" Critchley said, and that \"resulted in this tortured and unfair prosecution.\"\n\nThe charges stem in part from 2012-2013, when Norcross sought to redevelop the waterfront in Camden, New Jersey, which overlooks Philadelphia. Camden at that point had among the highest crime rates in the nation. The 111-page indictment unsealed Monday alleges that he threatened a developer who would not relinquish his rights to waterfront property and that Norcross used political influence to orchestrate tax incentives to be enacted to benefit organizations he controlled\n\nMembers of the alleged conspiracy also got a government development agency to help them get leverage in private negotiations, said Platkin, who is also a Democrat.\n\nProsecutors said the 13-count indictment outlined how the group flexed political influence and acquired property and property rights through coercion, extortion and other criminal acts. All six defendants are accused of first-degree racketeering, financial crimes, misconduct by corporate officials and conspiracy.\n\nNorcross and his associates \"used their political influence to tailor New Jersey economic development legislation to their preferences,\" the indictment says.\n\n\"The alleged conduct of the Norcross Enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, non-profits, the people of the State of New Jersey, and especially the City of Camden and its residents. That stops today. We must never accept politics and government - that is funded with tax dollars - to be weaponized against the people it serves. Today we reaffirm that no one in our state is above the law -- period,\" Platkin said in a statement.\n\nThe defendants are scheduled to be arraigned July 9 in Mercer County, New Jersey.\n\nIn remarks outside the justice complex that includes Platkin's office, Norcross demanded a trial in two weeks and called Platkin a coward. He said he was left thinking, \"Where's the beef?\"\n\nThe defendants are Norcross, 68, of Palm Beach, Florida; his brother Philip A. Norcross, 61, of Philadelphia, a New Jersey lawyer; George Norcross's longtime lawyer William M. Tambusi, 61, of Brigantine, New Jersey; Camden Community Partnership chief executive and former Camden Mayor Dana L. Redd, 56, of Sicklerville, New Jersey; Sidney R. Brown, 67, of Philadelphia, chief executive of trucking and logistics company NFI; and development company executive John J. O'Donnell, 61, of Newtown, Pennsylvania.\n\nA lawyer representing Philip Norcross called him a stellar lawyer with an \"unblemished reputation.\" \"The notion that he would be charged with crimes is simply outrageous,\" lawyer Kevin Marino told The Associated Press.\n\nMarino declined to address any specific allegations in the indictment.\n\nPhilip Norcross, the attorney, and U.S. Rep Donald Norcross, are all brothers of George. A message left for the congressman was not immediately returned.\n\nHenry Klingeman, Redd's attorney, said she was surprised by the charges.\n\n\"She's done nothing wrong,\" Klingeman said. \"What she has done is serve the Camden community in public and not-for-profit roles for more than three decades. She has cooperated fully with the grand jury investigation for over a year and is unaware of evidence of wrongdoing by her or others. She looks forward to fighting these false allegations in the courtroom before a judge and jury, so she can reclaim her good name that has now been tarnished by the Attorney General's unjust and unjustified action.\"\n\nMessages seeking comment were left with a lawyer for Tambusi.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Mark Scolforo in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Maryclaire Dale in Philadelphia; and Wayne Parry in Pleasantville, New Jersey, contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "bradfordera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Bradford Era"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He is an insurance broker by trade but built up what's known as the South Jersey machine, a Democratic political coalition considered one of the strongest in the state. He was a member of the Democratic National Committee and counted figures like Nancy Pelosi among his friends.\n\nAt his peak, Norcross was known as the most powerful unelected official in New Jersey. His influence peaked under Republican Gov. Chris Christie, who worked hand in hand with Democratic Senate President Steve Sweeney, a childhood friend of Norcross. But after losing legislative elections in his power base of South Jersey in 2021 -- including the one held by Sweeney -- Norcross conceded he'd been diminished and told POLITICO that he was stepping back from state politics.\n\nPlatkin also charged Norcross' brother Philip, a lawyer and lobbyist; his longtime lawyer Bill Tambussi; former Camden Mayor Dana Redd; Sidney Brown, the CFO of trucking company NFI; and John O'Donnell, a leader of the residential development company The Michaels Organization. (Politico)\n\n\"On full display in this indictment is how a group of unelected, private businessmen used their power and influence to get government to aid their criminal enterprise and further its interests,\" Platkin said. \"The alleged conduct of the Norcross Enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, non-profits, the people of the State of New Jersey, and especially the City of Camden and its residents.\"\n\n\"That stops today,\" the attorney general added.\n\nNorcross lashed out against Platkin in response, telling reporters he wanted a trial to begin in two weeks.\n\n\"I want to witness an extraordinary embarrassment and outrageous conduct from a government official who stands up there and tries to act like he's holier than thou,\" Norcross said.\n\nAs Politico noted, the Norcross indictment is \"just the latest in a series of political shockwaves that have struck New Jersey over the past year.\"", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType":

Norcross III and several co-defendants, including a former Camden mayor who served in the state Senate, are facing first-degree racketeering and other charges related to allegedly corrupt real estate dealings in Camden under an indictment announced by the state attorney general's office.\n\nThe bombshell, 13-count indictment unsealed Monday also alleges Norcross and several co-defendants influenced the drafting of an important state tax-incentive law over a decade ago to serve their own interests.\n\nAttorney General Matt Platkin, speaking during an afternoon news conference -- which Norcross himself attended as an apparent uninvited guest -- accused Norcross, a long-standing figure in state politics, of \"running a criminal enterprise in this state for at least the last twelve years.\"\n\n\"On full display in this indictment is how a group of unelected, private businessmen used their power and influence to get government to aid their criminal enterprise and further its interests,\" Platkin said.\n\n\"The alleged conduct of the Norcross Enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, nonprofits, the people of the State of New Jersey, and especially the City of Camden and its residents,\" Platkin said.\n\nExtensive indictment\n\nAfterward, Norcross, an insurance company executive, accused Platkin of overreach and called for a speedy trial, while his attorney referred to the charges as \"bogus.\"\n\nAlso charged in the 111-page indictment were Norcross's brother Philip, a politically connected lawyer, and Dana Redd, a former Camden mayor and state senator. And also facing charges are Norcross's personal attorney and two other business associates, according to the indictment.\n\nAnother Norcross brother, Donald, represents the region in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n\"I love my brothers. I believe in the rule of law and they will have the opportunity to defend themselves during their day in court,\" Rep. Donald Norcross said in a statement late Monday.\n\nFor decades, George Norcross has been one of New Jersey's most powerful Democrats, based on his track record as a prolific fundraiser and ability, using the state's party line ballot system, to back candidates for local office as well as the Legislature. The longest-running Senate president, a friend, was one of those candidates. Norcross worked with governors from both parties and his political activities received intense media scrutiny over the years.\n\nThe tax breaks\n\nHowever he also had his critics, including in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, and some on Monday praised the indictment.\n\n\"Today's indictment represents vindication for the Black and brown grassroots advocates who, for years, blew the whistle on Norcross' corrupt political machine and demanded more accountability,\" said Antoinette Miles, state director of the New Jersey Working Families Party.\n\nWhile it's unusual for defendants to attend a news conference where authorities announce criminal charges, Norcross's presence at the attorney general's event in Trenton comes several years after he personally testified before a state Senate committee that was investigating the handling of the state's tax-incentive laws.\n\nThe 'Norcross Enterprise' obtained 'property and property rights on the Camden Waterfront for itself and others, collected millions of dollars in government-issued tax credits, and controlled and influenced government officials to further the interests of the enterprise.' -- NJ attorney general's office\n\nDuring that hearing, Norcross spent more than an hour defending tax breaks awarded to his insurance company, Conner, Strong & Buckelew, and other Camden-based companies that benefited from programs that were established during the tenure of former Gov. Chris Christie.\n\nThese tax breaks and others were the primary focus of a special investigative panel that Gov. Phil Murphy convened in 2019 following an audit released by the Office of the State Comptroller that raised serious questions about whether companies were profiting without living up to job-creation or investment standards that were set in the state law.\n\nThe gubernatorial task force had already announced its work resulted in a criminal referral, and published reports confirmed an ongoing probe by the state attorney general's office.\n\nThe 'Norcross Enterprise'\n\nAt the time, a defiant Norcross told the Senate panel he was speaking for himself that day, and \"not through lawyers or spokespeople, to defend Camden and to correct many misstatements and mischaracterizations and outright mistruths that are having a serious negative impact on the revitalization of our city.\"\n\nBut according to Platkin's office, the \"Norcross Enterprise\" obtained \"property and property rights on the Camden Waterfront for itself and others, collected millions of dollars in government-issued tax credits, and controlled and influenced government officials to further the interests of the enterprise.\"\n\n'I love my brothers. I believe in the rule of law and they will have the opportunity to defend themselves during their day in court.' -- Rep. Donald Norcross\n\nNow a resident of Palm Beach, Florida, Norcross chaired the Camden County Democratic Committee from 1989 to 1995 but has never held an elected office himself in New Jersey.\n\nIn addition to serving as executive chairman of Conner, Strong & Buckelew -- which has offices in one of the buildings in Camden that is covered in the indictment -- Norcross also chairs the board of trustees for Camden-based Cooper University Health Care.\n\nNorcross slams 'agenda to get us'\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Trenton on Monday, Norcross pointed to improvements made in Camden in recent years, including reductions in the crime and unemployment rates, and alleged Platkin has an \"agenda to get us.\"\n\n\"I want Matt Platkin to come down here and try this case himself,\" Norcross said.\n\nDana Redd, former Camden mayor 'has cooperated fully with the grand jury investigation for over a year and is unaware of evidence of wrongdoing by her or others.' -- Henry Klingeman, Redd's attorney\n\nIn a statement emailed to NJ Spotlight News, Redd's attorney, Henry Klingeman, said Redd was \"surprised\" by the indictment and that she has \"done nothing wrong.\"\n\n\"She has cooperated fully with the grand jury investigation for over a year and is unaware of evidence of wrongdoing by her or others,\" Klingeman said. \"She looks forward to fighting these false allegations in the courtroom before a judge and jury, so she can reclaim her good name that has now been tarnished by the Attorney General's unjust and unjustified action.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Philip Norcross's attorney, Kevin Marino, cited his client's long career as an attorney and also took aim at Platkin, saying the case would show the attorney general \"what it really means to have those who really are in power to be held to account.\"\n\n\"That an allegation would be made that he was engaged in extortion and other crimes of the type that I heard the attorney general recite from the podium is truly outrageous,\" Marino said.", "source": {"uri": "njspotlightnews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ Spotlight News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_reitmeyer@njspotlightnews.org", "name": "John

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nGeorge Norcross, a well-known Democratic power broker and businessman in New Jersey, snagged a front-row seat at the state attorney general's press conference on Monday morning, watching intently as prosecutors unveiled a 13-count criminal indictment against him and five others.\n\nWearing a black suit with loafers, Norcross sat by himself with his hands folded in his lap as New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin accused him of engaging in a years-long criminal enterprise to unlawfully obtain property and property rights on the waterfront in Camden. He was also accused of collecting millions in tax credits and engaging in an extortion plot involving government officials to maintain power.\n\nThe sprawling indictment is a shocking development for Norcross who was once considered the most powerful non-elected political official in the state.\n\nShortly before Platkin's press conference began, staffers in the AG's office asked Norcross to move from the \"reserved\" seating in the front row -- which the businessman firmly declined to do.\n\n\"Is there someone more significant than the lead defendant in the case to have a seat in the front row while he's being excoriated by the attorney general of the state?\" Norcross said to the staffers.\n\nHe sat in the reserved seat for the rest of the presser, keeping his head forward as Platkin announced the charges and answered questions from the press.\n\nNorcross, 68, is an insurance executive and former member of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) who spent decades influencing state legislation and politicians, especially in South Jersey.\n\nAfter a series of political losses in 2021, Norcross moved to Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nNorcross and his associates have been under investigation by the state attorney general for years, specifically for his influence on politicians and how it may or may not have benefitted him financially.\n\nIn the 111-page indictment, Platkin accuses Norcross of running a criminal enterprise, referred to as the \"Norcross Enterprise,\" and using threats and coercion to push a developer into relinquishing property rights on the Camden waterfront. He's also accused of coercing a nonprofit into giving up its property rights at a discounted price.\n\nPlatkin said the property along the Camden waterfront came with state-incentivized tax credits as well as views of the Delaware River and Philadelphia skyline that made the location desirable.\n\nThe others indicted alongside Norcross include his brother and lawyer Philip Norcross; William Tambussi, Norcross' longtime personal lawyer; Dana Redd, the CEO of Camden Community Partnership and former mayor of Camden; Sidney Brown, the CEO of a trucking and logistics company; and John O'Donnell an executive at a residential development company.\n\nThe indictment alleges Norcross told one developer he would \"f*** you up like you've never been f***ed up before\" and threatened that he would never do business in Camden if he did not give him the property rights.\n\nMembers of the Norcross Enterprise also allegedly conspired to manufacture a smear campaign of sorts by getting the mayor of Camden to stop communicating with the developer.\n\nNorcross and his co-defendants are also accused of extorting and coercing a nonprofit organization into partnering with the developer of their choice and selling the rights to a complex for a heavily discounted price.\n\nAs a result, they obtained millions of dollars worth of tax credits, prosecutors said.\n\n\"On full display in this indictment is how a group of unelected, private businessmen used their power and influence to get government to aid their criminal enterprise and further its interests,\" Platkin said in a press release.\n\nHe added, \"The alleged conduct of the Norcross Enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, non-profits, the people of the State of New Jersey, and especially the City of Camden and its residents. That stops today. We must never accept politics and government - that is funded with tax dollars - to be weaponized against the people it serves. Today we reaffirm that no one in our state is above the law - period.\"\n\nNorcross is charged with racketeering, two counts of conspiracy to commit theft by extortion in the first degree, conspiracy to commit theft by extortion in the second degree, six counts of financial facilitation of criminal activity, two counts of misconduct by a corporate official in the second degree and official misconduct.\n\nWhen asked how he felt about Norcross' presence at the end of the press conference, Platkin responded, \"No comment.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

New Jersey\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s attorney general has charged the influential Democratic power broker with racketeering and other charges in connection with government issued tax credits, according to an indictment unsealed Monday, June 17, 2024. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke, File)TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey Democratic power broker George E. Norcross III was charged Monday with racketeering and other crimes in connection with a waterfront redevelopment and the use of government-issued tax credits. At a news conferenced in Trenton, New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin accused Norcross, a former Democratic National Committee member and onetime head of the Camden County Democratic Party, of leading a criminal enterprise. Five alleged co-conspirators also were indicted. Michael Critchley, Norcross' attorney, called the indictment a political vendetta. \"What they did is they relied on some political adversaries,\" Critchley said, and that \"resulted in this tortured and unfair prosecution.\"\u009d The charges stem in part from 2012-2013, when Norcross sought to redevelop the waterfront in Camden, New Jersey, which overlooks Philadelphia. Camden at that point had among the highest crime rates in the nation. The 111-page indictment unsealed Monday alleges that he threatened a developer who would not relinquish his rights to waterfront property and that Norcross used political influence to orchestrate tax incentives to be enacted to benefit organizations he controlled Members of the alleged conspiracy also got a government development agency to help them get leverage in private negotiations, said Platkin, who is also a Democrat. Prosecutors said the 13-count indictment outlined how the group flexed political influence and acquired property and property rights through coercion, extortion and other criminal acts. All six defendants are accused of first-degree racketeering, financial crimes, misconduct by corporate officials and conspiracy. Norcross and his associates \"used their political influence to tailor New Jersey economic development legislation to their preferences,\" the indictment says. \"The alleged conduct of the Norcross Enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, non-profits, the people of the State of New Jersey, and especially the City of Camden and its residents. That stops today. We must never accept politics and government \"\" that is funded with tax dollars \"\" to be weaponized against the people it serves. Today we reaffirm that no one in our state is above the law - period,\"\u009d Platkin said in a statement. The defendants are scheduled to be arraigned July 9 in Mercer County, New Jersey. In remarks outside the justice complex that includes Platkin's office, Norcross demanded a trial in two weeks and called Platkin a coward. He said he was left thinking, \"Where's the beef?\"\u009d The defendants are Norcross, 68, of Palm Beach, Florida; his brother Philip A. Norcross, 61, of Philadelphia, a New Jersey lawyer; George Norcross's longtime lawyer William M. Tambusi, 61, of Brigantine, New Jersey; Camden Community Partnership chief executive and former Camden Mayor Dana L. Redd, 56, of Sicklerville, New Jersey; Sidney R. Brown, 67, of Philadelphia, chief executive of trucking and logistics company NFI; and development company executive John J. O'Donnell, 61, of Newtown, Pennsylvania. A lawyer representing Philip Norcross called him a stellar lawyer with an \"unblemished reputation.\"\u009d \"The notion that he would be charged with crimes is simply outrageous,\"\u009d lawyer Kevin Marino told The Associated Press. Marino declined to address any specific allegations in the indictment. Philip Norcross, the attorney, and U.S. Rep Donald Norcross, are all brothers of George. A message left for the congressman was not immediately returned. Henry Klingeman, Redd's attorney, said she was surprised by the charges. \"She's done nothing wrong,\"\u009d Klingeman said. \"What she has done is serve the Camden community in public and not-for-profit roles for more than three decades. She has cooperated fully with the grand jury investigation for over a year and is unaware of evidence of wrongdoing by her or others. She looks forward to fighting these false allegations in the courtroom before a judge and jury, so she can reclaim her good name that has now been tarnished by the Attorney General's unjust and unjustified action.\"\u009d Messages seeking comment were left with a lawyer for Tambusi. ___ Associated Press reporters Mark Scolforo in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Maryclaire Dale in Philadelphia; and

(CBS) -- Democratic power broker George Norcross and his allies have been charged in a years-long racketeering investigation, New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin announced Monday in Trenton.\n\nOn Monday, Platkin alongside the Office of Public Integrity & Accountability unsealed a 13-count, 111-paged indictment charging Norcross with leading a criminal enterprise, along with five co-defendants in South Jersey and elsewhere. Platkin added in the afternoon press conference that several other people were involved in the criminal activity but they have not been indicted nor were they identified.\n\n\"The indictment unsealed today alleges that George Norcross has been running a criminal enterprise in this state for at least the last twelve years,\" Platkin said.\n\nNorcross, 68, is the executive chairman of the insurance firm Conner, Strong & Buckelew and serves as the chairman of the board of trustees for Cooper Health.\n\nThe 68-year-old, along with his allies, including his brother Phillip Norcross, former City of Camden Mayor Dana Redd, William Tambussi, Sidney Brown and John O'Donnell, allegedly committed first-degree racketeering conspiracy, among other offenses to further the Norcross enterprise.\n\nAll six defendants are also charged with multiple counts of financial facilitation, misconduct by a corporate official, and official misconduct and conspiring to commit theft by extortion, criminal coercion, financial facilitation, misconduct by a corporate official, and official misconduct.\n\nThe state's indictment alleges the Norcross enterprise secured property and property rights along the Camden Waterfront for itself and others while collecting millions of dollars in government-issued tax credits and controlled and influenced government officials to advance the interests of the enterprise.\n\n\"On full display in this indictment is how a group of unelected, private businessmen used their power and influence to get government to aid their criminal enterprise and further its interests,\" Platkin said Monday. \"The alleged conduct of the Norcross Enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, non-profits, the people of the State of New Jersey, and especially the City of Camden and its residents. That stops today.\"\n\nPlatkin described an alleged interaction between George Norcross and a developer when the 68-year-old looked to acquire what would become the Triad1828 center.\n\n\"When the developer would not initially relinquish his rights on terms preferred by the Norcross enterprise, George Norcross threatened the developer that he would, in substance and in part, 'F you up like you've never been F'd up before.' And he told the victim developer that he would make sure that the developer would never do business in Camden again,\" Platkin said.\n\nGeorge Norcross' attorney Michael Critchley said Platkin didn't interview Norcross prior to Monday's press conference.\n\n\"He didn't have the decency to want to conduct this investigation, to seek to interview Mr. Norcross or allow him to come before the Grand Jury. It's a one-sided investigation with a pre-determined result,\" Critchley said.\n\nThe indictment has evidence from early as 2012 through 2024 and alleges the Norcross enterprise used its power over government officials to create and craft legislation that would serve their personal mission's interests. The indictment also alleges Redd and other officials used parts of Camden's city government to help the enterprise obtain property and property rights for itself and others by way of coercion and extortion.\n\nRedd's attorney, Henry Klingeman, said the former Camden mayor was surprised by Monday's legal action:\n\n\"She's done nothing wrong. What she has done is serve the Camden community in public and not-for-profit roles for more than three decades. She has cooperated fully with the grand jury investigation for over a year and is unaware of evidence of wrongdoing by her or others. She looks forward to fighting these false allegations in the courtroom before a judge and jury, so she can reclaim her good name that has now been tarnished by the Attorney General's unjust and unjustified action.\"\n\nKevin Marino, the attorney representing Phillip Norcross, said they're looking forward to the trial.\n\n\"I don't think a thing that Mr. Platkin said was fair. I know for a fact none of it is supported by the evidence, with which I am extremely familiar, and we really do look forward to a trial as quickly as humanly possible.\"\n\nThe defendants' arraignment is scheduled for July 9 at 10 a.m. in Mercer County.\n\nGeorge Norcross serves as the executive chairman of the insurance firm Conner, Strong & Buckelew, which has multiple locations but is headquartered in Camden, New Jersey. Norcross is also the chairman of the Board of Trustees for Cooper Health.\n\nPhillip Norcross is an attorney, managing shareholder, and CEO of the New Jersey law firm Parker McCay. Norcross, 61, is the registered agent of the groups that own the buildings in Camden centered in this investigation. He also serves on the board of Cooper Health.\n\nDana Redd was the mayor of Camden from 2010 to 2018 when the state alleges she abused her power to benefit the Norcross enterprise and herself. Redd, 56, is the current CEO of Camden Community Partnership and previously served as a Camden City councilmember and the New Jersey Senate.\n\nWilliam Tambussi is an attorney and partner at Brown and Connery law firm in Camden County. Tambussi, 66, is George Norcross' attorney. He serves as counsel to the Camden County Democratic Committee, chaired by Norcross from 1989 to 1995. He additionally served as outside council for Camden, the Camden Redevelopment Agency, Cooper Health and Conner Strong.\n\nFollowing the indictment, Rutgers AAUP-AFT, which represents more than 6,000 full-time faculty members and graduate workers, reiterated its demand to remove Tambussi from the Rutgers University Board of Governors.\n\n\"It just kind of accelerates and deepens our desire to get this individual off the Rutgers Board of Governors,\" Todd Wolfson, the union's president, said. \"To keep him on the board is just spitting in the face of all of us.\"\n\nWolfson said the union filed a lawsuit earlier this year seeking to remove Tambussi, claiming he doesn't meet the residency requirement of his position.\n\nHe said the union plans to bring up its demands once again at a Board of Governors meeting Thursday.\n\nCBS News Philadelphia reached out to Tambussi's attorney and Tambussi via email but is awaiting a response.\n\nSixty-seven-year-old Sidney Brown is the CEO of NFI, a trucking and logistics company, a board member of Cooper Health, and a partner in the groups that own the Camden buildings centered in the investigation.\n\nJohn O'Donnell works on the executive leadership team of The Michaels Organization, a residential development company. O'Donnell, 61, is a partner in the groups that own the Camden buildings involved in the allegations. He's also been a board member of the Camden Community Partnership multiple times since 2018.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Norcross III, the towering figure who has led South Jersey's Democratic political machine for nearly a quarter century, was charged Monday in a sweeping racketeering case alleging that he and key allies used their influence to corruptly acquire tax credits and real estate worth millions while muscling rivals out of the lucrative redevelopment of Camden's waterfront.\n\nAttorney General Matthew J. Platkin unveiled the 13-count indictment - which also named Norcross' brother and Camden-based attorney Philip, their longtime lawyer William Tambussi, and former Camden Mayor Dana Redd as defendants - at a news conference in Trenton.\n\nHe accused the group - which he repeatedly referred to as the \"Norcross Enterprise\" - of hijacking a 2013 state program meant to encourage development in poorer communities to line their own pockets instead. They maintained that control, Platkin said, through coercion, extortion and threats.\n\n\"On full display in this indictment is how a group of unelected, private businessmen used their power and influence to get government to aid their criminal enterprise and further (their) interests,\" Platkin said, adding that their conduct allowed them to essentially take \"the Camden waterfront all for themselves.\"\n\nRemarkably, as the attorney general detailed the 111-page indictment in front of an audience of reporters Monday, Norcross, 68, sat quietly in the front row.\n\nHe was anything but quiet afterward as he balked at the charges, called Platkin a \"politician masquerading as an attorney general,\" and accused him of carrying out a yearslong political vendetta against him.\n\nThe entire scene played out just blocks from the New Jersey State House, where Norcross over the years had become accustomed to being treated as a distinguished guest by governors and lawmakers alike.\n\n\"I want to go to trial in two weeks. I want Matt Platkin to come down here and try this case himself,\" Norcross told reporters outside the Hughes Justice Complex after the attorney general announced charges. \"Because he's a coward, because he has forced people in this building to implement his will.\"\n\nThat Norcross - a Camden County native, insurance executive, philanthropist, and chair of Cooper University Health System, a major hospital network - had found himself on the wrong end of a criminal indictment signaled a seismic shift in the political forces that have governed New Jersey for years.\n\nDespite never having held elected office, Norcross built the South Jersey Democratic machine into a juggernaut over the last two decades that has propelled key allies into all levels of politics and government from city councils and local party committees to government agencies and the state legislature. His backing helped to elect his brother Donald Norcross to Congress in 2013 and to install former state Senate President Stephen Sweeney, George Norcross' childhood friend, in his leadership role in 2009.\n\nAnd while state and federal authorities have repeatedly scrutinized his business dealings over the last two decades - tapping his phones and sending informants to record his conversations - none of those earlier investigations ever resulted in charges.\n\nSeismic impact\n\nMonday's indictment came after a yearslong investigation and just days after Platkin's office announced separate charges against two Norcross allies on the board of the South Jersey Transportation Authority who are accused of abusing their positions to exact revenge against one of his political rivals. Though he is referenced in charging documents in that case as a \"South Jersey Democratic Party Leader,\" that indictment did not identify Norcross by name, accuse him of any wrongdoing or charge him with a crime.\n\nThe case unveiled Monday means he now faces the threat of substantial prison time, if he is convicted, and a messy court battle that could tarnish both his legacy and the narrative he has helped build over years of his role as a white knight bringing back Camden from decades of poverty and financial disinvestment.\n\nIt's also all but certain to further roil New Jersey political circles, which have been buffeted in recent months by another blockbuster indictment, that of Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez, and a court decision earlier this year that forced a redesign of the state's ballots, after a federal court found it unfairly cemented the influence of party bosses like Norcross.\n\n\"It's often said that in New Jersey politics is a blood sport, and what's meant by that is that if you don't go along with the demands of those in political power, you'll get hurt,\" Platkin said at his news conference. \"But there's nothing inherent in our state's culture that requires us to accept politics and government that functions this way. And as we so clearly (say) in this indictment, there's nothing legal about it either.\"\n\nWaterfront real estate\n\nSpecifically, the indictment focused on Norcross' role in a handful of real estate deals on the Camden waterfront during a development boom set off by the state's implementation of a 2013 tax credit program.\n\nProsecutors say that Norcross and his brother Philip helped shape the legislation behind the tax incentives from the start. At a meeting in 2012 or early 2013 in which they discussed how they would use the tax credit program to their benefit, George Norcross told a group the program was \"for our friends\" and stated he hoped to use the program to build an office tower in downtown Camden for free, according to the indictment.\n\nShortly after the law passed, Philip Norcross spoke to several allies in a meeting that was recorded and detailed in Monday's indictment. \"I try to practice as little law as possible. Just for laughs and giggles, I run a law firm,\" he joked. \"And for more laughs and giggles, my sibling and I get around ... the table and decide what George's agenda is in Camden.\"\n\nAnd as prosecutors described it, they quickly got to work extorting and coercing others to acquire land and property rights on or near the waterfront.\n\nWhen George Norcross learned that a nonprofit redevelopment organization then known as Cooper's Ferry Partnership was seeking to buy two office buildings in Camden known as the L3 complex, his associates forced the nonprofit to partner with Norcross' preferred developer and ultimately sell its rights to the property, according to the indictment.\n\nProsecutors said that at the direction of Norcross' criminal enterprise, Camden Mayor Dana L. Redd's office instructed the nonprofit in 2013 to meet regularly with Philip Norcross, who ultimately told Cooper's Ferry not to use its chosen developer.\n\nPhilip Norcross \"implied\" that if the nonprofit didn't use the Norcross enterprise's preferred developer - investor Ira Lubert and commercial landlord Howard Needleman - it would \"suffer repercussions,\" the indictment says.\n\nAfter being told his job was in jeopardy, the nonprofit's CEO - Anthony Perno - reluctantly agreed to partner with Lubert and Needleman in Cooper's Ferry's purchase of the property from the state Economic Development Authority, prosecutors say.\n\nIn December 2014 the nonprofit received $125,000 for its rights, far less than the millions it had expected to earn from the transaction and in future profit-sharing. Lubert and Needleman, meantime, were able to buy the property at a steep discount - for $20 million less than its appraised value - as a result of a deal Cooper's Ferry had locked in with the state EDA before the passage of the tax incentive legislation, prosecutors say.\n\nWith Cooper's Ferry out of the picture, Cooper Health - whose board chairman was George Norcross - gained an ownership stake in the L3 complex. The hospital later obtained more than $27 million in tax credits from the state and moved into its own building as a tenant.\n\nA few years later, the indictment says, Norcross and his allies used threats of economic and reputational harm to force Perno to resign as chief executive of Cooper's Ferry. That helped outgoing Camden Mayor Dana Redd land a new job, the indictment says.\n\nThreats and extortion\n\nThat alleged extortion scheme was just the beginning, prosecutors said. Norcross and his allies quickly turned their attention to other waterfront developments - a planned office tower known as Triad1828, which is now headquarters to Norcross' insurance brokerage and its business partners trucking and logistics company NFI and the Michaels Organization, a residential real estate firm. Two top executives for those businesses - Sidney R. Brown, chief executive of NFI, and John J. O'Donnell, of Michaels - were also indicted Monday.\n\nBut despite Norcross' plans to erect the Triad office tower, Philadelphia developer Carl Dranoff controlled property rights that affected his ability to proceed.\n\nWhen Dranoff balked at Norcross' terms for buying property rights, Norcross in the summer of 2016 told him he would \"f- you up like you've never been f- ed up before,\" adding he would make sure the developer never did business in Camden again, the indictment says. In a recorded call, Norcross admitted to threatening Dranoff, according to prosecutors.\n\nAs a result of these and other actions, the indictment says, Dranoff in 2016 sold the rights to $18 million worth of tax credits to \"an entity owned by Norcross Enterprise members and associates.\" The developer also sold and extinguished other rights - for a price below where he valued the property - allowing Norcross' insurance brokerage and other entities to apply for more tax credits. They were approved for more than $240 million in tax credits and started receiving and selling them in 2022, according to prosecutors.\n\nThen, starting in 2018, Norcross allegedly leaned on his allies in Camden City government to block Dranoff's attempted sale of a luxury apartment complex known as The Victor Building. The city also moved to terminate Dranoff's rights to develop another site. That prompted years of litigation, which concluded last fall in a settlement under which Dranoff agreed to pay the city $3 million plus additional tax payments of $300,000.\n\nNorcross' history with Platkin\n\nDespite the seriousness of the allegations lodged against his client, Norcross' attorney Michael Critchley predicted Monday that Norcross would ultimately be acquitted at trial.\n\nAfter all, members of Norcross' camp noted throughout the day, this wasn't the first time many of the real estate deals at issue had received public scrutiny, and it wasn't Norcross' first run-in with Platkin.\n\nIn 2019, a task force Platkin helped to create under Gov. Phil Murphy found companies with ties to political insiders, including Norcross, may have made false representations to win tax credits from the state Economic Development Authority.\n\nThe task force questioned the propriety of several credits awarded to companies including Norcross' insurance brokerage Conner Strong & Buckelew and Cooper Health System.\n\nNorcross unsuccessfully sued Murphy over the inquiry, denying any wrongdoing and dismissing the task force's work as a political hit job. In 2022 Conner Strong and its business partners received their first installment of tax breaks, which are distributed over 10 years and can be used to offset tax liabilities or sold for cash.\n\nNorcross' allies pointed out that despite all the headlines generated by the task force, its efforts to rescind millions of dollars in tax credits have been shot down in court.\n\nKevin Marino, attorney for Philip Norcross, predicted that with Monday's indictment Platkin - now in a new role as attorney general - would once again come up short.\n\n\"Mr. Platkin,\" he said, \"is going to find out in this case, what it really means to have those who really are in power to be held to account.\"\n\n_____", "source": {"uri": "newsobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

The city at that point had among the highest crime rates in the nation. The 111-page indictment unsealed Monday alleges he threatened a developer who would not relinquish his rights to waterfront property and that Norcross used political influence to orchestrate tax incentives to be enacted to benefit organizations he controlled\n\nMembers of the alleged conspiracy also got a government development agency to help them get leverage in private negotiations, said Platkin, who is also a Democrat.\n\nProsecutors said the 13-count indictment outlined how the group flexed political influence and acquired property and property rights through coercion, extortion and other criminal acts. All six defendants are accused of first-degree racketeering, financial crimes, misconduct by corporate officials and conspiracy.\n\nNorcross and his associates \"used their political influence to tailor New Jersey economic development legislation to their preferences,\" the indictment says.\n\n\"The alleged conduct of the Norcross Enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, non-profits, the people of the State of New Jersey, and especially the City of Camden and its residents. That stops today. We must never accept politics and government -- that is funded with tax dollars -- to be weaponized against the people it serves. Today we reaffirm that no one in our state is above the law -- period,\" Platkin said in a statement.\n\nThe defendants are scheduled to be arraigned July 9 in Mercer County.\n\nIn remarks outside the justice complex that includes Platkin's office, Norcross demanded a trial in two weeks and called Platkin a coward. He said he was left thinking, \"Where's the beef?\"\n\nThe defendants are Norcross, 68, of Palm Beach, Florida; his brother Philip A. Norcross, 61, of Philadelphia, a New Jersey lawyer; George Norcross' longtime lawyer William M. Tambussi, 66, of Brigantine; Camden Community Partnership chief executive and former Camden Mayor Dana L. Redd, 56, of Sicklerville; Sidney R. Brown, 67, of Philadelphia, chief executive of trucking and logistics company NFI; and development company executive John J. O'Donnell, 61, of Newtown, Pennsylvania.\n\nA lawyer representing Philip Norcross called him a stellar lawyer with an \"unblemished reputation.\" \"The notion that he would be charged with crimes is simply outrageous,\" lawyer Kevin Marino told The Associated Press.\n\nMarino declined to address any specific allegations in the indictment.\n\nPhilip Norcross, the attorney, and U.S. Rep. Donald Norcross, D-1st, are both brothers of George. Donald Norcross said in a statement that he looks forward to his brothers telling their side of the story.\n\n\"I love my brothers,\" he said. \"I believe in the rule of law, and they will have the opportunity to defend themselves during their day in court.\"\n\nHenry Klingeman, Redd's attorney, said she was surprised by the charges.\n\n\"She's done nothing wrong,\" Klingeman said. \"What she has done is serve the Camden community in public and not-for-profit roles for more than three decades. She has cooperated fully with the grand jury investigation for over a year and is unaware of evidence of wrongdoing by her or others. She looks forward to fighting these false allegations in the courtroom before a judge and jury, so she can reclaim her good name that has now been tarnished by the Attorney General's unjust and unjustified action.\"\n\nMessages seeking comment were left with a lawyer for Tambussi.\n\nTambussi recently represented Jersey Freedom, an independent expenditures group sued by the state Republican Committee and state Sen. Vince Polistina, R-Atlantic after the November general election.\n\nPolistina and the GOP alleged the group tried to split the GOP vote with sham conservative candidates to benefit Democrats, and hid the true source of their funding until votes had been cast. After the election, Jersey Freedom disclosed its funds came from a Democratic political action committee.\n\nIn March, a Superior Court judge decided the state Election Law Enforcement Commission had jurisdiction in the case and dismissed it. ELEC is now investigating.\n\nO'Donnell has been an executive with The Michael's Organization, a residential development company that has worked with the Atlantic City Housing Authority on rehabbing

Platkin has charged George E. Norcross III, a politically powerful south Jersey insurance executive, with sprawling racketeering charges, Platkin announced in a Monday press conference.\n\nNorcross, the chairman of insurance firm Conner Strong & Buckelew, was the keystone in a sprawling enterprise to \"manipulate government programs and processes designed to attract development and investment to instead suit their own financial desires,\" Platkin announced Monday.\n\n\"Instead of contributing to the successes of the city of Camden, through a series of criminal acts alleged in the state's case, the Norcross enterprise took the Camden waterfront all for themselves. As George Norcross himself allegedly said 'this is for our friends,'\" Platkin announced. (RELATED: Democrats Changed Campaign Finance Laws Ahead Of Contentious Election In This State, It Ultimately Benefited Them)\n\nThe Attorney General accused Norcross of using his power and influence over government officials, including former Camden Mayor Dana Redd, who Platkin also charged with racketeering, to achieve highly favorable deals and squeeze rival developers out of properties, Platkin alleged.\n\nOne focus of the indictment was the L3 commercial real estate property, which Norcross allegedly pressured a nonprofit to sell to a developer associated with him for a fraction of what they could have gotten for it.\n\n\"The Camden Mayor's office directed the nonprofit's leaders to meet regularly with Phillip Norcross and then to update the Norcross enterprise of its progress in the deal,\" Platkin alleged.\n\n\"At the direction of city government officials the nonprofit's leaders met regularly with Phillip Norcross and were pressured to follow the directions of the Norcross enterprise or else face repercussions,\" Platkin continued.\n\nThe nonprofit ultimately sold it to the Norcross-associated developer for a $125,000 net profit while Platkin claims they could have sold it for millions.\n\nNorcross' handpicked developers were \"able to obtain the L3 complex at a discounted price only available to the nonprofit,\" according to Slatkin.\n\nSubsequently Cooper Health, where Norcross served as chairman of the board, gained ownership interest in the building and collected over $27 million in state tax credits from 2016 to 2022, \"thanks to legislation that the Norcross enterprise helped craft,\" Slatkin alleged.\n\n\"We re-wrote a tax credit law in New Jersey that says, in essence, if you come to Camden we're going to give you 100 percent tax credit for all capital and related cost. It will cause real havoc. It's unlimited,\" Norcross wrote about the tax code, according to Slatkin.\n\nSlatkin detailed another incident in which Norcross threatened a developer and forced him to relinquish property rights so Norcross could build the tallest building on Camden's waterfront.\n\n\"When the developer would not initially relinquish his rights on terms preferred by the Norcross enterprise, George Norcross threatened the developer that he would in substantive part 'F you up like you've never been F'd up before,'\" Slatkin alleged.\n\n\"And he told the victim developer that he would make sure he would never do business in Camden again,\" Slatkin continued.\n\n\"In a later recorded phone call, George Norcross admitted to threatening the developer and recalled the conversation with the victim developer asking Norcross 'Are you threatening me?' to which George Norcross replied 'absolutely,\" Slatkin claimed.\n\nNorcross, who served on the Democratic National Committee, was \"the most powerful unelected political official in New Jersey,\" according to the New York Times.\n\nNew Jersey's Democratic Governor Phil Murphy had previously criticized Norcross for his exploitation of the state's tax incentive program, though that criticism seemed to stop in 2021 around the same time that the Camden County Democratic Committee, a group controlled by Norcross, endorsed Murphy's wife for Senate, the New York Times reported.\n\nBesides Norcross and Redd, Slatkin charged four other individuals in the racketeering case. Norcross' brother Phillip, his personal lawyer William Tambussi, and business leaders Sidney Brown and John O'Donnell also received charges, according to Slatkin.", "source": {"uri": "dailycaller.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Caller"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Norcross", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Norcross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norcross,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeering", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Racketeering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Redd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dana Redd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Murphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden_County,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Camden County, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Camden County, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Development", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Development", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Commercial", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Commercial", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1437573080-scaled-e1718650733478.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659259", "eventUri": "eng-9659259", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

Five alleged co-conspirators also were indicted.\n\nMichael Critchley, Norcross' attorney, called the indictment a political vendetta.\n\n\"What they did is they relied on some political adversaries,\" Critchley said, and that \"resulted in this tortured and unfair prosecution.\"\n\nThe charges stem in part from 2012-2013, when Norcross sought to redevelop the waterfront in Camden, New Jersey, which overlooks Philadelphia. Camden at that point had among the highest crime rates in the nation.

Norcross is pictured above testifying before the New Jersey Senate.\n\nGeorge Norcross III, the insurance executive known for his political influence in South Jersey, was indicted Monday on charges of racketeering.\n\nThe New Jersey Attorney General's Office alleges Norcross led a criminal enterprise that acquired lucrative properties along the Camden waterfront, collected millions in state tax credits, manipulated government officials and bullied business rivals. Five other defendants are named in the 111-page indictment, including Norcross's brother Philip Norcross, an attorney, and Dana Redd, the former mayor of Camden.\n\nNorcross is the father of PhillyVoice founder and CEO Lexie Norcross. Philip Norcross is the uncle of Lexie Norcross.\n\nThe indictment lays out a complicated conspiracy to control and profit from projects along the Camden waterfront. Norcross and the other defendants not only acquired properties and benefited from the associated state tax credits, prosecutors said, but threatened people who stood in their way. Norcross allegedly told one developer, who held the property rights needed to build the Triad1828 Centre, that he would \"f*** you up like you've never been f***ed up before,\" according to the indictment, and the defendants allegedly also conspired to sully the developer's reputation and directed Redd, who was Camden's mayor between 2010 and 2018, to stop communicating with him.\n\nThe developer eventually agreed to sell his rights, clearing the way for Norcross to build his property. It is the tallest building on the waterfront and headquarters of Conner Strong & Buckelew, the insurance firm Norcross chairs.\n\nAccording to the filing, Norcross also is intervened in the sale of the L3 complex. Norcross had hoped to use the site as the offices of Cooper Health, where both he and Philip are board members. Upon learning that a nonprofit redevelopment organization planned to buy the property, the enterprise forced the nonprofit to use its chosen developer and eventually sell its rights for $125,000 rather than \"expected millions.\"\n\nOther defendants named in the indictment are Bill Tambussi, Norcross' longtime personal attorney, and Sidney Brown, another Cooper Health board member. John O'Donnell, an executive at a residential development company, was also indicted.\n\nNew Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin announced the charges at a Monday afternoon news conference that got off to a bizarre start as Norcross took a seat in the front row. A member of Platkin's team approached Norcross, seemingly asking him to leave or at least move further back. She later announced that only reporters could ask questions.\n\nAfter Platkin's briefing, Norcross and his attorney's responded to the accusations outside justice complex. Norcross called Platkin a \"coward\" and \"we want to go to trial.\"\n\n\"Two weeks, Matt Plantkin, come join us. Try the case, because your people don't want to try anything,\" he said. \"You get down here and back up your words.\"\n\nPlatkin's office as well as the FBI and Justice Department had been investigating Norcross and his associates for years, according to a release. The defendants face 13 counts of first-degree racketeering and conspiracy to commit theft by extortion, first-degree financial facilitation of criminal activity, second-degree misconduct by a corporate official and second-degree official misconduct. If convicted, they could each face decades in prison as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines.", "source": {"uri": "phillyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PhillyVoice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Redd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dana Redd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Norcross", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Norcross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norcross,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tax credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racketeering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Jersey"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Development", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Development", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/61724_norcross_indictment.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659259", "eventUri": "eng-9659259", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

Democratic power broker charged with racketeering", "body": "George Norcross III, a New Jersey Democratic power broker, has been charged with racketeering by New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin, according to a report from The New York Times.\n\nPlatkin accused Norcross and five other defendants of \"unlawfully obtaining property and property rights on the waterfront\" of Camden, the Times reported. This allegedly allowed them to collection millions of dollars' worth of tax credits and exert influence over government officials.\n\nIn a statement reported by the Times, Platkin wrote: \"The indictment unsealed today alleges that George Norcross has been running a criminal enterprise in this state for at least the last 12 years. On full display in this indictment is how a group of unelected, private businessmen used their power and influence to get government to aid their criminal enterprise and further its interests.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Norcross via the contact form of the law firm Conner Strong & Buckelew, of which he serves as executive chairman.\n\nPlatkin is also charging George's brother, Phillip Norcross, his personal lawyer, William Tambussi, former Camden Mayor Dana Redd, Sidney Brown and John O'Donnell in the case, according to the Times.\n\nNorcross is a New Jersey businessman who has been viewed as among the most powerful figures in New Jersey politics. He has wielded substantial influence over elections and legislation in the Democratic-leaning state.\n\nHe served on the Democratic National Committee (DNC) until 2021 and previously served as the head of the Camden County Democratic Party.\n\nOn Monday, Norcross attended the press conference in which Platkin announced the indictment.\n\n\"Norcross is here, at right. First time I've seen a criminal defendant sit in the front row of a press conference about his indictment,\" posted journalist S.P. Sullivan.\n\nNorcross announced that he would be stepping away from politics in May 2023, Politico reported. He told the publication he was \"involuntarily pushed to a different place\" and felt he had been \"sitting in the backseat.\"\n\n\"We had a great run for almost 25 years, and now it's time for others to lead the party,\" he said.\n\nHis brother, Donald Norcross, represents New Jersey's 1st Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nThe South Jersey machine has been viewed as one of the most robust political operations across the U.S. but suffered significant losses during the 2021 election, when Republicans made notable gains against Norcross-backed candidates.\n\nSince then, the New Jersey political establishment has faced growing scrutiny after Democratic U.S. Senator Bob Menendez was indicted on criminal charges in a separate case.", "source": {"uri":

Sen. Bob Menendez, another powerful political boss held in awe by lower-level political players, is in the middle of a corruption trial. And that comes just months after a federal judge struck down the \"county line\" -- a tool long used by New Jersey's political machines to suppress intra-party challengers -- for the 2024 Democratic primary.\n\nNew Jersey's notoriously boss-driven political system has never been imperiled like this before, at least not in living memory. And now, a crop of younger New Jersey Democrats are ready to dance on its grave.\n\n\"2024 is going to go down as the most significant change that New Jersey has ever seen for its electoral and political process,\" said Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, 47, who at times fought publicly with Norcross and who's now running for governor in 2025. \"You've had this culture of a handful of people with disproportionate influence. The public didn't necessarily realize how all of this stuff was monetized, and now the situation has changed.\"\n\nNorcross was charged along with his brother Phil, former Camden Mayor Dana Redd and three other longtime associates. The indictment alleges a dozen years of extortion and other corruption by the \"Norcross enterprise\" at the expense of a downtrodden city located across the Delaware River from Philadelphia. (Another Norcross brother, Democratic Rep. Donald Norcross, is not facing any charges).\n\n\"George Norcross has been running a criminal enterprise in the state for at least the last 12 years. This alleged conduct of the Norcross enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, nonprofits, the people of the state of New Jersey and especially -- especially -- to the city of Camden and its residents,\" state attorney general Matt Platkin said at a news conference -- with Norcross, uninvited, sitting just feet in front of him. \"That stops today.\"\n\nPlatkin, who has not run for office before, is among a younger group of progressives like Fulop, Rep. Andy Kim and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka seen as potential reformers of the state's political system. Although Platkin has not publicly expressed ambitions for elected office, a bill in the Legislature would bar him from doing so for three years after leaving his position.\n\nNorcross lashed out at Platkin afterwards and demanded that a trial start in two weeks.\n\n\"I want Matt Platkin to come down here and try this case himself,\" he said outside the attorney general's office in Trenton. \"Because he's a coward, because he has forced people in this building to implement his will.\"\n\nDecades of influence without holding office\n\nNorcross, a 68-year-old insurance broker, has never held elective office. But he's been one of the most influential figures in the state since the early 1990s, able to channel millions of dollars for his chosen candidates and against his political enemies.\n\nNorcross forged alliances with governors of both parties -- most notably Republican Chris Christie, who was arguably his closest governing partner and whose administration worked with Norcross and his allies to design the tax credit system that Norcross is charged with exploiting.\n\nAnd Norcross held huge sway over virtually every member of South Jersey's state legislative delegation. Super PACs with close ties to Norcross have often been the top spenders in New Jersey elections going back a decade. Meanwhile, his insurance brokerage, Conner Strong & Buckelew, profited from millions of dollars in public work across the state.\n\nNorcross was also childhood friends with former Senate President Steve Sweeney, and virtually every South Jersey Democratic state lawmaker past and present owes their election at least in part to Norcross' fundraising prowess. That has given Norcross immense bargaining power and a seat at the table for some of the state's biggest political decisions. His power increased immensely shortly before Christie was elected, when he and Sweeney put together enough votes to oust longtime Senate President Dick Codey, a Norcross foe.\n\nMany politicians feared crossing Norcross.\n\n\"He was a guy who never lived a day smiling,\" Codey, who retired in January after 50 years in the Legislature, said of his former nemesis Monday.\n\n\"It's about time, and New Jersey is a better place without people like him who think running the government is what they should be doing even though they're unelected,\" Codey said.\n\nAnother Norcross critic, for a time, was Gov. Phil Murphy. Murphy, when Platkin was his chief counsel, hired an outside law firm to investigate the Christie-era tax credit programs and Norcross' influence in both shaping and generating them -- much of which is featured in the new indictment.\n\nNorcross and Murphy would later set aside their differences for an uneasy political detente. Murphy even raised money for Norcross' super PAC earlier this year, and Norcross' political machine backed first lady Tammy Murphy's aborted run for Menendez's Senate seat. But Platkin, who broke with the Murphys when he refused to defend the county line in court against a lawsuit by Kim, now the Democratic Senate nominee to replace Menendez, never let the power broker out of his sights.\n\n\"I'm kind of speechless, honestly,\" said Sue Altman, former executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Alliance.\n\nIn 2019, when the Legislature convened a friendly committee hearing that gave Norcross an opportunity to push back against the Murphy administration's tax credit investigation, Altman was forcibly removed from the room by State Police as Norcross looked on.\n\nNow Altman is the Democratic nominee for Congress in Central Jersey's 7th district. Norcross' shadow remains over even that race. New Jersey Globe reported last week that, due in part to her fights with the South Jersey Democratic machine, the AFL-CIO -- some of whose Building Trades members are closely aligned with Norcross -- chose not to endorse her.\n\n\"It's a little bit of a sad day for Camden. It sort of proves what we knew all along: The people of Camden were far down the line of constituents who were considered when these plans were being hatched,\" Altman said. But, she added, \"it's an opportunity and a moment for change in New Jersey, for accountability in politics, and to replace old party structures and old power with people committed to the public good and public service.\"\n\nRonsha Dickerson, an anti-Norcross Camden advocate, said the indictment felt like \"bricks being lifted off our chests.\" Dickerson said that the tax incentives built shining new office buildings, but noted that few Camden residents actually got jobs in them, and that promised necessities to benefit locals, like supermarkets, never materialized.\n\n\"It kind of confirmed that we're not crazy. For years, people just thought we were doing some conspiracy theory stuff,\" Dickerson said. \"It felt like someone finally understood that we were telling the truth down here.\"\n\nPolitical heavyweights knocked down in 2024\n\nThe potential downfalls of Norcross and Menendez coincide with the elimination of the county line, which bosses of both parties wielded for decades to give their candidates advantages on primary ballots. The line enabled the party to list all its endorsed candidates in a single row or column. Those challenging the party apparatus sometimes found themselves in obscure, hard-to-find parts of the ballot known as \"ballot Siberia.\"\n\nDemocrats in Camden County, where Norcross' power is most concentrated, were particularly notorious for their use of the county line. They were also its most vociferous defenders against Kim's challenge to it , and made headlines when several Camden County Democratic officials blocked a Democratic Senate candidate from entering party headquarters while Tammy Murphy spoke inside the building.\n\nProgressive Democrats even uncovered evidence that Camden County Democrats recruited \"phantom candidates\" just to take up space on the ballot against rivals.\n\nNorcross' political machine suffered a series of major political defeats in 2021, capped off by the shocking defeat of Sweeney by a virtually-unknown truck driver named Ed Durr. Norcross, whose official residence is now Florida, told POLITICO last year that he was stepping back from state politics, though few took his word seriously. And indeed, with Norcross still helping finance elections through his super PAC, South Jersey Democrats in 2023 reclaimed many of their losses from two years earlier.\n\nBut there have been signs that the grip on power by Norcross, Menendez and other party bosses has been loosening.\n\nAltman, who led the effort to eliminate the line even before Kim did, is one of several Democrats coming into their own who either challenged or fell out with New Jersey's boss-driven political culture.\n\nKim, a former Obama administration diplomat who was elected to Congress on the anti-Trump wave, was one of the first elected Democrats to call on Menendez to resign following his September indictment and turned the tide against the county line. Fulop was also openly critical of Menendez and was an early elected official to call for the end of the line. Baraka, who's also running for governor in 2025, also supports ending the line.\n\nSweeney, who in 2023 declined to seek a return to his state Senate seat, is also running for governor in 2025. Norcross, along with his brothers, last week hosted a $1,500 per-head fundraiser for Sweeney in South Jersey. Sweeney declined to comment through a spokesperson.\n\nWhile there's no doubt New Jersey's Democratic political boss system is wounded, it's not dead. Even without the county line, Democratic county parties managed to dominate most seriously-contested elections in the primary earlier this month. And despite outcries from the progressive wing of the party and many of the Democrats running for statewide office, the Democratic Legislature passed and Murphy signed a bill putting new restrictions on the state's Open Public Records Act -- a move seen by some as a vestige of New Jersey's boss-driven political culture.\n\n\"They're fighting back. We just witnessed the OPRA changes as one example,\" said Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray. \"They're not going to go quietly here, but there certainly is a sea change in the comfort level that these organizations have had over the past few decades.\"", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Murphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Norcross", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Norcross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Jersey"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norcross,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Platkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Platkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Menendez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bob Menendez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Fulop", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steven Fulop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tax credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Political machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Kim_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Kim (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ras_J._Baraka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ras J.

Phil Murphy, announced multiple charges, including first-degree racketeering, against six defendants: George Norcross III, Philip Norcross, William Tambussi, Dana Redd, Sidney Brown, and John O'Donnell.\n\n'The alleged conduct of the Norcross Enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, non-profits, the people of the State of New Jersey, and especially the City of Camden and its residents. That stops today.'\n\nAccording to Platkin's press release, a group referred to as the Norcross Enterprise used unseemly means to acquire property, especially in Camden, and then coordinated with government officials to \"craft\" laws and regulations that benefited them. When officials and other residents refused to play along, the enterprise resorted to \"coercion, extortion, and other criminal acts\" to get their way, the press release said.\n\nThis scandal dates back at least to 2012, Platkin alleged, and officials have been investigating it for \"years.\"\n\n\"On full display in this indictment is how a group of unelected, private businessmen used their power and influence to get government to aid their criminal enterprise and further its interests,\" Platkin said in a statement. \"The alleged conduct of the Norcross Enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, non-profits, the people of the State of New Jersey, and especially the City of Camden and its residents. That stops today. We must never accept politics and government - that is funded with tax dollars - to be weaponized against the people it serves. Today we reaffirm that no one in our state is above the law - period.\"\n\nOf the six defendants charged in the indictment, Redd, the former mayor of Camden and a Democrat former state senator, is the only one to have been elected to office. Nevertheless, the rest, especially George Norcross, wielded considerable influence over their state's political landscape.\n\nPolitico claimed 68-year-old George Norcross \"ruled\" the state of New Jersey for \"decades\" and that \"many politicians feared crossing\" him. The AP described him as one of \"the most influential unelected Democrats in the state.\"\n\nNorcross, a former member of the Democratic National Committee and the former chair of the Camden County Democratic Party, also joined forces with high-profile New Jersey Republicans, including former Gov. Chris Christie. Currently a resident of Palm Beach, Florida, Norcross was also a former member of former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.\n\nOne New Jersey insider compared the indictment to a political \"earthquake,\" another to an \"atomic bomb.\"\n\n'I want to witness an extraordinary embarrassment and outrageous conduct from a government official who stands up there and tries to act like he's holier than thou.'\n\nNorcross even attended Platkin's press conference to announce the indictment. \"I want to witness an extraordinary embarrassment and outrageous conduct from a government official who stands up there and tries to act like he's holier than thou,\" he said after the conference.\n\n\"I want Matt Platkin to come down here and try this case himself, because he's a coward, because he has forced people in this building to implement his will.\"\n\nOne of Norcross' brothers, Philip Norcross, a Philadelphia attorney with an \"unblemished reputation,\" according to his attorney, has also been charged. Another Norcross brother, Donald Norcross, a Democrat U.S. representative from New Jersey, has not.\n\n\"I love my brothers. I believe in the rule of law, and they will have the opportunity to defend themselves during their day in court,\" Rep. Norcross said in a statement.\n\nTambussi is also an attorney who once served as outside counsel to the City of Camden. For the past 35 years, he has also served as counsel to the Camden County Democratic Committee. His attorney did not respond to a request for comment from the AP.\n\nRedd's attorney Henry Klingeman insisted she has \"done nothing wrong.\" Klingeman claimed Redd served her community and cooperated in the investigation.\n\nThe other defendants have not yet hired an attorney.\n\nThe first-degree racketeering charge alone carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $200,000 as well as \"additional financial penalties\" that Platkin has already confirmed he intends to seek.", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors":

Like this exchange for instance, where it's, \"Yes, I said that, but not in those words.\"\n\n...The indictment says that Norcross' criminal conduct included threatening a developer who had held the waterfront property rights necessary for the Norcross enterprise to build the tallest building on the Camden waterfront.\n\n\"When the developer would not relinquish his rights on terms preferred by George E. Norcross III, he threatened the developer that he would, in substance and in part, \"f**k you up like you've never been f**ked up before and told the developer he would make sure the developer never did business in Camden again,\" the indictment said.\n\n\"In a recorded phone call, [Norcross] later admitted to threatening the developer: 'I said, 'this is unacceptable. If you do this, it will have enormous consequences.' [The developer] said, 'Are you threatening me?' I said, 'Absolutely,' \" according to the indictment.\n\nThis is a whole 'nuther level of Jersey.\n\nThe indictment is alleging that Norcross and Co's scheme was to get ahold of all the abandoned warehouse and frontage on the Camden waterfront so they could develop it themselves. The exchange above, where Norcross either flat-out threatened or politely insinuated a real downside to an uncooperative developer (whomever you choose to believe) is the guy who wouldn't sell them one of the remaining pieces of property they needed to put their plans into motion.\n\n...\"The abandoned industrial sites along the Camden waterfront had the potential to serve as the city's salvation,\" Platkin said today. \"But as the state alleges, the Norcross enterprise manipulated government programs and processes designed to attract development and investment to instead suit their own financial desires instead of contributing to the successes of the city of Camden. Through a series of criminal acts alleged in this case, the Norcross enterprise took the Camden waterfront all for themselves.\"\n\n...The indictment alleges that Norcross threatened a developer who owned property he needed to build the tallest building along the waterfront, Triad1828 Centre.\n\n\"When the developer would not relinquish his rights on terms preferred by (Norcross), he threatened the developer that he would, in substance and in part, 'f**k you up like you've never been f**ked up before,' and told the developer he would make sure the developer never did business in Camden again,\" the indictment reads. \"In a recorded phone call, (Norcross) later admitted to threatening the developer: 'I said ... 'this is unacceptable. If you do this, it will have enormous consequences.''\"\n\nThe developer wound up selling the rights to $18 million worth of tax credits to an entity owned by persons connected to the Norcross enterprise. That allowed the enterprise to apply for additional tax credits worth more than $240 million.\n\nAnd this fellow has had his threads running through all sorts of New Jersey administrations. He's an equal opportunity opportunist when it came to working the state real estate tax incentive angles.\n\n...In testimony before a State Senate committee in 2019, Norcross criticized a task force investigating New Jersey's tax incentive.\n\nThat year, the New York Times reported that Kevin Sheehan, an attorney at Parker McCay, where Philip Norcross, the kingmaker's brother, is managing partner, had significant input on the bill, at times injecting verbatim passages that created carve-outs for specific businesses in Camden.\n\nThe task force later confirmed the report, releasing publicly draft versions of the bills that showed edits made by Sheehan, who ProPublica reported was in constant communication with Gov. Chris Christie's administration during the drafting of the bill.\n\nWith Menendez-like bluster but ever more elegantly, Norcross stood outside after the indictment press conference and challenged NJ AG Platkin to a mud wrestling match.\n\nNorcross had a stage already set up in the lobby for his post-press conference appearance, but the AG kicked them completely out of the building.\n\nNo worries for Norcross. He did fine off the French cuff.\n\nCrusty NJ political hands are shocked at the seismic shift in the status quo. Is Murphy evening old scores before he skitters out of the office, or is it actually a new day where politics \"as usual\" won't be the usual?\n\nNo one's sure yet, but it was something different for New Jersey to wake up to.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "beege_welborn@hotair.com", "name": "Beege Welborn", "type": "author",

Norcross III, the towering figure who has led South Jersey's Democratic political machine for nearly a quarter century, was charged Monday in a sweeping racketeering case alleging that he and key allies used their influence to corruptly acquire tax credits and real estate worth millions while muscling rivals out of the lucrative redevelopment of Camden's waterfront.\n\nAttorney General Matthew J. Platkin unveiled the 13-count indictment -- which also named Norcross' brother and Camden-based attorney Philip, their longtime lawyer William Tambussi, and former Camden Mayor Dana Redd as defendants -- at a news conference in Trenton.\n\nHe accused the group -- which he repeatedly referred to as the \"Norcross Enterprise\" -- of hijacking a 2013 state program meant to encourage development in poorer communities to line their own pockets instead. They maintained that control, Platkin said, through coercion, extortion and threats.\n\n\"On full display in this indictment is how a group of unelected, private businessmen used their power and influence to get government to aid their criminal enterprise and further (their) interests,\" Platkin said, adding that their conduct allowed them to essentially take \"the Camden waterfront all for themselves.\"\n\nRemarkably, as the attorney general detailed the 111-page indictment in front of an audience of reporters Monday, Norcross, 68, sat quietly in the front row.\n\nHe was anything but quiet afterward as he balked at the charges, called Platkin a \"politician masquerading as an attorney general,\" and accused him of carrying out a yearslong political vendetta against him.\n\nThe entire scene played out just blocks from the New Jersey State House, where Norcross over the years had become accustomed to being treated as a distinguished guest by governors and lawmakers alike.\n\n\"I want to go to trial in two weeks. I want Matt Platkin to come down here and try this case himself,\" Norcross told reporters outside the Hughes Justice Complex after the attorney general announced charges. \"Because he's a coward, because he has forced people in this building to implement his will.\"\n\nThat Norcross -- a Camden County native, insurance executive, philanthropist, and chair of Cooper University Health System, a major hospital network -- had found himself on the wrong end of a criminal indictment signaled a seismic shift in the political forces that have governed New Jersey for years.\n\nDespite never having held elected office, Norcross built the South Jersey Democratic machine into a juggernaut over the last two decades that has propelled key allies into all levels of politics and government from city councils and local party committees to government agencies and the state legislature. His backing helped to elect his brother Donald Norcross to Congress in 2013 and to install former state Senate President Stephen Sweeney, George Norcross' childhood friend, in his leadership role in 2009.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki",

It did look like an act of intimidation. It was his way of communicating that 'you've really picked a fight here and you might regret it' kind of look.\"\n\nIf he was intimidated, Platkin didn't really show it, and he had no comment about the Norcross theatrics when asked about it later, letting the charges do his talking.\n\n\"We're here today to announce the unsealing of a 13-count indictment charging George Norcross with leading a criminal enterprise,\" he announced. \"The state alleges that defendants George Norcross, Phillip Norcross, William Tambucci, former Camden Mayor Dana Redd, Sydney Brown and John O'Donnell, committed the first-degree crime of racketeering conspiracy, among other offenses to further the purposes of the Norcross enterprise.\"\n\nThe charges are serious and carry long prison terms. The state alleges that Norcross and his co-defendants cornered the market on properties, tax credits and other incentives, made possible by the Economic Opportunity Act, a Christie era multi-billion dollar economic booster shot aimed right at the city of Camden. It said the defendants used threats, intimidation and all the political muscle at his disposal to do it.\n\nIn response, a defiant Norcross has challenged the Attorney General.\n\n\"Remember who he is and what he was,\" Norcross said to reporters outside the Attorney General's office on Monday. \"He was a second-year associate at a law firm who's a politician now, masquerading as an attorney general. His interest is to find himself a venue where he can be hoisted on the shoulders of whomever.\n\n\"We want to go to trial. Two weeks. Matt Platkin, come join us. Try the case,\" Norcross said.\n\nThe charges in the indictment have long been asserted by community leaders like Ronsha Dickerson, who's been saying that the Camden Renaissance was good for the Norcross brothers but not so much for Camden's long-time residents.\n\n\"Though this is coming from the AG's office, this is 20 years of grassroots community work,\" she said. \"And I want to say that we did this with no support. No legal support. It was us, in courage and spirit, getting in front of the FBI, getting in front of people to tell the story, knowing that we were dealing with people with different powers who could really change our livelihoods.\n\nGubernatorial candidate Steve Fulop, who's battled Norcross for years, said the Norcross indictment should be the start of a sea change in Jersey politics.\n\n\"New Jersey is different than many other states,\" said Fulop. \"In New Jersey, there's essentially a shadow government that makes decisions. So you see your elected officials, but for the most part, your elected officials aren't the ones making the decisions. There's four or five people that choose who the candidates are for governor, speaker, senate president, every powerful position and legislation that goes through.\"", "source": {"uri": "njspotlightnews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ Spotlight News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Norcross", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Norcross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norcross,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Platkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Platkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Record_(North_Jersey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Record (North Jersey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Jersey"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Redd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dana Redd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of the Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Fulop", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Fulop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}], "image": "https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2024/06/@spsullivan.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659259", "eventUri": "eng-9659259", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

Sen. Bob Menendez, another powerful political boss held in awe by lower-level political players, is in the middle of a corruption trial. And that comes just months after a federal judge struck down the \"county line\" -- a tool long used by New Jersey's political machines to suppress intra-party challengers -- for the 2024 Democratic primary.\n\nNew Jersey's notoriously boss-driven political system has never been imperiled like this before, at least not in living memory. And now, a crop of younger New Jersey Democrats are ready to dance on its grave.\n\n\"2024 is going to go down as the most significant change that New Jersey has ever seen for its electoral and political process,\" said Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, 47, who at times fought publicly with Norcross and who's now running for governor in 2025. \"You've had this culture of a handful of people with disproportionate influence. The public didn't necessarily realize how all of this stuff was monetized, and now the situation has changed.\"\n\nNorcross was charged along with his brother Phil, former Camden Mayor Dana Redd and three other longtime associates. The indictment alleges a dozen years of extortion and other corruption by the \"Norcross enterprise\" at the expense of a downtrodden city located across the Delaware River from Philadelphia. (Another Norcross brother, Democratic Rep. Donald Norcross, is not facing any charges).\n\n\"George Norcross has been running a criminal enterprise in the state for at least the last 12 years. This alleged conduct of the Norcross enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, nonprofits, the people of the state of New Jersey and especially -- especially -- to the city of Camden and its residents,\" state attorney general Matt Platkin said at a news conference -- with Norcross, uninvited, sitting just feet in front of him. \"That stops today.\"\n\nPlatkin, who has not run for office before, is among a younger group of progressives like Fulop, Rep. Andy Kim and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka seen as potential reformers of the state's political system. Although Platkin has not publicly expressed ambitions for elected office, a bill in the Legislature would bar him from doing so for three years after leaving his position.\n\nNorcross lashed out at Platkin afterwards and demanded that a trial start in two weeks.\n\n\"I want Matt Platkin to come down here and try this case himself,\" he said outside the attorney general's office in Trenton. \"Because he's a coward, because he has forced people in this building to implement his will.\"\n\nNorcross, a 68-year-old insurance broker, has never held elective office. But he's been one of the most influential figures in the state since the early 1990s, able to channel millions of dollars for his chosen candidates and against his political enemies.\n\nNorcross forged alliances with governors of both parties -- most notably Republican Chris Christie, who was arguably his closest governing partner and whose administration worked with Norcross and his allies to design the tax credit system that Norcross is charged with exploiting.\n\nAnd Norcross held huge sway over virtually every member of South Jersey's state legislative delegation. Super PACs with close ties to Norcross have often been the top spenders in New Jersey elections going back a decade. Meanwhile, his insurance brokerage, Conner Strong & Buckelew, profited from millions of dollars in public work across the state.\n\nNorcross was also childhood friends with former Senate President Steve Sweeney, and virtually every South Jersey Democratic state lawmaker past and present owes their election at least in part to Norcross' fundraising prowess. That has given Norcross immense bargaining power and a seat at the table for some of the state's biggest political decisions. His power increased immensely shortly before Christie was elected, when he and Sweeney put together enough votes to oust longtime Senate President Dick Codey, a Norcross foe.\n\nMany politicians feared crossing Norcross.\n\n\"He was a guy who never lived a day smiling,\" Codey, who retired in January after 50 years in the Legislature, said of his former nemesis Monday.\n\n\"It's about time, and New Jersey is a better place without people like him who think running the government is what they should be doing even though they're unelected,\" Codey said.\n\nAnother Norcross critic, for a time, was Gov. Phil Murphy. Murphy, when Platkin was his chief counsel, hired an outside law firm to investigate the Christie-era tax credit programs and Norcross' influence in both shaping and generating them -- much of which is featured in the new indictment.\n\nNorcross and Murphy would later set aside their differences for an uneasy political detente. Murphy even raised money for Norcross' super PAC earlier this year, and Norcross' political machine backed first lady Tammy Murphy's aborted run for Menendez's Senate seat. But Platkin, who broke with the Murphys when he refused to defend the county line in court against a lawsuit by Kim, now the Democratic Senate nominee to replace Menendez, never let the power broker out of his sights.\n\n\"I'm kind of speechless, honestly,\" said Sue Altman, former executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Alliance.\n\nIn 2019, when the Legislature convened a friendly committee hearing that gave Norcross an opportunity to push back against the Murphy administration's tax credit investigation, Altman was forcibly removed from the room by State Police as Norcross looked on.\n\nNow Altman is the Democratic nominee for Congress in Central Jersey's 7th district. Norcross' shadow remains over even that race. New Jersey Globe reported last week that, due in part to her fights with the South Jersey Democratic machine, the AFL-CIO -- some of whose Building Trades members are closely aligned with Norcross -- chose not to endorse her.\n\n\"It's a little bit of a sad day for Camden. It sort of proves what we knew all along: The people of Camden were far down the line of constituents who were considered when these plans were being hatched,\" Altman said. But, she added, \"it's an opportunity and a moment for change in New Jersey, for accountability in politics, and to replace old party structures and old power with people committed to the public good and public service.\"\n\nRonsha Dickerson, an anti-Norcross Camden advocate, said the indictment felt like \"bricks being lifted off our chests.\" Dickerson said that the tax incentives built shining new office buildings, but noted that few Camden residents actually got jobs in them, and that promised necessities to benefit locals, like supermarkets, never materialized.\n\n\"It kind of confirmed that we're not crazy. For years, people just thought we were doing some conspiracy theory stuff,\" Dickerson said. \"It felt like someone finally understood that we were telling the truth down here.\"\n\nThe potential downfalls of Norcross and Menendez coincide with the elimination of the county line, which bosses of both parties wielded for decades to give their candidates advantages on primary ballots. The line enabled the party to list all its endorsed candidates in a single row or column. Those challenging the party apparatus sometimes found themselves in obscure, hard-to-find parts of the ballot known as \"ballot Siberia.\"\n\nDemocrats in Camden County, where Norcross' power is most concentrated, were particularly notorious for their use of the county line. They were also its most vociferous defenders against Kim's challenge to it , and made headlines when several Camden County Democratic officials blocked a Democratic Senate candidate from entering party headquarters while Tammy Murphy spoke inside the building.\n\nProgressive Democrats even uncovered evidence that Camden County Democrats recruited \"phantom candidates\" just to take up space on the ballot against rivals.\n\nNorcross' political machine suffered a series of major political defeats in 2021, capped off by the shocking defeat of Sweeney by a virtually-unknown truck driver named Ed Durr. Norcross, whose official residence is now Florida, told POLITICO last year that he was stepping back from state politics, though few took his word seriously. And indeed, with Norcross still helping finance elections through his super PAC, South Jersey Democrats in 2023 reclaimed many of their losses from two years earlier.\n\nBut there have been signs that the grip on power by Norcross, Menendez and other party bosses has been loosening.\n\nAltman, who led the effort to eliminate the line even before Kim did, is one of several Democrats coming into their own who either challenged or fell out with New Jersey's boss-driven political culture.\n\nKim, a former Obama administration diplomat who was elected to Congress on the anti-Trump wave, was one of the first elected Democrats to call on Menendez to resign following his September indictment and turned the tide against the county line. Fulop was also openly critical of Menendez and was an early elected official to call for the end of the line. Baraka, who's also running for governor in 2025, also supports ending the line.\n\nSweeney, who in 2023 declined to seek a return to his state Senate seat, is also running for governor in 2025. Norcross, along with his brothers, last week hosted a $1,500 per-head fundraiser for Sweeney in South Jersey. Sweeney declined to comment through a spokesperson.\n\nWhile there's no doubt New Jersey's Democratic political boss system is wounded, it's not dead. Even without the county line, Democratic county parties managed to dominate most seriously-contested elections in the primary earlier this month. And despite outcries from the progressive wing of the party and many of the Democrats running for statewide office, the Democratic Legislature passed and Murphy signed a bill putting new restrictions on the state's Open Public Records Act -- a move seen by some as a vestige of New Jersey's boss-driven political culture.\n\n\"They're fighting back. We just witnessed the OPRA changes as one example,\" said Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray. \"They're not going to go quietly here, but there certainly is a sea change in the comfort level that these organizations have had over the past few decades.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Will we listen? | Mike Kelly", "body": "The 13-count criminal indictment of George Norcross, the well-connected power broker who controlled political puppet strings across South Jersey, isn't just a matter of law.\n\nThis is about a lifestyle that is far too common in New Jersey.\n\nLike plenty of honchos before him -- and, sadly, plenty more probably in the future -- Norcross created a world that blended politics and business. He is now charged with using his political connections to enrich his businesses. And those businesses, in turn, reportedly bolstered his political standing.\n\nGiven such a history, is anyone shocked that Norcross, 68, and a resident of Palm Beach, Florida, was a member of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club where politics and business -- and an occasional top-secret document -- were part of the ambience?\n\nThe details of a stunning indictment raise questions about NJ politics\n\nOnly now, the state of New Jersey thinks it has finally caught up with Norcross. An indictment this week from New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin also names five other associates, including the former mayor of Camden, New Jersey, Dana Redd; Norcross's brother, Philip; and Norcross's long-time personal attorney and the former legal counsel to the Camden County Democratic machine, William Tambussi.\n\nIn a stunning, wide-ranging 111-page indictment, Norcross was depicted as akin to a slick, well-tailored crime boss. In announcing the indictments on Monday, Platkin even went so far as to label Norcross's political-business spider web a \"criminal enterprise.\"\n\nBut the criminal lifestyle depicted in the indictment does not fit the easy narratives of organized law-breaking that we generally associate with such films as \"The Godfather\" and \"Goodfellas.\" There are no guns, no \"button men\" whose speaking style tends to substitute \"dems\" and \"does\" for pronouns.\n\nThe alleged scheme run by Norcross has its own unique narrative. As Platkin noted in describing the case, this was basically \"a group of unelected, private businessmen [who] used their power and influence to get government to aid their criminal enterprise and further its interests.\"\n\nThe indictment even named the scheme the \"Norcross Enterprise\" and offered evidence that it continued virtually unchecked for 12 years, starting in 2012.\n\nThat time frame is important. It encompasses the gubernatorial administrations of Republican former Gov. Chris Christie and now into the second, four-year term of Gov, Phil Murphy, a Democrat.\n\nBoth Christie and Murphy initially tried to avoid dealing with Norcross -- and why not? Democrats and Republicans alike have long viewed the silver-haired Norcross as a pompous, self-centered manipulator who was hardly shy about announcing that he would only support a piece of state legislation or a candidate if he concluded that he would benefit from it.\n\nEventually, Christie and Murphy swallowed their pride and played along with Norcross, mostly looking the other way. So did the New Jersey Democratic Party, which needed Norcross desperately to drum up votes in South Jersey to win state-wide elections. On Wednesday, two days after the indictment and as an indication of how Democrats walk a strange path when it comes to Norcross, Murphy finally offered only tepid support for Platkin's investigation. What's significant is that Murphy did not ask the important question: Why in the world are Democrats involved with Norcross?\n\nWhat's a power broker?: Why is George Norcross referred to as one in New Jersey?\n\nYes, Norcross called himself a Democrat, but few in the party ever bothered to wonder why Norcross never seemed to have any real views on the important social issues of the last few decades. It was as if Norcross managed to avoid getting bloodied in America's culture war political battles over abortion, guns, climate change and immigration.\n\nIn a way, he was a perfect political cipher, blending business and politics -- and profits, but never seeming to take a stand on the important issues of the day. He left the heavy-lifting of those divisive issues to others. He actually could have been a Republican. Maybe he should have. Nobody would have noticed the difference.\n\nOnce, in a conversation with me, I asked him -- naively -- why he wasn't interested in a U.S. senatorial primary. Norcross's answer speaks volumes about how he viewed his role as a Democratic party leader.\n\n\"I don't care about the U.S. Senate,\" he said bluntly, adding, with a degree of honesty that offers a window into his self-confident approach to politics and business, that he was more concerned with how the state legislature and governor might affect his own business interests in Camden.\n\nWho knows how the alleged \"Norcross Enterprise\" enriched George Norcross. But clearly, Matthew Platkin has staked his reputation and his future career on putting an end to it.\n\n\"That stops today,\" said Platkin, a Democrat who was once a close legal advisor to Murphy but whose independence has opened a deep a rift with the governor and his circle of pals.\n\nKeep in mind that it was Platkin who broke from Murphy earlier this year and urged a federal judge to reject the practice of allowing the county bosses of political parties to grant prime ballot spots to favored candidates in primary elections. This year, Murphy lobbied extensively with Democratic county bosses for a top ballot spot for his wife, Tammy, in the primary election for U.S. Senatorial candidates to replace incumbent Bob Menendez who is currently on trial on corruption charges.\n\nTammy Murphy turned out to be a poor campaigner and withdrew on her own, leaving the field open for Rep. Andy Kim who is considered a front-runner to win the seat in November's election. But Platkin's efforts to help derail the so-called \"county line\" on primary ballots left a bitter aftertaste with Murphy and old-line Democrats.\n\nMore: George Norcross III, South Jersey's Democratic power broker, faces racketeering charges\n\nWill Norcross upend NJ political culture?\n\nNow comes the Norcross indictment -- and what will surely be a spotlight on the long tradition of New Jersey political figures enriching their businesses with government contracts.\n\n\"We must never accept politics and government -- that is funded with tax dollars -- to be weaponized against the people it serves,\" Platkin said. \"Today we reaffirm that no one in our state is above the law - period.\"\n\nThose are inspiring words. And it's worth noting they were spoken by Platkin on June 17, which just happens to be the 52 anniversary of the arrests of the Watergate burglars and the start of what would turn out to be the most consequential political scandal in U.S. history.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Platkin's effort to \"stop\" the so-called \"Norcross Enterprise\" will go down in New Jersey history as a turning point in how politics is conducted.\n\nNearly two decades ago, the same questions were raised about the Bergen County Democratic chief Joe Ferriero's habit of enriching himself with government contracts. Ferriero eventually served time in federal prison. But before that, he was hardly denying that he routinely used his political connections to enrich himself and his law firm. In a strange way, Ferriero was playing the same role as George Norcross -- but on a much smaller landscape.\n\nAsked by me -- naively -- whether this practice might be unethical, Ferriero shot back: \"Would you deny me the chance to make a living?\"Don't be shocked if George Norcross says something like that in his defense. He'll likely explain how he has helped to re-build parts of Camden -- and that's true. But now those business ventures will go on trial. For his part, Norcross and several pals showed up unannounced at Platkin's press conference on Monday as the indictment was announced. Consider that moment the equivalent of a school-boy stare-down. It belongs on a grade school playground.\n\nYes, this is about alleged crimes. But it's also about a lifestyle that is considered a rite of passage for many New Jersey political figures -- and probably many others across America. Norcross just happens to be the target now.", "source": {"uri": "app.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asbury Park Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Platkin is charging a well-known New Jersey insurance executive and long-time Democratic political influencer with leading a criminal enterprise in the state for the past dozen years.\n\nGeorge E. Norcross III, executive chairman of Camden-based insurance agency Conner Strong & Buckelew (CSB) and chairman of the board of trustees of Cooper Health, is among six people alleged to have acquired property rights and tax credits in Camden and elsewhere through coercion, extortion, and other criminal acts. Norcross and five alleged associates have been all charged with racketeering.\n\nPlatkin said the 13-count indictment came after a years-long investigation into the activities of Norcross and his associates in South Jersey and elsewhere. The indictment filed in Superior Court alleges that from about 2012 through the present, the Norcross Enterprise used coercion, extortion, and other criminal acts to tailor legislation to serve its interests, obtain property and property rights on the Camden waterfront, collect as much as $240 million in government-issued tax credits, and control and influence government officials including a former mayor of Camden.\n\nThe defendants include Norcross III, who now resides in Florida; his brother Philip A. Norcross, an attorney and CEO of Parker McCay, a New Jersey law firm; William M. Tambussi, a partner at the law firm of Brown and Connery and counsel to the Camden County Democratic Committee; Dana L. Redd, currently CEO of Camden Community Partnership and former mayor of Camden (2010 to 2018); Sidney R. Brown, CEO of NFI, a trucking and logistics company; and John J. O'Donnell, an executive with The Michaels Organization, a residential development company.\n\nThe defendants are also charged with various other counts including financial facilitation, misconduct by a corporate official, and conspiring to commit theft by extortion.\n\n\"On full display in this indictment is how a group of unelected, private businessmen used their power and influence to get government to aid their criminal enterprise and further its interests,\" said Platkin in announcing the charges.\n\nThe charges and allegations are accusations and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in court.\n\nAccording to CNN, Norcross attended the news conference by Platkin and \"angrily denounced the charges, later calling Platkin a 'coward' and demanding a speedy trial.\"\n\nMichael Critchley, attorney for Norcross, did not reply to a request for comment by press time.\n\nHenry Klingeman, Redd's attorney, told CNN that the former mayor has done nothing wrong and had cooperated with the grand jury investigation.\n\nNorcross is the brother of U.S. Rep. Donald Norcross (D), who is not named in the indictment.\n\nThe charges do not implicate other employees of CSB insurance agency. The agency dates back to 1959 and has seven offices in the Northeast.\n\nThe indictment describes the Norcross Enterprise as a group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity who engaged in activities affecting trade and commerce in New Jersey and elsewhere. The purposes of the conspiracy included preserving and enhancing the \"power, reputation, and profits\" of the enterprise and its members and associates as well as preserving and enhancing the \"reputation and political power\" of Norcross, the court documents maintain.\n\nDuring the 12 years cited in the indictment, CSB was either owned in part or in full by holding companies controlled by, or trusts for the benefit of, Norcross. Philip Norcross also held a small share of the holding company that controlled CSB, the documents say.\n\nThe indictment describes Norcross as being influential in state and local politics: \"He exercises control of Democratic politics throughout south Jersey, and beyond, by controlling the manner in which candidates are endorsed and supported by the local party apparatus and given preferential locations on the ballot, and through fundraising.\"\n\nThe indictment claims that the enterprise members and associates used their political influence to tailor The Economic Opportunity Act of 2013 to their preferences and then after the legislation was enacted in September 2013, extorted and coerced others to obtain properties and property rights on the Camden waterfront.\n\nThe indictment maintains that Cooper Health and CSB benefitted and occupied some of the properties the enterprise obtained interests in and sold the tax credits they obtained for millions of dollars.\n\nAccording to the attorney general, as of 2023, CSB had received $8.6 million in state tax credits which it sold for $7.9 million. Also, for the period of 2012 to 2023, Norcross received approximately $29 million in wages from CSB, according to the indictment.\n\nThe attorney general's Office of Public Integrity and Accountability and the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Newark office participated In the investigation.\n\nThe arraignment is scheduled for July 9 before Superior Court Judge Peter E. Warshaw Jr. in Mercer County.", "source": {"uri": "insurancejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Insurance Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He resigned from his position and said he had received incorrect advice that the DNC's rules would allow him to continue to serve after his move.\n\nAccording to the news release from the New Jersey Attorney General's office, those charged in the 13-count indictment are:\n\nA third Norcross brother, Democratic New Jersey Rep. Donald Norcross, has not been implicated.\n\nAs early as 2012, Norcross wielded his political power to persuade government officials to create rules that favored his business interests, the news release said.\n\n\"The indictment unsealed today alleges that George Norcross has been running a criminal enterprise in this state for at least the last 12 years,\" New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said when announcing the charges Monday. \"On full display in this indictment is how a group of unelected, private businessmen used their power and influence to get government to aid their criminal enterprise and further its interests.\"\n\nAmong the allegations: Norcross enterprises threatened a developer with waterfront property rights in Camden and then worked with local officials to \"condemn the developer's rights through legal action to gain leverage in their negotiations,\" the indictment said.\n\nAccording to NorthJersey.com, Norcross sat in the front row Monday at the news conference where Platkin announced the charges.\n\n\"I want to witness an extraordinary embarrassment and outrageous conduct from a government official who stands up there and tries to act like he's holier than thou,\" Norcross said, according to Politico.\n\nNorcross also called Platkin a coward and said the charges were politically motivated, according to news reports.\n\nNorcross' attorney Michael Critchley told reporters that investigators \"never gave Mr. Norcross the decency of interviewing him or asking him to appear before the grand jury.\"\n\n\"What they did is, they relied on some political adversary and resulted in this tortured and unfair prosecution,\" he said.\n\nThe indictment was the result of an investigation that involved the Attorney General's office, the FBI and the New Jersey State Police.\n\nThe six accused will be arraigned July 9 in New Jersey, the attorney general's office said.\n\nNorthJersey.com contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri":

Phil Murphy told the media Wednesday that the racketeering charges Norcross faces are \"very serious\" but that he will \"likely have nothing else to say about this given it's an active law enforcement matter.\"\n\n\"As I said about Senator Menendez, as disturbing as the allegations might be, this is America. Folks are innocent until proven guilty, and that's the way it should be,\" Murphy said.\n\nThe governor started his tenure in Trenton at odds with Norcross, but has been building bridges in recent years. He has headlined fundraisers held by Norcross's PAC in recent years.\n\nWhen asked about attending or hosting fundraisers, the governor did not comment directly but did acknowledge that he has \"raised money for Democrats up and down the state and all across this country\" and said he will continue to do so.\n\nMurphy did say that Platkin has his \"complete confidence.\"\n\nStile: George Norcross indictment is the latest sign: NJ's political old guard is dying\n\nThe charges in the 13-count indictment unsealed Monday stem from tax breaks for a dozen companies that had ties to Norcross.\n\nIt alleges for more than a decade, Norcross and his associates obtained both property and property rights on the waterfront in Camden, collected millions of dollars in government-issued tax credits and controlled and influenced government officials to further their own interests for property and property rights through coercion, extortion and other criminal acts.\n\nIn a truly Jersey moment, Norcross himself attended the press conference announcing the charges and sat in the front row, staring down Platkin before holding court himself afterward on the front steps.\n\nRelated: What's a power broker? Why is George Norcross referred to as one in New Jersey?\n\nNorcross is charged alongside his brother, Philip Norcross, as well as William Tambussi, Dana Redd, Sidney Brown and John O'Donnell, Platkin's office announced. Norcross' brother, Rep. Donald Norcross, a Democrat who represents New Jersey's 1st Congressional District, was not implicated or charged.\n\nThe defendants also face charges of financial facilitation, misconduct by a corporate official, and official misconduct and conspiring to commit theft by extortion, criminal coercion, financial facilitation, misconduct by a corporate official and official misconduct.\n\nAn arraignment for the defendants is scheduled for 10 a.m. on July 9, before Superior Court Judge Peter E.

Will we listen? | Mike Kelly", "body": "The 13-count criminal indictment of George Norcross, the well-connected power broker who controlled political puppet strings across South Jersey, isn't just a matter of law.\n\nThis is about a lifestyle that is far too common in New Jersey.\n\nLike plenty of honchos before him -- and, sadly, plenty more probably in the future -- Norcross created a world that blended politics and business. He is now charged with using his political connections to enrich his businesses. And those businesses, in turn, reportedly bolstered his political standing.\n\nGiven such a history, is anyone shocked that Norcross, 68, and a resident of Palm Beach, Florida, was a member of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club where politics and business -- and an occasional top-secret document -- were part of the ambience?\n\nOnly now, the state of New Jersey thinks it has finally caught up with Norcross. An indictment this week from New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin also names five other associates, including the former mayor of Camden, New Jersey, Dana Redd; Norcross's brother, Philip; and Norcross's long-time personal attorney and the former legal counsel to the Camden County Democratic machine, William Tambussi.\n\nIn a stunning, wide-ranging 111-page indictment, Norcross was depicted as akin to a slick, well-tailored crime boss. In announcing the indictments on Monday, Platkin even went so far as to label Norcross's political-business spider web a \"criminal enterprise.\"\n\nBut the criminal lifestyle depicted in the indictment does not fit the easy narratives of organized law-breaking that we generally associate with such films as \"The Godfather\" and \"Goodfellas.\" There are no guns, no \"button men\" whose speaking style tends to substitute \"dems\" and \"does\" for pronouns.\n\nThe alleged scheme run by Norcross has its own unique narrative. As Platkin noted in describing the case, this was basically \"a group of unelected, private businessmen [who] used their power and influence to get government to aid their criminal enterprise and further its interests.\"\n\nThe indictment even named the scheme the \"Norcross Enterprise\" and offered evidence that it continued virtually unchecked for 12 years, starting in 2012.\n\nThat time frame is important. It encompasses the gubernatorial administrations of Republican former Gov. Chris Christie and now into the second, four-year term of Gov, Phil Murphy, a Democrat.\n\nBoth Christie and Murphy initially tried to avoid dealing with Norcross -- and why not? Democrats and Republicans alike have long viewed the silver-haired Norcross as a pompous, self-centered manipulator who was hardly shy about announcing that he would only support a piece of state legislation or a candidate if he concluded that he would benefit from it.\n\nEventually, Christie and Murphy swallowed their pride and played along with Norcross, mostly looking the other way. So did the New Jersey Democratic Party, which needed Norcross desperately to drum up votes in South Jersey to win state-wide elections. On Wednesday, two days after the indictment and as an indication of how Democrats walk a strange path when it comes to Norcross, Murphy finally offered only tepid support for Platkin's investigation. What's significant is that Murphy did not ask the important question: Why in the world are Democrats involved with Norcross?\n\nWhat's a power broker?: Why is George Norcross referred to as one in New Jersey?\n\nYes, Norcross called himself a Democrat, but few in the party ever bothered to wonder why Norcross never seemed to have any real views on the important social issues of the last few decades. It was as if Norcross managed to avoid getting bloodied in America's culture war political battles over abortion, guns, climate change and immigration.\n\nIn a way, he was a perfect political cipher, blending business and politics -- and profits, but never seeming to take a stand on the important issues of the day. He left the heavy-lifting of those divisive issues to others. He actually could have been a Republican. Maybe he should have. Nobody would have noticed the difference.\n\nOnce, in a conversation with me, I asked him -- naively -- why he wasn't interested in a U.S. senatorial primary. Norcross's answer speaks volumes about how he viewed his role as a Democratic party leader.\n\n\"I don't care about the U.S. Senate,\" he said bluntly, adding, with a degree of honesty that offers a window into his self-confident approach to politics and business, that he was more concerned with how the state legislature and governor might affect his own business interests in Camden.\n\nWho knows how the alleged \"Norcross Enterprise\" enriched George Norcross. But clearly, Matthew Platkin has staked his reputation and his future career on putting an end to it.\n\n\"That stops today,\" said Platkin, a Democrat who was once a close legal advisor to Murphy but whose independence has opened a deep a rift with the governor and his circle of pals.\n\nKeep in mind that it was Platkin who broke from Murphy earlier this year and urged a federal judge to reject the practice of allowing the county bosses of political parties to grant prime ballot spots to favored candidates in primary elections. This year, Murphy lobbied extensively with Democratic county bosses for a top ballot spot for his wife, Tammy, in the primary election for U.S. Senatorial candidates to replace incumbent Bob Menendez who is currently on trial on corruption charges.\n\nTammy Murphy turned out to be a poor campaigner and withdrew on her own, leaving the field open for Rep. Andy Kim who is considered a front-runner to win the seat in November's election. But Platkin's efforts to help derail the so-called \"county line\" on primary ballots left a bitter aftertaste with Murphy and old-line Democrats.\n\nMore: George Norcross III, South Jersey's Democratic power broker, faces racketeering charges\n\nNow comes the Norcross indictment -- and what will surely be a spotlight on the long tradition of New Jersey political figures enriching their businesses with government contracts.\n\n\"We must never accept politics and government -- that is funded with tax dollars -- to be weaponized against the people it serves,\" Platkin said. \"Today we reaffirm that no one in our state is above the law - period.\"\n\nThose are inspiring words. And it's worth noting they were spoken by Platkin on June 17, which just happens to be the 52 anniversary of the arrests of the Watergate burglars and the start of what would turn out to be the most consequential political scandal in U.S. history.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Platkin's effort to \"stop\" the so-called \"Norcross Enterprise\" will go down in New Jersey history as a turning point in how politics is conducted.\n\nNearly two decades ago, the same questions were raised about the Bergen County Democratic chief Joe Ferriero's habit of enriching himself with government contracts. Ferriero eventually served time in federal prison. But before that, he was hardly denying that he routinely used his political connections to enrich himself and his law firm. In a strange way, Ferriero was playing the same role as George Norcross -- but on a much smaller landscape.\n\nAsked by me -- naively -- whether this practice might be unethical, Ferriero shot back: \"Would you deny me the chance to make a living?\"Don't be shocked if George Norcross says something like that in his defense. He'll likely explain how he has helped to re-build parts of Camden -- and that's true. But now those business ventures will go on trial. For his part, Norcross and several pals showed up unannounced at Platkin's press conference on Monday as the indictment was announced. Consider that moment the equivalent of a school-boy stare-down. It belongs on a grade school playground.\n\nYes, this is about alleged crimes. But it's also about a lifestyle that is considered a rite of passage for many New Jersey political figures -- and probably many others across America. Norcross just happens to be the target now.\n\nMike Kelly is an award-winning columnist for NorthJersey.com, part of the USA TODAY Network, as well as the author of three critically acclaimed nonfiction books and a podcast and documentary film producer.

Within the 13-count indictment are signs of the years of earlier investigations that preceded it.\n\nPeppered throughout the charging documents are nearly a dozen references to contemporaneous recordings of phone calls and meetings in which Norcross and others discussed the real estate deals at the heart of the case. The tapes referenced in the indictment date as far back as 2013 -- well before Platkin's investigation began -- and continue through periods of time in which other earlier investigations of Norcross were occurring.\n\n\" READ MORE: 'New Jersey politics is a blood sport' and other key takeaways from prosecutors' case against S. Jersey power broker George Norcross\n\nIn one of them -- a recorded 2016 phone call -- Norcross admits to threatening Philadelphia real estate developer Carl Dranoff, with whom he was feuding at the time, the indictment says.\n\n\"He said, 'Are you threatening me?' \" Norcross reportedly told a confidante on the call, as he recalled a conversation with Dranoff. \"I said, 'Absolutely.' \"\n\nSome of the recordings described in the indictment were made during the same period the FBI was tapping Norcross' phones in an unrelated investigation into Philadelphia labor leader John J. Dougherty. The Inquirer has previously reported agents were listening in on Norcross' phone calls from July through late August 2016, then picked up again in October for about a month. Norcross wasn't charged or accused of any wrongdoing in that investigation.\n\nMonday's indictment also described a previously undisclosed FBI interview with Norcross in 2016 in which he discussed a Camden nonprofit that prosecutors now say was the victim of the power broker's extortion.\n\n\" READ MORE: What to know about the racketeering indictment against South Jersey power broker George Norcross\n\nHow many recordings of Norcross and his allies investigators have obtained remains unclear, as does who made them and where exactly they came from. During his news conference announcing the indictment Monday, Platkin credited the U.S. Attorney's Offices in Philadelphia and New Jersey for earlier work that contributed to his investigation.\n\nThe tapes could raise the stakes if the case against Norcross heads to trial.\n\n\"I can tell you that there is nothing more powerful in a criminal prosecution than hearing a tape recording,\" said Ed Stier, a former state and federal prosecutor who served as director of the New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice. \"You can't cross examine it.\"\n\nBut to Norcross, Platkin's use of recordings seemingly made during other investigations that went nowhere is a sign that the case is light on evidence and brought by an attorney general fueled by political ambition.\n\nDuring an interview Tuesday, Michael Critchley, an attorney for Norcross, dismissed the recordings as \"antiquated material\" that has \"been in the government's possession for almost a decade by multiple law enforcement agencies.\"\n\nHe also suggested some of the recordings may have captured conversations involving Norcross and his attorneys -- raising the possibility that his defense team could argue the government violated attorney-client privelege.\n\n\"They looked at these recordings, they examined these records and found no wrongdoing,\" Critchley said, noting that prior investigations didn't result in charges. \"Those recordings amount to nothing based upon the fact that law enforcement agencies that previously reviewed it did nothing. So from nothing comes nothing.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: Who is George Norcross? A look at the indicted South Jersey power broker\n\nAmong the earliest recordings of Norcross mentioned in the indictment is one from August 2016.\n\nAt the time, Norcross was working with Malvern-based real estate investment firm Liberty Property Trust to acquire parcels of land and property rights to build the office tower for his insurance brokerage and other partners, including logistics company NFI and development firm The Michaels Organization. Norcross and executives at those companies, who were charged alongside Norcross on Monday, also hoped to partner on a proposed residential project nearby.\n\nBut they faced several obstacles, chief among them Dranoff, who held property and development rights to several parcels on the waterfront. Years earlier, Dranoff had developed the Victor Building, the first market-rate apartment complex in Camden in decades, and was granted what is known as a view easement that protected its views of the Philadelphia skyline.\n\nThat limited how high other developers -- including Norcross' investor group -- could build in the surrounding area. For months, Dranoff had been negotiating with Liberty Property Trust over selling his view easement to make way for the development Norcross envisioned.\n\nThose talks were dragging on, and Norcross' group couldn't yet apply for state tax credits under the Economic Opportunity Act that would make the deal financially viable. (Prosecutors say the 2013 law that created those tax breaks was shaped by Norcross and his brother, Philip, as part of their criminal enterprise.)\n\nAccording to the indictment, on Aug. 22, 2016, George Norcross told Liberty CEO William P. Hankowsky that it would be a \"bad thing for the city\" if Norcross had to walk away from the project, and it would be \"humiliating for me.\"\n\n\"That's why I'm so irritated by [Dranoff's] crap,\" Norcross said, in a recorded conversation quoted in the prosecutors' court filing.\n\n\" READ MORE: In legal brawl over Camden waterfront, developer alleges 'shakedown' involving power broker George Norcross\n\nFrustrated by the lack of progress, on Oct. 20, 2016, the indictment says, Norcross threatened Dranoff, warning that there would be \"consequences\" if he didn't relent.\n\nThe next day, Norcross recounted that conversation to a confidante during another recorded conversation highlighted in Monday's indictment.\n\n\"I said, '[Dranoff], this is unacceptable. If you do this, it will have enormous consequences,'\" Norcross said, according to the filing.\n\nThe most detailed recorded conversations referenced in the indictment involved a purported plan to use the Camden Redevelopment Agency -- a government entity represented by the law firm of Norcross ally William Tambussi, who was also charged Monday -- to attack Dranoff by condemning his view easement.\n\nOn Oct. 21, 2016, a day after the indictment says Norcross told a friend he'd warned Dranoff of \"enormous consequences\" for refusing to agree to a deal on his property rights, an agreement emerged and was memorialized in an email, according to the indictment.\n\nBut it fell apart later that same day. In a recorded conversation, Norcross spoke with his brother Philip and mentioned the plan involving the redevelopment agency and Tambussi: \"I just talked to Tambussi. ... I want to go in. I want to encourage Tambussi to do his thing ... I think we just do it. F -- 'em. F -- 'em. Just do it.\"\n\nThe next day, Norcross convened a conference call with Philip Norcross, Tambussi, and his partners on the office project, Sidney Brown, CEO of NFI, and John J. O'Donnell, an executive at The Michaels Organization.\n\n\"I don't even know why we're dealing with [Dranoff] ... [T]he city ought to condemn his ass and just move on,\" George Norcross is quoted as saying in the indictment's recounting of the recorded conversation.\n\n\"He's gonna come under some very serious accusations from the City of Camden which are gonna basically suggest that he's not a reputable person, and he's done nothing but try to impede the progress of the city,\" Norcross continued. \"You can never trust him until you got a bat over his head.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: Camden accuses Dranoff of bilking city out of $9 million from Victor apartments tax break\n\nTambussi noted on the call that if a court authorized the city's condemnation of Dranoff's view easement, the value of his property rights would come \"down to virtually nothing\" -- benefiting the Norcross group's negotiating position, the indictment says.\n\nOn multiple occasions during the call, Brown asked questions clarifying the purpose of using the Camden Redevelopment Agency to go after Dranoff.\n\n\"Let me just make sure, is the goal here really to try and put some pressure on [Dranoff] to sign what we just tried to get signed?\" he asked the others at one point.\n\nGeorge Norcross responded: \"Of course. Either that or condemn it, so we can move expeditiously ...\"\n\n\" READ MORE: George Norcross probe: Two South Jersey transit officials charged with using authority to exact political revenge\n\nHe also floated another point of attack on Dranoff, who he referred to as a \"putz\": The city could revoke an option he held to redevelop another parcel nearby, a vacant property known as Radio Lofts. Philip Norcross chimed in that Tambussi's condemnation plan offered the best chance to \"kill\" the view easement.\n\nThe indictment doesn't indicate who recorded the men hatching those plans. The conversation does overlap with the period the FBI was wiretapping Norcross' phone as part of the Dougherty investigation.\n\nUltimately Norcross and the others didn't follow through with their condemnation idea. Liberty declined to cooperate, the indictment says, and instead offered to pay Dranoff more out of its own end of the deal.\n\nOn Oct. 24 -- the same day the Norcross group had planned to have the CRA go after Dranoff in court -- Dranoff agreed to sell his view easement for $1.95 million, below what he thought it was worth, as well as other property rights, prosecutors say. That would clear the way for the Norcross group's office tower, known as Triad1828 Centre, and the 11 Cooper apartment complex.\n\nOther people in Norcross' orbit were secretly recorded as well, including as far back as 2013, in the aftermath of the passage of the tax-incentive legislation.\n\nPhilip Norcross was recorded telling acquaintances in a September 2013 meeting that he practices \"as little law as possible\" and instead focuses on \"George's agenda in Camden,\" according to the indictment.\n\nFour years later, when George Norcross wanted to install a political ally at the helm of the nonprofit Cooper's Ferry, his associates advised the organization's chief executive to resign.\n\nSusan Bass Levin, a former Cherry Hill mayor installed as the nonprofit's cochair by Norcross and his allies, told CEO Anthony Perno that nothing could stop George Norcross from getting what he wanted, the indictment says. Levin isn't mentioned in the indictment by name, but she fits the description of a person identified in the charging document as \"CC-1,\" who prosecutors say was the CEO of Cooper Health's philanthropic arm, the Cooper Foundation.\n\nPerno left the nonprofit in 2017.\n\n\"If you don't think [Norcross] can't get to anybody he wants to,\" Levin told Perno in a recorded conversation recorded shortly before his decision to resign, \"you're kidding yourself.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Norcross III Indicted on Racketeering Charges - The Jewish Voice", "body": "AOC demands Netanyahu be banned from Congress, calling him a 'war criminal'\n\nGeorge E. Norcross III, a prominent Democratic power broker in New Jersey, has been charged with racketeering in a significant legal action that has sent shockwaves through the state's political landscape, according to a report in The New York Times. The indictment, unsealed on Monday by New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin, accuses Norcross and five co-defendants of orchestrating a 12-year scheme involving corruption, fraud, and the illicit acquisition of property along Camden's waterfront.\n\nThe 13-count indictment outlines a range of serious charges against Norcross and his associates, including his brother Philip A. Norcross, a prominent lawyer, and Dana L. Redd, the former mayor of Camden. As was reported on Monday in the NYT, they are accused of unlawfully obtaining property and property rights, fraudulently securing millions in government-issued tax breaks, and exerting undue influence over government officials to further their interests.\n\n\"Instead of contributing to the successes of the city of Camden,\" Attorney General Platkin stated during the announcement of the charges, \"Mr. Norcross led a criminal enterprise that took the Camden waterfront all for themselves.\" Indicated in the NYT report was that this criminal enterprise, according to prosecutors, exploited the city's efforts to revitalize its waterfront, a historically neglected area plagued by crime and poverty.\n\nThe indictment paints a picture of a ruthless and intimidating operation, with George Norcross allegedly using his considerable influence to bully rival developers. One developer, in a recorded phone conversation mentioned in the indictment, asked Norcross if he was being threatened, the report in the NYT said. \"Absolutely,\" Norcross reportedly replied, highlighting the aggressive tactics used to maintain control over the lucrative redevelopment projects.\n\nThe indictment also details how Norcross and his associates manipulated the system to secure advantageous tax breaks and government incentives. These actions not only deprived the city of potential benefits but also undermined public trust in the fairness and integrity of the redevelopment efforts.\n\nAs the central figure in the indictment, Norcross is a well-known insurance executive and a powerful political figure in New Jersey. His influence extends across the state's political and business spheres. The NYT reported that the other figures in the indictment include the following:\n\nGeorge Norcross's brother, Philip is the chief executive of a prominent Camden-based law firm. He faces charges of racketeering alongside his brother.\n\nDana L. Redd is the former mayor of Camden. Redd is accused of participating in the racketeering scheme. Her involvement signifies the extent of the alleged corruption within the city's leadership.\n\nWilliam Tambussi is a lawyer who has represented both Norcross and the city of Camden, Tambussi is among the co-defendants. His presence highlights the legal entanglements and the breadth of the network involved in the alleged scheme.\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, Norcross, now 68 and residing in Florida, appeared uninvited at the press conference held by Attorney General Platkin in Trenton, N.J. Dressed casually in a suit and loafers without socks, Norcross took a front-row seat as Platkin detailed the charges in the 111-page indictment, according to the NYT report. Norcross's legal team and at least one co-defendant, William Tambussi, sat behind him, underscoring the high stakes of the legal battle ahead.\n\nIn a swift and defiant response, Norcross held an impromptu news conference where he vehemently accused Attorney General Platkin of harboring a personal vendetta against him. According to the NYT report, he labeled Platkin as a \"coward\" and a \"politician masquerading as an attorney general,\" suggesting that the charges were politically motivated.\n\n\"He's innocent,\" asserted Norcross's lawyer, Michael Critchley. \"He's not afraid of the accusations.\" Similarly, Kevin H. Marino, representing Philip Norcross, dismissed the allegations as \"bogus,\" claiming Platkin had been misled by his own ambitions.\n\nThe 111-page indictment details a series of serious charges against Norcross and his co-defendants. They are accused of unlawfully obtaining property, securing fraudulent tax breaks, and exerting undue influence over government officials, as per the information in the NYT report. The indictment specifically mentions incidents of intimidation against rival developers, with recorded conversations highlighting Norcross's aggressive tactics.\n\nAttorney General Platkin criticized Norcross for exploiting Camden's revitalization efforts for personal gain. \"Instead of contributing to the successes of the city of Camden, Mr. Norcross led a criminal enterprise that took the Camden waterfront all for themselves,\" Platkin stated, as was noted in the NYT report.\n\nThe charges against Norcross come at a time when New Jersey's political landscape is already under scrutiny. The state's senior senator, Robert Menendez, is concurrently facing a corruption trial on charges of accepting bribes. These developments contribute to the perception of pervasive corruption within New Jersey politics.\n\nNorcross has been a formidable political figure in New Jersey for decades. As a member of the Democratic National Committee until 2021, he wielded significant influence, forming strategic alliances that often crossed party lines. According to the information contained in the NYT report, his political maneuvering was instrumental in selecting governors, steering legislative bills, and shaping state policy. His relationships spanned from close ties with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to membership at former President Donald J. Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club.\n\nGeorge Norcross's political career is marked by his ability to amass and wield power effectively. By leveraging generous campaign donations and cultivating a solid voting bloc of South Jersey lawmakers, Norcross played a pivotal role in New Jersey's political arena, as was explained in the NYT report. His influence extended beyond party affiliations, making him a central figure in the state's governance.\n\nAbout a year ago, George Norcross hinted at a retreat from the political spotlight following a series of legislative setbacks. The information in the NYT report said that these public statements came amidst renewed scrutiny from the attorney general's office into over a billion dollars in tax breaks awarded to South Jersey companies, a program heavily supported by Norcross and former Governor Chris Christie, a close ally.\n\nThe tax incentive program, known as the Economic Opportunity Act of 2013, was designed with the assistance of influential Democratic lawyers and disbursed nearly $7 billion in tax breaks. However,the NYT report said that the program lacked stringent safeguards against fraud, leading to widespread controversy and legislative inquiries. Despite the issuance of subpoenas and extensive hearings, no charges were filed at the time.\n\nGovernor Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat, had vocally opposed the tax incentive program during his first term, frequently clashing with Norcross. As per the NYT report, these tensions defined much of Murphy's initial years in office. Matthew J. Platkin, who served as Murphy's chief counsel during the investigation into the tax breaks, later became the attorney general and continued the probe, now culminating in the indictment of Norcross.\n\nThe conflict between Norcross and Murphy reached a peak in 2019 during a heated hearing on corporate tax breaks. Sue Altman, then the leader of the left-leaning Working Families Alliance and a close ally of Murphy, was forcibly removed from the standing-room-only hearing after causing a disruption, the NYT report said.", "source": {"uri": "tjvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Voice"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sholom_schreirber@tjvnews.com", "name": "Sholom Schreirber", "type": "author",

Norcross, chief executive of a law firm based in Camden, was also among those charged by the attorney general, whose office had been investigating George Norcross' access to government tax breaks.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Norcross was sitting alone in the front row of the hall in Trenton, where Platkin announced the 111-page indictment.\n\nIn remarks outside the justice complex that includes Platkin's office, Norcross demanded a trial in two weeks and called Platkin a coward.\n\nMichael Critchley, Norcross' attorney, called the indictment a political vendetta.\n\n\"What they did is they relied on some political adversaries,\" Critchley said, and that \"resulted in this tortured and unfair prosecution.\"\n\nThe charges reinforced New Jersey's already tarnished reputation for political corruption. The state's senior senator, Democrat Bob Menendez, is in his sixth week of trial, charged by federal prosecutors with accepting cash, gold bars, and a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for his willingness to use his political clout to dole out favors for allies.\n\nNorcross, an insurance executive who served on the Democratic National Committee, was for decades the most powerful unelected political official in New Jersey. He was instrumental in selecting governors, steering legislation, and influencing state policy.\n\nAbout a year ago, Norcross suggested he was stepping back from politics after a series of embarrassing legislative defeats. His public statements coincided with news reports that the attorney general's office had revived its investigation into more than $1 billion in tax breaks awarded to South Jersey companies close to Norcross under legislation backed by former governor Chris Christie, a Republican.\n\nDuring his first term, Governor Phil Murphy, a Democrat, railed against that tax incentive program and sparred openly with Norcross -- tension that defined much of his first two years in office. Platkin was Murphy's chief counsel when the state began investigating the program, the Economic Opportunity Act of 2013, and was later tapped as attorney general.\n\nCrafted with help from a well-connected Democratic lawyer, the program gave out nearly $7 billion in tax breaks but provided few guardrails to protect the state against fraud.\n\nControversy over the program prompted legislative hearings and subpoenas to companies and at least one state agency, but charges were never filed.\n\nThe feud between Murphy and Norcross appeared to ease as the governor was running for reelection in 2021. Murphy signed off on his own $14 billion tax incentive package in late 2020, and he and Norcross began appearing together in public, a scenario that for years was unheard-of.\n\nLast year, as Murphy's wife, Tammy Murphy, was vying to run for US Senate, the Camden County Democratic Committee, an influential group controlled by Norcross, was one of the first political organizations to back her. The endorsement came at a crucial time for Murphy, a first-time candidate, giving an air of inevitability to her faltering campaign.\n\nMurphy dropped out of the race in March, days before a crucial building block of Norcross' success -- a tradition unique to New Jersey in which party leaders gave preferential treatment to their favored candidates on primary election ballots -- was declared unconstitutional, first by Platkin and then by a federal judge.\n\nAs a result, Platkin's relationship with Murphy, once one of his closest allies, has frayed.\n\nIn addition to Norcross and his brother, the others charged are:\n\n-- William M. Tambussi, 66, of Brigantine, N.J., the longtime personal lawyer for Norcross;\n\n-- Dana L. Redd, 56, of Sicklerville, N.J., chief executive of Camden Community Partnership and former mayor of Camden;\n\n-- Sidney R. Brown, 67, of Philadelphia, chief executive of NFI, a trucking and logistics company;\n\n-- John J. O'Donnell, 61, of Newtown, Pa., who has been in the executive leadership of the Michaels Organization, a residential development company.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news",

Norcross III, New Jersey's once-powerful Democratic kingmaker, was charged Monday with racketeering along with five other defendants.\n\nThe 13-count indictment unsealed by New Jersey's attorney general, Matthew J. Platkin, accused the group of unlawfully obtaining property and property rights on the waterfront in Camden, New Jersey; fraudulently collecting millions of dollars in government-issued tax credits; and controlling and influencing government officials.\n\n\"George Norcross has been running a criminal enterprise in this state for at least the last 12 years,\" Platkin said in a statement.\n\nRelated Story: Madera Pharmacist Pleads Guilty in Long-Running Opiate Trafficking Scheme\n\nNorcross' brother, Philip A. Norcross, CEO of a Camden-based law firm, and the city's former mayor, Dana L. Redd, were also among those charged in the indictment. Platkin's government-integrity unit had been investigating George Norcross for more than a year in connection with the redevelopment of the Camden waterfront.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Norcross, who now lives in Florida, showed up at a news conference Platkin held in Trenton, New Jersey. Norcross' team of lawyers and at least one co-defendant, William Tambussi, a lawyer who has represented the city of Camden, sat behind him.\n\nNorcross said Platkin was acting on a personal vendetta, calling him a \"coward\" and a \"politician masquerading as an attorney general.\"\n\n\"He's innocent,\" his lawyer, Michael Critchley, added. \"He's not afraid of the accusations.\"\n\nRelated Story: Long Prison Stint for Fresno Man Busted in Child Solicitation Sting\n\nThe charges immediately served to further tarnish the already blemished reputation of New Jersey politics. The state's senior senator, Democrat Bob Menendez, is in his sixth week of a corruption trial, charged by federal prosecutors with accepting cash, gold bars and a Mercedes-Benz in exchange for his willingness to use his political clout to dole out favors for allies.\n\nNorcross, an insurance executive who served on the Democratic National Committee, was for decades the most powerful unelected political official in New Jersey. By donating generously to political campaigns and assembling a powerful South Jersey voting bloc in the Legislature, he was instrumental in selecting governors, steering legislation and influencing state policy.\n\nRelated Story: Man Plotted Mass Shooting in Atlanta to Incite 'Race War,' Officials Say\n\nTambussi, who joined Norcross and Critchley for an impromptu news conference after Platkin

He famously helped oust a state senate president in order to install a childhood friend in 2009. His brother, Donald Norcross, has served in Congress representing South Jersey for nearly a decade.\n\nMr. Norcross himself appeared at a press conference on Monday as Mr. Platkin announced the indictment. The lead defendant sat in the front row, just feet from Mr. Platkin and other prosecutors and investigators.\n\nAt one point, a woman who appeared to be a staff member for the attorney general's office asked Mr. Norcross to move to another seat because it was reserved for government officials who were involved in the investigation.

Jersey power broker George Norcross", "body": "Clocking in at 111-pages, Monday's mammoth indictment of South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross is full of insider details and new insights. Here are some highlights.\n\nClocking in at 111 pages and covering 12 years of development history and real estate wrangling in Camden, Monday's mammoth indictment of South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross and five allies was filled with insider details and new insights destined to be overshadowed by the larger news of the charges brought within it.\n\nBroadly, Attorney General Matt Platkin has accused Norcross and the others of using their political influence and control over local government to muscle out rivals in the lucrative development of Camden's waterfront -- allegations Norcross has dismissed as a political hit job.\n\nHere are some other -- yet no less interesting -- takeaways from prosecutors' summation of their case:\n\n\" READ MORE: Read the full 13-count indictment against South Jersey power broker George Norcross\n\nThe indictment underscored the large sums of money that Norcross, businesses associated with him, and his allies took in through New Jersey's 2013 state tax credit program and the real estate transactions at the heart of the criminal case.\n\nFor instance, Norcross' insurance brokerage -- Conner Strong & Buckelew -- has been awarded $8.6 million in tax credits as of 2023, which it later conveyed to other business in exchange for $7.9 million, a transaction enabled by provisions of the 2013 law. As the company's executive chairman, Norcross has been paid handsomely for the business' success, taking home $29 million in salary from the company between 2012 and 2023, according to the indictment.\n\nMeanwhile, Cooper University Health Care -- the Camden-based hospital network for which Norcross serves as board chairman -- won $27 million in tax credits between 2016 and 2022, which it has sold for $25 million. Those sales, according to the indictment, have allowed it to fully cover the annual $3.8 million rental cost for its headquarters at the 575,000-square-foot office complex on Federal Street known as L3.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Norcross and his allies strong-armed a local nonprofit out of a deal to buy the building in 2013, steering the sale instead to an investor group they preferred. Cooper Health later gained a 49% ownership stake in the building, entitling it to nearly half the profits earned from its other tenants.\n\nLikewise, after allegedly muscling Philadelphia developer Carl Dranoff out of development rights to another parcel on Cooper Street in Camden, Norcross and other investors went on to build the apartment complex 11 Cooper there. The complex received $3.5 million in tax credits between 2022 and 2023 and sold them for $4.3 million.\n\nNorcross has stressed that for as much money he's taken in from his business dealings in Camden, he and his business partners have invested significantly in the city, pumping more than $300 million into development there.\n\n\" READ MORE: Who is George Norcross? A look at the indicted South Jersey power broker\n\nIf George Norcross sat atop what prosecutors are calling the \"the Norcross Enterprise\" -- the alleged racketeering operation at the heart of their case -- his brother Philip served as its fixer.\n\nPhilip Norcross, CEO of the Mount Laurel law firm Parker McCay, is referenced throughout the indictment conveying his brother's demands to rivals and meeting with local government officials to ensure George Norcross' interests remained protected.\n\n\"I try to practice as little law as possible ... just for laughs and giggles,\" he told a group of allies in a September 2013 meeting quoted in the indictment. \"My siblings and I get around ... the table and decide what George's agenda is in Camden.\"\n\nPhilip Norcross and his law firm played a central role in shaping the 2013 tax credit legislation that set off the development boom along Camden's waterfront that forms the backdrop for prosecutors' case. Working with another Norcross ally, then-Senate President Stephen Sweeney, prosecutors say, he sent over line-item revisions to the tax credit bill that were later adopted as part of the law.\n\nOnce that tax incentive program was approved and the Norcrosses began eyeing waterfront property for development, it was Philip Norcross who, according to the indictment, muscled the CEO of the community development nonprofit Cooper's Ferry out of the deal to by the L3 building that now serves as headquarters to Cooper Health.\n\nThough Philip Norcross had no financial stake in the property and no role at Cooper's Ferry, Camden City officials repeatedly instructed the nonprofit's then-CEO Anthony Perno to \"meet with Philip\" and to follow his instructions about the land deal, the indictment says.\n\nPhilip Norcross pushed Perno to abandon a developer Cooper's Ferry had earlier lined up and partner instead with two other investors, preferred by George Norcross, instead. If Perno refused, the indictment alleges, it was made clear to him that Cooper's Ferry would \"suffer repercussions.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: New Jersey tax credits turned a Camden office complex into a lucrative investment. Now the feds and state AG are investigating\n\nPerno eventually acceded to Philip Norcross' demands and sided with the Norcrosses' preferred partners. Then in 2014 Cooper's Ferry sold its rights to the L3 development for a net $125,000, far less than the millions it had expected to earn from the more actively involved ownership of the building it had originally envisioned.\n\nWhen years later, George Norcross found himself at odds with Dranoff, the Philadelphia developer, over another parcel of land along the waterfront, Philip Norcross helped him achieve his desired outcome there, too.\n\nAt the time, Dranoff was hoping to sell the Victor Building, a luxury apartment complex he helped develop in 2003, but needed Camden City officials to agree to transfer a beneficial tax arrangement he'd enjoyed during his ownership to the potential buyers.\n\nPhilip Norcross urged city officials to \"slow down\" approving the transfer and met regularly with elected officials and other \"stakeholders\" about the issue, according to the indictment, even though he didn't have any formal role with the city or financial or legal interest in Dranoff's building. They did not grant Dranoff the approvals he needed, and ultimately, his deal to sell the Victor fell through.\n\nThe indictment also accuses Philip Norcross of plotting with his brother and others to have the Camden Redevelopment Agency condemn another nearby property Dranoff owned to force him to accede to other demands.\n\nPhilip Norcross' lawyer, Kevin Marino, has denied his client did anything improper.\n\n\"What is in this indictment that is outside the lines of appropriate negotiations?\" Marino said in an interview Tuesday. He added: \"I've never seen a thinner indictment. I have never seen a set of allegations that I feel more confident should never have been brought.\"\n\n\" READ MORE: What to know about the racketeering indictment against South Jersey power broker George Norcross\n\nTo cover up their conduct, the indictment says, Norcross and his allies routinely made false or misleading statements to the media and the courts.\n\nAs news outlets including ProPublica and The Inquirer began writing articles in 2019 about the pressure the Norcrosses exerted on Cooper's Ferry during the L3 deal, Norcross' spokespeople pushed back with a number of claims prosecutors now characterized as false, including that the nonprofit wasn't capable of purchasing the building.\n\nIn fact, the indictment says, Cooper's Ferry had \"an agreement in principle\" with a well-known developer to complete the transaction.\n\nIn another instance, Norcross lawyer William Tambussi, who was also charged in Monday's indictment, allegedly misled a Superior Court judge about the role the Norcross brothers had played in a push to pressure Dranoff to give up an easement he held protecting the views from his Victor Building apartment complex.\n\nThe indictment accuses the Norcrosses of using threats, intimidation and their control over Camden City government to effectively force Dranoff sell the easement rights in 2016 for less than he thought it was worth.\n\nDranoff later sued the City of Camden over his continued frustrations with his efforts to do business in the city. As the case neared trial last fall, Dranoff sought to introduce evidence that his difficulties in Camden dated back to that 2016 dispute with the Norcross team over the easement rights.\n\nBut Tambussi -- a longtime Norcross lawyer who represented the city in the litigation with Dranoff -- sought to block Dranoff from mentioning either George or Philip Norcross at the trial, arguing that they weren't relevant to the deal and that Dranoff's negotiations over the easement had occurred with another developer.\n\nProsecutors maintained Monday that, in fact, Dranoff's negotiations with that developer had been consummated at the insistence of the Norcrosses and their other business partners.\n\nTambussi on Monday said he was proud of his legal work for Camden and \"astounded\" by the charges.\n\n\" READ MORE: George Norcross probe: Two South Jersey transit officials charged with using authority to exact political revenge\n\nThe indictment portrays former Camden Mayor Dana Redd, who was also charged Monday along with Norcross and his brother, as a willing ally of their development plans in the city. When she left office in 2018, they allegedly helped her land a lucrative job as CEO of the Rowan University / Rutgers-Camden Board of Governors.\n\nBut that required moving others out the way. The indictment details a complicated game of musical chairs that culminated in Redd securing the position, which came with a $275,000 annual salary -- a significant pay bump over the $102,000-a-year she was paid as mayor.\n\nBut first, her predecessor in the role, Kris Kolluri, had to be set up with another job. According to the indictment, Norcross and his allies had the perfect position in mind -- Perno's job at Cooper's Ferry following his falling out with Norcross over the L3 deal.\n\nIn late 2017 -- as Redd's term as mayor neared its end -- one of Cooper's Ferry's cochairs, former Cherry Hill Mayor Susan Bass Levin, told Perno he needed to leave his $242,000-a-year job as the nonprofit's CEO so that Kolluri could step into the role instead, prosecutors said.\n\nShe warned him, according to the indictment, that if he resisted, \"they\" would just make up something about him and use it as grounds to fire him. In late 2017, Perno asked whether Cooper's Ferry would agree to restructure his severance package to better compensate him for the cost of leaving. But Levin told Perno that wouldn't work either.\n\n\"It doesn't give me cover with George,\" she said in a secretly recorded conversation with the nonprofit CEO quoted in the indictment. \"You can't go there. You don't want that fight. ... If you don't think he can't get to anybody he wants to, you're kidding yourself.\"\n\nEventually, Perno agreed to resign as CEO. Kolluri moved into his old job, vacating his spot as CEO of the Rowan University / Rutgers-Camden Board of Governors, and Redd moved into that position.\n\nIn 2022, she was named CEO of Camden Community Partnership, the name under which Cooper's Ferry rebranded itself in 2021.\n\nNeither Levin nor Redd's attorney, Henry Klingeman, has responded to requests for comment.\n\nWhile unveiling the indictment at a news conference Monday, Platkin described New Jersey politics as a \"blood sport.\" It didn't take long for that observation to be born out.\n\nTypically, high-profile criminal defendants speak through their attorneys and reserve their sharpest barbs for the courtroom. Norcross, however, stared down Platkin from a seat in the front row of the news conference.\n\nAfterward, he publicly attacked Platkin in deeply personal terms, calling him a \"coward\" and a \"politician masquerading as an attorney general.\" Norcross referenced a messy 2018 scandal in which Platkin's handling of rape allegations involving a staffer on Gov. Phil Murphy's 2017 campaign drew criticism from a state Senate committee full of Norcross allies.\n\nAt the time, Platkin was serving as chief counsel to Murphy's administration. The Senate committee concluded that the governor's office had \"seriously mishandled\" the sexual misconduct complaints from its former campaign employee. It specifically blasted Platkin for \"sloppy\" legal decisions and questioned the credibility of his testimony before the committee. The incident arose again during Platkin's 2022 confirmation hearings for the attorney general post.\n\n\" READ MORE: 'My voice went unheard': Official testifies N.J. Gov. Murphy campaign, administration ignored sexual assault allegation\n\nThe episode had left Platkin \"humiliated,\" Norcross insisted Monday, and seeking political revenge.\n\nAs Norcross and his lawyers see it, Monday's indictment is the culmination of years of bad blood between him and the attorney general -- a feud further fueled by the role Platkin, while still working for Murphy's administration, played in a 2019 task force that questioned the propriety of millions of dollars in state tax breaks awarded to several companies linked to Norcross.\n\nDespite the headlines generated by the task force's work, its efforts to rescind those tax credits have been shot down in court. Norcross and his lawyers dismissed Monday's indictment as little more than a warmed-over version of the task force's already stale allegations.\n\n\"Now, I'm sending a message to Matt Platkin,\" Critchley told a crowd of reporters Monday afternoon. \"Buckle up.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The 56-year-old previously served on the Camden City Council before becoming an elected state senator and the mayor of Camden from 2010 to 2018.\n\nRedd is accused of using her held offices to benefit herself and the Norcross Enterprise.\n\nAnother defendant is 66-year-old William Tambussi, of Brigantine.\n\nTambussi is the long-time personal attorney to George Norcross, as partner at law firm Brown and Connery.\n\nSince 1989, Tambussi has also served as counsel to the Camden County Democratic Committee, which George Norcross chaired from 1989 to 1995 and continued to influence to this day.\n\nTambussi has additionally worked as outside counsel for the City of Camden, the Camden Redevelopment Agency, Cooper Health and Conner Strong.\n\nHe also serves as a member of the Rutgers University Board of Governors, from which the Rutgers faculty union was calling for him to resign from on Monday afternoon.\n\nAnother alleged Norcross associate is Sidney Brown, 67, also of Philadelphia, the CEO of trucking and logistics company, NFI.\n\nHe also serves as a member of the board at Cooper Health and is a partner in the groups that own several of the Camden buildings at the center of the case.\n\nThe sixth and final defendant is John O'Donnell, 61, of Newtown, Pennsylvania, an executive with The Michaels Organization. He has separately served as the residential development company's chief operating officer, president and CEO.\n\nO'Donnell is another partner in groups that own several Camden buildings at the center of the allegations. He has also served stints on the Board of Cooper's Ferry Partnership, since 2018.\n\nBeyond racketeering, the defendants were also charged with counts of financial facilitation, misconduct by a corporate official, official misconduct and conspiring to commit theft by extortion, criminal coercion, financial facilitation, misconduct by a corporate official and official misconduct.\n\nJust days earlier, criminal charges were filed against two other Norcross associates who also serve as South Jersey Transportation Commissioners.\n\nBoth men, from Sewell, were accused Friday of blocking payments to an engineering firm whose executive refused to go along with a political request from Norcross, Politico reported.\n\n\"No matter how connected or powerful you are, if there is evidence suggesting that you have used your position and taxpayer dollars for political retribution or gain, we will hold you accountable,\" Platkin said in a written release on the earlier case.", "source":

Norcross is charged alongside his brother, Philip Norcross, as well as William Tambussi, Dana Redd, Sidney Brown and John O'Donnell, Platkin's office announced.\n\nNorcross has been under scrutiny from officials for years and was seated front row at a press conference convened to announced the charges in Trenton on Monday afternoon.\n\nThe 13-count indictment alleges Norcross and his associates obtained both property and property rights on the waterfront in Camden, collected millions of dollars in government-issued tax credits and controlled and influenced government officials to further their own interests for property and property rights through coercion, extortion and other criminal acts.\n\nUnsealed by Platkin's office on Monday, the 111-page indictment claims that, for more than a decade, Norcross and his associates used their power and influence on government officials to craft legislation with the help of Camden officials.\n\nPlatkin spoke for about 20 minutes, detailing specific examples from the indictment about actions taken by Norcross and his co-defendants to benefit what officials referred to as the Norcross Enterprise.\n\nThe defendants also face charges of financial facilitation, misconduct by a corporate official, and official misconduct and conspiring to commit theft by extortion, criminal coercion, financial facilitation, misconduct by a corporate official and official misconduct.\n\nAn arraignment for the defendants is scheduled for 10 a.m. on Tuesday, July 9, before Superior Court Judge Peter E. Warshaw Jr. in Mercer County.\n\nA task force formed by Gov. Phil Murphy early in his administration found that the state doled out tax breaks focused on the Camden companies tied to Norcross.\n\nMurphy hired the team of lawyers in January 2019, after the state comptroller's audit showing loose oversight and management of tax incentives.\n\nThe task force recommended in July 2020 that the EDA freeze the incentive awards for a dozen companies totaling $578 million. It also made unspecified criminal referrals.\n\nMurphy started his tenure in Trenton at odds with Norcross, but has been building bridges in recent years.

There are no legal issues with the credits.\n\nNorcross has long been described as a Democratic power broker though he held no public office and never has.\n\nOn NFI's website, the company says it is the country's sixth-largest dedicated carrier and the fourth-largest warehouse provider, and that it has more than 16,000 employees.\n\nThe indictment portrays Brown as a member of what prosecutors call \"the Norcross Enterprise\" without being one of its leaders or directly engaging in what the indictment portrays as the often threatening steps some members of the enterprise took that allegedly constitute criminal extortion.\n\nBrown has direct ties to George Norcross through Cooper Health, a South Jersey health system where Norcross is chairman of the Board of Trustees and Brown is a member of the board. Brown also is described in the indictment as a member of the group that ultimately bought not only the Triad1828 Centre but also the Ferry Terminal building and 11 Cooper in Camden.\n\nTriad1828 is described in the indictment as the tallest building on the Camden waterfront. It was constructed between January 2017 and December 2019.\n\nThe 111-page indictment mostly focuses on the interaction between the group led by the Norcross brothers, George in particular, and various state and local officials in redevelopment efforts along the Camden waterfront. The city, directly across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, was once a major manufacturing site that over the years saw such manufacturers as Campbell Soup (NYSE: CPB) and RCA Victor depart for other locations as it sank into poverty and population decline.\n\nThe six people indicted are George and Philip Norcross; Brown; former Camden Mayor Dana Redd; George Norcross' personal attorney, William Tambussi; and John O'Donnell, an executive in an organization that like NFI moved into Triad1828 and who is also described in the indictment as a member of the group that owns some of the Camden real estate that is the focus of the charges.\n\n\"From approximately 2012 to 2013, members and associates of the Norcross Enterprise used their political influence to tailor New Jersey economic development legislation to their preferences,\" the indictment says in one of its opening pages.\n\nWhen the legislation the Norcross group backed became law in 2013, according to the indictment, the Norcross Enterprise -- prosecutors capitalize the name -- \"did extort and coerce others to obtain -- for certain individuals and business entities -- property rights on the Camden, New Jersey waterfront and associated tax incentive credits.\"\n\nBy moving into those properties, various companies associated with George Norcross were able to obtain tax credits that were designed to incentivize redevelopment. Those tax credits could then be sold.\n\nMore than $7 million in credit with more to come\n\nFinancial benefit to NFI totaled $7.866 million through 2023, the amount of Grow New Jersey tax credits that were enabled by the 2013 legislation, according to the indictment. NFI sold those credits for $7.186 million.\n\nBut they aren't done. According to the indictment, the right to earn tax credits under Grow New Jersey extends to 2030. The owners of the developments at the center of the Norcross activities -- including 1828Triad and the residential building known as 11 Cooper -- have $211 million in additional credits to claim.\n\nAccording to the indictment, when the state announced the Grow New Jersey credits to be awarded to various Camden office building tenants in March 2017, it put the size of the credits NFI could expect to earn for its residency at Triad1828 at about $79.3 million.\n\nThe indictment also reveals -- though it has no bearing on issues related to Brown's involvement with Norcross -- that Brown earned about $60 million from NFI between 2012 and 2023.\n\nThe indictment obtained recorded direct conversations, strongly suggesting somebody in the Norcross universe has been cooperating for some time with New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin, who brought the indictment. He announced it at a press conference Monday that featured the odd sight of Norcross sitting in the front row of the audience before holding court with the media afterward.\n\nOne recorded conversation, according to the indictment, features George Norcross telling a recalcitrant unnamed developer who resisted giving up development rights he owned on the river that he would \"f -- you up like you've never been f -- - before.\" In another recording, Norcross refers to the developer as a \"putz.\"\n\nThe reaction to the Norcross indictment in the New York/New Jersey area was enormous, given the power he has been long known to wield in South New Jersey and by extension the state as a whole.\n\nAs Politico wrote of the indictment: \"New Jersey political insiders struggled to come up with big enough words to describe what they were hearing: The state attorney general was about to indict South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross, one of the most formidable and fearsome operators in state history, on corruption charges.\"\n\nThe fact that Brown was not as central to the activities that are the subject of the indictment can be seen partly in the fact that while there are 13 counts in the indictment, Brown is named in only eight of them.\n\nBut the charges are serious. For example, in count one, all the defendants are charged with racketeering. All are charged with being part of the \"Norcross Enterprise,\" which the indictment says was \"an ongoing organization whose members and associates function as a continuing unit for the common purpose of achieving the objectives of the Enterprise.\"\n\nPressure on a developer\n\nAnd while there are no quotes in the indictment from Brown quite as stark as Norcross' threats, it does show Brown as being actively involved in the effort to get that unnamed developer to give up his development rights.\n\nIn a recorded October 2016 call to discuss the holdout developer -- a call during which Norcross said Camden should \"condemn his ass and just move on\" -- Brown said of the plan the group was coming up with, \"A couple of good things would come out of this. It puts pressure on [the developer] to come to the table. He hasn't had any pressure up to this point.\"\n\nBrown then mentions the alleged work of fellow defendant Tambussi to work with government agencies to pressure the developer and says of the plan, \"[It] seems we should proceed and go ahead and let Bill get this thing done.\"\n\nThe other indictments against Brown are:\n\nNorcross also had an indirect trucking tie besides his links to Brown: He is seen as close to Steve Sweeney, the Democrat who was longtime president of the state's Senate and a major power broker in the Garden State. Sweeney was defeated by Raymour & Flanagan truck driver Edward Durr in 2021 in a shocking upset. Durr was defeated for reelection last November; both he and Sweeney are running for governor in the 2025 election, Durr as a Republican and Sweeney as a Democrat.\n\nS&P cuts Forward Air debt rating

Platkin and the Office of Public Integrity and Accountability (OPIA) announced the filing of criminal charges against six defendants following a years-long investigation into a criminal enterprise allegedly run by Norcross and his associates in South Jersey and elsewhere.\n\nThe 13-count indictment alleges that through a series of unlawful acts, the Norcross criminal enterprise obtained property and property rights on the Camden Waterfront, collected millions of dollars in government-issued tax credits, and controlled and influenced government officials to further the interests of the enterprise.\n\nThe charges stem from tax breaks for a dozen companies that had ties to Norcross, his brother, Philip Norcross, as well as William Tambussi, Dana Redd, Sidney Brown and John O'Donnell.\n\nGeorge Norcross, who has faced scrutiny from officials for years, was seated in the front row at a press conference held by Platkin in Trenton to announce the indictment.\n\nNorcross, a former Democratic National Committee member and one-time head of the Camden County Democratic Party, has been an influential figure in state politics.\n\nThe indictment alleges that from as early as 2012 through the present, the Norcross Enterprise used its power and influence over government officials to craft legislation tailored to serve the interests of the enterprise.\n\nWith the cooperation of then-Camden Mayor Dana Redd and other officials, the Norcross criminal enterprise allegedly used parts of the city's government to aid in acquiring property and property rights through coercion, extortion, and other criminal acts. All six defendants are charged with first-degree racketeering.\n\nGeorge E.

The alleged conduct of the Norcross Enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, non-profits, the people of the State of New Jersey, and especially the City of Camden and its residents. That stops today.\"\n\n\"Today's indictment marks the culmination of a years-long, collaborative investigation,\" said Drew Skinner, Executive Director of the Office of Public Integrity and Accountability. \"Every day, we at the Office of Public Integrity and Accountability work with our law enforcement partners across the State to root out corruption and criminal activities that create distrust in government institutions and harm the communities we in law enforcement are sworn to serve and protect.\"\n\nThe investigation involved the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Newark and Philadelphia Field Offices, the Division of Criminal Justice, the New Jersey State Police, and the United States Attorney's Offices for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the District of New Jersey.\n\nThe charges and allegations are merely accusations, and the defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in court.

Norcross III was charged Monday with operating a racketeering enterprise, threatening people whose properties he sought to take over, and orchestrating tax incentive [...]\n\nTRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Being a political boss in New Jersey ain't what it used to be.\n\nMonday's indictment on racketeering charges of Democratic power broker George E. Norcross III by state Attorney General Matt Platkin caps a series of blows to influential figures in the state's dominant political party and adds to a sense of turbulence in the blue-state stronghold.\n\nThere's the ongoing federal bribery case against Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who's pleaded not guilty in a New York trial that has consistently delivered glimpses of the tawdry underbelly of Garden State politics. There's the fall this year of a century-old, unique-to-New Jersey primary ballot system that allowed party bosses to give preferred placement to endorsed candidates.\n\nAnd now there's the indictment of Norcross, who Platkin said stepped across legal lines in orchestrating tax benefits for entities he controlled. Norcross angrily denied doing anything wrong.\n\nIt all comes months before the November general election, as Democrats look to hold on to a U.S. Senate seat they didn't expect to have to fight for in a year when their thin majority is already in jeopardy. Republicans, meanwhile, have found new reasons to be optimistic about their chances to win a seat they haven't held in more than five decades.\n\nSome New Jersey progressives see the unfolding chaos as part of an overdue cleanup in the messy politics of a state they have long dominated. Other observers draw a parallel to what has happened nationally in the Republican Party, where the power of establishment Republicans has given way to a more chaotic brand of populism espoused by former President Donald Trump and others like him.\n\nThey see it as a dissipation of centralized control all across the political spectrum -- perhaps even a restoration of power to the people.\n\n\"What we're really seeing is pushback against things that people would have gotten away with some time ago,\" Daniel Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll. \"This is basically saying, I think that these parties are out of touch with what voters want, and the energy of the party and both Republican and Democratic Party is very much on the side of the people who are against the institutional party.\"\n\nPlatkin, a Democrat, argued that it's time for the state to leave behind its reputation for ugly politics, a legacy that has been helped along at times in caricature, whether in fictional scenes from \"The Sopranos\" or in the minds of those who embrace it as a badge of honor.\n\n\"It's often said that in New Jersey politics is a blood sport,\" he said Monday. \"What's meant by that is that if you don't go along with the demands of those in political power, you'll get hurt. ... There is nothing inherent in our state's culture that requires us to accept politics and government that functions in this way.\"\n\nNorcross cast Platkin's prosecution of him as politically motivated. He called Platkin a coward and demanded the trial start in two weeks.\n\nHe's charged with operating a criminal enterprise over more than a decade, starting in 2012, in which he threatened property owners whose land he sought to acquire, used Camden city government to acquire land and tailored legislation for tax incentives that benefited companies he controlled. Those allegations have been the subject of investigations for years, with Norcross denying any wrongdoing and praising the good his investments did for the economically hard-up city of Camden, across the Delaware River from Philadelphia.\n\nA longtime kingmaker in southern New Jersey, Norcross often wielded influence through back channels. An old friend of the former Senate president and current gubernatorial candidate Steve Sweeney, Norcross played a key role in getting economic tax incentive legislation passed in 2013. His brothers are lobbyist and co-defendant Philip Norcross -- who's fighting the charges as well -- and Rep. Donald Norcross, a former state legislator.\n\nGeorge Norcross is the wealthy executive of an insurance firm and, until 2021, a Democratic National Committee member who also contributed financially to state and national Democrats. He's since moved to Palm Beach, Florida, where he had been listed before as a member of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.\n\nHe's long been a boogeyman of many progressive New Jersey Democrats, who saw him as enriching himself while poorer residents languished. On Monday, some of them cheered his indictment. Antoinette Mills, who heads the Working Families Party, called on officials to denounce Norcross' behavior. Murphy and other top Democrats have yet to weigh in.\n\nSue Altman, a Democratic candidate in the 7th District and longtime critic of Norcross, viewed the indictment -- along with Menendez's federal trial and the end of the so-called county line -- as part of a year of \"corruption busting\" in the state. Altman was once dragged by state police from a legislative hearing in 2019 at which Norcross was defending himself and the tax credits his organizations received. Her removal by troopers encapsulated his ability to influence lawmakers, she said in an interview.\n\n\"My getting thrown out, I think, ended up distilling that moment. And yes, that was very much on my mind,\" she said. \"I think it represents a new beginning in New Jersey.\"\n\nMenendez's September indictment on charges that he, his wife and three business associates engaged in a scheme in which the senator traded promises to use his office for cash, gold bars and a luxury vehicle, saw his party largely abandon him.\n\nHe declined to run as a Democrat for reelection this year, and filed this month to get on the ballot as an independent. His trial is underway in New York. Republicans, in a minority in state government, cast Menendez as a symptom of what's wrong with the Democratic majority.\n\nMenendez's refusal to heed the advice of fellow Democrats and resign led Rep. Andy Kim to become a Senate candidate last year. When the governor's spouse, first lady Tammy Murphy, looked assured of winning significant county party backing, Kim sued to stop the primary ballot system widely viewed as helping insiders.\n\nTammy Murphy, saying she wanted to avoid a negative campaign among Democrats, dropped out, and a federal judge ordered a temporary halt to the ballot design, bringing New Jersey in line with the rest of the country -- at least for this year.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press",

Norcross III, a formidable and long feared Democratic powerbroker whose influence stretched across the state, has been criminally charged, along with one of his brothers, his personal attorney, the former mayor of Camden and two others Monday on wide-ranging on corruption charges in connection with efforts in connection of the awarding of millions in tax credits in the state's poorest city that enabled him to land millions in lucrative real estate deals.\n\nSources said a 13-count state indictment will be released in Trenton at 1 p.m. and announced by Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin.\n\nIt alleges that Norcross and others obtained property and property rights on the Camden Waterfront while collecting millions of dollars in government-issued tax credits, and controlled or influenced government officials to further the scheme.\n\nNorcross serves as executive chairman of the insurance firm Conner, Strong & Buckelew and chairman of the board of trustees for Cooper Health.\n\nCharged with Norcross were:\n\nAlso charged were Sidney Brown, the CEO of NFI, a trucking and logistics company that benefitted from the the development deals. and John J. O'Donnell, pf The Michaels Organization, a residential development company, who was a partner in the groups that own several of the Camden buildings at the center of the allegations.\n\nThe indictment of Norcross -- a deep-pocketed fundraiser who never ran for elective office but had an outsized role in determining the fates of those who do -- is likely shockwaves through the state's political realm.\n\nWith unquestionable political muscle and a well-oiled political machine able to sway elections from local mayoral contests and the state Legislature to the office of the governor and Capitol Hill, Norcross had been a major player in Jersey politics for decades. Elected officials, from his home base of Camden to counties far to the north, owed their careers to the power and money Norcross wielded to get them elected. His control of a core bloc of legislators put the leadership of the state Legislature in his hands, and his close ties to former Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester, gave him the ability to make or break any piece of legislation -- as the task force into the tax credit programs would later charge.\n\nAt the same time, his power cemented connections that enabled his insurance brokerage business, Conner Strong & Buckelew, to profit from big contracts awarded by municipalities, counties, and public agencies across New Jersey.\n\nNorcross was not shy about using that muscle. Captured on a series of secretly taped recordings conversations, he once boasted about how the game was stacked, in bare-knuckle language that was by turns profane, ruthless and matter-of-fact as he pressured a local councilman -- who unbeknownst to him was cooperating with prosecutors at the time -- to sabotage a political rival. He essentially told the councilman in no uncertain terms that he was the one who called the shots.\n\n\"I'm not going to tell you this to insult you, but in the end, the McGreeveys, the Corzines, they're all going to be with me,\" Norcross could be heard on the tape, talking of then-Gov. James E. McGreevey and Jon Corzine, who at the time had just been elected to the U.S. Senate.\n\n\"Not that they like me,\" Norcross said. \"But because they have no choice.\"\n\nThat probe more than 20 years ago ended without any indictments.", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki",

There are no legal issues with the credits.\n\nNorcross has long been described as a Democratic power broker though he held no public office and never has.\n\nOn NFI's website, the company says it is the country's sixth-largest dedicated carrier and the fourth-largest warehouse provider, and that it has more than 16,000 employees.\n\nA spokesman for the company declined comment.\n\nThe indictment portrays Brown as a member of what prosecutors call \"the Norcross Enterprise\" without being one of its leaders or directly engaging in what the indictment portrays as the often threatening steps some members of the enterprise took that allegedly constitute criminal extortion.\n\nBrown has direct ties to George Norcross through Cooper Health, a South Jersey health system where Norcross is chairman of the Board of Trustees and Brown is a member of the board. Brown also is described in the indictment as a member of the group that ultimately bought not only the Triad1828 Centre but also the Ferry Terminal building and 11 Cooper in Camden.\n\nTriad1828 is described in the indictment as the tallest building on the Camden waterfront. It was constructed between January 2017 and December 2019.\n\nThe 111-page indictment mostly focuses on the interaction between the group led by the Norcross brothers, George in particular, and various state and local officials in redevelopment efforts along the Camden waterfront. The city, directly across the Delaware River from Philadelphia, was once a major manufacturing site that over the years saw such manufacturers as Campbell Soup (NYSE: CPB) and RCA Victor depart for other locations as it sank into poverty and population decline.\n\nThe six people indicted are George and Philip Norcross; Brown; former Camden Mayor Dana Redd; George Norcross' personal attorney, William Tambussi; and John O'Donnell, an executive in an organization that like NFI moved into Triad1828 and who is also described in the indictment as a member of the group that owns some of the Camden real estate that is the focus of the charges.\n\n\"From approximately 2012 to 2013, members and associates of the Norcross Enterprise used their political influence to tailor New Jersey economic development legislation to their preferences,\" the indictment says in one of its opening pages.\n\nWhen the legislation the Norcross group backed became law in 2013, according to the indictment, the Norcross Enterprise -- prosecutors capitalize the name -- \"did extort and coerce others to obtain -- for certain individuals and business entities -- property rights on the Camden, New Jersey waterfront and associated tax incentive credits.\"\n\nBy moving into those properties, various companies associated with George Norcross were able to obtain tax credits that were designed to incentivize redevelopment. Those tax credits could then be sold.\n\nFinancial benefit to NFI totaled $7.866 million through 2023, the amount of Grow New Jersey tax credits that were enabled by the 2013 legislation, according to the indictment. NFI sold those credits for $7.186 million.\n\nBut they aren't done. According to the indictment, the right to earn tax credits under Grow New Jersey extends to 2030. The owners of the developments at the center of the Norcross activities -- including 1828Triad and the residential building known as 11 Cooper -- have $211 million in additional credits to claim.\n\nAccording to the indictment, when the state announced the Grow New Jersey credits to be awarded to various Camden office building tenants in March 2017, it put the size of the credits NFI could expect to earn for its residency at Triad1828 at about $79.3 million.\n\nThe indictment also reveals -- though it has no bearing on issues related to Brown's involvement with Norcross -- that Brown earned about $60 million from NFI between 2012 and 2023.\n\nThe indictment obtained recorded direct conversations, strongly suggesting somebody in the Norcross universe has been cooperating for some time with New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin, who brought the indictment. He announced it at a press conference Monday that featured the odd sight of Norcross sitting in the front row of the audience before holding court with the media afterward.\n\nOne recorded conversation, according to the indictment, features George Norcross telling a recalcitrant unnamed developer who resisted giving up development rights he owned on the river that he would \"f -- you up like you've never been f -- - before.\" In another recording, Norcross refers to the developer as a \"putz.\"\n\nThe reaction to the Norcross indictment in the New York/New Jersey area was enormous, given the power he has been long known to wield in South New Jersey and by extension the state as a whole.\n\nAs Politico wrote of the indictment: \"New Jersey political insiders struggled to come up with big enough words to describe what they were hearing: The state attorney general was about to indict South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross, one of the most formidable and fearsome operators in state history, on corruption charges.\"\n\nThe fact that Brown was not as central to the activities that are the subject of the indictment can be seen partly in the fact that while there are 13 counts in the indictment, Brown is named in only eight of them.\n\nBut the charges are serious. For example, in count one, all the defendants are charged with racketeering. All are charged with being part of the \"Norcross Enterprise,\" which the indictment says was \"an ongoing organization whose members and associates function as a continuing unit for the common purpose of achieving the objectives of the Enterprise.\"\n\nAnd while there are no quotes in the indictment from Brown quite as stark as Norcross' threats, it does show Brown as being actively involved in the effort to get that unnamed developer to give up his development rights.\n\nIn a recorded October 2016 call to discuss the holdout developer -- a call during which Norcross said Camden should \"condemn his ass and just move on\" -- Brown said of the plan the group was coming up with, \"A couple of good things would come out of this. It puts pressure on [the developer] to come to the table. He hasn't had any pressure up to this point.\"\n\nBrown then mentions the alleged work of fellow defendant Tambussi to work with government agencies to pressure the developer and says of the plan, \"[It] seems we should proceed and go ahead and let Bill get this thing done.\"\n\nThe other indictments against Brown are:\n\nNorcross also had an indirect trucking tie besides his links to Brown: He is seen as close to Steve Sweeney, the Democrat who was longtime president of the state's Senate and a major power broker in the Garden State. Sweeney was defeated by Raymour & Flanagan truck driver Edward Durr in 2021 in a shocking upset. Durr was defeated for reelection last November; both he and Sweeney are running for governor in the 2025 election, Durr as a Republican and Sweeney as a Democrat.\n\nS&P cuts Forward Air debt rating again; 3 key agencies now at same low level", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

As the company's executive chairman, Norcross has been paid handsomely for the business' success, taking home $29 million in salary from the company between 2012 and 2023, according to the indictment.\n\nMeanwhile, Cooper University Health Care -- the Camden-based hospital network for which Norcross serves as board chairman -- won $27 million in tax credits between 2016 and 2022, which it has sold for $25 million. Those sales, according to the indictment, have allowed it to fully cover the annual $3.8 million rental cost for its headquarters at the 575,000-square-foot office complex on Federal Street known as L3.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Norcross and his allies strong-armed a local nonprofit out of a deal to buy the building in 2013, steering the sale instead to an investor group they preferred. Cooper Health later gained a 49% ownership stake in the building, entitling it to nearly half the profits earned from its other tenants.\n\nLikewise, after allegedly muscling Philadelphia developer Carl Dranoff out of development rights to another parcel on Cooper Street in Camden, Norcross and other investors went on to build the apartment complex 11 Cooper there. The complex received $3.5 million in tax credits between 2022 and 2023 and sold them for $4.3 million.\n\nNorcross has stressed that for as much money he's taken in from his business dealings in Camden, he and his business partners have invested significantly in the city, pumping more than $300 million into development there.\n\nPhilip Norcross' alleged role in the criminal enterprise\n\nIf George Norcross sat atop what prosecutors are calling the \"the Norcross Enterprise\" -- the alleged racketeering operation at the heart of their case -- his brother Philip served as its fixer.\n\nPhilip Norcross, CEO of the Mount Laurel law firm Parker McCay, is referenced throughout the indictment conveying his brother's demands to rivals and meeting with local government officials to ensure George Norcross' interests remained protected.\n\n\"I try to practice as little law as possible ... just for laughs and giggles,\" he told a group of allies in a September 2013 meeting quoted in the indictment. \"My siblings and I get around ... the table and decide what George's agenda is in Camden.\"\n\nPhilip Norcross and his law firm played a central role in shaping the 2013 tax credit legislation that set off the development boom along Camden's waterfront that forms the backdrop for prosecutors' case. Working with another Norcross ally, then-Senate President Stephen Sweeney, prosecutors say, he sent over line-item revisions to the tax credit bill that were later adopted as part of the law.\n\nOnce that tax incentive program was approved and the Norcrosses began eyeing waterfront property for development, it was Philip Norcross who, according to the indictment, muscled the CEO of the community development nonprofit Cooper's Ferry out of the deal to buy the L3 building that now serves as headquarters to Cooper Health.\n\nThough Philip Norcross had no financial stake in the property and no role at Cooper's Ferry, Camden City officials repeatedly instructed the nonprofit's then-CEO Anthony Perno to \"meet with Philip\" and to follow his instructions about the land deal, the indictment says.\n\nPhilip Norcross pushed Perno to abandon a developer Cooper's Ferry had earlier lined up and partner instead with two other investors, preferred by George Norcross, instead. If Perno refused, the indictment alleges, it was made clear to him that Cooper's Ferry would \"suffer repercussions.\"\n\nPerno eventually acceded to Philip Norcross' demands and sided with the Norcrosses' preferred partners. Then in 2014 Cooper's Ferry sold its rights to the L3 development for a net $125,000, far less than the millions it had expected to earn from the more actively involved ownership of the building it had originally envisioned.\n\nWhen years later, George Norcross found himself at odds with Dranoff, the Philadelphia developer, over another parcel of land along the waterfront, Philip Norcross helped him achieve his desired outcome there, too.\n\nAt the time, Dranoff was hoping to sell the Victor Building, a luxury apartment complex he helped develop in 2003, but needed Camden City officials to agree to transfer a beneficial tax arrangement he'd enjoyed during his ownership to the potential buyers.\n\nPhilip Norcross urged city officials to \"slow down\" approving the transfer and met regularly with elected officials and other \"stakeholders\" about the issue, according to the indictment, even though he didn't have any formal role with the city or financial or legal interest in Dranoff's building. They did not grant Dranoff the approvals he needed, and ultimately, his deal to sell the Victor fell through.\n\nThe indictment also accuses Philip Norcross of plotting with his brother and others to have the Camden Redevelopment Agency condemn another nearby property Dranoff owned to force him to accede to other demands.\n\nPhilip Norcross' lawyer, Kevin Marino, has denied his client did anything improper.\n\n\"What is in this indictment that is outside the lines of appropriate negotiations?\" Marino said in an interview Tuesday. He added: \"I've never seen a thinner indictment. I have never seen a set of allegations that I feel more confident should never have been brought.\"\n\nNorcross and his allies misled the media and a judge, prosecutors say\n\nTo cover up their conduct, the indictment says, Norcross and his allies routinely made false or misleading statements to the media and the courts.\n\nAs news outlets including ProPublica and The Inquirer began writing articles in 2019 about the pressure the Norcrosses exerted on Cooper's Ferry during the L3 deal, Norcross' spokespeople pushed back with a number of claims prosecutors now characterized as false, including that the nonprofit wasn't capable of purchasing the building.\n\nIn fact, the indictment says, Cooper's Ferry had \"an agreement in principle\" with a well-known developer to complete the transaction.\n\nIn another instance, Norcross lawyer William Tambussi, who was also charged in Monday's indictment, allegedly misled a Superior Court judge about the role the Norcross brothers had played in a push to pressure Dranoff to give up an easement he held protecting the views from his Victor Building apartment complex.\n\nThe indictment accuses the Norcrosses of using threats, intimidation and their control over Camden City government to effectively force Dranoff sell the easement rights in 2016 for less than he thought they were worth.\n\nDranoff later sued the City of Camden over his continued frustrations with his efforts to do business in the city. As the case neared trial last fall, Dranoff sought to introduce evidence that his difficulties in Camden dated back to that 2016 dispute with the Norcross team over the easement rights.\n\nBut Tambussi -- a longtime Norcross lawyer who represented the city in the litigation with Dranoff -- sought to block Dranoff from mentioning either George or Philip Norcross at the trial, arguing that they weren't relevant to the deal and that Dranoff's negotiations over the easement had occurred with another developer.\n\nProsecutors maintained Monday that, in fact, Dranoff's negotiations with that developer had been consummated at the insistence of the Norcrosses and their other business partners.\n\nTambussi on Monday said he was proud of his legal work for Camden and \"astounded\" by the charges.\n\nThe Norcrosses helped Camden's mayor land a new job\n\nThe indictment portrays former Camden Mayor Dana Redd, who was also charged Monday along with Norcross and his brother, as a willing ally of their development plans in the city. When she left office in 2018, they allegedly helped her land a lucrative job as CEO of the Rowan University/ Rutgers-Camden Board of Governors.\n\nBut that required moving others out the way. The indictment details a complicated game of musical chairs that culminated in Redd securing the position, which came with a $275,000 annual salary -- a significant pay bump over the $102,000-a-year she was paid as mayor.\n\nBut first, her predecessor in the role, Kris Kolluri, had to be set up with another job. According to the indictment, Norcross and his allies had the perfect position in mind -- Perno's job at Cooper's Ferry following his falling out with Norcross over the L3 deal.\n\nIn late 2017 -- as Redd's term as mayor neared its end -- one of Cooper's Ferry's cochairs, former Cherry Hill Mayor Susan Bass Levin, told Perno he needed to leave his $242,000-a-year job as the nonprofit's CEO so that Kolluri could step into the role instead, prosecutors said.\n\nShe warned him, according to the indictment, that if he resisted, \"they\" would just make up something about him and use it as grounds to fire him. In late 2017, Perno asked whether Cooper's Ferry would agree to restructure his severance package to better compensate him for the cost of leaving. But Levin told Perno that wouldn't work either.\n\n\"It doesn't give me cover with George,\" she said in a secretly recorded conversation with the nonprofit CEO quoted in the indictment. \"You can't go there. You don't want that fight. ... If you don't think he can't get to anybody he wants to, you're kidding yourself.\"\n\nEventually, Perno agreed to resign as CEO. Kolluri moved into his old job, vacating his spot as CEO of the Rowan University/Rutgers-Camden Board of Governors, and Redd moved into that position.\n\nIn 2022, she was named CEO of Camden Community Partnership, the name under which Cooper's Ferry rebranded itself in 2021.\n\nNeither Levin nor Redd's attorney, Henry Klingeman, has responded to requests for comment.\n\n'New Jersey politics is a blood sport'\n\nWhile unveiling the indictment at a news conference Monday, Platkin described New Jersey politics as a \"blood sport.\" It didn't take long for that observation to be borne out.\n\nTypically, high-profile criminal defendants speak through their attorneys and reserve their sharpest barbs for the courtroom. Norcross, however, stared down Platkin from a seat in the front row of the news conference.\n\nAfterward, he publicly attacked Platkin in deeply personal terms, calling him a \"coward\" and a \"politician masquerading as an attorney general.\" Norcross referenced a messy 2018 scandal in which Platkin's handling of rape allegations involving a staffer on Gov. Phil Murphy 's 2017 campaign drew criticism from a state Senate committee full of Norcross allies.\n\nAt the time, Platkin was serving as chief counsel to Murphy's administration. The Senate committee concluded that the governor's office had \"seriously mishandled\" the sexual misconduct complaints from its former campaign employee. It specifically blasted Platkin for \"sloppy\" legal decisions and questioned the credibility of his testimony before the committee. The incident arose again during Platkin's 2022 confirmation hearings for the attorney general post.\n\nThe episode had left Platkin \"humiliated,\" Norcross insisted Monday, and seeking political revenge.\n\nAs Norcross and his lawyers see it, Monday's indictment is the culmination of years of bad blood between him and the attorney general -- a feud further fueled by the role Platkin, while still working for Murphy's administration, played in a 2019 task force that questioned the propriety of millions of dollars in state tax breaks awarded to several companies linked to Norcross.\n\nDespite the headlines generated by the task force's work, its efforts to rescind those tax credits have been shot down in court. Norcross and his lawyers dismissed Monday's indictment as little more than a warmed-over version of the task force's already stale allegations.\n\n\"Now, I'm sending a message to Matt Platkin,\" defense attorney Michael Critchley told a crowd of reporters Monday afternoon. \"Buckle up.\"\n\n\u00a92024 The Philadelphia Inquirer.

(AP) - Being a political boss in New Jersey ain't what it used to be.\n\nMonday's indictment on racketeering charges of Democratic power broker George E. Norcross III by state Attorney General Matt Platkin caps a series of blows to influential figures in the state's dominant political party and adds to a sense of turbulence in the blue-state stronghold.\n\nThere's the ongoing federal bribery case against Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who's pleaded not guilty in a New York trial that has consistently delivered glimpses of the tawdry underbelly of Garden State politics. There's the fall this year of a century-old, unique-to-New Jersey primary ballot system that allowed party bosses to give preferred placement to endorsed candidates.\n\nAnd now there's the indictment of Norcross, who Platkin said stepped across legal lines in orchestrating tax benefits for entities he controlled. Norcross angrily denied doing anything wrong.\n\nIt all comes months before the November general election, as Democrats look to hold on to a U.S. Senate seat they didn't expect to have to fight for in a year when their thin majority is already in jeopardy. Republicans, meanwhile, have found new reasons to be optimistic about their chances to win a seat they haven't held in more than five decades.\n\nSome New Jersey progressives see the unfolding chaos as part of an overdue cleanup in the messy politics of a state they have long dominated. Other observers draw a parallel to what has happened nationally in the Republican Party, where the power of establishment Republicans has given way to a more chaotic brand of populism espoused by former President Donald Trump and others like him.\n\nGeorge Norcross III sits in the front row before an announcement by the New Jersey Attorney General, Matthew Platkin charging him on racketeering charges on Monday, June 17, 2024 in Trenton, N.J. Norcross III was charged Monday with operating a racketeering enterprise, threatening people whose properties he sought to take over, and orchestrating tax incentive legislation to benefit organizations he controlled. (Jose F. Moreno/The Philadelphia Inquirer via AP)\n\nThey see it as a dissipation of centralized control all across the political spectrum - perhaps even a restoration of power to the people.\n\n\"What we\u00b4re really seeing is pushback against things that people would have gotten away with some time ago,\" Daniel Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll. \"This is basically saying, I think that these parties are out of touch with what voters want, and the energy of the party and both Republican and Democratic Party is very much on the side of the people who are against the institutional party.\"\n\nPlatkin, a Democrat, argued that it's time for the state to leave behind its reputation for ugly politics, a legacy that has been helped along at times in caricature, whether in fictional scenes from \"The Sopranos\" or in the minds of those who embrace it as a badge of honor.\n\n\"It\u00b4s often said that in New Jersey politics is a blood sport,\" he said Monday. \"What\u00b4s meant by that is that if you don\u00b4t go along with the demands of those in political power, you\u00b4ll get hurt. ... There is nothing inherent in our state\u00b4s culture that requires us to accept politics and government that functions in this way.\"\n\nNorcross cast Platkin's prosecution of him as politically motivated. He called Platkin a coward and demanded the trial start in two weeks.\n\nHe's charged with operating a criminal enterprise over more than a decade, starting in 2012, in which he threatened property owners whose land he sought to acquire, used Camden city government to acquire land and tailored legislation for tax incentives that benefited companies he controlled. Those allegations have been the subject of investigations for years, with Norcross denying any wrongdoing and praising the good his investments did for the economically hard-up city of Camden, across the Delaware River from Philadelphia.\n\nA longtime kingmaker in southern New Jersey, Norcross often wielded influence through back channels. An old friend of the former Senate president and current gubernatorial candidate Steve Sweeney, Norcross played a key role in getting economic tax incentive legislation passed in 2013. His brothers are lobbyist and co-defendant Philip Norcross - who's fighting the charges as well - and Rep. Donald Norcross, a former state legislator.\n\nGeorge Norcross is the wealthy executive of an insurance firm and, until 2021, a Democratic National Committee member who also contributed financially to state and national Democrats. He's since moved to Palm Beach, Florida, where he had been listed before as a member of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.\n\nHe's long been a boogeyman of many progressive New Jersey Democrats, who saw him as enriching himself while poorer residents languished. On Monday, some of them cheered his indictment. Antoinette Mills, who heads the Working Families Party, called on officials to denounce Norcross' behavior. Murphy and other top Democrats have yet to weigh in.\n\nSue Altman, a Democratic candidate in the 7th District and longtime critic of Norcross, viewed the indictment - along with Menendez's federal trial and the end of the so-called county line - as part of a year of \"corruption busting\" in the state. Altman was once dragged by state police from a legislative hearing in 2019 at which Norcross was defending himself and the tax credits his organizations received. Her removal by troopers encapsulated his ability to influence lawmakers, she said in an interview.\n\n\"My getting thrown out, I think, ended up distilling that moment. And yes, that was very much on my mind,\" she said. \"I think it represents a new beginning in New Jersey.\"\n\nMenendez's September indictment on charges that he, his wife and three business associates engaged in a scheme in which the senator traded promises to use his office for cash, gold bars and a luxury vehicle, saw his party largely abandon him.\n\nHe declined to run as a Democrat for reelection this year, and filed this month to get on the ballot as an independent. His trial is underway in New York. Republicans, in a minority in state government, cast Menendez as a symptom of what's wrong with the Democratic majority.\n\nMenendez's refusal to heed the advice of fellow Democrats and resign led Rep. Andy Kim to become a Senate candidate last year. When the governor's spouse, first lady Tammy Murphy, looked assured of winning significant county party backing, Kim sued to stop the primary ballot system widely viewed as helping insiders.\n\nTammy Murphy, saying she wanted to avoid a negative campaign among Democrats, dropped out, and a federal judge ordered a temporary halt to the ballot design, bringing New Jersey in line with the rest of the country - at least for this year.\n\nGeorge Norcross, exits the room minutes after New Jersey Attorney General, Matthew Platkin's racketeering announcement on Monday, June 17, 2024 in Trenton, N.J.

Donald Norcross was hit with 13 criminal counts tied to a sweeping scheme to take financial and political advantage of the lucrative redevelopment of the Camden waterfront.\n\n\"The Norcross enterprise manipulated government programs and processes designed to attract development and investment to instead suit their own financial desires,\" New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin said. \"Instead of contributing to the successes of the city ... the Norcross enterprise took the Camden waterfront all for themselves.\"\n\nNorcross, who has controlled the vote-spinning South Jersey Democratic machine for three decades, was charged along his lobbyist brother, Phillip and several other cronies.\n\nThey're charged with bullying a developer into relinquishing a prime waterfront site with threats of political retaliation and engineering a lucrative tax-credit scheme to benefit his associates.\n\n\"(Norcross) threatened the developer that he would ... 'f -- you up like you've never been f -- ed up before,\" the indictment says. \"(He) told the developer he would make sure the developer never did business in Camden again.\"\n\nThe developer wound up selling the site for $18 million to a Norcross pal who wound up pocketing $240 million in tax credits, the indictment says.\n\nGeorge Norcross sat in the front row of Platkin's press conference announcing the indictment. His lawyer tried to ask the state's top lawman a question but Platkin left without answering.\n\nNorcross, a former Democratic National Committee member and one-time head of the Camden County Democratic Party, has faced legal scrutiny for years but has never been charged by state or federal prosecutors.\n\nThe South Jersey machine headed by Norcross was once one of the most powerful political operations in the nation.\n\nIts power has waned in recent years as New Jersey has become more of a solidly blue state, meaning its power to deliver votes has become less important to swinging statewide elections.\n\nOnetime Democratic Rep. Jeff Van Drew also dealt a blow to the organization by crossing the aisle to become a Republican in 2020.\n\nThe indictment makes Norcross the latest Garden State Democrat to face criminal charges.\n\nSen. Robert Menendez is currently on trial for his role in a federal bribery and influence-peddling scheme.\n\nThe aftermath of Menendez's legal troubles has also weakened the Democratic machine. Rep. Andy Kim, a reform-minded suburban lawmaker, looks poised to succeed Menendez and convinced a federal judge to toss out the so-called \"county line\" ballot system, which gave county bosses the power to give favored candidates prime spots on primary ballots.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_goldiner@nydailynews.com",

Norcross III has spent the better part of the last two decades on the radar of state and federal authorities, who despite launching multiple investigations into his business dealings have never brought charges against him.\n\nThat changed this week as New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin unveiled a sprawling racketeering indictment against the South Jersey power broker and five allies. Within the 13-count indictment are signs of the years of earlier investigations that preceded it.\n\nPeppered throughout the charging documents are nearly a dozen references to contemporaneous recordings of phone calls and meetings in which Norcross and others discussed the real estate deals at the heart of the case. The tapes referenced in the indictment date as far back as 2013 - well before Platkin's investigation began - and continue through periods of time in which other earlier investigations of Norcross were occurring.\n\nIn one of them - a recorded 2016 phone call - Norcross admits to threatening Philadelphia real estate developer Carl Dranoff, with whom he was feuding at the time, the indictment says.\n\n\"He said, 'Are you threatening me?' \" Norcross reportedly told a confidante on the call, as he recalled a conversation with Dranoff. \"I said, 'Absolutely.' \"\n\nSome of the recordings described in the indictment were made during the same period the FBI was tapping Norcross' phones in an unrelated investigation into Philadelphia labor leader John J. Dougherty. The Inquirer has previously reported agents were listening in on Norcross' phone calls from July through late August 2016, then picked up again in October for about a month. Norcross wasn't charged or accused of any wrongdoing in that investigation.\n\nMonday's indictment also described a previously undisclosed FBI interview with Norcross in 2016 in which he discussed a Camden nonprofit that prosecutors now say was the victim of the power broker's extortion.\n\nHow many recordings of Norcross and his allies investigators have obtained remains unclear, as does who made them and where exactly they came from. During his news conference announcing the indictment Monday, Platkin credited the U.S. Attorney's Offices in Philadelphia and New Jersey for earlier work that contributed to his investigation.\n\nThe tapes could raise the stakes if the case against Norcross heads to trial.\n\n\"I can tell you that there is nothing more powerful in a criminal prosecution than hearing a tape recording,\" said Ed Stier, a former state and federal prosecutor who served as director of the New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice. \"You can't cross examine it.\"\n\nBut to Norcross, Platkin's use of recordings seemingly made during other investigations that went nowhere is a sign that the case is light on evidence and brought by an attorney general fueled by political ambition.\n\nDuring an interview Tuesday, Michael Critchley, an attorney for Norcross, dismissed the recordings as \"antiquated material\" that has \"been in the government's possession for almost a decade by multiple law enforcement agencies.\"\n\nHe also suggested some of the recordings may have captured conversations involving Norcross and his attorneys - raising the possibility that his defense team could argue the government violated attorney-client privelege.\n\n\"They looked at these recordings, they examined these records and found no wrongdoing,\" Critchley said, noting that prior investigations didn't result in charges. \"Those recordings amount to nothing based upon the fact that law enforcement agencies that previously reviewed it did nothing. So from nothing comes nothing.\"\n\n'Enormous consequences'\n\nAmong the earliest recordings of Norcross mentioned in the indictment is one from August 2016.\n\nAt the time, Norcross was working with Malvern-based real estate investment firm Liberty Property Trust to acquire parcels of land and property rights to build the office tower for his insurance brokerage and other partners, including logistics company NFI and development firm The Michaels Organization. Norcross and executives at those companies, who were charged alongside Norcross on Monday, also hoped to partner on a proposed residential project nearby.\n\nBut they faced several obstacles, chief among them Dranoff, who held property and development rights to several parcels on the waterfront. Years earlier, Dranoff had developed the Victor Building, the first market-rate apartment complex in Camden in decades, and was granted what is known as a view easement that protected its views of the Philadelphia skyline.\n\nThat limited how high other developers - including Norcross' investor group - could build in the surrounding area. For months, Dranoff had been negotiating with Liberty Property Trust over selling his view easement to make way for the development Norcross envisioned.\n\nThose talks were dragging on, and Norcross' group couldn't yet apply for state tax credits under the Economic Opportunity Act that would make the deal financially viable. (Prosecutors say the 2013 law that created those tax breaks was shaped by Norcross and his brother, Philip, as part of their criminal enterprise.)\n\nAccording to the indictment, on Aug. 22, 2016, George Norcross told Liberty CEO William P. Hankowsky that it would be a \"bad thing for the city\" if Norcross had to walk away from the project, and it would be \"humiliating for me.\"\n\n\"That's why I'm so irritated by [Dranoff's] crap,\" Norcross said, in a recorded conversation quoted in the prosecutors' court filing.\n\nFrustrated by the lack of progress, on Oct. 20, 2016, the indictment says, Norcross threatened Dranoff, warning that there would be \"consequences\" if he didn't relent.\n\nThe next day, Norcross recounted that conversation to a confidante during another recorded conversation highlighted in Monday's indictment.\n\n\"I said, '[Dranoff], this is unacceptable. If you do this, it will have enormous consequences,'\" Norcross said, according to the filing.\n\n'Condemn his ass'\n\nThe most detailed recorded conversations referenced in the indictment involved a purported plan to use the Camden Redevelopment Agency - a government entity represented by the law firm of Norcross ally William Tambussi, who was also charged Monday - to attack Dranoff by condemning his view easement.\n\nOn Oct. 21, 2016, a day after the indictment says Norcross told a friend he'd warned Dranoff of \"enormous consequences\" for refusing to agree to a deal on his property rights, an agreement emerged and was memorialized in an email, according to the indictment.\n\nBut it fell apart later that same day. In a recorded conversation, Norcross spoke with his brother Philip and mentioned the plan involving the redevelopment agency and Tambussi: \"I just talked to Tambussi. ... I want to go in. I want to encourage Tambussi to do his thing ... I think we just do it. F - 'em. F - 'em. Just do it.\"\n\nThe next day, Norcross convened a conference call with Philip Norcross, Tambussi, and his partners on the office project, Sidney Brown, CEO of NFI, and John J. O'Donnell, an executive at The Michaels Organization.\n\n\"I don't even know why we're dealing with [Dranoff] ... [T]he city ought to condemn his ass and just move on,\" George Norcross is quoted as saying in the indictment's recounting of the recorded conversation.\n\n\"He's gonna come under some very serious accusations from the City of Camden which are gonna basically suggest that he's not a reputable person, and he's done nothing but try to impede the progress of the city,\" Norcross continued. \"You can never trust him until you got a bat over his head.\"\n\nTambussi noted on the call that if a court authorized the city's condemnation of Dranoff's view easement, the value of his property rights would come \"down to virtually nothing\" - benefiting the Norcross group's negotiating position, the indictment says.\n\nOn multiple occasions during the call, Brown asked questions clarifying the purpose of using the Camden Redevelopment Agency to go after Dranoff.\n\n\"Let me just make sure, is the goal here really to try and put some pressure on [Dranoff] to sign what we just tried to get signed?\" he asked the others at one point.\n\nGeorge Norcross responded: \"Of course. Either that or condemn it, so we can move expeditiously ...\"\n\nHe also floated another point of attack on Dranoff, who he referred to as a \"putz\": The city could revoke an option he held to redevelop another parcel nearby, a vacant property known as Radio Lofts. Philip Norcross chimed in that Tambussi's condemnation plan offered the best chance to \"kill\" the view easement.\n\nThe indictment doesn't indicate who recorded the men hatching those plans. The conversation does overlap with the period the FBI was wiretapping Norcross' phone as part of the Dougherty investigation.\n\nUltimately Norcross and the others didn't follow through with their condemnation idea. Liberty declined to cooperate, the indictment says, and instead offered to pay Dranoff more out of its own end of the deal.\n\nOn Oct. 24 - the same day the Norcross group had planned to have the CRA go after Dranoff in court - Dranoff agreed to sell his view easement for $1.95 million, below what he thought it was worth, as well as other property rights, prosecutors say. That would clear the way for the Norcross group's office tower, known as Triad1828 Centre, and the 11 Cooper apartment complex.\n\n'Kidding yourself'\n\nOther people in Norcross' orbit were secretly recorded as well, including as far back as 2013, in the aftermath of the passage of the tax-incentive legislation.\n\nPhilip Norcross was recorded telling acquaintances in a September 2013 meeting that he practices \"as little law as possible\" and instead focuses on \"George's agenda in Camden,\" according to the indictment.\n\nFour years later, when George Norcross wanted to install a political ally at the helm of the nonprofit Cooper's Ferry, his associates advised the organization's chief executive to resign.\n\nSusan Bass Levin, a former Cherry Hill mayor installed as the nonprofit's cochair by Norcross and his allies, told CEO Anthony Perno that nothing could stop George Norcross from getting what he wanted, the indictment says. Levin isn't mentioned in the indictment by name, but she fits the description of a person identified in the charging document as \"CC-1,\" who prosecutors say was the CEO of Cooper Health's philanthropic arm, the Cooper Foundation.\n\nPerno left the nonprofit in 2017.\n\n\"If you don't think [Norcross] can't get to anybody he wants to,\" Levin told Perno in a recorded conversation recorded shortly before his decision to resign, \"you're kidding yourself.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News&Observer"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

(AP) -- Being a political boss in New Jersey ain't what it used to be.\n\nMonday's indictment on racketeering charges of Democratic power broker George E. Norcross III by state Attorney General Matt Platkin caps a series of blows to influential figures in the state's dominant political party and adds to a sense of turbulence in the blue-state stronghold.\n\nThere's the ongoing federal bribery case against Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who's pleaded not guilty in a New York trial that has consistently delivered glimpses of the tawdry underbelly of Garden State politics. There's the fall this year of a century-old, unique-to-New Jersey primary ballot system that allowed party bosses to give preferred placement to endorsed candidates.\n\nAnd now there's the indictment of Norcross, who Platkin said stepped across legal lines in orchestrating tax benefits for entities he controlled. Norcross angrily denied doing anything wrong.\n\nIt all comes months before the November general election, as Democrats look to hold on to a U.S. Senate seat they didn't expect to have to fight for in a year when their thin majority is already in jeopardy. Republicans, meanwhile, have found new reasons to be optimistic about their chances to win a seat they haven't held in more than five decades.\n\nSome New Jersey progressives see the unfolding chaos as part of an overdue cleanup in the messy politics of a state they have long dominated. Other observers draw a parallel to what has happened nationally in the Republican Party, where the power of establishment Republicans has given way to a more chaotic brand of populism espoused by former President Donald Trump and others like him.\n\nThey see it as a dissipation of centralized control all across the political spectrum -- perhaps even a restoration of power to the people.\n\n\"What we're really seeing is pushback against things that people would have gotten away with some time ago,\" Daniel Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll. \"This is basically saying, I think that these parties are out of touch with what voters want, and the energy of the party and both Republican and Democratic Party is very much on the side of the people who are against the institutional party.\"\n\nPlatkin, a Democrat, argued that it's time for the state to leave behind its reputation for ugly politics, a legacy that has been helped along at times in caricature, whether in fictional scenes from \"The Sopranos\" or in the minds of those who embrace it as a badge of honor.\n\n\"It's often said that in New Jersey politics is a blood sport,\" he said Monday. \"What's meant by that is that if you don't go along with the demands of those in political power, you'll get hurt. ... There is nothing inherent in our state's culture that requires us to accept politics and government that functions in this way.\"\n\nNorcross cast Platkin's prosecution of him as politically motivated. He called Platkin a coward and demanded the trial start in two weeks.\n\nHe's charged with operating a criminal enterprise over more than a decade, starting in 2012, in which he threatened property owners whose land he sought to acquire, used Camden city government to acquire land and tailored legislation for tax incentives that benefited companies he controlled. Those allegations have been the subject of investigations for years, with Norcross denying any wrongdoing and praising the good his investments did for the economically hard-up city of Camden, across the Delaware River from Philadelphia.\n\nA longtime kingmaker in southern New Jersey, Norcross often wielded influence through back channels. An old friend of the former Senate president and current gubernatorial candidate Steve Sweeney, Norcross played a key role in getting economic tax incentive legislation passed in 2013. His brothers are lobbyist and co-defendant Philip Norcross -- who's fighting the charges as well -- and Rep. Donald Norcross, a former state legislator.\n\nGeorge Norcross is the wealthy executive of an insurance firm and, until 2021, a Democratic National Committee member who also contributed financially to state and national Democrats. He's since moved to Palm Beach, Florida, where he had been listed before as a member of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.\n\nHe's long been a boogeyman of many progressive New Jersey Democrats, who saw him as enriching himself while poorer residents languished. On Monday, some of them cheered his indictment. Antoinette Mills, who heads the Working Families Party, called on officials to denounce Norcross' behavior. Murphy and other top Democrats have yet to weigh in.\n\nSue Altman, a Democratic candidate in the 7th District and longtime critic of Norcross, viewed the indictment -- along with Menendez's federal trial and the end of the so-called county line -- as part of a year of \"corruption busting\" in the state. Altman was once dragged by state police from a legislative hearing in 2019 at which Norcross was defending himself and the tax credits his organizations received. Her removal by troopers encapsulated his ability to influence lawmakers, she said in an interview.\n\n\"My getting thrown out, I think, ended up distilling that moment. And yes, that was very much on my mind,\" she said. \"I think it represents a new beginning in New Jersey.\"\n\nMenendez's September indictment on charges that he, his wife and three business associates engaged in a scheme in which the senator traded promises to use his office for cash, gold bars and a luxury vehicle, saw his party largely abandon him.\n\nHe declined to run as a Democrat for reelection this year, and filed this month to get on the ballot as an independent. His trial is underway in New York. Republicans, in a minority in state government, cast Menendez as a symptom of what's wrong with the Democratic majority.\n\nMenendez's refusal to heed the advice of fellow Democrats and resign led Rep. Andy Kim to become a Senate candidate last year. When the governor's spouse, first lady Tammy Murphy, looked assured of winning significant county party backing, Kim sued to stop the primary ballot system widely viewed as helping insiders.\n\nTammy Murphy, saying she wanted to avoid a negative campaign among Democrats, dropped out, and a federal judge ordered a temporary halt to the ballot design, bringing New Jersey in line with the rest of the country -- at least for this year.", "source": {"uri": "wboc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBOC TV-16"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wboc.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

Hughes Center for Public Policy with Stockton University, said.\n\nThe indictment of Norcross sent shockwaves through New Jersey. While Norcross has never held elected office, Zappile said he served as the power broker in South Jersey politics for the last five decades.\n\n\"Wielding influence to legislation including both Democratic and Republican governors,\" Zappile said. \"Being able to wield influence to select who runs for the party.\"\n\nNorcross was the former chair of the Camden County Democratic Party and a member of the Democratic National Committee until 2021. But Zappile says his biggest impact may have been his ability to raise the political profile of South Jersey.\n\n\"For better and for worse, he was able to influence Trenton in a way that a lot of other politicians and major economic figures in South Jersey have been unable to do,\" Zappile said.\n\nOn Monday, Norcross and five others, including his brother Philip and former Camden Mayor Dana Redd, were hit with racketeering and other charges.\n\nNew Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin said Norcross led the group and alleged he used coercion and extortion to acquire property and property rights along the Camden Waterfront to take advantage of state tax credits he helped pass.\n\nBut the Norcross case is just the latest in what experts believe is a reckoning on state political establishments.\n\n\"There appears, in general, to be a growing wave of intolerance of the old way of getting things done in New Jersey politics,\" Zappile said.\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, who's held his seat since 2006, is in the middle of a federal corruption trial.\n\nCongressman Andy Kim earlier this year successfully challenged the state's longtime \"county-line\" ballots, which gave county officials sway over where candidates were positioned on ballots.\n\nZappile said this all points to a changing political landscape in the Garden State.\n\n\"There could be a little bit of a scramble or vacuum for power,\" Zappile said. \"Somebody's gotta fill that, so there is opportunity.\"\n\nBoth Norcross and Menendez have proclaimed their innocence in their cases.\n\nSome Camden residents cheered about the racketeering charges brought against Norcross. About a dozen residents gathered in front of City Hall and said the influential figure has for too long held power over their local leaders.\n\n\"I believe that Camden residents are finally saying out loud that we're not the ones that are crazy, you all are the ones that are corrupt,\" said Ronsha Dickerson, who is a local activist and Camden resident.\n\nOn Tuesday, current Camden Mayor Vic Carstarphen tried to distance the current administration from those past allegations.\n\n\"Everyone has their opinions,\" Carstarphen said. \"And whatever the opinions people have, I'm telling you, that doesn't resemble what we're doing every day.\"\n\nHowever, Carstarphen acknowledged Norcross had some positive impact on the city.\n\n\"A lot of the renaissance is here from people that cared about Camden, like him,\" Carstarphen said.\n\nResidents acknowledged those contributions but said they're limited to the waterfront and only served to benefit Norcross -- not the city at large.\n\n\"I'm not seeing that same kind of rising where I live,\" Dickerson said. \"I don't see the manicured lawns. I don't see great streetlights. I don't see opportunities for jobs and better income.\"\n\nResidents said this indictment should serve as a warning to others inside city hall that change is coming.\n\n\"If anybody inside this building is part of the corruption that's been going on for 20 years, you need to pack your bags and resign,\" Dickerson said.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Jersey"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norcross,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeering", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Racketeering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockton_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stockton University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Hughes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William J.

A look at the indicted South Jersey powerbroker", "body": "Norcross, 68, was charged Monday along with five allies in a state racketeering indictment.\n\nSouth Jersey Democratic boss George E. Norcross III has never been elected to anything, but he's salted dozens of municipal governments with loyalists of his political organization and amassed influence in the backrooms of Trenton and the marbled halls of Washington.\n\nGovernors, would-be governors, and U.S. senators have sought his advice and favor. Presidents know him and return his calls.\n\nNorcross publicly chafes at terms like boss, kingmaker and powerbroker, which sound unsavory.\n\nBut his modern brand of machine politics, built on loyalty and resentment of the wealthier and more populous North Jersey, would have been familiar to Tammany Hall Democrats who accumulated power by helping and organizing immigrants, workers, and poor people. They ran New York City in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n\"People in South Jersey were disenfranchised and ignored for far too long,\" Norcross, who grew up the son of a labor leader in Pennsauken, said in a 2003 New York Times interview. It's one of the few times he's discussed the machine-boss characterization with the media.\n\nNorcross, 68, was charged Monday along with five allies in a state racketeering indictment for using their influence over city government to corruptly acquire lucrative waterfront real estate and development rights in Camden.\n\nThe charges come amid a turbulent time for old-school New Jersey politicos and the county machines that have dominated primaries. U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez is standing trial, for the second time, on federal corruption charges.\n\nThe Norcross machine has in recent years suffered defeats at the ballot box, and lost an important tool of power in a March ruling by a federal judge requiring the redesign of state ballots, which had long benefited candidates backed by county party organizations like Norcross'. The case was brought by U.S. Rep. Andy Kim, a Burlington County Democrat who won the nomination for U.S. Senate earlier this month.\n\nLast year, Norcross said that he was stepping away from an active role in politics. Many have expressed skepticism he'd truly withdraw from the fray.\n\nDespite his passion for South Jersey, Norcross has a reputation as a bipartisan pragmatist. He forged a mutually beneficial alliance with Republican Gov. Chris Christie, who created the tax breaks for Camden development in 2013, for instance. He's also allied with Newark Democrats and other political leaders in North Jersey at times.\n\nNorcross started a small insurance business in Camden in the early 1970s, helped by his father, George Norcross Jr., who was head of the AFL-CIO in South Jersey. The younger Norcross had been an indifferent student at Rutgers University-Camden, often spending time hanging around the courthouse to watch murder trails, according to his origin story.\n\nAs a young insurance man, Norcross met the Camden mayor at the time, Angelo Errichetti, who gave him his first and only government job: chairman of the Camden Parking Authority, as good a place as any to absorb the lessons of building political power.\n\nErrichetti later was charged in the Abscam scandal, for arranging meetings between politicians and Arab businessmen seeking favors with bribes; the businessmen turned out to be undercover federal agents. Errichetti was convicted in 1981 of accepting some of the bribe money and sentenced to six years in prison, serving 32 months of it.\n\nA federal judge presiding over the case said the mayor stood \"at the center of a cesspool of corruption.\" Norcross was never charged with a crime in the scheme. Neither was he implicated as having been involved.\n\nOver the next 30-plus years, Norcross built his power as a prolific fundraiser for political candidates and partly using that leverage, by helping allies win municipal legal, engineering, and other contracts.\n\nHe also grew rich as a businessman and now is the executive chairman of Conner Strong & Buckelew, one of the nation's largest brokers of insurance and consultants on risk management and employee benefits.\n\nHe's also worked in banking and invested in other businesses and is chairman of the board of trustees of the Cooper University Health Care system, which includes Cooper University Hospital and the MD Anderson Cancer Center at Cooper.\n\nIn 2012, Norcross became a minority owner of The Inquirer but lost his ownership stake two years later after falling out with, and being outbid for the property by co-owners Lewis Katz and H.F. \"Gerry\" Lenfest. Today, The Inquirer is owned by the non-profit Lenfest Institute for Journalism.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Within the 13-count indictment are signs of the years of earlier investigations that preceded it.\n\nPeppered throughout the charging documents are nearly a dozen references to contemporaneous recordings of phone calls and meetings in which Norcross and others discussed the real estate deals at the heart of the case. The tapes referenced in the indictment date as far back as 2013 -- well before Platkin's investigation began -- and continue through periods of time in which other earlier investigations of Norcross were occurring.\n\nIn one of them -- a recorded 2016 phone call -- Norcross admits to threatening Philadelphia real estate developer Carl Dranoff, with whom he was feuding at the time, the indictment says.\n\n\"He said, 'Are you threatening me?' \" Norcross reportedly told a confidante on the call, as he recalled a conversation with Dranoff. \"I said, 'Absolutely.' \"\n\nSome of the recordings described in the indictment were made during the same period the FBI was tapping Norcross' phones in an unrelated investigation into Philadelphia labor leader John J. Dougherty. The Inquirer has previously reported agents were listening in on Norcross' phone calls from July through late August 2016, then picked up again in October for about a month. Norcross wasn't charged or accused of any wrongdoing in that investigation.\n\nMonday's indictment also described a previously undisclosed FBI interview with Norcross in 2016 in which he discussed a Camden nonprofit that prosecutors now say was the victim of the power broker's extortion.\n\nHow many recordings of Norcross and his allies investigators have obtained remains unclear, as does who made them and where exactly they came from. During his news conference announcing the indictment Monday, Platkin credited the U.S. Attorney's Offices in Philadelphia and New Jersey for earlier work that contributed to his investigation.\n\nThe tapes could raise the stakes if the case against Norcross heads to trial.\n\n\"I can tell you that there is nothing more powerful in a criminal prosecution than hearing a tape recording,\" said Ed Stier, a former state and federal prosecutor who served as director of the New Jersey Division of Criminal Justice. \"You can't cross examine it.\"\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com",

As the company's executive chairman, Norcross has been paid handsomely for the business' success, taking home $29 million in salary from the company between 2012 and 2023, according to the indictment.\n\nMeanwhile, Cooper University Health Care -- the Camden-based hospital network for which Norcross serves as board chairman -- won $27 million in tax credits between 2016 and 2022, which it has sold for $25 million. Those sales, according to the indictment, have allowed it to fully cover the annual $3.8 million rental cost for its headquarters at the 575,000-square-foot office complex on Federal Street known as L3.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Norcross and his allies strong-armed a local nonprofit out of a deal to buy the building in 2013, steering the sale instead to an investor group they preferred. Cooper Health later gained a 49% ownership stake in the building, entitling it to nearly half the profits earned from its other tenants.\n\nLikewise, after allegedly muscling Philadelphia developer Carl Dranoff out of development rights to another parcel on Cooper Street in Camden, Norcross and other investors went on to build the apartment complex 11 Cooper there. The complex received $3.5 million in tax credits between 2022 and 2023 and sold them for $4.3 million.\n\nNorcross has stressed that for as much money he's taken in from his business dealings in Camden, he and his business partners have invested significantly in the city, pumping more than $300 million into development there.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norcross,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tax credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Platkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Platkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Norcross", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Norcross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Jersey"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Commercial", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Commercial", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Brokerages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Brokerages", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/294/29415/2941527.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659259", "eventUri": "eng-9659259", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Murphy stands firm behind AG amid Norcross indictment", "body": "Make your contribution now and help Gothamist thrive in 2024. Donate today\n\nGov. Phil Murphy says he has full faith in the state attorney general following the indictment of George Norcross, one of the most powerful men in New Jersey who is also an ally of the governor.\n\n\"Matt Platkin has my complete confidence, period,\" Murphy told reporters Wednesday following an event in Newark.\n\nPlatkin, who was appointed attorney general by Murphy, announced Monday a sweeping criminal indictment of Norcross that charges the Democratic Party boss with racketeering, extortion and financial crimes. Platkin is using the state's Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organizations act, or RICO, to charge Norcross and five others with coercing elected officials and private business people in a scheme to obtain land on the Camden waterfront.\n\nThe waterfront deal and the grip that George Norcross holds on local, county and state governments was described in the 2022 WNYC podcast, Dead End: A New Jersey Political Murder Mystery.\n\nAt the center of the allegations is a state tax break program that was partly written by George Norcross's brother, Phil, who was also indicted. The state legislation was sponsored, in part, by a third brother, Donald, who is now in Congress. The tax break program gave special benefits to businesses that moved to Camden, and $1.1 billion in tax breaks went to businesses connected in varying ways to George and Phil Norcross.\n\nWhen Murphy first took office in 2018, he openly criticized the tax break program and established a task force to investigate it. But over the years, he has made his peace with Norcross and recently appeared at Norcross-sponsored fundraisers.\n\n\"I've raised money for Democrats up and down the state and all across this country, and I'll continue to do so,\" Murphy said. He declined to discuss the specifics of the case.\n\n\"The charges, the allegations, are very serious. They are deeply disturbing, let there be no doubt about that - period,\" Murphy said. \"As I said about Senator Menendez, as disturbing as the allegations might be, this is America. Folks are innocent until proven guilty, and that's the way it should be.\"\n\nSen. Bob Menendez is on trial on bribery and corruption charges that involve half a million dollars in cash, gold bars and a Mercedes Benz. He is accused of accepting bribes in exchange for help for the Egyptian government and three businessmen in New Jersey.\n\nMurphy's remarks came after a Juneteenth event at the St. James AME Church in Newark, where the governor signed an executive order that remakes the state's clemency program. Instead of offering forgiveness to individuals in prison, the new policy will look at entire categories of people and rethink whether they were unfairly or too harshly sentenced.\n\nThe governor said he did not watch the live stream of the press conference announcing the Norcross indictment, and said he would not comment about the unusual attendance of George Norcross and a phalanx of lawyers. Norcross sat in the front row, and then verbally attacked the attorney general afterwards.\n\n\"I want to go to trial in two weeks. I want Matt Platkin to come down here and try this case himself because he's a coward, because he has forced people in this building to implement his will,\" Norcross told reporters outside the Hughes Justice Complex in Trenton.\n\nOverall, the response among political leaders to the indictment has been lukewarm.\n\n\"We must always respect the rule of law and hold people accountable - whether you are a former President or a local elected official,\" Rep. Josh Gottheimer said in a written statement which never mentions Norcross by name. \"And we must also respect the legal process as it plays out. That is the American way.\"", "source": {"uri": "gothamist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gothamist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Murphy", "type":

But Norcross and his allies still ran into problems.\n\nTurmoil rocks New Jersey's Democratic political bosses just in time for an election\n\nMonday's indictment on racketeering charges of Democratic power broker George E. Norcross III by state Attorney General Matt Platkin caps a series of blows to influential figures in the state's dominant political party.\n\nThey did not own the land and lacked the rights to develop it, and Philadelphia-based developer Dranoff Properties had the right of first refusal for one lot and a view easement that would limit the height of construction in the other.\n\nNorcross and allies sought an end to the easement so they could construct the Triad1828 Centre -- the tallest building on Camden's waterfront, which now hosts Conner Strong & Buckelew, NFI, and the Michaels Organization -- but met with resistance from Carl Dranoff, the developer whom the indictment refers to as developer-1.\n\nNorcross is executive chairman of Conner Strong & Buckelew. NFI CEO Sidney Brown and Michaels Organization CEO John O'Donnell have also been charged.\n\nCity officials, including then-Mayor Dana Redd -- another co-defendant -- then stopped returning the developer's calls, and an offer followed, prosecutors claim. Dranoff Properties would receive $1.3 million in reimbursements and consulting fees plus $1 million to cede its development rights, its easement, and $18 million in state tax credits to Liberty Property Trust, the developer favored by Norcross, according to the indictment.\n\nThe offer included the promise of a push by Norcross allies to lobby the Camden Redevelopment Agency to issue permits that would lower the environmental remediation standards at a separate site the developer sought to redevelop, the indictment says. The firms played no legal role in that process.\n\nThe deal fell through the same day it was offered, and those in Norcross' orbit turned to other methods, prosecutors claim.\n\n\"I think we just do it. F**k 'em. F**k 'em. Just do it,\" Norcross said during a recorded conversation with his brother, according to the indictment.\n\nThe indictment alleges Norcross turned to two strategies: His team would have the Camden Redevelopment Agency challenge the easement in court, and they would challenge the developer's character in public.\n\nWho is George Norcross? A look at the indicted South Jersey power broker\n\nSouth Jersey Democratic boss George E. Norcross III has never been elected to anything, but he's salted dozens of municipal governments with loyalists of his political organization and amassed influence in the back rooms of Trenton and the marbled halls of Washington.\n\nThe court filing was an effort to get the easement thrown out under the New Jersey Eminent Domain Act, which allows governments to seize private property under certain circumstances that include just compensation for the property owner.\n\nThere is no evidence the redevelopment agency intended to follow the process set out by that law, which requires the condemning agency appraise the property to be seized and make a written offer that meets or exceeds its value before moving to condemn the building, prosecutors said.\n\nThe indictment says the developer feared the financial harms borne of Norcross' control of Camden government and his ability to do businesses elsewhere in the future. He ceded his easement and sold his $18 million in tax credits and his development rights for $1.95 million in October 2016.\n\nProsecutors allege Norcross and his allies resorted to coercive tactics over a separate site some 16 months later, when they charged Dranoff was responsible for stalled redevelopment at Radio Lofts, a former Radio Corporation of America building that could not be redeveloped because the Camden Redevelopment Agency could not secure sufficient financing for environmental remediation.\n\n\"He's gonna come under some serious accusations from the City of Camden, which are gonna basically suggest that he's not a reputable person and he's done nothing but try to impede the progress of the city,\" Norcross said on a recorded conference call, according to the indictment. \"You can never trust him until you got a bat over his head.\"\n\nOfficials began deriding the developer after he sued the city, the redevelopment agency, and others in 2018 after Camden moved to end his development rights on the Radio Lofts site.\n\n\"The city of Camden is taking action against those who have taken advantage of the city when it was down,\" then-Camden Mayor Frank Moran said when the city countersued Dranoff in 2018.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe developer settled that suit in 2023, agreeing to pay the city $3.3 million and cede redevelopment rights to the Radio Lofts site. He believed he was in the right, the indictment says, but \"had concerns over corruption in Camden which made him believe that he would not be treated fairly by the court system.\"\n\nCorruption trial of Sen. Menendez resumes\n\nLawyers in the case told the judge during a remote hearing Monday they believe the case will continue until at least the week of July 8.\n\nThe post Corruption trial of Sen. Menendez resumes Tuesday appeared first on New Jersey Monitor.\n\nThat accusation raised the hackles of Norcross attorney Michael Critchley, who likened them to Donald Trump's claims that his New York hush money conviction is the result of a corrupt judicial system.\n\n\"Why would an officer of the court, meaning Platkin, the attorney general, put shame unnecessarily, unjustly, and salaciously, on the entire court system of Camden, and in particular the judge?\" Critchley told the New Jersey Monitor. \"This is just out of Trump's playbook.\"\n\nConner Strong & Buckelew, NFI, and the Michaels Organization won more than $240 million in tax credits for the Triad1828 Centre through the now-defunct GROW NJ tax credit program. The three firms have received at least $29 million of those tax credits, prosecutors said, much of which they sold.\n\nThe Michaels Organization has received roughly $3.5 million in tax credits for 11 Cooper, a residential project on the site to which the developer had the right of first refusal. Michaels sold those tax credits for roughly $4.3 million.\n\nA Dranoff spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nL3 complex\n\nThe indictment alleges similar misconduct over the nonprofit Coopers Ferry's redevelopment of an office building Cooper University Health Care wanted for its own offices. Norcross is chairman of the Cooper health system's board.\n\nPhilip Norcross railed at top officials at Cooper's Ferry over the project, saying it should be handed over to a private developer, the indictment claims. Prosecutors allege that within a day, he urged the nonprofit to partner with Ira Lubert, a Pennsylvania real estate mogul with financial ties to George Norcross whom the indictment calls Investor-1.\n\nCooper's Ferry entered a non-disclosure agreement with Lubert but chose another developer, a decision that immediately drew Norcross' ire, prosecutors say.\n\nNew Jersey attorney general charges Democratic power broker Norcross with racketeering\n\nNew Jersey's attorney general has charged influential Democratic power broker George Norcross with racketeering and other charges in connection with government issued tax credits.\n\nTwo days later, on April 25, 2014, Philip Norcross, who held no formal role with the city or Cooper's Ferry, told the nonprofit it was not allowed to use its chosen developers, a statement then-Cooper's Ferry CEO Anthony Perno took as a threat, prosecutors allege.\n\nIn an email cited by the indictment, Perno called the two bids a \"false choice,\" saying Cooper's Ferry would likely not be able to close a deal with its chosen developers \"given the opposition.\"\n\nIn the end, Cooper's Ferry partnered with Norcross' chosen developer, netted just $125,000 for its work on the project, and never received shares of future profits promised to it during negotiations, the indictment alleges.\n\nThe nonprofit's agreement with its preferred developer would have seen it win 25% of future profits from the site. At the time of closing, the L3 site was appraised at roughly $54 million, tens of millions more than the $32.7 million Lubert's partnership paid for it.\n\nCooper Health had applied for tax incentives to cover the costs of rent at the site a month earlier, though in its applications to the state Economic Development Authority, it left out that it planned to purchase an interest in L3, prosecutors say.\n\nCooper Health received an award of nearly $40 million just 28 days after filing its application and, four months thereafter, purchased a 49% stake in the site for about $2.5 million. Between 2015 and 2020, Cooper Health received more than $27.1 million in tax incentives, which it sold for about $25.1 million.\n\nProsecutors allege Norcross and others then sought to shield their role in the saga. Norcross, during a 2016 FBI interview, claimed he did not know anyone at Cooper's Ferry, according to the indictment.\n\nBut Susan Bass Levin, who the indictment calls CC-1, joined the Cooper Ferry's board two years earlier. Bass Levin is CEO of the Cooper Foundation, the charitable arm of Cooper University Health Care.\n\nCourt approves Cape Regional, Cooper University Health merger\n\nCape May County Superior Court has approved the merger of Cape Regional Health System and Cooper University Health Care.\n\nIn 2017, Norcross moved to oust Perno as he shifted officials through positions within his influence, prosecutors allege. Perno resigned at the urging of Bass Levin -- losing a full year in severance -- though his departure had less to do with his job performance than Norcross' view of his performance, prosecutors claimed.\n\nIf he refused to quit, officials would just invent a reason to remove him for cause and thereby deny him severance, Bass Levin said, according to the indictment.\n\nThe indictment recounts a conversation about Norcross that prosecutors claim Bass Levin had with Perno.\n\n\"You don't want that fight. Believe me when I tell you. If you don't think that he can't get to anybody he wants to, you're kidding yourself,\" Bass Levin said.\n\nMarino, the attorney representing Philip Norcross, said that exchange is an example of many in the indictment that prove no criminal activity and were included to create the appearance that George Norcross and his allies acted improperly.\n\n\"One party's telling another party that George Norcross can get anywhere and do anything. What is that doing in an indictment?\" Marino said. \"The reason this indictment runs to 111 pages is it takes a lot of work to construct what actually happened in such a way as to make it look like it violates the law. It doesn't.\"\n\nThis story first appeared on the New Jersey Monitor.\n\nOriginally published on newjerseymonitor.com, part of the BLOX Digital Content Exchange.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local

His business partner in the firm, Joe Buckalew, is the former chairman of the Ocean County GOP, but continues to be a major powerbroker in the county.\n\nThe two men are close friends and business partners who reportedly vacation together annually in Florida.\n\nToday, the New Jersey Attorney General's Office indicted Norcross. Attorney General Matt Platkin announced the indictment against Norcross and five other defendants following a years-long criminal and political corruption probe into the powerful Democrat's business affairs.\n\nNorcross has been credited with securing both of Chris Christie's successful campaigns for New Jersey governor.\n\nAG Platkin charged Norcross with racketeering and operating a criminal enterprise after a lengthy investigation into a criminal enterprise run by George E. Norcross III and his associates in South Jersey and elsewhere.\n\nToday, Mayor Dan Rodrick, when asked, confirmed that one of his first actions as mayor was to cut ties with Norcross' firm after it had been entrenched in the township for decades and rehired each year during former Mayor Maurice Hill's term of office.\n\nThe state charged Norcross with various counts of financial facilitation, misconduct by a corporate official, and official misconduct and conspiring to commit theft by extortion, criminal coercion, financial facilitation, misconduct by a corporate official, and official misconduct.\n\nWhen asked about the indictment, Rodrick declined to comment on the criminal matter.\n\n\"I don't know about that or what's going on, but we switched providers based only on a financial decision for the township,\" Rodrick said. We are saving $2 million a year by cutting out the middleman insurance broker and dealing directly with Aetna. I am happy about that and happy we can continue finding ways to cut costs in Toms River.\"\n\nThe FBI, who assisted in the investigation commented on the case.\n\n\"We work each day with the New Jersey Attorney General's Office, as well as other State agencies, creating effective and lasting relationships,\" said Special Agent in Charge James Dennehy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Newark Field Office. \"We are always willing to support and assist when our partners ask. We will do everything within our purview to bring to justice anyone accused of wrongdoing.\"\n\n\"The indictment unsealed today alleges that George Norcross has been running a criminal enterprise in this state for at least the last twelve years,\" said Attorney General Platkin in announcing the charges earlier today. \"On full display in this indictment is how a group of unelected, private businessmen used their power and influence to get government to aid their criminal enterprise and further its interests. The alleged conduct of the Norcross Enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, non-profits, the people of the State of New Jersey, and especially the City of Camden and its residents. That stops today. We must never accept politics and government - that is funded with tax dollars - to be weaponized against the people it serves. Today we reaffirm that no one in our state is above the law - period.\"\n\nNorcross was among six people charged today:\n\nThe indictment alleges that from as early as 2012 through the present, the Norcross Enterprise used its power and influence over government officials to craft legislation tailored to serve the interests of the enterprise, and with the cooperation of then-Camden Mayor Dana Redd and other officials, used parts of the city's government to aid the enterprise in acquiring property and property rights for itself and others through coercion, extortion, and other criminal acts. All six of the following defendants are charged with first-degree racketeering:", "source": {"uri": "shorenewsnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shore News Network"}, "authors": [],

What top Democrats said about takedown of NJ party boss", "body": "George Norcross indictment (Norcross from 6abc Philadelphia via Youtube, NJOAG)\n\nIn the wake of a 13-count indictment against South Jersey party boss George Norcross, public reaction from the leaders of his political party has been limited.\n\nNorcross, whose influence and money have played an integral part in New Jersey political races and multi-million-dollar policy decisions for decades, moved to Florida full-time in 2020, as Palm Beach Daily News reported.\n\nRELATED: Norcross sits front row as criminal charges against him detailed\n\nAfter the news conference where charges were announced against him, Norcross called for the case to rush to trial in two weeks.\n\nHe also dared state Attorney General Matthew Platkin to try the case himself in court, calling him a \"coward.\"\n\nThe following are NJ Democrats who have ventured to comment on the racketeering and other charges facing the longtime power broker.\n\nU.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J. 11th District, released a statement on social media, including Facebook, saying, \"New Jerseyans deserve to know that our tax dollars are spent wisely and fairly. My full statement on George Norcross's indictment.\" She is considered a potential candidate for governor in the future.\n\n\"From Menendez to Alito to Norcross, too many powerful people from New Jersey seem to think that they are above the law and work to enrich themselves at the expense of hard-working Americans,\" Sherrill said.\n\n\"New Jerseyans deserve to know that their tax dollars are being spent wisely, that contracts are being awarded fairly and that the system isn't rigged against them.\"\n\n\"This type of corruption undermines citizens' faith in government and costs taxpayers money,\" Sherrill added. \"I've served in the Navy, as a federal prosecutor, and now in Congress. I always have and always will put the people I serve and my oath of office above all else.\"\n\nAnother Democrat who went on record about the Norcross indictment was congressional candidate, Sue Altman, who is running in the 7th District against U.S. Rep. Tom Kean Jr. and has been a foe of Norcross on the grassroots level.\n\n\"I laud the Attorney General's monumental indictment. Like Donald Trump, George Norcross and his South Jersey cronies are finding out that breaking the law for personal gain has consequences,\" the former educator and current executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Alliance said in a statement on Facebook.\n\n\"It is a new day for New Jersey politics. We are replacing our culture of corruption, misuse of public funds, and self-dealing government with a new one - one that prioritizes public service, the greater good, and functional government where both parties are held accountable,\" she said.\n\nAltman said the indictment is \"a major step toward rooting out the rampant corruption that led to the abuse of taxpayer dollars and Camden residents,\" while adding it \"is sobering to see the scope and details of the damage done.\"\n\n\"As we move forward, I urge us to rethink what it means to invest in and develop a city. Instead of relying on state-funded giveaways to politically connected corporations, we must focus our efforts and investments on the people who already live and work there.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Democratic state Senator Britnee Timberlake issued a statement to InsiderNJ.com.\n\n\"Attorney General Matt Platkin's press conference on his indictment of George Norcross underscores the damaging impact of power abuse within our government and its consequences for taxpayers throughout the state,\" she said.\n\n\"Let me be unequivocal: I oppose anyone who threatens livelihoods, future opportunities, or physical harm to maintain or expand their power and influence. I oppose the exploitation of any and all communities but especially powerless impoverished ones. I oppose the abuse of taxpayer dollars for personal enrichment.\"\n\nJersey City Mayor Steven Fulop -- the first Democrat to announce his candidacy for governor next year -- was also among the first to comment on the indictment.\n\nIn a second tweet, Fulop said: \"Don't take this post as I'm happy that so many people in the political institutional world are being called out bc it's really unfortunate however I do think turning of the page is good thing and there is more still to do.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer did not issue a statement in direct reaction to the indictment. Instead, his campaign account on X countered Fulop's response, seemingly coining the term \"flip-Fuloping.\"\n\n\"Jersey Values is straight talking, not flip-flopping. You pursued Bob Menendez until you didn't. You chased George Norcross until you didn't. You supported Tammy Murphy until you didn't. Enough phony flip-Fuloping,\" Gottheimer's campaign account tweeted.\n\nPatricia Campos-Medina, Executive Director of The Worker Institute, took to social media to comment on Norcross.\n\n\"George Norcross has been undermining democracy in South Jersey for far too long,\" South Jersey Progressive Democrats President Kate Delany said, as part of a joint statement issued Monday along with Rowan University Democrats.\n\nThe groups also called the indictment of Norcross a \"big step in the right direction.\"\n\nNorcross' own reaction to his indictment was delivered outside the building on Monday.\n\n6ABC Action News was among those with video of the statements:", "source": {"uri": "nj1015.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Jersey 101.5"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It follows a years-long investigation into what Platkin described as a criminal enterprise run by Norcross and his associates in South Jersey and elsewhere.\n\nIn the indictment, Platkin alleges that from as early as 2012 through the present, \"The Norcross Enterprise\":\n\n\"And with the cooperation of then-Camden Mayor Dana Redd and other officials, used parts of the city's government to aid the enterprise in acquiring property and property rights for itself and others through coercion, extortion, and other criminal acts,\" the Attorney General's Office said, noting that all six defendants are charged with first-degree racketeering.\n\nThe defendants are also charged with various counts of financial facilitation, misconduct by a corporate official. Additional changes include official misconduct and conspiring to commit theft by extortion, criminal coercion, financial facilitation, misconduct by a corporate official, and official misconduct.\n\n\"The indictment unsealed today alleges that George Norcross has been running a criminal enterprise in this state for at least the last 12 years,\" said Platkin during a press conference in Trenton that included the appearance of Norcross himself, who was seated in the first row, just feet from the podium during the announcement. \"On full display in this indictment is how a group of unelected, private businessmen used their power and influence to get government to aid their criminal enterprise and further its interests. The alleged conduct of the Norcross Enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, non-profits, the people of the State of New Jersey, and especially the City of Camden and its residents.\"\n\nPlatkin said that stops today.\n\n\"We must never accept politics and government - that is funded with tax dollars - to be weaponized against the people it serves,\" said Platkin. \"Today we reaffirm that no one in our state is above the law - period.\"\n\n\"Today's indictment marks the culmination of a years-long, collaborative investigation, and I am grateful to the team handling this case for their dedication to seeking justice,\" said Drew Skinner, executive director of the Office of Public Integrity and Accountability. That office will oversee prosecution of the case.\n\nFollowing the press conference, Norcross spoke to reporters. He accused the Murphy administration of having a political vendetta and reportedly taunted Platkin - calling him a coward. Michael Critchley represents Norcross.\n\nAdditionally, Henry Klingeman, Redd's attorney, told NJBIZ, \"Dana Redd was surprised by today's legal action. She's done nothing wrong. What she has done is serve the Camden community in public and not-for-profit roles for more than three decades. She has cooperated fully with the grand jury investigation for over a year and is unaware of evidence of wrongdoing by her or others. She looks forward to fighting these false allegations in the courtroom before a judge and jury, so she can reclaim her good name that has now been tarnished by the Attorney General's unjust and unjustified action.\"\n\nAttorneys for Philip Norcross and Tambussi did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Defense counsel for Brown and O'Donnell was unknown at press time.\n\nArraignment is scheduled for July 9 at 10 a.m. before Superior Court Judge Peter Warshaw Jr. in Mercer County.", "source": {"uri": "njbiz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJBIZ"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_fazelpoor@njbiz.com", "name": "Matthew Fazelpoor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norcross,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeering", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Racketeering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Norcross", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George Norcross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coercion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Platkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Platkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden_Waterfront", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camden Waterfront"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Redd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dana Redd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Jersey"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trenton,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trenton, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Trenton, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Superior_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey Superior Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercer_County,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mercer County, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mercer County, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://njbiz.com/files/2024/01/George-Norcross.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659259", "eventUri": "eng-9659259", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 206, "textEnd": 213}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 3546, "textEnd": 3552}], "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Norcross III seethed in the afternoon heat as he waited for his lawyers begin a fierce pushback against an indictment that depicted the insurance executive -- impeccably dressed as ever in a navy blue suit and red tie -- as the foul-mouthed boss of an alleged criminal enterprise.\n\n\"I want (Attorney General) Matt Platkin to come down and try this case himself because he's a coward,\" the pugnacious Democratic Party leader from Camden County barked, referring to his new nemesis, New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin.\n\nMinutes earlier, Platkin had lowered the boom on Norcross and five others, including his brother, Philip, a lawyer, Dana Redd, the former Camden mayor, and three others in a 13-count indictment.\n\nThe entire spectacle in Trenton on Monday -- Norcross sat in the front row and glowered in a brazen show of intimidation at Platkin as he described an alleged \"criminal enterprise\" at a press conference while his legal team was dispatched outside to fulminate -- sounded at times like a weigh-in for a heavyweight bout.\n\nIt was the smart, stubborn tenacity of the Stanford Law School-trained Platkin versus the street-brawling bravado of the son of a South Jersey labor leader.\n\n\"I want to go to trial in two weeks,\" Norcross asserted afterward.\n\nPlatkin outlines allegations: George Norcross III, South Jersey's Democratic power broker, faces racketeering charges\n\nNew Jersey's political establishment is collapsing\n\nIt was nothing short of riveting political theater.\n\nNew Jersey's most powerful unelected Democrat -- with ties to the upper echelons of the national Democratic Party and a membership at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago, a millionaire known to helicopter into political fundraisers -- was depicted as a political Tony Soprano in a well-tailored suit. Norcross wielded power and enormous personal profit through threats, extortion and political influence, Platkin alleged.\n\nBut Monday's drama couldn't eclipse the other political narrative that has been steadily unfolding over the past year: The political old guard in New Jersey is in full retreat. Change is coming swiftly. Light is streaming through cracks in the clubhouse windows.\n\nConsider:\n\nThe Line: In just recent months, we have seen a federal court suspend the use of a ballot design that often gave Garden State party bosses aa significant advantage in securing public office for those under their control. While a separate federal court case has yet to fully resolve the fate of the county line, many expect that it is on its way out for good in coming New Jersey election cycles.\n\nSen. Bob Menendez: Then we have the legally-troubled mandarins of New Jersey politics who set the agenda and operated politically as usual -- with impunity. Menendez is facing his second federal corruption trial in a decade, this time inside a Manhattan courtroom, facing a sweeping set of bribery charges. Menendez asserts that he is innocent on all of the charges, says he will be vindicated and has filed enough petitions to appear on the November ballot as an independent candidate.\n\nThe Andy Kim insurgency: Meanwhile the, New Jersey Democratic Party has moved on from Menendez. In a grassroots revolt this spring, the party regulars selected a reformer newcomer from Burlington County, Rep. Andy Kim, to carry the Democratic standard in the fall race for the U.S. Senate. Menendez has little chance of winning and faces a narrow window to wreak revenge as a spoiler on all the Democratic Party leaders who cut him loose the moment his indictment was unsealed last September. His days as the hard-knuckled power broker from Hudson County appear to be at an end.\n\nTammy Murphy: Democrats also rejected the candidacy of first lady Tammy Murphy for the U.S. Senate as a nepotistic power play. Tammy Murphy had hoped to slide comfortably into the Senate with the help of her husband, Gov. Phil Murphy. But the old rules crumbled around her.\n\nSouth Jersey's waning influence: Norcross' own formidable machine, while still potent, has neither the statewide reach nor the veto power over Trenton that it did for decades. The mascot of the machine, former state Senate President Steve Sweeney, D- Gloucester, was routed in 2021 by a little known right-wing trucker driver, Ed Durr. Sweeney is hoping for a comeback next year in a long-shot bid for governor -- a goal now complicated by Monday's indictment. Norcross's ability to raise money for Sweeney, a childhood friend, will likely be diminished.\n\nChris Christie ties: In his remarks Monday, Platkin also emphasized that the period of the alleged criminal conduct considered in the case against Norcross stretches back 12 years to 2012. That year, Norcross and Sweeney's frequent collaborations with then-Republican Gov. Chris Christie reached their apex. That alliance produced a lucrative tax incentive program that sent billions to Camden and, authorities said, Norcross-linked entities. It's a sign that the entire period may be revisited, possibly in a courtroom.\n\nWho is George Norcross?: NJ power broker charged with racketeering, criminal conspiracy\n\nWe should still expect Norcross' fury\n\nThis is not to say that Norcross is going to quietly retreat into the political graveyard or onto a golf course in Florida where he officially moved to a couple of years ago. That move was a sign that he was possibly retiring, which few actually believed. He is expected to fight with a relentless fury, defending not only his innocence but what he describes as the resurrection of his hometown of Camden from rubble.\n\nIt's the big picture, he asserted, that Platkin failed to see through the narrow focus of his obsession to take down Norcross and his machine. Outside the Justice Complex in Trenton, Norcross sought to muddy the day's narrative with this own personal indictment, of sorts, of Platkin -- his role in controversies during his tenure as Murphy's campaign counsel and chief counsel before moving into the Attorney General's post. Norcross cited Platkin's role in the case of Katie Breinnan, a 2017 campaign aide whose accusations of being raped by a colleague went unheeded until the episode was detailed in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAnd Norcross complained about planning sessions in which he claimed government, political and law enforcement officials strategized on how to \"get us.\"\n\nIt's shocking, shocking to hear that a prosecutor is ambitious and aggressive. History is filled with prosecutors who set their sites on public office. Christie, for one. Thomas E. Dewey was the corruption busting prosecutor from New York that almost became president. Yet, this 113-page indictment was not about Platkin's ambition or his tactics or his own political missteps and controversies.\n\nThis was about an \"enterprise,'' an alleged, self-aggrandizing cabal that ran the table from Trenton to Camden.\n\nThe self-declared victim was also the menacing figure who, the indictment says, strong-armed a developer to relinquish property rights along the Camden waterfront so that the \"Norcross enterprise\" could build the tallest building along the strip. The developer's resistance prompted a conference call with his Norcross and his brother and co-defendant, Philip Norcross, in the summer of 2016, according to the indictment. Norcross stated, in substance, \"If you **** this up, I'll **** you up like you've never been ****ed up before. I'll make sure you never do business in this town again.\n\nThe developer took \"this threat seriously,\" according to the indictment.\n\nIt is this kind of conduct -- the old-school Jersey intimidation and the below-the-radar racketeering under the aegis of acceptable hard-ball Jersey style politics -- that has left voters dispirited and disgusted. It is this disgust that has been on a slow burn in the Democratic Party rank-and-file for years as Norcross and his allies wielded unchecked power. It's a disgust that has fueled the drive for change.\n\n\"It's often said that in New Jersey, politics is a blood sport, and what's meant by that is that if you don't go along with the demands of those in political power, you'll get hurt, you might lose your job, might lose your business, maybe you lose your reputation, or maybe government, the very government that you vote for, that you support with your tax dollars, that exists to serve you will instead be weaponized against you,\" Platkin said.\n\n\"All of these consequences are on full display in this indictment, but there is nothing inherent in our state's culture that requires us to accept politics and government that functions in this way, and as we show clearly in this indictment, there's nothing legal about it either,\" the attorney general added.", "source": {"uri": "northjersey.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "North Jersey"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Norcross III seethed in the afternoon heat as he waited for his lawyers begin a fierce pushback against an indictment that depicted the insurance executive -- impeccably dressed as ever in a navy blue suit, red tie but without socks -- as the foul-mouthed boss of an alleged criminal enterprise.\n\n\"I want (Attorney General) Matt Platkin to come down and try this case himself because he's a coward,\" the pugnacious Democratic Party leader from Camden County barked outside the front of the Richard J. Hughes Justice Complex, referring to his new nemesis, New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin.\n\nTough talk but hardly surprising, given the Norcross' flame throwing style heard in interviews and taped recordings in a past corruption investigation. Minutes earlier, Platkin dropped a political bombshell on Norcross and five others, including his brother, Philip, a lawyer, Dana Redd, the former Camden mayor, and three others in a 13-count indictment.\n\nThe entire spectacle in Trenton on Monday -- Norcross sitting in the front row, glowering at Platkin at Trenton press conference in a brazen show of intimidation only to lash out on the front steps of the building -- sounded at times like a weigh-in for a heavyweight bout.\n\nIt was the smart, stubborn tenacity of the Stanford Law School-trained Platkin versus the street-brawling bravado of the son of a South Jersey labor leader.\n\n\"I want to go to trial in two weeks,\" Norcross asserted afterward.\n\nPlatkin outlines allegations: George Norcross III, South Jersey's Democratic power broker, faces racketeering charges\n\nNew Jersey's political establishment is collapsing\n\nIt was nothing short of riveting political theater.\n\nNew Jersey's most powerful unelected Democrat -- with ties to the upper echelons of the national Democratic Party and a membership at former President Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago, a millionaire known to helicopter into political fundraisers -- was reduced in the unsealed indictment as a political Tony Soprano in a well-tailored suit. Norcross wielded power and enormous personal profit through threats, extortion and political influence, Platkin alleged.\n\nBut Monday's drama couldn't eclipse the other political narrative that has been steadily unfolding over the past year: The political old guard in New Jersey is in full retreat. Change is coming swiftly. Light is streaming through cracks in the clubhouse windows.\n\nNorcross may have hoped to scare off Platkin by glaring in the front row -- and maybe send a signal to potential witnesses -- but the fact is, the era of unchecked Norcross power has been broken. The man who once bragged that eventually all governors had to come groveling to him because, in the end, they had no choice, was simply standing alone and frustrated, flanked by lawyers. Among them was another co-defendant, Willaim Tambussi, the Camden County Democratic Party attorney.\n\nThe Norcross Era has now given way to the Age of Upheaval. Consider:\n\nThe Line: In just recent months, we have seen a federal court suspend the use of a ballot design that often gave Garden State party bosses aa significant advantage in securing public office for those under their control. While a separate federal court case has yet to fully resolve the fate of the county line, many expect that it is on its way out for good in coming New Jersey election cycles.\n\nSen. Bob Menendez: Then we have the legally-troubled mandarins of New Jersey politics who set the agenda and operated politically as usual -- with impunity. Menendez is facing his second federal corruption trial in a decade, this time inside a Manhattan courtroom, facing a sweeping set of bribery charges. Menendez asserts that he is innocent on all of the charges, says he will be vindicated and has filed enough petitions to appear on the November ballot as an independent candidate.\n\nThe Andy Kim insurgency: Meanwhile the, New Jersey Democratic Party has moved on from Menendez. In a grassroots revolt this spring, the party regulars selected a reformer newcomer from Burlington County, Rep. Andy Kim, to carry the Democratic standard in the fall race for the U.S. Senate. Menendez has little chance of winning and faces a narrow window to wreak revenge as a spoiler on all the Democratic Party leaders who cut him loose the moment his indictment was unsealed last September. His days as the hard-knuckled power broker from Hudson County appear to be at an end.\n\nTammy Murphy: Democrats also rejected the candidacy of first lady Tammy Murphy for the U.S. Senate as a nepotistic power play. Tammy Murphy had hoped to slide comfortably into the Senate with the help of her husband, Gov. Phil Murphy. But the old rules crumbled around her.\n\nSouth Jersey's waning influence: Norcross' own formidable machine, while still potent, has neither the statewide reach nor the veto power over Trenton that it did for decades. The mascot of the machine, former state Senate President Steve Sweeney, D- Gloucester, was routed in 2021 by a little known right-wing trucker driver, Ed Durr. Sweeney is hoping for a comeback next year in a long-shot bid for governor -- a goal now complicated by Monday's indictment. Norcross's ability to raise money for Sweeney, a childhood friend, will likely be diminished.\n\nChris Christie ties: In his remarks Monday, Platkin also emphasized that the period of the alleged criminal conduct considered in the case against Norcross stretches back 12 years to 2012. That year, Norcross and Sweeney's frequent collaborations with then-Republican Gov. Chris Christie reached their apex. That alliance produced a lucrative tax incentive program that sent billions to Camden and, authorities said, Norcross-linked entities. It's a sign that the entire period may be revisited, possibly in a courtroom.\n\nWho is George Norcross?: NJ power broker charged with racketeering, criminal conspiracy\n\nWe should still expect Norcross' fury\n\nThis is not to say that Norcross is going to quietly retreat into the political graveyard or onto a golf course in Florida where he officially moved to a couple of years ago. That move was a sign that he was possibly retiring, which few actually believed. He is expected to fight with a relentless fury, defending not only his innocence but what he describes as the resurrection of his hometown of Camden from rubble.\n\nIt's the big picture, he asserted, that Platkin failed to see through the narrow focus of his obsession to take down Norcross and his machine. Outside the Justice Complex in Trenton, Norcross sought to muddy the day's narrative with this own personal indictment, of sorts, of Platkin -- his role in controversies during his tenure as Murphy's campaign counsel and chief counsel before moving into the Attorney General's post. Norcross cited Platkin's role in the case of Katie Breinnan, a 2017 campaign aide whose accusations of being raped by a colleague went unheeded until the episode was detailed in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nAnd Norcross complained about planning sessions in which he claimed government, political and law enforcement officials strategized on how to \"get us.\"\n\nIt's shocking, shocking to hear that a prosecutor is ambitious and aggressive. History is filled with prosecutors who set their sites on public office. Christie, for one. Thomas E. Dewey was the corruption busting prosecutor from New York that almost became president. So what?\n\nYet, this 113-page indictment was not about Platkin's ambition or his tactics or his own political missteps and controversies.\n\nThis was about an \"enterprise,'' an alleged, self-aggrandizing cabal that ran the table from Trenton to Camden.\n\nThe self-declared victim was also the menacing figure who, the indictment says, strong-armed a developer to relinquish property rights along the Camden waterfront so that the \"Norcross enterprise\" could build the tallest building along the strip. The developer's resistance prompted a conference call with his Norcross and his brother and co-defendant, Philip Norcross, in the summer of 2016, according to the indictment. Norcross stated, in substance, \"If you **** this up, I'll **** you up like you've never been ****ed up before. I'll make sure you never do business in this town again.\n\nThe developer took \"this threat seriously,\" according to the indictment.\n\nIt is this kind of conduct -- the old-school Jersey intimidation and the below-the-radar racketeering under the aegis of acceptable hard-ball Jersey style politics -- that has left voters dispirited and disgusted. It is this disgust that has been on a slow burn in the Democratic Party rank-and-file for years as Norcross and his allies wielded unchecked power. It's a disgust that has fueled the drive for change.\n\n\"It's often said that in New Jersey, politics is a blood sport, and what's meant by that is that if you don't go along with the demands of those in political power, you'll get hurt, you might lose your job, might lose your business, maybe you lose your reputation, or maybe government, the very government that you vote for, that you support with your tax dollars, that exists to serve you will instead be weaponized against you,\" Platkin said.\n\n\"All of these consequences are on full display in this indictment, but there is nothing inherent in our state's culture that requires us to accept politics and government that functions in this way, and as we show clearly in this indictment, there's nothing legal about it either,\" the attorney general added.", "source": {"uri": "app.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asbury Park Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Platkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Platkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Menendez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Menendez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Norcross", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Norcross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Jersey"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trenton,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trenton, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Trenton, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norcross,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden_County,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Camden County, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Camden County, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_J._Hughes_Justice_Complex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard J.

There's the fall this year of a century-old, unique-to-New Jersey primary ballot system that allowed party bosses to give preferred placement to endorsed candidates.\n\nAnd now there's the indictment of Norcross, who Platkin said stepped across legal lines in orchestrating tax benefits for entities he controlled. Norcross angrily denied doing anything wrong.\n\nIt all comes months before the November general election, as Democrats look to hold on to a U.S. Senate seat they didn't expect to have to fight for in a year when their thin majority is already in jeopardy. Republicans, meanwhile, have found new reasons to be optimistic about their chances to win a seat they haven't held in more than five decades.\n\nSome New Jersey progressives see the unfolding chaos as part of an overdue cleanup in the messy politics of a state they have long dominated. Other observers draw a parallel to what has happened nationally in the Republican Party, where the power of establishment Republicans has given way to a more chaotic brand of populism espoused by former President Donald Trump and others like him.\n\nThey see it as a dissipation of centralized control all across the political spectrum -- perhaps even a restoration of power to the people.\n\n\"What we're really seeing is pushback against things that people would have gotten away with some time ago,\" Daniel Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll. \"This is basically saying, I think that these parties are out of touch with what voters want, and the energy of the party and both Republican and Democratic Party is very much on the side of the people who are against the institutional party.\"\n\nPlatkin, a Democrat, argued that it's time for the state to leave behind its reputation for ugly politics, a legacy that has been helped along at times in caricature, whether in fictional scenes from \"The Sopranos\" or in the minds of those who embrace it as a badge of honor.\n\n\"It's often said that in New Jersey politics is a blood sport,\" he said Monday. \"What's meant by that is that if you don't go along with the demands of those in political power, you'll get hurt. ... There is nothing inherent in our state's culture that requires us to accept politics and government that functions in this way.\"\n\nNorcross cast Platkin's prosecution of him as politically motivated. He called Platkin a coward and demanded the trial start in two weeks.\n\nHe's charged with operating a criminal enterprise over more than a decade, starting in 2012, in which he threatened property owners whose land he sought to acquire, used Camden city government to acquire land and tailored legislation for tax incentives that benefited companies he controlled. Those allegations have been the subject of investigations for years, with Norcross denying any wrongdoing and praising the good his investments did for the economically hard-up city of Camden, across the Delaware River from Philadelphia.\n\nA longtime kingmaker in southern New Jersey, Norcross often wielded influence through back channels. An old friend of the former Senate president and current gubernatorial candidate Steve Sweeney, Norcross played a key role in getting economic tax incentive legislation passed in 2013. His brothers are lobbyist and co-defendant Philip Norcross -- who's fighting the charges as well -- and Rep. Donald Norcross, a former state legislator.\n\nGeorge Norcross is the wealthy executive of an insurance firm and, until 2021, a Democratic National Committee member who also contributed financially to state and national Democrats. He's since moved to Palm Beach, Florida, where he had been listed before as a member of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.\n\nHe's long been a boogeyman of many progressive New Jersey Democrats, who saw him as enriching himself while poorer residents languished. On Monday, some of them cheered his indictment. Antoinette Mills, who heads the Working Families Party, called on officials to denounce Norcross' behavior. Murphy and other top Democrats have yet to weigh in.\n\nSue Altman, a Democratic candidate in the 7th District and longtime critic of Norcross, viewed the indictment -- along with Menendez's federal trial and the end of the so-called county line -- as part of a year of \"corruption busting\" in the state. Altman was once dragged by state police from a legislative hearing in 2019 at which Norcross was defending himself and the tax credits his organizations received. Her removal by troopers encapsulated his ability to influence lawmakers, she said in an interview.\n\n\"My getting thrown out, I think, ended up distilling that moment. And yes, that was very much on my mind,\" she said. \"I think it represents a new beginning in New Jersey.\"\n\nMenendez's September indictment on charges that he, his wife and three business associates engaged in a scheme in which the senator traded promises to use his office for cash, gold bars and a luxury vehicle, saw his party largely abandon him.\n\nHe declined to run as a Democrat for reelection this year, and filed this month to get on the ballot as an independent. His trial is underway in New York. Republicans, in a minority in state government, cast Menendez as a symptom of what's wrong with the Democratic majority.\n\nMenendez's refusal to heed the advice of fellow Democrats and resign led Rep. Andy Kim to become a Senate candidate last year. When the governor's spouse, first lady Tammy Murphy, looked assured of winning significant county party backing, Kim sued to stop the primary ballot system widely viewed as helping insiders.\n\nTammy Murphy, saying she wanted to avoid a negative campaign among Democrats, dropped out, and a federal judge ordered a temporary halt to the ballot design, bringing New Jersey in line with the rest of the country -- at least for this year.", "source": {"uri": "nbcphiladelphia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC10 Philadelphia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The multi-millionaire political boss sat at the seat closest to the podium where Platkin spoke, staring him down alongside an entourage of defense attorneys, watching the entirety of the press conference.\n\nThe silver-haired Norcross has a legendary reputation in New Jersey politics. His power is concentrated in South Jersey, where for decades he has ruled Democratic politics with an iron fist, but his influence over lawmakers has the ability to make-or-break the legislative agenda of governors.\n\n\"In the end, the McGreeveys, the Corzines, they're all going to be with me,\" Norcross was caught saying in the 2000s on secret recordings, in reference to the two former Democratic governors James McGreevey and Jon Corzine. \"Not that they like me, but because they have no choice.\"\n\nNorcross -- who seldom speaks with reporters -- said after the press conference that the 13-count indictment was part of a \"smear campaign\" against him from Platkin, and appeared confident that he would beat the charges.\n\n\"I want[ed] to witness an extraordinary embarrassment and outrageous conduct from a government official who stands up there and tries to act like he's holier than thou,\" Norcross said outside the Richard J. Hughes Justice Complex, where the attorney general's office is located, explaining his attendance.\n\nEven before the press conference started, attorneys for Norcross and his associates were combative with state officials -- a potential harbinger of how the criminal proceedings may look. When Sharon Lauchaire, the interim communications director for the Department of Law and Public Safety, asked Norcross to move because he was sitting in a reserved seat, attorneys aligned with Norcross pushed back.\n\n\"Is there someone more significant than the lead defendant in the case to have a seat in the front row while he's being exploited by the attorney general of the state?\" asked Kevin Marino, an attorney who is representing co-defendant Phil Norcross, George's brother. \"Is there someone who deserves that seat more?\"\n\nMichael Critchley, a high-profile New Jersey defense attorney, interrupted his own colleague, asking Lauchaire: \"Is there any reason why he shouldn't be sitting there?\"\n\nNorcross ultimately was allowed to stay in his seat. But Critchley made another pre-press conference objection after Lauchaire announced that only reporters could ask Platkin questions. Platkin, who took a handful of questions from reporters, said he had \"no comment\" on Norcross' attendance.\n\nAfter Platkin's press conference, Norcross and his attorneys went to the lobby of the government building -- speaking from a podium and stage tucked in the corner of the ground floor -- for their rebuttal press conference. State Police, however, quickly interrupted and asked them to leave the building.\n\nOutside, Norcross told reporters that he wanted to go to trial in two weeks and that Platkin should personally try the case. He criticized Platkin in bitingly personal terms, suggesting that Platkin unveiled the charges in pursuit of higher office -- he has long been rumored as a potential political candidate -- calling him a \"politician now masquerading as an attorney general.\"\n\n\"I want Matt Platkin to come down here and try this case himself,\" Norcross said. \"Because he's a coward, because he has forced people in this building to implement his will.\"\n\nNorcross ticked off controversies Platkin has been involved in: A county prosecutor currently suing him in court, alleging that Platkin illegally forced him out of his job; his involvement where a state legislative panel found he mishandled a rape case involving a campaign aide when Platkin was the governor's chief counsel; and a lawsuit from a former state Department of Health official which claimed that Platkin improperly got a Covid-19 test in the early days of the pandemic.\n\n\"He protects those he wants, he punishes others,\" Norcross said. \"What he's decided to do is for his future aspirations, whatever they may be, or whatever he dreams they're going to be.\"\n\nCritchley, a high-profile defense attorney, pushed back on any characterization that Norcross' presence at the press conference was intimidation.\n\n\"Why can we not come down here? Is there something wrong with that?\" he said. \"Maybe in Russia that doesn't happen, but this is still America. We have constitutional rights, and we are going to exercise those constitutional rights. Whether Mr. Platkin likes it or not.\"\n\nCritchley cryptically suggested that it would be a bumpy road ahead as the criminal proceedings continue.\n\n\"We just listened for about a half-hour of Mr. Platkin basically sending a personal message to George Norcross,\" he said. \"Now I'm sending a personal message to Matt Platkin: Buckle up.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_boss", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Political boss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Jersey"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norcross,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Platkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Platkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racketeering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_McGreevey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jim McGreevey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Corzine", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Corzine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Norcross", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Norcross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trenton,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trenton, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Trenton, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Department_of_Law_and_Public_Safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Conferences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659259", "eventUri": "eng-9659259", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Trenton, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

A look at the indicted South Jersey power broker", "body": "New Jersey Democratic political boss George Norcross was apparently kicked out of a Philadelphia Eagles game Sunday for flying an American-Israeli flag from his luxury suite.\n\nSouth Jersey Democratic boss George E. Norcross III has never been elected to anything, but he's salted dozens of municipal governments with loyalists of his political organization and amassed influence in the back rooms of Trenton and the marbled halls of Washington.\n\nGovernors, would-be governors, and U.S. senators have sought his advice and favor. Presidents know him and return his calls.\n\nNorcross publicly chafes at terms like boss, kingmaker, and power broker, which sound unsavory.\n\nBut his modern brand of machine politics, built on loyalty and resentment of the wealthier and more populous North Jersey, would have been familiar to Tammany Hall Democrats who accumulated power by helping and organizing immigrants, workers, and poor people. They ran New York City in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n\"People in South Jersey were disenfranchised and ignored for far too long,\" Norcross, who grew up the son of a labor leader in Pennsauken, said in a 2003 New York Times interview. It's one of the few times he's discussed the machine-boss characterization with the media.\n\nPeople are also reading...

U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez is standing trial, for the second time, on federal corruption charges.\n\nThe Norcross machine has in recent years suffered defeats at the ballot box, and lost an important tool of power in a March ruling by a federal judge requiring the redesign of state ballots, which had long benefited candidates backed by county party organizations like Norcross'. The case was brought by U.S. Rep. Andy Kim, a Burlington County Democrat who won the nomination for U.S. Senate earlier this month.\n\nNew Jersey attorney general charges Democratic power broker Norcross with racketeering\n\nNew Jersey's attorney general has charged influential Democratic power broker George Norcross with racketeering and other charges in connection with government issued tax credits.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nLast year, Norcross said that he was stepping away from an active role in politics. Many have expressed skepticism he'd truly withdraw from the fray.\n\nDespite his passion for South Jersey, Norcross has a reputation as a bipartisan pragmatist. He forged a mutually beneficial alliance with Republican Gov. Chris Christie, who created the tax breaks for Camden development in 2013, for instance. He's also allied with Newark Democrats and other political leaders in North Jersey at times.\n\nNorcross started a small insurance business in Camden in the early 1970s, helped by his father, George Norcross Jr., who was head of the AFL-CIO in South Jersey. The younger Norcross had been an indifferent student at Rutgers University-Camden, often spending time hanging around the courthouse to watch murder trails, according to his origin story.\n\nAs a young insurance man, Norcross met the Camden mayor at the time, Angelo Errichetti, who gave him his first and only government job: chairman of the Camden Parking Authority, as good a place as any to absorb the lessons of building political power.\n\nErrichetti later was charged in the Abscam scandal, for arranging meetings between politicians and Arab businessmen seeking favors with bribes; the businessmen turned out to be undercover federal agents. Errichetti was convicted in 1981 of accepting some of the bribe money and sentenced to six years in prison, serving 32 months of it.\n\nA federal judge presiding over the case said the mayor stood \"at the center of a cesspool of corruption.\" Norcross was never charged with a crime in the scheme. Neither was he implicated as having been involved.\n\nOver the next 30-plus years, Norcross built his power as a prolific fundraiser for political candidates and partly using that leverage, by helping allies win municipal legal, engineering, and other contracts.\n\nHe also grew rich as a businessman and now is the executive chairman of Conner Strong & Buckelew, one of the nation's largest brokers of insurance and consultants on risk management and employee benefits.\n\nCorruption trial of Sen. Menendez resumes\n\nLawyers in the case told the judge during a remote hearing Monday they believe the case will continue until at least the week of July 8.\n\nThe post Corruption trial of Sen. Menendez resumes Tuesday appeared first on New Jersey Monitor.\n\nHe's also worked in banking and invested in other businesses and is chairman of the board of trustees of the Cooper University Health Care system, which includes Cooper University Hospital and the MD Anderson Cancer Center at Cooper.\n\nIn 2012, Norcross became a minority owner of The Inquirer but lost his ownership stake two years later after falling out with, and being outbid for the property by, co-owners Lewis Katz and H.F. \"Gerry\" Lenfest. Today, The Inquirer is owned by the nonprofit Lenfest Institute for Journalism.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that

They then allegedly forced rivals to surrender projects to them, as well as associated credits worth millions of dollars. Those credits could be used to offset state taxes or sold to others.\n\nIn one case, according to the complaint, when a developer refused to sell his development rights for a particular piece of land on terms that George Norcross demanded, he threatened to \"f**k you up like you've never been f**ked up before\", and told him he would never again do business in Camden. In other cases, the Norcrosses allegedly enlisted Redd to gum up rivals' projects.\n\nGeorge Norcross did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nNorcross, an insurance broker, was the chair of Camden's Democratic committee from 1989 to 1995, and a member of the Democratic National Committee until 2021. Another brother, Donald, is a member of the House of Representatives representing a district that includes Camden.\n\nHe is a legendary figure in the world of New Jersey politics, in which county bosses wield power with their ability to bestow endorsements, campaign contributions and prominent placement on the ballot to favoured candidates.\n\nThat system, long associated with public corruption, now appears to be under strain. Robert Menendez, the New Jersey Democratic senator renowned for his own local power base, is currently standing trial on federal criminal charges for allegedly taking actions to benefit Egypt in exchange for cash, jewellery and other bribes. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nMeanwhile, New Jersey's controversial \"county line\" system -- in which candidates endorsed by the local party are listed in a single row on the ballot, giving them a boost over outsiders -- has been struck down by a court.\n\nThe Norcrosses' overlapping business and political dealings have long faced scrutiny but they had not previously been charged. In an unusual scene, George Norcross attended the press conference in Trenton, the state capital, in which Matthew Platkin, the attorney-general, announced the charges.\n\n\"It's often said that in New Jersey politics is a blood sport. And what's meant by that is that if you don't go along with the demands of those in political power, you'll get hurt,\" Platkin said, accusing the Norcrosses and their associates of using criminal means to take \"the Camden waterfront all for themselves\".", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

His power is concentrated in South Jersey, where for decades he has ruled Democratic politics with an iron fist, but his influence over lawmakers has the ability to make-or-break the legislative agenda of governors.\n\n\"In the end, the McGreeveys, the Corzines, they're all going to be with me,\" Norcross was caught saying in the 2000s on secret recordings, in reference to the two former Democratic governors James McGreevey and Jon Corzine. \"Not that they like me, but because they have no choice.\"\n\nNorcross -- who seldom speaks with reporters -- said after the press conference that the 13-count indictment was part of a \"smear campaign\" against him from Platkin, and appeared confident that he would beat the charges.\n\n\"I want[ed] to witness an extraordinary embarrassment and outrageous conduct from a government official who stands up there and tries to act like he's holier than thou,\" Norcross said outside the Richard J. Hughes Justice Complex, where the attorney general's office is located, explaining his attendance.\n\nEven before the press conference started, attorneys for Norcross and his associates were combative with state officials -- a potential harbinger of how the criminal proceedings may look. When Sharon Lauchaire, the interim communications director for the Department of Law and Public Safety, asked Norcross to move because he was sitting in a reserved seat, attorneys aligned with Norcross pushed back.\n\n\"Is there someone more significant than the lead defendant in the case to have a seat in the front row while he's being exploited by the attorney general of the state?\" asked Kevin Marino, an attorney who is representing co-defendant Phil Norcross, George's brother. \"Is there someone who deserves that seat more?\"\n\nMichael Critchley, a high-profile New Jersey defense attorney, interrupted his own colleague, asking Lauchaire: \"Is there any reason why he shouldn't be sitting there?\"\n\nNorcross ultimately was allowed to stay in his seat. But Critchley made another pre-press conference objection after Lauchaire announced that only reporters could ask Platkin questions. Platkin, who took a handful of questions from reporters, said he had \"no comment\" on Norcross' attendance.\n\nAfter Platkin's press conference, Norcross and his attorneys went to the lobby of the government building -- speaking from a podium and stage tucked in the corner of the ground floor -- for their rebuttal press conference. State Police, however, quickly interrupted and asked them to leave the building.\n\nOutside, Norcross told reporters that he wanted to go to trial in two weeks and that Platkin should personally try the case. He criticized Platkin in bitingly personal terms, suggesting that Platkin unveiled the charges in pursuit of higher office -- he has long been rumored as a potential political candidate -- calling him a \"politician now masquerading as an attorney general.\"\n\n\"I want Matt Platkin to come down here and try this case himself,\" Norcross said. \"Because he's a coward, because he has forced people in this building to implement his will.\"\n\nNorcross ticked off controversies Platkin has been involved in: A county prosecutor currently suing him in court, alleging that Platkin illegally forced him out of his job; his involvement where a state legislative panel found he mishandled a rape case involving a campaign aide when Platkin was the governor's chief counsel; and a lawsuit from a former state Department of Health official which claimed that Platkin improperly got a Covid-19 test in the early days of the pandemic.\n\n\"He protects those he wants, he punishes others,\" Norcross said. \"What he's decided to do is for his future aspirations, whatever they may be, or whatever he dreams they're going to be.\"\n\nCritchley, a high-profile defense attorney, pushed back on any characterization that Norcross' presence at the press conference was intimidation.\n\n\"Why can we not come down here? Is there something wrong with that?\" he said. \"Maybe in Russia that doesn't happen, but this is still America. We have constitutional rights, and we are going to exercise those constitutional rights. Whether Mr. Platkin likes it or not.\"\n\nCritchley cryptically suggested that it would be a bumpy road ahead as the criminal proceedings continue.\n\n\"We just listened for about a half-hour of Mr. Platkin basically sending a personal message to George Norcross,\" he said. \"Now I'm sending a personal message to Matt Platkin: Buckle up.\"", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norcross,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_J._Hughes_Justice_Complex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard J.

That stops today,\" Platkin stated on the unsealed indictment on June 17.\n\nThe charges reveal aggressive tactics employed by Norcross, including a reported threat to a developer holding key waterfront property rights. Norcross allegedly told the developer he would \"f -- you up like you've never been f -- - up before\" and ensure the developer could no longer do business in Camden. In a recorded phone call, Norcross also allegedly admitted to the threat and confessed that he warned the developer of \"enormous consequences.\"\n\nRep.

Bob Menendez, the senior U.S. senator for New Jersey.\n\nBack in September, Menendez and his wife Nadine were indicted in a New York federal court for allegedly accepting substantial bribes and being involved in a \"corrupt relationship\" with three New Jersey businessmen. In exchange for thousands of dollars in cash and gold bars, a Mercedes-Benz convertible, home mortgage payments and more, Menendez allegedly agreed to use his power and influence as a U.S. senator to favor his co-conspirators. (Related: New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez and his wife charged with BRIBERY.)\n\nAll these high-profile controversies have rocked the blue-state stronghold. State Democrats have already withdrawn their support for Menendez, instead nominating Rep. Andy Kim of the state's third congressional district. Menendez has decided to continue seeking re-election as an independent, putting the state's Republican nominee, businessman Curtis Bashaw, in good position to become the first Republican that New Jersey sends to the U.S. Senate in a decade.\n\nFollow Corruption.news for more stories about corruption in the United States.\n\nWatch this episode of the \"Health Ranger Report\" as Mike Adams, the

He extols virtues of compassion and compromise while eschewing the sort of cut throat maneuvering people like Norcross trade in. And barring an extreme circumstance, Booker is the only Democrat today who will hold statewide office beyond 2025.\n\nBooker's muted response shows the reality of living in the two worlds he straddles: he often tries to stay above the fray but also must maintain friendships and alliances with some of the most aggressive politicians in America.\n\n\"When people have come up through a certain system, it becomes very difficult to criticize that system,\" said Democrat Sue Altman, former director of the Working Families Party group who is hoping to unseat Republican Rep. Tom Kean Jr. \"You see it with Republicans. We see it with Democrats. But I'm very encouraged that Democrats in New Jersey in general, are moving towards accountability and diversity and change.\"\n\nBooker is not the only one holding his tongue on Norcross, who has earned a reputation for striking fear into his loyalists and opponents alike. The indictment of one of New Jersey's most powerful political figures drew silence from both sides of the aisle Monday, from the governor down through the Legislature.\n\nDuring the press conference announcing his indictment, Norcross defiantly sat in the front row while Attorney General Matt Platkin read the allegations of a decade-long criminal \"enterprise.\"\n\nBooker rose to prominence without much help from Norcross, but they became allies and Norcross donated and helped raise money for Booker since becoming a senator a decade ago.\n\nMost of New Jersey's congressional delegation has stayed mum on the issue, which Jersey City mayor and 2025 candidate for governor Steven Fulop pointed out on social media.\n\n\"Bueller.... Bueller.... I know Monday can be a slow day in Congress but weird only two comments in the entire state??\" Fulop posted on X, tagging two anticipated rivals for the Democratic nomination, Democratic Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill (who later issued a statement).\n\nEven Rep. Andy Kim (D-N.J.) -- who was the first to call on Menendez to resign and now is likely to take his Senate seat after winning the Democratic nomination -- didn't mention Norcross by name in his statement.\n\n\"There's no doubt that NJ politics is going through a lot of turmoil,\" Kim said. \"But I believe we will come out of this better; that our democracy will be fairer and more tied to the people.\"\n\nOn Monday, Booker called the Norcross indictment \"disturbing\" when asked about it. But he reminded reporters that everyone is innocent until proven guilty. He's taken that same approach in the past, but when Trump was indicted in Manhattan last year, he added that it meant that a grand jury \"has decided that there is enough evidence to charge former President Trump with committing a crime.\"\n\nHe reiterated that the focus is on Norcross but that one other politician -- the mayor of Camden -- is also involved.\n\n\"One of the reasons it was so difficult to create a coalition against the South Jersey Democratic machine is because politicians in New Jersey -- and [that] include[s] Democrats and Republicans -- were very afraid of taking on George Norcross directly,\" Altman said. \"And those fears don't go away overnight. I think that you'll continue to see a general lack of courage among Democratic and Republican politicians in New Jersey until, and if, George Norcross is convicted.\"\n\nPatricia Campos-Medina, who ran for Menendez's seat but lost the Democratic nomination to Kim, said for many activists Norcross' indictment doesn't come as a surprise. But she said neither does Democrats' reservations to talk about the charges.\n\n\"Norcross was the Night King of New Jersey politics, like in 'Game of Thrones,'\" Campos-Medina said. \"You had to go to Norcross if you wanted to be in a statewide office. So he had a lot to say about elected officials.\"\n\nShe later added, \"Everyone is quiet because they don't know how deep the tentacles are going to go on this one.\"\n\nFormer New Jersey Sen. Bob Toriccelli said the muted reaction by other Democrats to the Norcross indictment is not unusual. There had been so much speculation about Norcross being investigated for years that \"people long ago dismissed the notion that it was serious.\"\n\n\"I think most of the silence is that it's a complete surprise,\" Torricelli said. But Booker, in particular, is \"not really identified\" with Norcross because he rose up the ranks without much support from him.\n\nHe said it's another indictment that's more \"problematic\" for Booker: that of his friend and colleague Menendez, now in the middle of his second bribery trial.\n\n\"He took a risk testifying for Menendez,\" Torricelli said. 'I admire his fidelity to the friendship with Menendez, but it obviously took a toll.\"\n\n\"If we are going to hold Trump and Republicans for their lies,\" Campos-Medina said, \"then we also need to hold Democrats accountable.\"", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type":

(Photo by Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)\n\nThe indictment unveiled Monday that accuses insurance executive and Democratic power broker George Norcross III of overseeing a criminal enterprise is replete with accusations of threats, intimidation, and political corruption that go on for 111 pages.\n\nBut at the heart of the charges filed by Attorney General Matt Platkin's office are claims that Norcross -- a Democratic kingmaker widely regarded as New Jersey's most powerful unelected person -- conspired with his allies to leverage their control of Camden County government officials to steer redevelopment work to their preferred investors and punish those who did not fall in line.\n\nWhile some details of the saga have previously emerged in press reports or through a gubernatorial task force convened to probe abuses of the state's tax incentives, the indictment against Norcross and five of his allies presents new details about how prosecutors claim they used their political power for personal gain.\n\nIt centers around voluminous New Jersey tax incentive programs meant to steer investment to the state's financially struggling cities and accuses Norcross and others of enriching themselves with taxpayer dollars while lying to the government.\n\nNorcross, a former Democratic national committeeman who faces 13 counts in the racketeering indictment, has denied any wrongdoing and alleges the prosecution is politically motivated.\n\n\"What's being alleged here, it's a wild story, a fanciful story woven together, a concocted criminal enterprise,\" said Kevin Marino, an attorney for one of the defendants. \"I don't see a single allegation here that rises to the level of criminal activity.\"\n\nIn 2013, Norcross and allies sought to build on plots near Camden's waterfront as expanded tax incentives became available under a new law.\n\nParts of the law were written by Kevin Sheehan, an attorney at the Parker McCay firm -- Norcross's brother Philip, a co-defendant, is the CEO -- who the indictment calls lawyer-1, and offered more generous awards with far fewer guardrails to projects in Camden than it called for elsewhere. But Norcross and his allies still ran into problems.\n\nThey did not own the land and lacked the rights to develop it, and Philadelphia-based developer Dranoff Properties had the right of first refusal for one lot and a view easement that would limit the height of construction in the other.\n\nNorcross and allies sought an end to the easement so they could construct the Triad1828 Centre -- the tallest building on Camden's waterfront, which now hosts Conner Strong & Buckelew, NFI, and the Michaels Organization -- but met with resistance from Carl Dranoff, the developer whom the indictment refers to as developer-1.\n\nNorcross is executive chairman of Conner Strong & Buckelew. NFI CEO Sidney Brown and Michaels Organization CEO John O'Donnell have also been charged.\n\nCity officials, including then-Mayor Dana Redd -- another co-defendant -- then stopped returning the developer's calls, and an offer followed, prosecutors claim. Dranoff Properties would receive $1.3 million in reimbursements and consulting fees plus $1 million to cede its development rights, its easement, and $18 million in state tax credits to Liberty Property Trust, the developer favored by Norcross, according to the indictment.\n\nThe offer included the promise of a push by Norcross allies to lobby the Camden Redevelopment Agency to issue permits that would lower the environmental remediation standards at a separate site the developer sought to redevelop, the indictment says. The firms played no legal role in that process.\n\nThe deal fell through the same day it was offered, and those in Norcross's orbit turned to other methods, prosecutors claim.\n\n\"I think we just do it. F**k 'em. F**k 'em. Just do it,\" Norcross said during a recorded conversation with his brother, according to the indictment.\n\nThe indictment alleges Norcross turned to two strategies: His team would have the Camden Redevelopment Agency challenge the easement in court, and they would challenge the developer's character in public.\n\nThe court filing was an effort to get the easement thrown out under the New Jersey Eminent Domain Act, which allows governments to seize private property under certain circumstances that include just compensation for the property owner.\n\nThere is no evidence the redevelopment agency intended to follow the process set out by that law, which requires the condemning agency appraise the property to be seized and make a written offer that meets or exceeds its value before moving to condemn the building, prosecutors said.\n\nThe indictment says the developer feared the financial harms borne of Norcross's control of Camden government and his ability to do businesses elsewhere in the future. He ceded his easement and sold his $18 million in tax credits and his development rights for $1.95 million in October 2016.\n\nProsecutors allege Norcross and his allies resorted to coercive tactics over a separate site some 16 months later, when they charged Dranoff was responsible for stalled redevelopment at Radio Lofts, a former Radio Corporation of America building that could not be redeveloped because the Camden Redevelopment Agency could not secure sufficient financing for environmental remediation.\n\n\"He's gonna come under some serious accusations from the City of Camden, which are gonna basically suggest that he's not a reputable person and he's done nothing but try to impede the progress of the city,\" Norcross said on a recorded conference call, according to the indictment. \"You can never trust him until you got a bat over his head.\"\n\nOfficials began deriding the developer after he sued the city, the redevelopment agency, and others in 2018 after Camden moved to end his development rights on the Radio Lofts site.\n\n\"The city of Camden is taking action against those who have taken advantage of the city when it was down,\" then-Camden Mayor Frank Moran said when the city countersued Dranoff in 2018.\n\nThe developer settled that suit in 2023, agreeing to pay the city $3.3 million and cede redevelopment rights to the Radio Lofts site. He believed he was in the right, the indictment says, but \"had concerns over corruption in Camden which made him believe that he would not be treated fairly by the court system.\"\n\nThat accusation raised the hackles of Norcross attorney Michael Critchley, who likened them to Donald Trump's claims that his New York hush money conviction is the result of a corrupt judicial system.\n\n\"Why would an officer of the court, meaning Platkin, the attorney general, put shame unnecessarily, unjustly, and salaciously, on the entire court system of Camden, and in particular the judge,\" Critchley told the New Jersey Monitor. \"This is just out of Trump's playbook.\"\n\nConner Strong & Buckelew, NFI, and the Michaels Organization won more than $240 million in tax credits for the Triad1828 Centre through the now-defunct GROW NJ tax credit program. The three firms have received at least $29 million of those tax credits, prosecutors said, much of which they sold.\n\nThe Michaels Organization has received roughly $3.5 million in tax credits for 11 Cooper, a residential project on the site to which the developer had the right of first refusal. Michaels sold those tax credits for roughly $4.3 million.\n\nA Dranoff spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe indictment alleges similar misconduct over the nonprofit Coopers Ferry's redevelopment of an office building Cooper University Health Care wanted for its own offices. Norcross is chairman of the Cooper health system's board.\n\nPhilip Norcross railed at top officials at Cooper's Ferry over the project, saying it should be handed over to a private developer, the indictment claims. Prosecutors allege that within a day, he urged the nonprofit to partner with Ira Lubert, a Pennsylvania real estate mogul with financial ties to George Norcross whom the indictment calls Investor-1.\n\nCooper's Ferry entered a non-disclosure agreement with Lubert but chose another developer, a decision that immediately drew Norcross's ire, prosecutors say.\n\nTwo days later, on April 25, 2014, Philip Norcross, who held no formal role with the city or Cooper's Ferry, told the nonprofit it was not allowed to use its chosen developers, a statement then-Cooper's Ferry CEO Anthony Perno took as a threat, prosecutors allege.\n\nIn an email cited by the indictment, Perno called the two bids a \"false choice,\" saying Cooper's Ferry would likely not be able to close a deal with its chosen developers \"given the opposition.\"\n\nIn the end, Cooper's Ferry partnered with Norcross' chosen developer, netted just $125,000 for its work on the project, and never received shares of future profits promised to it during negotiations, the indictment alleges.\n\nThe nonprofit's agreement with its preferred developer would have seen it win 25% of future profits from the site. At the time of closing, the L3 site was appraised at roughly $54 million, tens of millions more than the $32.7 million Lubert's partnership paid for it.\n\nCooper Health had applied for tax incentives to cover the costs of rent at the site a month earlier, though in its applications to the state Economic Development Authority, it left out that it planned to purchase an interest in L3, prosecutors say.\n\nCooper Health received an award of nearly $40 million just 28 days after filing its application and, four months thereafter, purchased a 49% stake in the site for about $2.5 million. Between 2015 and 2020, Cooper Health received more than $27.1 million in tax incentives, which it sold for about $25.1 million.\n\nProsecutors allege Norcross and others then sought to shield their role in the saga. Norcross, during a 2016 FBI interview, claimed he did not know anyone at Cooper's Ferry, according to the indictment.\n\nBut Susan Bass Levin, who the indictment calls CC-1, joined the Cooper Ferry's board two years earlier. Bass Levin is CEO of the Cooper Foundation, the charitable arm of Cooper University Health Care.\n\nIn 2017, Norcross moved to oust Perno as he shifted officials through positions within his influence, prosecutors allege. Perno resigned at the urging of Bass Levin -- losing a full year in severance -- though his departure had less to do with his job performance than Norcross's view of his performance, prosecutors claimed.\n\nIf he refused to quit, officials would just invent a reason to remove him for cause and thereby deny him severance, Bass Levin said, according to the indictment.\n\nThe indictment recounts a conversation about Norcross that prosecutors claim Bass Levin had with Perno.\n\n\"You don't want that fight. Believe me when I tell you. If you don't think that he can't get to anybody he wants to, you're kidding yourself,\" Bass Levin said.\n\nMarino, the attorney representing Philip Norcross, said that exchange is an example of many in the indictment that prove no criminal activity and were included to create the appearance that George Norcross and his allies acted improperly.\n\n\"One party's telling another party that George Norcross can get anywhere and do anything. What is that doing in an indictment?\" Marino said. \"The reason this indictment runs to 111 pages is it takes a lot of work to construct what actually happened in such a way as to make it look like it violates the law. It doesn't.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Norcross", "type": "person", "score": 5,

Norcross III by state Attorney General Matt Platkin caps a series of blows to influential figures in the state's dominant political party and adds to a sense of turbulence in the blue-state stronghold.\n\nThere's the ongoing federal bribery case against Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who's pleaded not guilty in a New York trial that has consistently delivered glimpses of the tawdry underbelly of Garden State politics. There's the fall this year of a century-old, unique-to-New Jersey primary ballot system that allowed party bosses to give preferred placement to endorsed candidates.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Norcross angrily denied doing anything wrong.\n\nIt all comes months before the November general election, as Democrats look to hold on to a U.S. Senate seat they didn't expect to have to fight for in a year when their thin majority is already in jeopardy. Republicans, meanwhile, have found new reasons to be optimistic about their chances to win a seat they haven't held in more than five decades.\n\nSome New Jersey progressives see the unfolding chaos as part of an overdue cleanup in the messy politics of a state they have long dominated. Other observers draw a parallel to what has happened nationally in the Republican Party, where the power of establishment Republicans has given way to a more chaotic brand of populism espoused by former President Donald Trump and others like him.\n\nThey see it as a dissipation of centralized control all across the political spectrum -- perhaps even a restoration of power to the people.\n\n\"What we're really seeing is pushback against things that people would have gotten away with some time ago,\" Daniel Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll. \"This is basically saying, I think that these parties are out of touch with what voters want, and the energy of the party and both Republican and Democratic Party is very much on the side of the people who are against the institutional party.\"\n\nCorruption trial of Sen. Menendez resumes\n\nLawyers in the case told the judge during a remote hearing Monday they believe the case will continue until at least the week of July 8.\n\nThe post Corruption trial of Sen. Menendez resumes Tuesday appeared first on New Jersey Monitor.\n\nPlatkin, a Democrat, argued it's time for the state to leave behind its reputation for ugly politics, a legacy that has been helped along at times in caricature, whether in fictional scenes from \"The Sopranos\" or in the minds of those who embrace it as a badge of honor.\n\n\"It's often said that in New Jersey politics is a blood sport,\" he said Monday. \"What's meant by that is that if you don't go along with the demands of those in political power, you'll get hurt. ... There is nothing inherent in our state's culture that requires us to accept politics and government that functions in this way.\"\n\nNorcross cast Platkin's prosecution of him as politically motivated. He called Platkin a coward and demanded the trial start in two weeks.\n\nHe's charged with operating a criminal enterprise over more than a decade, starting in 2012, in which he threatened property owners whose land he sought to acquire, used Camden city government to acquire land and tailored legislation for tax incentives that benefited companies he controlled. Those allegations have been the subject of investigations for years, with Norcross denying any wrongdoing and praising the good his investments did for the economically hard-up city of Camden, across the Delaware River from Philadelphia.\n\nA longtime kingmaker in southern New Jersey, Norcross often wielded influence through back channels. An old friend of the former Senate president and current gubernatorial candidate Steve Sweeney, Norcross played a key role in getting economic tax incentive legislation passed in 2013. His brothers are lobbyist and co-defendant Philip Norcross -- who's fighting the charges as well -- and Rep. Donald Norcross, a former state legislator.\n\nGeorge Norcross is the wealthy executive of an insurance firm and, until 2021, a Democratic National Committee member who also contributed financially to state and national Democrats. He's since moved to Palm Beach, Florida, where he had been listed before as a member of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.\n\nHe's long been a boogeyman of many progressive New Jersey Democrats, who saw him as enriching himself while poorer residents languished. On Monday, some of them cheered his indictment. Antoinette Mills, who heads the Working Families Party, called on officials to denounce Norcross' behavior. Murphy and other top Democrats have yet to weigh in.\n\nNew Jersey attorney general charges Democratic power broker Norcross with racketeering\n\nNew Jersey's attorney general has charged influential Democratic power broker George Norcross with racketeering and other charges in connection with government issued tax credits.\n\nSue Altman, a Democratic candidate in the 7th District and longtime critic of Norcross, viewed the indictment -- along with Menendez's federal trial and the end of the so-called county line -- as part of a year of \"corruption busting\" in the state. Altman was once dragged by state police from a legislative hearing in 2019 at which Norcross was defending himself and the tax credits his organizations received. Her removal by troopers encapsulated his ability to influence lawmakers, she said in an interview.\n\n\"My getting thrown out, I think, ended up distilling that moment. And yes, that was very much on my mind,\" she said. \"I think it represents a new beginning in New Jersey.\"\n\nMenendez's September indictment on charges that he, his wife and three business associates engaged in a scheme in which the senator traded promises to use his office for cash, gold bars and a luxury vehicle, saw his party largely abandon him.\n\nHe declined to run as a Democrat for reelection this year, and filed this month to get on the ballot as an independent. His trial is underway in New York. Republicans, in a minority in state government, cast Menendez as a symptom of what's wrong with the Democratic majority.\n\nMenendez's refusal to heed the advice of fellow Democrats and resign led Rep. Andy Kim to become a Senate candidate last year. When the governor's spouse, first lady Tammy Murphy, looked assured of winning significant county party backing, Kim sued to stop the primary ballot system widely viewed as helping insiders.\n\nTammy Murphy, saying she wanted to avoid a negative campaign among Democrats, dropped out, and a federal judge ordered a temporary halt to the ballot design, bringing New Jersey in line with the rest of the country -- at least for this year.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

We may be witnessing the fall of New Jersey's most corrupt Democratic Party power broker, George Norcross, as he faces a multi-count indictment for 12 years of wrongdoing.\n\nIt was five years ago that I wrote about Norcross, and this is as good a summary of that story as anything:\n\nNew Jersey politics have never been accused of being clean, and for good reason. Now that rampant and systemic sleaze is threatening freshman Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.\n\nThe gist of the feud is South Jersey political boss and all-around a-hole George Norcross, an insurance mogul who has seemingly purchased the entire South Jersey Democratic establishment, and much of its statewide crew as well. Many of the seedy details can be found in this article, and this one, oh, and this one. But it can be neatly summed up like this: While Camden is facing public school closings because of a $27 million budgetary shortfall, Norcross and his allies have sucked up $1.1 billion in public subsidies and tax breaks supposedly designed to help places such as Camden.\n\nThe article also blasted New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker for siding with Norcross despite his obvious sleaze. It was a blemish on Booker's otherwise solid record. Norcross was so powerful, it seemingly was impossible for anyone in the state's politics to cross him. That is, until Gov. Phil Murphy was elected. The two have been battling it out since 2019, and it apparently is now culminating in this indictment.\n\nFrom at least approximately 2012 to the present, GEORGE E. NORCROSS, III led a criminal enterprise whose members and associates agreed the enterprise would extort others through threats and fear of economic and reputational harm and commit other criminal offenses to achieve the enterprise's goals (the \"Norcross Enterprise\"\n\nFor his part, Norcross is acting like the political mafioso boss that he is:", "source": {"uri": "nationalmemo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Memo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Norcross", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George Norcross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norcross,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Murphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepotism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nepotism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Jersey"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_boss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political boss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cory Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Mafia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sicilian Mafia"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Political_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Political Science", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81MjQ2NzY3Mi9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTcyMjQxNjIxNH0.Sf0Svk5Y-JhnFsSbf5LIFOxgaayuaGitSi3FcZM34kk/img.png?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C95%2C0%2C95", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659259", "eventUri": "eng-9659259", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Platkin names Cooper Health and Conner Strong & Buckelew (CSB), where George Norcross held positions as chair of the board of trustees, as key beneficiaries.\n\nWe are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed, healthy and aware.

The alleged conduct of the Norcross Enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, non-profits, the people of the State of New Jersey, and especially the City of Camden and its residents. That stops today,\" Platkin stated on the unsealed indictment on June 17.\n\nThe charges reveal aggressive tactics employed by Norcross, including a reported threat to a developer holding key waterfront property rights. Norcross allegedly told the developer he would \"f--- you up like you've never been f----- up before\" and ensure the developer could no longer do business in Camden. In a recorded phone call, Norcross also allegedly admitted to the threat and confessed that he warned the developer of \"enormous consequences.\"\n\nRep. Donald Norcross, the political boss' younger brother who currently serves as the representative for New Jersey's first congressional district, remains uncharged.\n\nThe accusations against Norcross come on the heels of an ongoing federal bribery case against Sen. Bob Menendez, the senior U.S. senator for New Jersey.\n\nBack in September, Menendez and his wife Nadine were indicted in a New York federal court for allegedly accepting substantial bribes and being involved in a \"corrupt relationship\" with three New Jersey businessmen. In exchange for thousands of dollars in cash and gold bars, a Mercedes-Benz convertible, home mortgage payments and more, Menendez allegedly agreed to use his power and influence as a U.S. senator to favor his co-conspirators. (Related: New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez and his wife charged with BRIBERY.)\n\nAll these high-profile controversies have rocked the blue-state stronghold. State Democrats have already withdrawn their support for Menendez, instead nominating Rep. Andy Kim of the state's third congressional district. Menendez has decided to continue seeking re-election as an independent, putting the state's Republican nominee, businessman Curtis Bashaw, in good position to become the first Republican that New Jersey sends to the U.S. Senate in a decade.\n\nWatch this episode of the \"Health Ranger Report\" as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, discusses how Menendez was allegedly bribed with gold bars.\n\nRACKETEERING: Sidney Powell says that voting contracts made by GOP state leaders in Georgia should be investigated.\n\nRACKETEERING: Google is a drug company that uses its platform to smear

But Norcross and his allies still ran into problems.\n\nThey did not own the land and lacked the rights to develop it, and Philadelphia-based developer Dranoff Properties had the right of first refusal for one lot and a view easement that would limit the height of construction in the other.\n\nNorcross and allies sought an end to the easement so they could construct the Triad1828 Centre -- the tallest building on Camden's waterfront, which now hosts Conner Strong & Buckelew, NFI, and the Michaels Organization -- but met with resistance from Carl Dranoff, the developer whom the indictment refers to as developer-1.\n\nNorcross is executive chairman of Conner Strong & Buckelew. NFI CEO Sidney Brown and Michaels Organization CEO John O'Donnell have also been charged.\n\nCity officials, including then-Mayor Dana Redd -- another co-defendant -- then stopped returning the developer's calls, and an offer followed, prosecutors claim. Dranoff Properties would receive $1.3 million in reimbursements and consulting fees plus $1 million to cede its development rights, its easement, and $18 million in state tax credits to Liberty Property Trust, the developer favored by Norcross, according to the indictment.\n\nThe offer included the promise of a push by Norcross allies to lobby the Camden Redevelopment Agency to issue permits that would lower the environmental remediation standards at a separate site the developer sought to redevelop, the indictment says. The firms played no legal role in that process.\n\nThe deal fell through the same day it was offered, and those in Norcross's orbit turned to other methods, prosecutors claim.\n\n\"I think we just do it. F**k 'em. F**k 'em. Just do it,\" Norcross said during a recorded conversation with his brother, according to the indictment.\n\nThe indictment alleges Norcross turned to two strategies: His team would have the Camden Redevelopment Agency challenge the easement in court, and they would challenge the developer's character in public.\n\nThe court filing was an effort to get the easement thrown out under the New Jersey Eminent Domain Act, which allows governments to seize private property under certain circumstances that include just compensation for the property owner.\n\nThere is no evidence the redevelopment agency intended to follow the process set out by that law, which requires the condemning agency to appraise the property to be seized and make a written offer that meets or exceeds its value before moving to condemn the building, prosecutors said.\n\nThe indictment says the developer feared the financial harms borne of Norcross's control of Camden government and his ability to do businesses elsewhere in the future. He ceded his easement and sold his $18 million in tax credits and his development rights for $1.95 million in October 2016.\n\nProsecutors allege Norcross and his allies resorted to coercive tactics over a separate site some 16 months later, when they charged Dranoff was responsible for stalled redevelopment at Radio Lofts, a former Radio Corporation of America building that could not be redeveloped because the Camden Redevelopment Agency could not secure sufficient financing for environmental remediation.\n\n\"He's gonna come under some serious accusations from the City of Camden, which are gonna basically suggest that he's not a reputable person and he's done nothing but try to impede the progress of the city,\" Norcross said on a recorded conference call, according to the indictment. \"You can never trust him until you got a bat over his head.\"\n\nOfficials began deriding the developer after he sued the city, the redevelopment agency, and others in 2018 after Camden moved to end his development rights on the Radio Lofts site.\n\n\"The city of Camden is taking action against those who have taken advantage of the city when it was down,\" then-Camden Mayor Frank Moran said when the city countersued Dranoff in 2018.\n\nThe developer settled that suit in 2023, agreeing to pay the city $3.3 million and cede redevelopment rights to the Radio Lofts site. He believed he was in the right, the indictment says, but \"had concerns over corruption in Camden which made him believe that he would not be treated fairly by the court system.\"\n\nThat accusation raised the hackles of Norcross attorney Michael Critchley, who likened them to Donald Trump's claims that his New York hush money conviction is the result of a corrupt judicial system.\n\n\"Why would an officer of the court, meaning Platkin, the attorney general, put shame unnecessarily, unjustly, and salaciously, on the entire court system of Camden, and in particular the judge,\" Critchley told the New Jersey Monitor. \"This is just out of Trump's playbook.\"\n\nConner Strong & Buckelew, NFI, and the Michaels Organization won more than $240 million in tax credits for the Triad1828 Centre through the now-defunct GROW NJ tax credit program. The three firms have received at least $29 million of those tax credits, prosecutors said, much of which they sold.\n\nThe Michaels Organization has received roughly $3.5 million in tax credits for 11 Cooper, a residential project on the site to which the developer had the right of first refusal. Michaels sold those tax credits for roughly $4.3 million.\n\nA Dranoff spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nThe indictment alleges similar misconduct over the nonprofit Coopers Ferry's redevelopment of an office building Cooper University Health Care wanted for its own offices. Norcross is chairman of the Cooper health system's board.\n\nPhilip Norcross railed at top officials at Cooper's Ferry over the project, saying it should be handed over to a private developer, the indictment claims. Prosecutors allege that within a day, he urged the nonprofit to partner with Ira Lubert, a Pennsylvania real estate mogul with financial ties to George Norcross whom the indictment calls Investor-1.\n\nCooper's Ferry entered a non-disclosure agreement with Lubert but chose another developer, a decision that immediately drew Norcross's ire, prosecutors say.\n\nTwo days later, on April 25, 2014, Philip Norcross, who held no formal role with the city or Cooper's Ferry, told the nonprofit it was not allowed to use its chosen developers, a statement then-Cooper's Ferry CEO Anthony Perno took as a threat, prosecutors allege.\n\nIn an email cited by the indictment, Perno called the two bids a \"false choice,\" saying Cooper's Ferry would likely not be able to close a deal with its chosen developers \"given the opposition.\"\n\nIn the end, Cooper's Ferry partnered with Norcross' chosen developer, netted just $125,000 for its work on the project, and never received shares of future profits promised to it during negotiations, the indictment alleges.\n\nThe nonprofit's agreement with its preferred developer would have seen it win 25% of future profits from the site. At the time of closing, the L3 site was appraised at roughly $54 million, tens of millions more than the $32.7 million Lubert's partnership paid for it.\n\nCooper Health had applied for tax incentives to cover the costs of rent at the site a month earlier, though in its applications to the state Economic Development Authority, it left out that it planned to purchase an interest in L3, prosecutors say.\n\nCooper Health received an award of nearly $40 million just 28 days after filing its application and, four months thereafter, purchased a 49% stake in the site for about $2.5 million. Between 2015 and 2020, Cooper Health received more than $27.1 million in tax incentives, which it sold for about $25.1 million.\n\nProsecutors allege Norcross and others then sought to shield their role in the saga. Norcross, during a 2016 FBI interview, claimed he did not know anyone at Cooper's Ferry, according to the indictment.\n\nBut Susan Bass Levin, who the indictment calls CC-1, joined the Cooper Ferry's board two years earlier. Bass Levin is CEO of the Cooper Foundation, the charitable arm of Cooper University Health Care.\n\nIn 2017, Norcross moved to oust Perno as he shifted officials through positions within his influence, prosecutors allege. Perno resigned at the urging of Bass Levin -- losing a full year in severance -- though his departure had less to do with his job performance than Norcross's view of his performance, prosecutors claimed.\n\nIf he refused to quit, officials would just invent a reason to remove him for cause and thereby deny him severance, Bass Levin said, according to the indictment.\n\nThe indictment recounts a conversation about Norcross that prosecutors claim Bass Levin had with Perno.\n\n\"You don't want that fight. Believe me when I tell you. If you don't think that he can't get to anybody he wants to, you're kidding yourself,\" Bass Levin said.\n\nMarino, the attorney representing Philip Norcross, said that exchange is an example of many in the indictment that prove no criminal activity and were included to create the appearance that George Norcross and his allies acted improperly.\n\n\"One party's telling another party that George Norcross can get anywhere and do anything. What is that doing in an indictment?\" Marino said. \"The reason this indictment runs to 111 pages is it takes a lot of work to construct what actually happened in such a way as to make it look like it violates the law. It doesn't.\"", "source": {"uri": "njtoday.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJTODAY.NET"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_incentive", "type": "wiki",

Today, one of those bosses has been accused by the state of running a corrupt criminal enterprise.\n\nGeorge E. Norcross, III, a prominent figure in New Jersey politics and business circles, faces serious legal repercussions following a detailed criminal indictment unveiled this week. The charges allege that Norcross orchestrated a criminal enterprise spanning over a decade, leveraging his political influence to unlawfully manipulate economic legislation and extort property rights in Camden, New Jersey.\n\nNorcross also holds power in Republican counties where his business partner in the insurance firm Conner, Strong, and Buckalew call the shots and wields power in Ocean County. The powerful firm operates the municipal joint insurance fund and controls who can get on the ballot with the blessing of the Republican party.\n\nBuckalew was asked to comment about the indictment against his political, business, and personal partner but refused to comment.\n\nNorcross, 64, known for his roles as a former Democratic National Committee member, chair of the Camden County Democratic Committee, and executive positions at Cooper University Health Care and Conner Strong & Buckelew, stands accused of leading what prosecutors have termed the \"Norcross Enterprise.\"\n\nHis brother, Phillip Norcross was also indicted.\n\nAccording to court documents, the enterprise operated from approximately 2012 onward, aiming to coerce and intimidate individuals and entities into surrendering valuable properties and associated tax incentives on the Camden waterfront. The scheme allegedly involved threats of economic ruin and reputational damage to enforce compliance with the enterprise's demands.\n\nKey allegations include Norcross personally threatening a developer holding crucial waterfront property rights, stating in recorded conversations, \"I will make sure you never do business in Camden again.\" The indictment further claims orchestrated efforts within the Camden city government to condemn and diminish the developer's standing, ultimately leading to significant financial concessions.\n\nFurther charges detail instances where Norcross and his associates purportedly intervened to influence nonprofit organizations and municipal decisions, directing transactions towards entities linked to the enterprise's interests. These actions reportedly included coercing a nonprofit redevelopment organization into partnering with a developer favored by the Norcross Enterprise, rather than its preferred choice, resulting in substantial financial benefits for the enterprise's associates.\n\nIn response to the indictment, Norcross's legal team has vowed to vigorously contest the charges, asserting that the allegations are unfounded and politically motivated. Meanwhile, prosecutors anticipate a lengthy legal process as they prepare to present evidence of what they describe as a calculated pattern of criminal conduct aimed at consolidating Norcross's personal and professional power.\n\nThe unfolding case has sent shockwaves through New Jersey's political landscape, raising questions about the extent of political influence in economic development and the accountability of high-profile figures in local governance.\n\nThe indictment marks a significant development in a case poised to reverberate across state politics and business sectors, as authorities seek to unravel the alleged web of corruption surrounding one of New Jersey's most influential figures.", "source": {"uri": "shorenewsnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shore News

He is an insurance broker by profession but built up what is known as the South Jersey machine, a Democrat political coalition considered one of the strongest in the state.\n\nThe Philadelphia Inquirer reported last year that investigators had issued several subpoenas and carried out dozens of interviews connected to the acquisition of parcels of real estate in Camden, New Jersey, by Norcross and his allies and alleged attempts to prevent potential rivals from competing.\n\nThe indictment against Norcross threatens both his political legacy and the story line he has helped to build over the last decade of Camden's comeback from decades of poverty and financial disinvestment.\n\nIt also threatens to shake up New Jersey's political map ahead of the state's gubernatorial race next year. Among the Democrats running for governor, with the backing of Norcross, is his childhood friend and one of his closest political allies, former state Senate President Stephen Sweeney.\n\nBrian Freeman \u2709\n\nBrian Freeman, a Newsmax writer based in Israel, has more than three decades writing and editing about culture and politics for newspapers, online and television.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_freeman@newsmax.com", "name": "Brian Freeman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racketeering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norcross,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Platkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Platkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Norcross", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Norcross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Philadelphia_Inquirer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Jersey"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Sweeney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Sweeney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Freeman_(psychological_suspense_author)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Freeman (psychological suspense author)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Political_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Political Science", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Tests_and_Quizzes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Tests and Quizzes", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=e943af70-d450-40ac-8ec8-51113fa76a4c&SiteName=Newsmax&maxsidesize=280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659259", "eventUri": "eng-9659259", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Cory Booker (D-N.J.) cuts an image as a moral authority in the Capitol, using his large social media platform and cable news appearances to condemn Republicans like Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh when he was a nominee for the Supreme Court.\n\nHe's a little more muddled when it comes to New Jersey -- a state lately in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.\n\nBooker took days to join the chorus calling for his friend and colleague Bob Menendez's resignation from the Senate after he was indicted a second time. Now, Booker speaks in general platitudes after the state's longtime Democratic kingmaker, George Norcross, was indicted by a state grand jury Monday.\n\n\"Anytime you see public figures getting indicted it's a sad time for our state,\" Booker said in an interview when asked about the allegations against Norcross, adding that he had not read the indictment yet. \"This is something that should be concerning.\"\n\nBooker occupies a unique place in New Jersey politics. He extols virtues of compassion and compromise while eschewing the sort of cut throat maneuvering people like Norcross trade in. And barring an extreme circumstance, Booker is the only Democrat today who will hold statewide office beyond 2025.\n\nBooker's muted response shows the reality of living in the two worlds he straddles: he often tries to stay above the fray but also must maintain friendships and alliances with some of the most aggressive politicians in America.\n\n\"When people have come up through a certain system, it becomes very difficult to criticize that system,\" said Democrat Sue Altman, former director of the Working Families Party group who is hoping to unseat Republican Rep. Tom Kean Jr. \"You see it with Republicans. We see it with Democrats. But I'm very encouraged that Democrats in New Jersey in general, are moving towards accountability and diversity and change.\"\n\nBooker is not the only one holding his tongue on Norcross, who has earned a reputation for striking fear into his loyalists and opponents alike. The indictment of one of New Jersey's most powerful political figures drew silence from both sides of the aisle Monday, from the governor down through the Legislature.\n\nDuring the press conference announcing his indictment, Norcross defiantly sat in the front row while Attorney General Matt Platkin read the allegations of a decade-long criminal \"enterprise.\"\n\nBooker rose to prominence without much help from Norcross, but they became allies and Norcross donated and helped raise money for Booker since becoming a senator a decade ago.\n\nMost of New Jersey's congressional delegation has stayed mum on the issue, which Jersey City mayor and 2025 candidate for governor Steven Fulop pointed out on social media.\n\n\"Bueller.... Bueller.... I know Monday can be a slow day in Congress but weird only two comments in the entire state??\" Fulop posted on X, tagging two anticipated rivals for the Democratic nomination, Democratic Reps. Josh Gottheimer and Mikie Sherrill (who later issued a statement).\n\nEven Rep. Andy Kim (D-N.J.) -- who was the first to call on Menendez to resign and now is likely to take his Senate seat after winning the Democratic nomination -- didn't mention Norcross by name in his statement.\n\n\"There's no doubt that NJ politics is going through a lot of turmoil,\" Kim said. \"But I believe we will come out of this better; that our democracy will be fairer and more tied to the people.\"\n\nOn Monday, Booker called the Norcross indictment \"disturbing\" when asked about it. But he reminded reporters that everyone is innocent until proven guilty. He's taken that same approach in the past, but when Trump was indicted in Manhattan last year, he added that it meant that a grand jury \"has decided that there is enough evidence to charge former President Trump with committing a crime.\"\n\nHe reiterated that the focus is on Norcross but that one other politician -- the mayor of Camden -- is also involved.\n\n\"One of the reasons it was so difficult to create a coalition against the South Jersey Democratic machine is because politicians in New Jersey -- and [that] include[s] Democrats and Republicans -- were very afraid of taking on George Norcross directly,\" Altman said. \"And those fears don't go away overnight. I think that you'll continue to see a general lack of courage among Democratic and Republican politicians in New Jersey until, and if, George Norcross is convicted.\"\n\nPatricia Campos-Medina, who ran for Menendez's seat but lost the Democratic nomination to Kim, said for many activists Norcross' indictment doesn't come as a surprise. But she said neither does Democrats' reservations to talk about the charges.\n\n\"Norcross was the Night King of New Jersey politics, like in 'Game of Thrones,'\" Campos-Medina said. \"You had to go to Norcross if you wanted to be in a statewide office. So he had a lot to say about elected officials.\"\n\nShe later added, \"Everyone is quiet because they don't know how deep the tentacles are going to go on this one.\"\n\nFormer New Jersey Sen. Bob Toriccelli said the muted reaction by other Democrats to the Norcross indictment is not unusual. There had been so much speculation about Norcross being investigated for years that \"people long ago dismissed the notion that it was serious.\"\n\n\"I think most of the silence is that it's a complete surprise,\" Torricelli said. But Booker, in particular, is \"not really identified\" with Norcross because he rose up the ranks without much support from him.\n\nHe said it's another indictment that's more \"problematic\" for Booker: that of his friend and colleague Menendez, now in the middle of his second bribery trial.\n\n\"He took a risk testifying for Menendez,\" Torricelli said. 'I admire his fidelity to the friendship with Menendez, but it obviously took a toll.\"\n\n\"If we are going to hold Trump and Republicans for their lies,\" Campos-Medina said, \"then we also need to hold Democrats accountable.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Booker", "type": "person",

This move was intended to save the township millions of dollars annually. Unbeknownst to Mayor Rodrick at the time, the broker he dismissed was under state and federal investigation for political corruption, racketeering, extortion, and operating a criminal enterprise.\n\nConnor Strong and Buckalew, located in Camden County with an office in Downtown Toms River, is owned and operated by South Jersey political figures George Norcross and Joe Buckalew. Norcross is considered New Jersey's most powerful unelected political official and a significant Democratic party powerbroker. Buckalew, a former chairman of the Ocean County GOP, remains a major political influence in the county. The two men are close friends and business partners who vacation together annually in Florida.\n\nRodrick declined to comment on the criminal matter when asked about the indictment.\n\nBuckalew and Norcross also operate the Joint Insurance Fund (JIF), a municipal insurance liability fund that nearly every municipality in Ocean County participates in. While the actual firm has not yet been accused of any wrongdoing, its political influence and contracts are derived from the power structure entrenched in local politics.\n\n\"I don't know about that or what's going on, but we switched providers based only on a financial decision for the township,\" Rodrick said. \"We are saving $2 million a year by cutting out the middleman insurance broker and dealing directly with Aetna. I am happy about that and happy we can continue finding ways to cut costs in Toms River.\"\n\nOn June 17, 2024, the New Jersey Attorney General's Office indicted George Norcross. Attorney General Matt Platkin announced the indictment against Norcross and five other defendants following a lengthy investigation into the powerful Democrat's business affairs.\n\nNorcross has been charged with multiple counts of racketeering and operating a criminal enterprise. The charges come after an extensive investigation into his activities in South Jersey and elsewhere. Mayor Rodrick confirmed that one of his first actions as mayor was to sever ties with Norcross' firm, which had been entrenched in the township for decades and rehired each year during former Mayor Maurice Hill's term.\n\nThe state charged Norcross with various counts of financial facilitation, misconduct by a corporate official, official misconduct, and conspiring to commit theft by extortion, criminal coercion, financial facilitation, and official misconduct. Rodrick declined to comment on the criminal matter, stating, \"I don't know about that or what's going on, but we switched providers based only on a financial decision for the township. We are saving $2 million a year by cutting out the middleman insurance broker and dealing directly with Aetna. I am happy about that and happy we can continue finding ways to cut costs in Toms River.\"\n\nThe FBI, which assisted in the investigation, emphasized their collaboration with the New Jersey Attorney General's Office and other state agencies. Special Agent in Charge James Dennehy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Newark Field Office stated, \"We work each day with the New Jersey Attorney General's Office and other state agencies, creating effective and lasting relationships. We are always willing to support and assist when our partners ask. We will do everything within our purview to bring to justice anyone accused of wrongdoing.\"\n\nAt his own indictment press conference, Norcross was present in the front row. Attorney General Platkin announced, \"The indictment unsealed today alleges that George Norcross has been running a criminal enterprise in this state for at least the last twelve years. On full display in this indictment is how a group of unelected, private businessmen used their power and influence to get government to aid their criminal enterprise and further its interests. The alleged conduct of the Norcross Enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, non-profits, the people of the State of New Jersey, and especially the City of Camden and its residents. That stops today. We must never accept politics and government - that is funded with tax dollars - to be weaponized against the people it serves. Today, we reaffirm that no one in our state is above the law.\"\n\nThe indictment includes charges against the following individuals:\n\nThe indictment alleges that from as early as 2012, the Norcross Enterprise used its power and influence over government officials to craft legislation tailored to serve the interests of the enterprise. With the cooperation of then-Camden Mayor Dana Redd and other officials, they used parts of the city's government to aid the enterprise in acquiring property and property rights for itself and others through coercion, extortion, and other criminal acts. All six defendants are charged with first-degree racketeering.", "source": {"uri": "shorenewsnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shore News Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(AP) -- Being a political boss in New Jersey ain't what it used to be.\n\nMonday's indictment on racketeering charges of Democratic power broker George E. Norcross III by state Attorney General Matt Platkin caps a series of blows to influential figures in the state's dominant political party and adds to a sense of turbulence in the blue-state stronghold.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThere's the ongoing federal bribery case against Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, who's pleaded not guilty in a New York trial that has consistently delivered glimpses of the tawdry underbelly of Garden State politics. There's the fall this year of a century-old, unique-to-New Jersey primary ballot system that allowed party bosses to give preferred placement to endorsed candidates.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAnd now there's the indictment of Norcross, who Platkin said stepped across legal lines in orchestrating tax benefits for entities he controlled. Norcross angrily denied doing anything wrong.\n\nIt all comes months before the November general election, as Democrats look to hold on to a U.S. Senate seat they didn't expect to have to fight for in a year when their thin majority is already in jeopardy. Republicans, meanwhile, have found new reasons to be optimistic about their chances to win a seat they haven't held in more than five decades.\n\nSome New Jersey progressives see the unfolding chaos as part of an overdue cleanup in the messy politics of a state they have long dominated. Other observers draw a parallel to what has happened nationally in the Republican Party, where the power of establishment Republicans has given way to a more chaotic brand of populism espoused by former President Donald Trump and others like him.\n\nThey see it as a dissipation of centralized control all across the political spectrum -- perhaps even a restoration of power to the people.\n\n\"What we're really seeing is pushback against things that people would have gotten away with some time ago,\" Daniel Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll. \"This is basically saying, I think that these parties are out of touch with what voters want, and the energy of the party and both Republican and Democratic Party is very much on the side of the people who are against the institutional party.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nPlatkin, a Democrat, argued that it's time for the state to leave behind its reputation for ugly politics, a legacy that has been helped along at times in caricature, whether in fictional scenes from \"The Sopranos\" or in the minds of those who embrace it as a badge of honor.\n\n\"It's often said that in New Jersey politics is a blood sport,\" he said Monday. \"What's meant by that is that if you don't go along with the demands of those in political power, you'll get hurt. ... There is nothing inherent in our state's culture that requires us to accept politics and government that functions in this way.\"\n\nNorcross cast Platkin's prosecution of him as politically motivated. He called Platkin a coward and demanded the trial start in two weeks.\n\nHe's charged with operating a criminal enterprise over more than a decade, starting in 2012, in which he threatened property owners whose land he sought to acquire, used Camden city government to acquire land and tailored legislation for tax incentives that benefited companies he controlled. Those allegations have been the subject of investigations for years, with Norcross denying any wrongdoing and praising the good his investments did for the economically hard-up city of Camden, across the Delaware River from Philadelphia.\n\nA longtime kingmaker in southern New Jersey, Norcross often wielded influence through back channels. An old friend of the former Senate president and current gubernatorial candidate Steve Sweeney, Norcross played a key role in getting economic tax incentive legislation passed in 2013. His brothers are lobbyist and co-defendant Philip Norcross -- who's fighting the charges as well -- and Rep. Donald Norcross, a former state legislator.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nGeorge Norcross is the wealthy executive of an insurance firm and, until 2021, a Democratic National Committee member who also contributed financially to state and national Democrats. He's since moved to Palm Beach, Florida, where he had been listed before as a member of Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.\n\nHe's long been a boogeyman of many progressive New Jersey Democrats, who saw him as enriching himself while poorer residents languished. On Monday, some of them cheered his indictment. Antoinette Mills, who heads the Working Families Party, called on officials to denounce Norcross' behavior. Murphy and other top Democrats have yet to weigh in.\n\nSue Altman, a Democratic candidate in the 7th District and longtime critic of Norcross, viewed the indictment -- along with Menendez's federal trial and the end of the so-called county line -- as part of a year of \"corruption busting\" in the state. Altman was once dragged by state police from a legislative hearing in 2019 at which Norcross was defending himself and the tax credits his organizations received. Her removal by troopers encapsulated his ability to influence lawmakers, she said in an interview.\n\n\"My getting thrown out, I think, ended up distilling that moment. And yes, that was very much on my mind,\" she said. \"I think it represents a new beginning in New Jersey.\"\n\nMenendez's September indictment on charges that he, his wife and three business associates engaged in a scheme in which the senator traded promises to use his office for cash, gold bars and a luxury vehicle, saw his party largely abandon him.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe declined to run as a Democrat for reelection this year, and filed this month to get on the ballot as an independent. His trial is underway in New York. Republicans, in a minority in state government, cast Menendez as a symptom of what's wrong with the Democratic majority.\n\nMenendez's refusal to heed the advice of fellow Democrats and resign led Rep. Andy Kim to become a Senate candidate last year. When the governor's spouse, first lady Tammy Murphy, looked assured of winning significant county party backing, Kim sued to stop the primary ballot system widely viewed as helping insiders.\n\nTammy Murphy, saying she wanted to avoid a negative campaign among Democrats, dropped out, and a federal judge ordered a temporary halt to the ballot design, bringing New Jersey in line with the rest of the country -- at least for this year.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_boss",

One characterized it as an \"embarrassment\" that won't hold up in court.\n\n\"I don't think there's any one fact that's new, that already wasn't hashed and rehashed over the years,\" Norcross attorney Michael Critchley said in an interview Tuesday.\n\n\"It's not based upon reality. It's not based upon new facts. It's based upon stale facts that have been tossed over,\" he added. \"That's why we say it's a political vendetta.\"\n\nState Attorney General Matt Platkin's office did not return a message seeking comment.\n\nThe indictment stretches back over a decade and covers areas that had been reported on by multiple news outlets over the years, such as Norcross and his associates' involvement in state tax credit awards in his native South Jersey and development deals along the Delaware River waterfront. A state task force investigated tax breaks in 2019, when Platkin was chief counsel for Gov. Phil Murphy, and issued a scathing report saying the state improperly awarded hundreds of millions of dollars in tax credits.\n\nAuthorities had looked into tax breaks years before and, in 2016, federal investigators in Pennsylvania tapped Norcross' phone. In 2018, the U.S. Attorney's Office for New Jersey told Critchley in a letter that it looked into Norcross' connection to tax credits and \"that no further action is warranted.\" The attorney general's office issued subpoenas related to tax credits in 2019, under a different attorney general, but charges weren't brought until Monday.\n\nLawyers for Norcross and his co-defendants questioned the lag.\n\n\"This has been looked at more times than 'Rocky' sequels -- over and over and over and over and over -- and nothing came of it,\" Critchley said. \"And all of a sudden, Matt Platkin, who himself is trying to basically use his position to run for elected office ... just wanted a bank of reporters in front of him so he could have his press conference.\"\n\nPlatkin's indictment of Norcross is one of two extraordinary actions he's taken in recent months thrusting him into the spotlight. During the Senate Democratic primary, he took the rare step of weighing in on an election lawsuit that went against the interest of first lady Tammy Murphy, saying the state's infamous ballot line system was unconstitutional.\n\nNow Platkin is among a crop of young Democrats who could play a significant role in transitioning New Jersey politics into a new era.\n\nOne of the other defense attorneys, Kevin Marino, dismissed Platkin's legal skills, saying he had little experience before becoming the state's top law enforcement official.\n\n\"And he has decided in his infinite wisdom, and based on his many minutes of experience, that he is going to bring this sort of an indictment. I cannot find a crime in here,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tax credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Platkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Platkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Norcross", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Norcross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Murphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delaware River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/D7jPxjO.US7PCuTJngbbLA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/db6bd5f360f6dfbc5699d87379795679", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659259", "eventUri": "eng-9659259", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Other observers draw a parallel to what has happened nationally in the Republican Party, where the power of establishment Republicans has given way to a more chaotic brand of populism espoused by former President Donald Trump and others like him.\n\nThey see it as a dissipation of centralized control all across the political spectrum -- perhaps even a restoration of power to the people.\n\n\"What we're really seeing is pushback against things that people would have gotten away with some time ago,\" Daniel Cassino, executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll. \"This is basically saying, I think that these parties are out of touch with what voters want, and the energy of the party and both Republican and Democratic Party is very much on the side of the people who are against the institutional party.\"\n\nPlatkin, a Democrat, argued that it's time for the state to leave behind its reputation for ugly politics, a legacy that has been helped along at times in caricature, whether in fictional scenes from \"The Sopranos\" or in the minds of those who embrace it as a badge of honor.\n\n\"It's often said that in New Jersey politics is a blood sport,\" he said Monday. \"What's meant by that is that if you don't go along with the demands of those in political power, you'll get hurt. ... There is nothing inherent in our state's culture that requires us to accept politics and government that functions in this way.\"\n\nNorcross cast Platkin's prosecution of him as politically motivated. He called Platkin a coward and demanded the trial start in two weeks.\n\nHe's charged with operating a criminal enterprise over more than a decade, starting in 2012, in which he threatened property owners whose land he sought to acquire, used Camden city government to acquire land and tailored legislation for tax incentives that benefited companies he controlled. Those allegations have been the subject of investigations for years, with Norcross denying any wrongdoing and praising the good his investments did for the economically hard-up city of Camden, across the Delaware River from Philadelphia.\n\nA longtime kingmaker in southern New Jersey, Norcross often wielded influence through back channels. An old friend of the former Senate president and current gubernatorial candidate Steve Sweeney, Norcross played a key role in getting economic tax incentive legislation passed in 2013.

It's not based upon new facts. It's based upon stale facts that have been tossed over,\" he added. \"That's why we say it's a political vendetta.\"\n\nState Attorney General Matt Platkin's office did not return a message seeking comment.\n\nThe indictment stretches back over a decade and covers areas that had been reported on by multiple news outlets over the years, such as Norcross and his associates' involvement in state tax credit awards in his native South Jersey and development deals along the Delaware River waterfront. A state task force investigated tax breaks in 2019, when Platkin was chief counsel for Gov. Phil Murphy, and issued a scathing report saying the state improperly awarded hundreds of millions of dollars in tax credits.\n\nAuthorities had looked into tax breaks years before and, in 2016, federal investigators in Pennsylvania tapped Norcross' phone. In 2018, the U.S. Attorney's Office for New Jersey told Critchley in a letter that it looked into Norcross' connection to tax credits and \"that no further action is warranted.\" The attorney general's office issued subpoenas related to tax credits in 2019, under a different attorney general, but charges weren't brought until Monday.\n\nLawyers for Norcross and his co-defendants questioned the lag.\n\n\"This has been looked at more times than 'Rocky' sequels -- over and over and over and over and over -- and nothing came of it,\" Critchley said. \"And all of a sudden, Matt Platkin, who himself is trying to basically use his position to run for elected office ... just wanted a bank of reporters in front of him so he could have his press conference.\"\n\nPlatkin's indictment of Norcross is one of two extraordinary actions he's taken in recent months thrusting him into the spotlight. During the Senate Democratic primary, he took the rare step of weighing in on an election lawsuit that went against the interest of first lady Tammy Murphy, saying the state's infamous ballot line system was unconstitutional.\n\nNow Platkin is among a crop of young Democrats who could play a significant role in transitioning New Jersey politics into a new era.\n\nOne of the other defense attorneys, Kevin Marino, dismissed Platkin's legal skills, saying he had little experience before becoming the state's top law enforcement official.\n\n\"And he has decided in his infinite wisdom, and based on his many minutes of experience, that he is going to bring this sort of an indictment.

Norcross III appears to remain in his role as board chairman of South Jersey's massive Cooper Health System following state charges that for more than a decade he has run a criminal enterprise that let him and others benefit from public resources intended to help Camden.\n\nThe state attorney general's office announced a 13-count indictment Monday that alleges Norcross and several co-defendants -- including his brother Philip, a politically connected attorney, and former state senator and Camden Mayor Dana Redd -- were involved in various real estate deals that allowed them to cash in on a state tax-incentive law designed to spur growth in Camden, long one of the state's most impoverished cities.\n\nPhilip Norcross also chairs the board of the Cooper Foundation, the health system's philanthropic arm. The Norcross family -- which also includes U.S. Rep. Donald Norcross (D-1st) -- has proudly highlighted its connection to Cooper and its roots in Camden, where George Norcross's powerful insurance company, Conner Strong & Buckelew, is also based. There are more than 100 references to Cooper Health in the 111-page indictment.\n\nRepresentatives for Cooper Health, which operates Cooper University Hospital and other facilities in Camden as well as Willingboro and Voorhees, did not respond to several requests for comment.\n\nBut George Norcross told reporters he is innocent following Monday's announcement of the charges in Trenton, which he attended in person, sitting in the front row directly across from Attorney General Matt Platkin.\n\n\"The alleged conduct of the Norcross Enterprise has caused great harm to individuals, businesses, nonprofits, the people of the State of New Jersey, and especially the City of Camden and its residents. That stops today,\" Platkin said, barely acknowledging Norcross's presence.\n\nCamden ties\n\nCooper Health and its flagship 660-bed Cooper University Hospital -- the region's only Level 1 Trauma Center and one of just three such programs recognized by the state -- have long served as anchors in Camden, a struggling former industrial hub now home to 71,000 people. More than half of Camden residents identify as Hispanic and nearly 43% are Black, according to U.S. census data from 2022, and nearly one-third live in poverty.\n\nThe Cooper Health System is not poor, however, noting on its website that Moody's Investors Service upgraded its credit to A3 last year, the highest ever. Cooper received hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, in part because of its role as a trauma center. It also gets tens of millions more through the annual state budget because it is a teaching hospital and serves such a low-income community.\n\nGeorge Norcross was often front and center when Cooper Health announced good news, positioned with a golden shovel next to government officials or other business leaders at groundbreaking events.\n\nIn this year, it also collected nearly $20 million in state funds to offset the cost of treating people without insurance. Changes proposed for the state's charity care program mean this could rise to $36 million in the coming year, based on a budget proposal lawmakers must finalize with Gov. Phil Murphy by July 1.\n\nFounded in the 1870s as the 30-bed Cooper Hospital, the facility \"quickly became a cornerstone in the community,\" according to its website, and soon added a training program for nurses. The hospital continued to expand as the city grew and by the early 1960s, Cooper was the largest nonprofit hospital in New Jersey.\n\nWork on a new 10-story building began in 1976 and the following year Cooper codified an agreement with the University of Medicine and Dentistry/Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, making it the first academic medical facility in South Jersey.\n\nNearly 35 years\n\nGeorge Norcross joined the Cooper board in 1990, as he built a political and business network that eventually became entrenched in state affairs.\n\nOutpatient offices eventually followed and by 1996 the hospital changed its name to Cooper Health System, to reflect the broader services available, the website notes. A massive state investment in 2004 led to a $220 million health science complex and a new 10-story hospital opened four years later.\n\nIn 2012, a partnership with Rowan University led to the opening of a new medical school, which graduated its first class four years later. During this period another agreement with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston allowed Cooper to greatly expand its cancer-care options in South Jersey.\n\nNorcross was often front and center when Cooper Health announced good news, positioned with a golden shovel next to government officials or other business leaders at groundbreaking events. He joined then-Gov. Chris Christie on site for the announcement of the MD Anderson agreement in 2013, welcoming the nationally acclaimed program to New Jersey.\n\n\"MD Anderson is not only the number one cancer center in the country, it's the number one cancer center in the galaxy,\" Norcross said at the time. \"And we are so proud that not only will they be in New Jersey but they're coming to Camden, New Jersey, a place that is changing, a place that's changing for the better.\"\n\nChristie, a Republican who worked well with Norcross and his Democratic allies in the Legislature, went on to restructure medical education in New Jersey, dissolving UMDNJ and giving Rutgers University control over state-backed medical schools in Newark and New Brunswick. He also made sure Rowan would be able to operate its osteopathic medicine program and continue to partner with Cooper.\n\nCooper's emergency medical response teams were part of a pilot program that enabled them to immediately provide medications to treat substance abuse in patients who had experienced an overdose and been revived with the opioid-reversal agent naloxone, commonly known as Narcan. Eventually, New Jersey became the first state to permit this work statewide and Dr. Kaitlan Baston, a leader in Cooper's effort, was tapped by Murphy in the summer of 2023 to serve as state health commissioner, replacing Judy Persichilli who was retiring.\n\n'Our friends'\n\nMonday's indictment suggests Norcross was more interested in his own gains than helping Camden, however. Platkin alleges Norcross and his allies \"conspired to, and did, extort and coerce\" a local nonprofit to turn over development rights to a valuable waterfront building that it had purchased at a discount. \"The entities that benefitted, including Cooper Health and [Norcross's insurance firm, Connor, Strong & Buckelew], then occupied the properties they obtained interests in and sold the tax credits they obtained for millions of dollars,\" it reads.\n\nCooper Health was able to buy a 49% share of the building, known as the L3 Complex, which also houses the system's main office, the indictment notes. Cooper eventually obtained more than $27 million in tax credits through a special state program designed to boost investment in Camden, based on a law Philip Norcross helped write, according to the allegations. The family even intervened as the state drafted regulations to implement the law to ensure that the hospital would be able to benefit financially from the credits, according to the charges.\n\n\"This is for our friends,\" George Norcross told key allies during a phone call about the tax-credit legislation, according to the indictment.\n\nThe charges include first-degree crimes that carry a sentence of 10 to 20 years in state prison and a fine of up to $200,000, Platkin said. An arrangement is scheduled for July 9 in Mercer County Superior Court.", "source": {"uri": "njspotlightnews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ Spotlight News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lilo_h_stainton@njspotlightnews.org", "name": "Lilo H.

{"uri": "2024-06-393347612", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-06-18", "time": "10:56:08", "dateTime": "2024-06-18T10:56:08Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-06-18T06:55:00Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "url": "https://www.politico.com/newsletters/new-jersey-playbook/2024/06/18/norcross-indicted-00163835", "title": "George Norcross indicted", "body": "Yesterday was a \"where were you when it happened\" day in New Jersey politics.\n\nAttorney General Matt Platkin announced a bombshell indictment against South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross -- as well as key players in the South Jersey Democratic political machine -- accusing the defendants of a 12-year criminal racket. The alleged criminal scheme is complex and wide-ranging, centering on waterfront development projects in Camden, supposedly ill-gotten tax breaks and political bossism in Camden. All 111 pages are here for some light morning reading.\n\nBut beyond the complexities of tax breaks and development projects, the criminal charges also appeared to be an indictment on New Jersey politics itself -- something Platkin acknowledged during his press conference.\n\n\"It's often said that in New Jersey politics is a blood sport. And what's meant by that is that if you don't go along with the demands of those in political power, you'll get hurt,\" Platkin said. \"... But there is nothing inherent in our state's culture that requires us to accept politics and government that functions in this way.\"\n\nNorcross watched Platkin say this, up close and personal. The multi-millionaire showed up at the press conference uninvited (and without socks, as many Twitter users have noted), sitting at the seat closest to the podium. After the press conference, he said he was innocent and made personal attacks on Platkin, calling him a \"coward.\" (Platkin seldom made any eye contact with Norcross -- if at all -- during the presser and just said \"no comment\" when asked about his unexpected guest.)\n\nThe bombshell charges are just the latest in what has been a monumental year in state politics. Between the indictment -- and political downfall -- of Sen. Bob Menendez, the county line being on life support and now this, 2024 may become known as the year where New Jersey's culture of political bossism came crumbling down.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: \"George hates Starbucks.\" -- Phil Norcross, George's brother and co-defendant, as per the unsealed indictment.\n\nProgramming note: Playbook will be off Wednesday in observation of Juneteenth (Yes, I know the State of New Jersey celebrates Juneteenth on Friday. Read NJ Advance Media's explainer of why that is here.)\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY: Brian Boyell, James Corti, Matthew Frankel, George Geist, John McCarthy, Carmen Rodriguez\n\nWHERE'S MURPHY? -- Calling in to WQHT Hot 97's Ebro in the Morning to Preview Clemency announcement at 9:40 a.m. and delivering remarks at the New Jersey Hall of Fame Entertainment and Learning Center Ribbon Cutting Ceremony in East Rutherford at 2 p.m.\n\nNORCROSS NEWS -- New Jersey AG charges Democratic power broker George Norcross in bombshell indictment, by POLITICO's Daniel Han and Dustin Racioppi: New Jersey's attorney general on Monday charged one of the state's most powerful Democrats and his allies in a sweeping indictment alleging a long-running corruption scheme. The charges against George Norcross represent another seismic event in New Jersey politics in a year that's already seen a drastic disruption of its notorious boss systems. And George Norcross is often held up as the symbol of a New Jersey political boss. He has long been the subject of scrutiny by law enforcement and a political task force, but has never been charged.\n\n-- POLITICO: New Jersey's top political boss stared down the AG at press conference announcing his indictment\n\n-- POLITICO: An 'atomic bomb' just fell on one of America's most powerful party bosses\n\n-- POLITICO: Racketeering, extortion and other 'criminal activity': the Norcross charges explained\n\n-- Moran: \"The Norcross indictment revives questions on Sheridan killings\"\n\n-- Inquirer: \"Who is George Norcross? A look at the indicted South Jersey power broker\"\n\n-- NJ Globe: \"Moriarty tells Dem municipal chair charged with corruption to resign\"\n\nTHIS ALSO HAPPENED -- Radio host Spadea announces run for governor, by POLITICO's Dustin Racioppi: Bill Spadea, the conservative NJ 101.5 morning show host, formalized a years-long build-up for higher office by announcing Monday he's running for governor next year. \"I've listened to the concerns and heard the message loud and clear. New Jerseyans are ready for a fighter,\" Spadea said in a statement. \"Weak politicians have failed us time and time again and the people of New Jersey deserve better.\" In an accompanying video, Spadea used familiar Republican tropes to portray a Democratic-run state run amok. It shows a \"drag queen story hour,\" a news headline about an immigrant charged with raping a woman in front of her child and a group of purported migrants \"getting free handouts on your dime.\"\n\n-- \"No shortage of opinions on what defines antisemitism,\" by NJ Spotlight News' Ted Goldberg: \"Five hours was not enough time to fit in everyone who wanted to share their opinions about a possible new official definition for antisemitism in New Jersey. A Senate hearing drew 600 people who requested to comment about whether New Jersey should adopt the definition of antisemitism as outlined by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, which includes certain criticisms of Israel. That drew considerable support but also vehement opposition during fiery testimony Monday, which included frequent interruptions and occasional obscenities.\"\n\n-- Senate Dems officially back Murphy's proposal for no cost-sharing for abortion, by POLITICO's Daniel Han: Senate Democratic leadership is throwing support behind Gov. Phil Murphy's longstanding goal of providing abortion coverage without cost-sharing on state-regulated health plans. Senate Majority Leader Teresa Ruiz and Senate President Nick Scutari announced new legislation that would do just that, promising in a Monday press release to schedule the bill, NJ S3452 (24R), for a committee hearing this month with the intention of a full Senate soon after. The measure also precludes medical malpractice insurers from penalizing policyholders in New Jersey for helping with abortion or gender-affirming care on the basis that it is illegal in another state.\n\n- Stile: \"Congestion pricing's death is a political win for NJ Democrats. At what cost?\"\n\nLAWSUIT MOVES FORWARD, UNLIKE MANHATTAN TRAFFIC -- \"Feds want a decision in N.J. lawsuit to block $15 congestion pricing fee to enter Lower Manhattan,\" by NJ Advance Media's Larry Higgs: \"With the June 30 start of New York's congestion pricing plan on hold, federal officials told a judge that a ruling is still needed in New Jersey's lawsuit to block the proposal to charge $15 to drive into lower Manhattan. Federal Highway Administration officials also have approved the $15 congestion pricing rates to enter lower Manhattan, despite Gov. Hochul decision pausing it earlier this month 'Notwithstanding New York Governor Kathleen Hochul's announcement of a 'pause' in the implementation of the (congestion pricing ) Project, the lawsuit is not moot,' Assistant U.S. Attorney General Todd Kim wrote on Friday. 'The lawfulness of the agency's action remains very much a live legal issue.'\"\n\nJan 6 -- \"Ex-N.J. trooper acquitted of Jan. 6 felonies, convicted of lesser offenses, lawyer says,\" by NJ Advance Media's Kevin Shea: \"A retired New Jersey State Police trooper was acquitted at trial Friday of two federal felony charges that accused him of obstructing police officers outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, his lawyer said. Michael Daniele, of Holmdel, was convicted of four misdemeanors, though his lawyer Stuart Kaplan says there's a chance those lesser charges could be dismissed before his October sentencing. Daniele opted for a bench trial, where the judge is also the jury. It concluded Friday in federal court in Washington, D.C. in front of Judge Amit P. Mehta. Mehta found Daniele not guilty of the obstruction charges, Kaplan said. He believes it was because he was able to show that the photos the FBI used to charge his client were taken out of context.\"\n\nLAW IS ON ICE -- \"Immigrant advocates alarmed by prospect of new immigrant jail in Newark,\" by The Monitor's Sophie Nieto-Munoz: \"Immigrant advocates in New Jersey are alarmed that a federal judge's 2023 ruling that allowed a private immigrant jail to remain open could mean there is little they can do to prevent another immigrant detention center from opening in Newark. ... Dolly Hernandez, executive director of immigrant rights advocacy organization Casa Freehold, said she's troubled by a recent letter from the state Attorney General's Office to the federal judge that could make it easier for the new jail to open. ... On April 25, Solicitor General Jeremy M. Feigenbaum, writing on behalf of Platkin's office, told Kirsch that as long as Kirsch's order regarding CoreCivic is still in effect, the state would not attempt to enforce the 2021 law with regard to GEO Group.\"\n\nCHEEKY -- \"'Nuttin' But Azz' Basketball Tournament at High School in Newark 'Not Authorized'\" by TapInto Newark's Matt Kadosh: \"A basketball tournament advertised to feature scantily clad women at West Side High School next month was 'not authorized,' despite a cheeky video from the organizer promoting the event, the West Ward Councilman told TAPinto Newark. An event page advertises the 'Nuttin' Butt Azz/NBA Baddies Basketball Tournament NJ' scheduled to happen at West Side High School on July 21, and a widely shared video promoting the event shows women with large bottoms dancing in a school gymnasium. ... West Ward Councilman Dupr\u00e9 \"Doitall\" Kelly, in a statement to TAPinto Newark, said his office was contacted by a third party about the cost associated with and availability of using space at the high school for a 'community basketball game,' but he did not authorize plans for the event.\"\n\nGLOUCO BATTLE -- \"Wingate defeats Vigilante in Gloucester GOP chair race,\" by New Jersey Globe's David Wildstein: \"\"Former Harrison Township Committeeman Adam Wingate ousted incumbent Jacci Vigilante in the race for Gloucester County Republican chair tonight in a county that has been sharply divided since a bitter primary last year. Wingate, 34, ran for Gloucester County Commissioner in 2022 but lost by one percentage point. He ran again last year and lost the Republican primary by a 1% margin. Republicans had appeared to be surging in 2021 after winning two county commissioner seats and the sheriff's office.\"\n\n-- Pix 11: \"Newark students brace for heat without air conditioning\"\n\n- The Record: \"Bergen County gets additional $3M to fight opioid addiction.

It describes a real estate deal that created a serious rift between Norcross and John Sheridan, Mark's father, a deeply respected advisor to governors in both parties. Norcross and the senior Sheridan had been friends, but in the months before Sheridan's violent death, he told his son that he was deeply troubled by a stubborn argument with Norcross over a patch of land on the Camden waterfront. At the time of the Sheridans' death in September 2014, the dining room table was covered with documents about this dispute.\n\nThe land at stake was controlled by a non-profit, Coopers Ferry, and John Sheridan, the chairman of the board, wanted to hold onto it, and use it to support the non-profit's mission. The indictment issued Monday accuses Norcross of using strong-arm threats to force the non-profit to surrender the land and yield to a partnership that was partially controlled by Norcross himself.\n\nAfter the killings, Mark Sheridan brought those papers to the attorney general's office, encouraging an investigation into the dispute between the two men.\n\n\"They did nothing,\" he says. \"I provided the attorney general with evidence of the crimes related to the real estate deals that are outlined in the indictment nearly nine years ago. Imagine how much of this could have been avoided if John Hoffman did his job.\"\n\nHoffman was acting attorney general at the time, but he left office without finding the alleged crimes that Attorney General Matt Platkin now describes in grotesque detail. As if this case needed still more political weight, Hoffman was recently nominated for a seat on the state Supreme Court by Gov. Phil Murphy. Calls and emails to his office went unreturned Monday.\n\nAt Platkin's press conference, WNYC's Nancy Solomon asked the question that is now on many minds: \"John Sheridan was trying to fight off this deal, and those documents were found on his dining room table the morning after he was murdered. Is your office looking at that case? And how do you see the murder of John and Joyce Sheridan as connected to the conspiracy you laid out today?\"\n\nPlatkin said he had \"nothing more to add.\"\n\nTo be clear, there is not a scrap of evidence that Norcross ordered the Sheridans killed; and Solomon, who has done the deepest dives into Norcross' shady real estate deals on the Camden waterfront, has never explicitly accused him of that. But the more you learn about the deaths of the Sheridans, the harder it becomes to dismiss the idea as a nutty conspiracy theory.\n\nSome background: The Sheridans' bodies were found after their home burned down on Sept. 28, 2014, and the investigation was marked from the start by incompetence that is almost hard to believe. Somerset County prosecutors quickly concluded that it was a murder-suicide, that John Sheridan stabbed his wife, Joyce, started the fire by spreading around gasoline, and then stabbed himself in the neck.\n\nThere was no history of violence, no gambling debt, no drugs, not even a theory as to why a marriage of 47 years - a happy marriage, according to family and friends - would suddenly explode into such gruesome violence. Could they have been killed by someone else, who lit the fire to cover up evidence?\n\nNo one dusted for fingerprints to see if an intruder entered the house through one of four unlocked doors. Two months after the killing, an insurance adjuster inspecting the home found a bag full of jewelry in a closet off the master bedroom. Investigators had somehow missed it.\n\nFinally, the Sheridan family paid for a private autopsy, which showed the knife that killed Joyce Sheridan could not possibly be the same knife that killed John Sheridan, as prosecutors said. That knife was never recovered.\n\nIn the end, the authorities conceded that the murder-suicide theory was bunk. The case was reclassified as an unsolved mystery. The prosecutor was later replaced.\n\nNorcross, always the aggressor, showed up at Platkin's press conference Monday and took a seat in the front row. He ain't afraid of nothing. One of his attorneys, Mike Critchley, denied any wrongdoing in the Coopers Ferry land deal, one of several deals cited in the indictment, and said he has documents to prove it. He said Norcross has been offering to talk with Platkin's investigators for six months, but they waited until last week and gave him two hours.\n\n\"Why didn't he (Platkin) subpoena him (Norcross) and let him talk to the grand jury?\" Critchley asks.\n\nThe politics behind this are hard to decipher. Gov. Phil Murphy smoked a peace pipe with Norcross a few years ago, and even helps him raise money these days.\n\nMurphy has been furious with Platkin, according to several sources, since Platkin went rogue and intervened in the federal case on ballot design in Democratic primaries, siding with Andy Kim, who successfully argued that the ballots tipped the scale in favor of endorsed candidates. That ruling put a knife through the heart of Tammy Murphy's Senate campaign.\n\nAs for the governor's race, this is bad news for Steve Sweeney, the former Senate president, who is a lifetime friend and ally of Norcross. Norcross' iron grip on South Jersey, a pillar of Sweeney's strength, is likely a thing of the past.\n\nAnd as Platkin noted, this investigation is continuing. Who knows where the next blow will land?", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Sheridan", "type":

Norcross, seated in the front row during a news conference by Attorney General Matt Platkin, angrily denounced the charges, later calling Platkin a \"coward\" and demanding a speedy trial.", "source": {"uri": "timesnownews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TimesNow"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racketeering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Norcross", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Norcross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_incentive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax incentive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Platkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Platkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedy_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speedy trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norcross,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norcross, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Power_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Power Supplies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Substation_and_Transmission", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Substation and Transmission", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Rowing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Rowing", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Brokers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Brokers", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://static.tnn.in/thumb/msid-111072395,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-75/111072395.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659259", "eventUri": "eng-9659259", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

It's morbid and upsetting. And to be clear, neither victim in the recently reopened murder investigation was actually mentioned (by name, at least) in the indicment, but a storyline central to John Sheridan's last hours on earth figures quite significantly in the jaw-dropping 111-page document unsealed by the New Jersey Attorney General on Monday.\n\nThe storyline in question is the sordid saga of the Coopers Ferry land deal of the mid-2010s when Chris Christie was still New Jersey's governor (h/t ProPublica):\n\nOn a frigid morning in March 2014, Philip Norcross met with Cooper's Ferry's top executive at City Hall. Norcross told him that even though the nonprofit had exclusive rights to buy L3, another group was now interested in purchasing and developing the complex, according to correspondence among nonprofit officials. That group's principal player was one of George Norcross' former business partners.\n\nCooper's Ferry's leaders initially resisted. \"As you know, we do believe we can do this on our own,\" the nonprofit CEO wrote to its board chairman. \"I am OK w a conversation but don't want to lose out on the opportunity.\"\n\nThree months later, however, the nonprofit changed course. It wrote a letter to the state that June, saying it wanted to transfer its option to buy the L3 complex to the group connected to George Norcross. By the time the deal closed at the end of the year, there was another partner as well: a subsidiary of Cooper University Health Care, where Norcross is the board chairman.\n\nHow does this episode intersect with the indictment?\n\nContinuing, with a h/t to the NJ Monitor:\n\nCooper's Ferry Partnership, a nonprofit redevelopment organization, was seeking to purchase the L3 site. Norcross allies intervened, according to the indictment, by having the Camden mayor's office instruct the nonprofit's leaders to meet regularly with Philip Norcross \"so the Norcross Enterprise could monitor what the nonprofit was doing,\" the indictment says. Philip Norcross then told the nonprofit it would suffer repercussions if it chose their own developer instead of one of the Norcross team's choosing, according to the indictment.\n\nIn the end, Cooper's Ferry -- which could have partnered with a developer and earned millions from shared profits -- instead sold the property at a \"discounted price\" to the Norcross-chosen developer, the indictment says. Cooper University Health Care then bought a substantial ownership share in the developer and over the next four years, won $27 million in state tax credits, the indictment says.\n\nThe state also claims that after this episode, a Norcross ally threatened the Cooper's Ferry CEO, forcing him to resign. Cooper's Ferry became Camden Community Partnership in 2021. Redd is now its president and CEO.\n\nNow, lastly, what does this bare-knuckle land sale brawl have to do with John Sheridan, president and chief executive officer of Cooper Health System at the time of his death?\n\nWell, in the lead up to Sheridan's untimely passing in fall 2014, his son (Mark, a respected attorney) reported that his father was visibly and uncharacteristically upset over an alleged ugly conflict with George Norcross concerning a patch of land on the Camden Waterfront. Mark Sheridan even recalled seeing his father's dining room table cluttered with documents pertaining to the land deal which vexed him.\n\nThe plot of soil at issue was land under the dominion of - you guessed it! - Cooper's Ferry.\n\nAfter the grisly September 2014 killings, Mark Sheridan reportedly asked the state AG to consider the aforementioned documents and investigate this particular aspect of his father's final days. Hoffman apparently opted to do nothing.\n\nFlash forward to this week. Nearly a decade later, law enforcement is finally doing something about the land sales (the indictmnet) and John Hoffman (the acting attorney general at the time of Mark Sheridan's unaddressed appeal for scrutiny) is a brand new Phil Murphy nominee to the New Jersey Supreme Court.\n\nIsn't that something! It's all something, folks. All of it.\n\nThe end result is, at least for now, a growing pile of questions desperately in need of answers. WNYC's Nancy Solomon - who produced the intriguing \"Dead End: A New Jersey Political Murder Mystery\" podcast delving into the Sheridan murders back in 2022 - showed up at Monday's indictment announcement presser and asked Matt Platkin the question which, as I said at the opening of this article, is presently on everyone's mind who's been following the Camden saga for more than five minutes:\n\n\"John Sheridan was trying to fight off this deal, and those documents were found on his dining room table the morning after he was murdered. Is your office looking at that case? And how do you see the murder of John and Joyce Sheridan as connected to the conspiracy you laid out today?\"\n\nWho knows. Platkin didn't modify his statement, but this is a \"conspiracy\" indictment so it's not out of the question for new angles (and defendants?) to emerge down the road. Solomon's line of inquiry might truly be at a dead end. And to be 100% clear, there is no evidence that anyone indicted by Matt Platkin this week was involved - directly or indirectly - in the Sheridan couple's deaths.\n\nBut isn't it also worth taking a fresh and serious look at what I think we can say, at the very least, presents as a deeply disturbing confluence of events?\n\nSpecifically, (#1) the apparent murder of a politically powerful figure (Sheridan) who was - immediately before his unsolved slaying - (#2) upset about a land sale that turned into a CENTRAL PIECE of a one-quarter-of-a-billion dollar RICO conspiracy case less than one decade later?\n\nWe may never know what John Sheridan knew about the subject matter of this blockbuster indictment. I sure as hell wish I did. You should, too, if you care about the rule of law in this deeply troubled state of ours.", "source": {"uri": "savejersey.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "savejersey.com"}, "authors": [],

said Wednesday.\n\n\"Whatever opinion people have, I'm telling you that (indictment) doesn't resemble what we're doing every day, working hard for our community,\" Carstarphen said at a ceremony noting the removal of a massive pile of toxic soil from the Bergen Square neighborhood.\n\nThe mayor prefaced his remarks by noting Camden's gains from George Norcross III, a Democratic power broker accused in the indictment of racketeering and other offenses.\n\n\"You know, there's a lot of contributions, endless contributions,\" said Carstarphen, adding \"a lot of the renaissance that's here (came) from people that cared about Camden, like him.\"\n\n\"And saying that, there were some unsealed documents that were opened yesterday, and by no means does that resemble the realities of what we're seeing on the ground here in Camden every day,\" the mayor continued.\n\nIn the 13-count, 111-page indictment, the Attorney General's Office contends Norcross and others used coercion, extortion and other criminal acts to acquire property, development rights and tax credits for Waterfront development projects.\n\nDefendants in the case include a former mayor, Dana Redd.\n\nAn attorney for Norcross described the pending prosecution as \"tortured and unfair.\"\n\nNorcross reacted to the indictment by noting previous praise for his work in Camden from figures like former President Barack Obama and multiple governors.\n\nCarstarphen declined additional comment on the indictment after taking a question from the media at the Bergen Square event.\n\n\"I don't want to belabor that today,\" he said. \"Today is not what that's all about.\"", "source": {"uri": "courierpostonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Courier-Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The son of a union boss, Norcross has made a fortune in the insurance business with a reported net worth of $250 million, much of it accumulated through his political network and allegedly shady business deals.\n\nIf you wanted to run for office in South Jersey, you had to have George's blessing... kind of like kissing the ring of Don Corleone in The Godfather. Otherwise, he would use his political (and possible mob) connections to destroy you. And if you were an office holder south of Trenton, you had to be in George's pocket if you wanted to be effective, let alone re-elected.\n\nJust ask Rob Andrews, who started his political career as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of congressman (and later governor) Jim Florio. Once Florio lost his re-election bid in 1993, Andrews needed a new benefactor and became - for all intents and purposes - Norcross' puppet. And when Andrews was forced to resign from Congress over some serious ethics violations, George simply replaced him with his younger brother Donald.\n\nSo, why am I boring you with all these details of backroom deals and political corruption? Because earlier this week, in the infamous words of Rev. Jeremiah Wright, \"the chickens have come home to roost.\" That's right; after skirting around the law and narrowly avoiding prosecution for decades, George Norcross was finally indicted on federal racketeering charges!\n\nNorcross is the executive chairman of Connor Strong & Buckelew, an insurance and benefits brokerage, the chairman of the board for Cooper University Health Care System, and a part owner of the Philadelphia Inquirer. However, none of those titles will do him any good now as he faces 13 racketeering counts for allegedly conspiring to illegally obtain waterfront property and property rights, unlawfully collecting millions of dollars in government tax credits, and attempting to influence and control public officials.\n\nYep, that sounds like George, all right. How should I know? Well, George graduated from the same high school as I did. So did his brother Don and their friend Steve Sweeney (both Class of 1977), who went from being a dropout to State Senate President and a Democratic candidate for governor in 2025, riding George's coattails the entire way. On top of that, I twice ran against Norcross' proxy, Rob Andrews, for Congress.\n\nFour peas in a pod, if you ask me, but I'll leave it up to the grand jury to decide.

Here's what you need to know.\n\nP.S. Tomorrow is Juneteenth, so this newsletter won't reappear in your inbox until Friday. Here's how to celebrate in Philly and what's closed on the federal holiday.\n\nMother Nature really wanted us to know this week is the official start of summer. A projected heat wave kicked off Monday afternoon when the thermostat hit 90, and temps may reach 100 by the weekend.\n\n\ud83d\udd25 The numbers back it up: Philly summers are getting hotter.

Norcross III? Norcross, 68, is an insurance exec and longtime Democratic political backer. The Camden County native works as the executive chairman of insurance firm Conner, Strong & Buckelew and chairman of the board at Cooper Health.\n\nWhat are the charges? Prosecutors allege the Norcross and his allies wielded their influence to corruptly obtain real estate along the Camden waterfront. Norcross and the others are charged with various acts of racketeering, financial facilitation, misconduct by a corporate official, and official misconduct. (See the full 111-page indictment here.)\n\nWhat officials are saying: \"On full display in this indictment is how a group of unelected, private businessmen used their power and influence to get government to aid their criminal enterprise and further its interests,\" New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin said.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the racketeering indictment against Norcross and other members of his political machine.\n\nPotato chips inspired by local food purveyors are competing in Herr's Flavored by Philly contest.

Norcross III, an influential Democratic power broker in southern New Jersey.\n\nThe 13-count indictment alleges that Norcross's company used political influence with state and local authorities to take advantage of hundreds of millions of dollars in government-issued tax credits. In one instance, when a developer refused to give up rights to his New Jersey property on Norcross' terms, Norcross threatened him.\n\nNorcross's defense attorney, Michael Critchley, said that Platkin held a \"vendetta\" against his client, claiming that, for years, agencies have looked into Norcross's business dealings and \"came up with nothing.\" Norcross, a former member of the Democratic National Committee attended Platkin's Monday news conference and called the attorney general, also a Democrat, a \"coward.\"\n\nPlatkin, a graduate of Stanford Law School, served as chief counsel to New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy from 2018 to 2020. Murphy appointed Platkin the state's attorney general in February 2022.\n\nPlatkin has worked to monitor the rising antisemitism in New Jersey since the Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7. A resident of Montclair, Platkin showed up to many events to emphasize law enforcement partnerships with Jewish communities and following up on incidents of antisemitism.\n\nTogether with Sundeep Iyer, the director of the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights, Platkin put out a statement on Oct. 27 about the rise in antisemitism and Islamophobia in K-12 schools and on college campuses. \"Now more than ever,\" they wrote, \"it is critical that our educational institutions respond immediately -- and in a manner consistent with their legal obligations -- when bias incidents occur.\"\n\nThey asked people to \"avoid stereotypes, hateful slogans, or tropes that may fuel antisemitism, Islamophobia, or other forms of bias,\" while encouraging educational institutions to follow the prevention bias best practices.\n\nThe Division on Civil Rights issued a notice of violation on Nov. 30 in response to a TaskRabbit worker who allegedly violated discrimination laws when posting advertisements that he was \"currently not offering my services to the Jewish community.\"\n\n\"Anyone who discriminates against others based on religion, national origin, ancestry, or race is breaking the law in New Jersey,\" Platkin said at the time. \"There is no justification for denying services to members of the public based on antisemitism, Islamophobia, or any other kind of discrimination, and we are committed to holding anyone who engages in discriminatory practices accountable.\"\n\nPlatkin has also worked closely with Jewish organizations to prevent antisemitism. At a March 2024 conference sponsored by the Anti-Defamation League in New York City, he spoke on a panel titled \"Protecting Jewish communities against swatting and other antisemitic threats.\" After the event, he posted on X, \"Combating all forms of hatred is a collective effort, and no one should face it alone.\"\n\nHis support of the Jewish community dates back prior to the Hamas attack. In 2022, he spoke at an event marking the third anniversary of a mass shooting at a New Jersey kosher deli. In April 2023, he delivered remarks at the Torah Academy of Bergen County in Teaneck where he encouraged the audience to report all incidents of antisemitism so that law enforcement could find trends and possible links between incidents.\n\n\"If you see something unsettling, report it,\" said Platkin. \"It breaks my heart honestly to hear someone say, 'We thought it was too small. It was only a swastika on a playground.'\"", "source": {"uri": "forward.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Forward"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_massel@forward.com", "name": "Rebecca Massel",

Platkin announced charges Monday against George E. Norcross III, the influential political powerbroker, along with Tambussi -- Norcross' personal attorney -- and four others.\n\nPlatkin alleged that Norcross and others obtained property and property rights on the Camden waterfront while collecting millions of dollars in government-issued tax credits and influencing government officials in what the attorney general described as \"political bloodsport\" to further the scheme.\n\nAll six people named in the indictment were charged with first-degree racketeering. They face up to 10 to 20 years in state prison if convicted.\n\nAfter the indictment was announced, Norcross accused Platkin of waging a political vendetta against him and his associates.\n\nRutgers faculty union officials said Tambussi should resign from his seat on the board of governors immediately or be removed by the board.\n\n\"Mr. Tambussi has now been indicted for criminally preying on Camden's residents, the very community that he is supposed to represent on this board,\" Kelly Dittmar, an associate professor of political science at Rutgers-Camden and vice president of the Camden chapter of the Rutgers AAUP-AFT faculty union, said during the public portion of the meeting on the New Brunswick campus.\n\nTambussi, 66, of Brigantine, did not speak during the board of governors meeting. He also did not immediately respond to a request to comment after the meeting about the calls for his resignation.\n\nNo Rutgers board members responded during the meeting to the union's calls for Tambussi's resignation.\n\nThe Rutgers union said it also filed a lawsuit to remove Tambussi from his Rutgers Board of Governors seat for allegedly violating residency requirements. A hearing in the case is scheduled for next week.\n\nThe union alleges Tambussi was appointed to the Rutgers board to represent Camden, but no longer lives there.\n\nSome Rutgers faculty, staff and students have long argued the Rutgers-Camden campus does not get enough money and resources from the university compared to the main New Brunswick campus.\n\n\"This is impossible when we don't have legitimate representation on this body, and even worse, when one of its members embodies the very disrespect for Camden that has, for too long, permeated the university,\" Dittmar said.\n\nTambussi was first appointed to the Rutgers University Board of Governors in 2014 by then-Gov. Chris Christie. He was reappointed to the board by Gov. Phil Murphy in 2020, according to his firm's website.\n\nAntoinette Miles, the state director of the New Jersey Working Families Party, also called on Tambussi to resign from his board position or for the board to remove him.\n\n\"Rutgers is our state's premier public research university,\" Miles said. \"It should not be sullied any further due its connection with Bill Tambussi, and the corrupt machine he represents.\"\n\nAt multiple points during the meeting, a group of people shouted for Tambussi to resign. They also chanted, saying \"Tambussi must go\" and \"We don't want Norcross here.\"\n\nTambussi is an attorney and partner at the law firm of Brown and Connery.

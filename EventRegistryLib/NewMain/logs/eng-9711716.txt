A second Marshal from another vehicle also responded and fired his service weapon.\n\n'The suspect was transported to a local hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries. No law enforcement officers were injured.'\n\nFlowers, 18, was arrested and charged with armed carjacking, carrying a pistol without a license, and possession of a large capacity ammunition feeding device.\n\nA police report obtained by DailyMail.com revealed the location of the incident at a residential street in North West DC where Sotomayor owns a condo, and the US Marshals Service (USMS) confirmed to DailyMail.com that the officers involved were part of her protection team.\n\nThe report said police recovered the black and silver Smith & Wesson 40VE handgun Flowers allegedly used for the attempted carjacking.\n\nThe Metro PD report named the first Marshal as 'Deputy US Marshal Black', and did not name the second officer.\n\n'The Deputy U.S. Marshals involved in the shooting incident were part of the unit protecting the residences of U.S. Supreme Court justices,' a USMS spokeswoman told DailyMail.com.\n\n'As a general practice, the U.S. Marshals don't discuss specifics of protective details.\n\n'USMS does not disclose the names of personnel involved in shooting incidents until all investigations are complete.'\n\nA statement of facts filed in DC district court by Deputy US Marshal Tyler Wells on Friday said that Flowers pulled up at 1:17am in a silver mini-van, got out and pointed his gun through the driver's side window of the federal officer's unmarked car parked on 11th Street.\n\n'The Complainant pulled out his department issued firearm and fired approximately four times at Defendant Flowers through the window, striking Flowers in the mouth,' the July 5 filing said.\n\n'The Complainant provided first aid to Flowers, while the silver van fled the scene traveling northbound on 11th Street Northwest.'\n\nThe Marshals found a matching silver 2017 Toyota Sienna mini-van in a database of jacked vehicles, but have not yet recovered the car or driver.\n\nThe shooting is under investigation by the PD's Internal Affairs Division Force Investigations Team, and the department said the case 'will be independently reviewed by the United States Attorney's Office.'\n\nIt is not the first high-profile attempted car-related theft in DC in recent months.\n\nOn November 12, 2023 Secret Service agents stationed outside the home of President Joe Biden's granddaughter Naomi opened fire on two teens who were fleeing after allegedly stealing over $1,000 of gear from a black Ford Expedition 'used for members of the first family', according to court documents.\n\nRobert Kemp, 19, was arrested on February 7. A 14-year-old male accomplice was arrested later that month after a separate alleged armed carjacking.\n\nAn affidavit from a Secret Service agent says the boy was wearing a court-ordered GPS ankle bracelet during the theft from Naomi's car.\n\nLast October, Congressman Henry Cuellar was carjacked at gunpoint near his DC home by three armed robbers in knit caps and ski masks.\n\nTexas Republican Cuellar was unharmed. Law enforcement eventually retrieved the car.\n\nHis phone and computer were also recovered from his white Toyota crossover - as well as his dinner he had bought from Whole Foods.\n\n'What really got me upset was they took my sushi,' the congressman told CNN at the time.\n\nDC police reported more than 900 carjackings and over 6,000 stolen vehicles in 2023, a sharp rise on the previous year.\n\nThe DC council member for the district where Sotomayor's condo is located, Brianne Nadeau, is facing a recall motion for supporting the Defund the Police movement.\n\nA group campaigning for her recall said Nadeau voted for budgets that 'defunded the police by $15million' and 'passed legislation to reduce penalties on violent crime, illegal gun crimes, and carjackings'.\n\nOn their website, the Committee to Recall Brianne Nadeau points to DC crime data showing a 100% increase in homicides, 56% increase in assaults with a dangerous weapon, and 48% increase in motor vehicle theft between 2022 and 2023.\n\nSotomayor bought her DC two-bed condo in 2012 for $660,000, now estimates it to be worth $861,480.\n\nThe New York Times described the area as 'scruffy' in a 2013 story about her purchase, but Sotomayor said it reminded her of her New York East Village roots.\n\n'It has a touch of the East Village in it,' she told the paper. 'I picked it because it's mixed. I walk out and I see all kinds of people, which is the environment I grew up in and the environment I love.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast

Police allege the man pointed a gun at the deputy marshal, who in turn fired multiple shots with his service weapon.\n\nAnother deputy in a separate vehicle also fired his gun, according to police.\n\nThe suspect, identified as Kentrell Flowers, 18, was shot in the mouth, according to a statement of facts filed by the Marshals Service. Flowers suffered non-life-threatening injuries and was taken to the hospital.

Metropolitan Police Department confirmed it was investigating a shooting that took place in the Northwest Washington, DC. where two marshals were on-duty working 'a protective detail' in the early hours of July 5. A Deputy US Marshal was sitting in his car outside the top judge's condominium at 1:15 am when 18-year-old Kentrell Flowers approached, pointed a handgun at him, and tried to steal his vehicle, according to a police report obtained by DailyMail.com.\n\nLocal police issued a press release about the incident last week, but did not mention its connection to Sotomayor. 'The suspect exited a vehicle, approached one of the Marshals, and pointed a handgun at him in an apparent attempt to carjack him,' a DC Metropolitan Police Department press release said. 'The Marshal drew his service weapon and fired several shots at the suspect. A second Marshal from another vehicle also responded and fired his service weapon.\n\n'The suspect was transported to a local hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries. No law enforcement officers were injured.' Flowers, 18, was arrested and charged with armed carjacking, carrying a pistol without a license, and possession of a large capacity ammunition feeding device. A police report obtained by DailyMail.com revealed the location of the incident at the Beauregard Condominiums in North West DC where Sotomayor owns a condo, and the US Marshals Service (USMS) confirmed to DailyMail.com that the officers involved were part of her protection team. The report said police recovered the black and silver Smith & Wesson 40VE handgun Flowers allegedly used for the attempted carjacking.\n\nThe Metro PD report named the first Marshal as 'Deputy US Marshal Black', and did not name the second officer. 'The Deputy U.S. Marshals involved in the shooting incident were part of the unit protecting the residences of U.S. Supreme Court justices,' a USMS spokeswoman told DailyMail.com. 'As a general practice, the U.S. Marshals don't discuss specifics of protective details. 'USMS does not disclose the names of personnel involved in shooting incidents until all investigations are complete.'\n\nA statement of facts filed in DC district court by Deputy US Marshal Tyler Wells on Friday said that Flowers pulled up at 1:17 am in a silver mini-van, got out and pointed his gun through the driver's side window of the federal officer's unmarked car parked on 11th Street. 'The Complainant pulled out his department issued firearm and fired approximately four times at Defendant Flowers through the window, striking Flowers in the mouth,' the July 5 filing said. 'The Complainant provided first aid to Flowers, while the silver van fled the scene traveling northbound on 11th Street Northwest.'\n\nThe Marshals found a matching silver 2017 Toyota Sienna mini-van in a database of jacked vehicles, but have not yet recovered the car or driver. The shooting is under investigation by the PD's Internal Affairs Division Force Investigations Team, and the department said the case 'will be independently reviewed by the United States Attorney's Office.' It is not the first high-profile attempted car-related theft in DC in recent months. On November 12, 2023 Secret Service agents stationed outside the home of President Joe Biden's granddaughter Naomi opened fire on two teens who were fleeing after allegedly stealing over $1,000 of gear from a black Ford Expedition 'used for members of the first family', according to court documents.\n\nRobert Kemp, 19, was arrested on February 7. A 14-year-old male accomplice was arrested later that month after a separate alleged armed carjacking. An affidavit from a Secret Service agent says the boy was wearing a court-ordered GPS ankle bracelet during the theft from Naomi's car. Last October, Congressman Henry Cuellar was carjacked at gunpoint near his DC home by three armed robbers in knit caps and ski masks. Texas Republican Cuellar was unharmed. Law enforcement eventually retrieved the car. His phone and computer were also recovered from his white Toyota crossover - as well as his dinner he had bought from Whole Foods. 'What really got me upset was they took my sushi,' the congressman told CNN at the time.\n\nDC police reported more than 900 carjackings and over 6,000 stolen vehicles in 2023, a sharp rise on the previous year. The DC council member for the district where Sotomayor's condo is located, Brianne Nadeau, is facing a recall motion for supporting the Defund the Police movement. A group campaigning for her recall said Nadeau voted for budgets that 'defunded the police by $15 million' and 'passed legislation to reduce penalties on violent crime, illegal gun crimes, and carjackings'. On their website , the Committee to Recall Brianne Nadeau points to DC crime data showing a 100 percent increase in homicides, 56 percent increase in assaults with a dangerous weapon, and 48 percent increase in motor vehicle theft between 2022 and 2023.\n\nSotomayor bought her DC two-bed, two-bath, 1,146 sq ft condo in 2012 for $660,000. Property site Redfin now estimates it to be worth $861,480. The New York Times described the area as 'scruffy' in a 2013 story about her purchase, but Sotomayor said it reminded her of her New York East Village roots. 'It has a touch of the East Village in it,' she told the paper. 'I picked it because it's mixed. I walk out and I see all kinds of people, which is the environment I grew up in and the environment I love.'\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Property site Redfin now estimates it to be worth $861,480.\n\nThe New York Times described the area as 'scruffy' in a 2013 story about her purchase, but Sotomayor said it reminded her of her New York East Village roots.\n\n'It has a touch of the East Village in it,' she told the paper.

The suspect drew a gun, aimed it at a security officer identified only as \"Deputy US Marshal Black,\" and demanded that Black hand over his car, the Daily Mail reported.\n\n'In most US cities, juveniles spend the summer hanging out with their friends, working summer jobs, visiting family members. In DC, juveniles carjack.'\n\nA statement from the D.C. Metro Police Department indicated that Black then \"drew his service weapon and fired several shots at the suspect,\" and at least one of those shots struck the suspect in the mouth, the Daily Mail said.\n\nBy that time, a second deputy Marshal had exited his vehicle \"and fired his service weapon,\" though whether any of his shots struck the suspect is unclear. Afterward, Black rendered first aid to the suspect, later identified as 18-year-old Kentrell Flowers of Washington, D.C.\n\nFlowers was then transported to an area hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, but his apparent accomplice did not stick around to assess Flowers' condition. Shortly after the Marshals fired their weapons, \"The silver van fled the scene travelling northbound on 11th Street Northwest,\" said a statement of facts filed in D.C. district court by Deputy U.S. Marshal Tyler Wells.\n\nA vehicle matching the van's description was later found, but no other suspect has yet been identified. The weapon allegedly used in the commission of the crime, a .40 caliber Smith & Wesson, was recovered at the scene. No Marshals were injured in the incident.\n\nFlowers has been charged with armed carjacking, carrying a pistol without a license, and possession of a large capacity ammunition-feeding device. The case remains under investigation.\n\nThe Daily Mail noted that Metro PD issued a statement about the Marshal-involved shooting within hours of the incident, but that initial announcement made no mention of the connection with Justice Sotomayor. According to the outlet, Sotomayor's D.C. residence is a two-bedroom, two-bath condo currently valued at over $860,000.\n\nIn 2013, Sotomayor likened the area to New York's East Village. \"It has a touch of the East Village in it,\" she told the New York Times. \"I picked it because it's mixed. I walk out and I see all kinds of people, which is the environment I grew up in and the environment I love.\"\n\nBlaze News reached out to the public information officer of the U.S. Supreme Court for comment but did not receive a response.\n\nK. Denise Rucker Krepp, a former elected D.C. official who once worked in the Obama administration, is outraged that violence perpetrated by young people continues to proliferate in her area.\n\n\"Washington DC, the District of Crime, has a juvenile carjacking problem,\" she told Blaze News in a statement. \"In most U.S. cities, juveniles spend the summer hanging out with their friends, working summer jobs, visiting family members. In DC, juveniles carjack. As was demonstrated last Friday, no one is safe from juvenile carjacking in the nation's capital.\"", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marshals_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Marshals Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Sotomayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carjacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carjacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metro (British newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Department_of_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A&E_Networks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A&E Networks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.40_S&W", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": ".40 S&W"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pistol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pistol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_&_Wesson", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smith & Wesson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Village,_Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Village, Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Village, Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/sonia-sotomayor-s-security-officers-shoot-armed-teen-carjacking-suspect-outside-justice-s-dc-condo.jpg?id=52557458&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C53%2C0%2C118", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9711716", "eventUri": "eng-9711716", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

The Marshals were parked outside of, and providing security for, the home of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Flowers ended up being shot and later treated for non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nA deputy US Marshal shot a suspected carjacker who pulled a gun on two marshals guarding Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor's home in Washington, DC, officials said.\n\nThe deputies were parked outside Sotomayor's home in northwest DC on July 5 when Kentrell Flowers, 18, allegedly walked up to one of their cars around 1:15 a.m. and pointed a gun at the bodyguard, the US Marshals Service told The Post.\n\nThe marshal drew his weapon and fired several shots at the suspect, who was arrested and treated at a local hospital for non-life-threatening injuries, officials said.\n\nIt's unclear whether Flowers was even aware of his proximity to Justice Sotomayor's residence, so it's unlikely that the choice of target, while unfortunate for Flowers, was connected to the Justice in any way.\n\nSee Related: Carjacker Gets Dirt Napped After Trying to Rob an Amazon Delivery Driver\n\nPrivate Security, Rampant Theft and Carjackings: Our Cities Continue to Disintegrate\n\nMost carjackers in the District of Columbia are never caught or convicted, according to the D.C. Witness' Jeff Levine.\n\nWhile carjackings have tripled in recent years and remain a \"real threat,\" says a source in the US Attorney's office, most offenders don't get caught. For the relatively few that are charged, conviction rates differ significantly and prosecutions can drag on for years, according to a D.C. Witness review of the data.\n\nOut of 2,227 total carjacking offenses documented by the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) from 2020 through 2023, 607 or just 27 percent end with an arrest or are closed for other reasons.\n\nOnly a fraction of these incidents resulted in convictions for adults while juvenile prosecutions seem more effective. according to D.C. Witness data and findings from the DC Sentencing Commission.\n\nLevine also points out that most of the District's carjackings are committed by juveniles.\n\nAccording to the MPD, between 2020 to March of this year, there were 569 actual carjacking arrests, 360 or 63 percent of which were minors between the ages of 12 and 17 years old.\n\nJuvenile carjackings are handled by the Office of the DC Attorney General, which last year prosecuted 186 cases with an overall conviction rate of about 80 percent.\n\nIt's also important to note that the District's municipal government bends every effort to prevent residents from arming themselves in self-defense against criminals; if there had been ordinary citizens in that car rather than United States Marshals, the carjacking would likely have been successful, and we would only know of it through another slight tick in the District's crime statistics - unless the event had escalated into one of the instances in which the crime victims are shot or otherwise injured.\n\nThis incident, which fortunately ended without serious injury or fatality, was largely the result of a bad choice of attempted victim on the part of Kentrell Flowers.

The marshal then recovered the weapon Flowers had pointed at them and administered first aid until he was transported to a hospital.\n\nThe complaint does not identify Sotomayor. A spokesperson for the U.S. Marshals Service confirmed, however, that the deputies involved in the incident \"were part of the unit protecting the residences of U.S. Supreme Court justices.\"\n\nAccording to the complaint, Flowers' firearm was a .40 caliber Smith & Wesson loaded with eight rounds. The driver of the silver van that Flowers arrived in -- which investigators confirmed was a stolen vehicle -- fled the scene and has not been caught.\n\nThere's no indication that Sotomayor was a target of the attempted theft. But it's the latest brush with violent crime for high-profile D.C. residents.\n\nEarlier this year, the Secret Service arrested two people for attempting to break into a Secret Service vehicle that was part of the protective detail for President Joe Biden's granddaughter Naomi. Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas) was held up at gunpoint and carjacked in the Navy Yard neighborhood last fall. And Rep. Angie Craig (D-Minn.) was assaulted by a man in the lobby of her apartment building in February 2023.\n\nThe security of the Supreme Court has been a recurring issue in recent years, particularly since the court overturned the Roe v. Wade opinion guaranteeing the right to abortion. At the time, an armed man was arrested for threatening to kill Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The incident and a rise in threats, coupled with increasing protests outside the personal residences of the justices, prompted Congress to pass legislation expanding security funds available to protect the justices and their families.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marshals_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Marshals Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Sotomayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carjacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carjacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_&_Wesson", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smith & Wesson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angie_Craig", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angie Craig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Kavanaugh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brett Kavanaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cuellar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Henry Cuellar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

In reality, carjacking is a violent crime made more dangerous than most muggings by the additional uncertainty posed by a victim potentially capable of driving off, raising the tensions and the risk of deadly miscalculation on all sides. To the extent there's a \"degree of difficulty\" component to carjacking, rolling up on a US Marshal's vehicle expecting to drive away with it falls at the heavy end of that spectrum.\n\nFrom the Daily Mail:\n\nA teenage suspect was shot by US Marshals on Friday after allegedly attempting to carjack Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor's federal bodyguards outside her home, DailyMail.com can exclusively reveal.\n\nThe Deputy Marshal was apparently sitting outside the justice's condo at 1:15 in the morning when approached by the attempted carjacker. Anyone sitting in a stationary vehicle in the middle of the night is presumptively not to be messed with. I mean... they've clearly got something heavy going on.

The teenager named Kentrell Flowers then did something really stupid but pretty commonplace for the DC Metro area.\n\n...The marshals were parked outside Sotomayor's home in northwest DC on July 5 when Kentrell Flowers, 18, allegedly walked up to one of their cars around 1:15 a.m. and pointed a gun one of the federal agents, the US Marshals Service told The Post.\n\nOne of the federal agents drew his weapon and fired several shots at the suspect, with the second officer also firing his weapon at Flowers.\n\nFlowers, of Southeast DC, was arrested and treated at a local hospital for non-life-threatening injuries, officials said.\n\nThe justice wasn't home, the marshalls were unharmed, and Mr. Flowers' premature ventilation was attended to at a local hospital no doubt at taxpayer cost.\n\nWhile that outcome is satisfying all around on its face, it's also the face of the problem in the District of Columbia and the surrounding area - it's frickin' dangerous as hell for everyone, whatever your status in life. And unless you're someone who has a licensed security detail assigned to protect your home and person, Mr. Flowers would have successfully boosted your vehicle and possibly - well, most probably - shot you, perhaps fatally whilst doing so.\n\nBecause \"private citizen\" you cannot be armed for self-protection and Mr. Flowers would no doubt be back roaming the streets within hours had he been caught (as he hit a \"somebody's\" home this time, they might go tough on him).\n\n...This is just the latest in a series of high profile carjackings of federal agents and VIPs in the nation's capital.\n\nLast year, Secret Service agents assigned to President Biden's granddaughter, Naomi, opened fire on a group of people attempting to break into an unmarked Secret Service car.\n\n...In January, former Trump administration official Mike Gill was fatally wounded by a carjacker as he sat in his vehicle on K Street at about 5:45 p.m.\n\nThe calls today have been off the hook but that's every day.\n\nIn October, I wrote about how the stats for violent crimes were going through the roof, and it was affecting every demographic.\n\n...Maybe the times, they are a' changin'. As with so many aspects of life in these United States one wouldn't ordinarily want doing so, the crime statistics for the nation's capital are going nowhere but up.\n\n...Meanwhile, the District is reporting year-over-year spikes in homicides (up 33%), robberies (up 70%) and carjackings (up 108%).\n\nViolent auto thefts have hit historic highs in the nation's capital. The District recorded 806 carjackings through Sunday. The city is on track to nearly double the record high set last year at 484.\n\nEspecially with the carjackings. So much so, as I noted, the Washington Post issued a hugely helpful \"How Not to Get Carjacked\" supplement just as the D.C. City Council voted to lower penalties for carrying, oh, like an illegal gun or carjacking.\n\nThings must really be looking up for the safety and security of the residents of the city, that council members feel they can move definitively in this direction. This is the second vote on these proposed reforms and all that remains is Mayor Muriel Bowers' approval.\n\nThe Washington, D.C., city council on Tuesday voted to dramatically reform the city's criminal code, reducing penalties for offenses including illegal gun possession and carjacking, even as D.C. has seen a spike in homicides in recent years.\n\nThese sorts of permissive attitudes bear fruit as far as repeat offenders and moving up into more violent crimes. No one in the D.C. hierarchy, either the city government or the court system, seems remotely interested in readjusting their attitudes towards charging and incarceration.\n\nJudges are some of the worst offenders. This case is from May of this year.\n\nThe US Attorney's Office routinely refuses to press charges or downgrades serious crimes, if they do anything at all.\n\nI can only assume this particular attorney in the USAO has not yet been a carjacking or shooting victim. Or maybe he has, and white guilt has taken over. In either case, they had multiple opportunities to get a repeat weapons offender off the street and did nothing.\n\nIt happens with alarming frequency.\n\nSo the USAO won't hammer the felons who carry illegally, but God help the law-abiding citizen who has a weapon if he dares to have one in the District.\n\nLast year, the District had to pay out over $5M to settle a lawsuit from 6 legal gun owners who'd been arrested and had their 2d Amendment rights violated thanks to zealous enforcement of D.C.'s campaign against legal firearms.\n\nSometimes it's easier when you're an 18 year-old carjacker, who doesn't have to worry about any of the #rulez, you know?", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "beege_welborn@hotair.com", "name": "Beege

Metropolitan Police.\n\nThe alleged suspect approached one of two deputy marshals parked in separate cars, pointing a handgun at his car in what the Metropolitan Police described as an attempted carjacking.\n\nThe marshal -- who was part of a unit tasked with protecting \"the residences of U.S. Supreme Court justices,\" ABC News reported, citing a U.S. Marshal spokesperson -- then fired at the suspect, while the second marshal followed suit, firing his weapon at the alleged carjacker.\n\nThe suspect was identified as 18-year-old Kentrell Flowers, who was transported to a local hospital and suffered non-life-threatening injuries, according to police -- neither of the two marshals were injured.\n\nFlowers was arrested and charged with armed carjacking, carrying a firearm without a license, and possession of large-capacity ammunition.\n\nThe marshal involved is under investigation by the Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department's Internal Affairs Division, which investigates all shootings involving law enforcement officers in Washington D.C., according to the Metropolitan Police.\n\nKey Background\n\nViolent crime, including homicides, in the nation's capital has gradually increased over the past two decades, jumping from 198 homicides in 2004 to 274 last year, according to data from the Metropolitan Police Department. The department has recorded 1,820 instances of violent crime so far this year, including assault, robbery, homicide and sexual abuse, while auto theft has also posed an issue for officers. So far this year, police have recorded 12,407 instances of property crime, including 2,496 cases of motor vehicle theft. Violent crime is down significantly from this point last year, with the total violent crimes reported 30% lower than the same point in 2023. Motor vehicle thefts are down 33% from this point last year, with homicides down 27%.\n\nTangent\n\nSotomayor, 70, was appointed to the Supreme Court in August 2009, the first of two justices nominated by former President Barack Obama to the nation's high court (the second was Justice Elena Kagan in 2010). In her 15 years on the bench, Sotomayor has been an integral member of the court's waning liberal bloc, which in recent years has dwindled, giving Republican-nominated justices a 6-3 majority. Sotomayor has supported women's rights issues and diversity and inclusion measures while on the court, dissenting to the court's 2022 ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade, and dissenting to the court's 2023 decision striking down affirmative action, which she argued amounted to rolling back \"decades of precedent and momentous progress.\" Recently, Sotomayor dissented in the court's ruling to strike down Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy settlement, dissented in its ruling to allow cities to punish homeless residents for sleeping in public, and dissented in the court's momentous decision to strike down the Securities and Exchange Commission's practice of administrative law, a ruling that weakens agencies that fall under the executive branch. She also dissented in former President Donald Trump's immunity case, writing the majority ruling \"makes a mockery of the principle, foundational, to our Constitution and system of Government, that no man is above the law.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marshals_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Marshals Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carjacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carjacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marshal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Department_of_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Sotomayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Violent crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Kagan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elena Kagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle_theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motor vehicle theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robbery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affirmative action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

City of Chicago, which found that the Second Amendment applies to states since they are incorporated by the 14th Amendment.\n\nThe case revolved around Otis McDonald, 76, wanting a handgun due to the crime in his Chicago neighborhood. He had shotguns but didn't trust them with a robbery. A handgun would be better.\n\nBut Chicago had a citywide handgun ban passed in 1982, making it impossible to register a handgun in the city.\n\nMcDonald sued the city.\n\nOn June 28, 2010, SCOTUS overturned the Seventh Circuit's decision, with the majority (5-4) stating that the right to bear arms is \"fundamental to the Nation's scheme of ordered liberty\" and \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.\"\n\nTherefore, Chicago's handgun ban violated a person's natural right to keep and bear arms for self-defense.\n\nSotomayor joined the dissent, penned by former Justice Breyer.\n\nBreyer wrote:\n\nIn sum, the Framers did not write the Second Amendment in order to protect a private right of armed self-defense. There has been, and is, no consensus that the right is, or was, \"fundamental.\" No broader constitutional interest or principle supports legal treatment of that right as fundamental. To the contrary, broader constitutional concerns of an institutional nature argue strongly against that treatment.\n\nDid the Framers stutter, liberal justices? I don't think so: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"", "source": {"uri": "legalinsurrection.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le\u00b7gal In\u00b7sur\u00b7rec\u00b7tion"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mary_chastain@legalinsurrection.com", "name": "Mary Chastain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marshals_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Marshals Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Sotomayor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sonia Sotomayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marshal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handgun", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Handgun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carjacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carjacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Department_of_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gun politics in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald_v._City_of_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McDonald v.

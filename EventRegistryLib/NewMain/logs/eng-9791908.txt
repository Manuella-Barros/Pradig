Vimal Kumar, expressed frustration with the Indian badminton contingent's performance in Paris.\n\nALSO ON ABP Live | Paris Olympics 2024, Day 10: Lakshya Sen Loses Bronze Medal Match- Full List Of India Results On August 5\n\nHe stressed that after numerous fourth-place finishes since Milkha Singh in 1964 and PT Usha in the 1980s, it is crucial for players to take responsibility for their performances.\n\n\"After Milkha Singh in 64' and PT Usha in the 80s, we have so many fourth place finishes. I think that it's high time that the players also take responsibility. Atleast for the results in this Olympics and the previous one, you cannot hold the federations and government responsible for the results. They have all done whatever they can. Ultimately the responsibility is on the players to go and deliver when it matters the most,\" he said while speaking to the reporters.\n\nPadukone urged players to self-reflect and evaluate their own efforts, rather than continuously demanding more from federations. He pointed out that players have ample resources and facilities, which might surpass those available in other countries, including the US.\n\n\"The players need to introspect, and not just keep asking for more from the federations. They need to ask themselves whether they are working hard enough because all of these players have their own physios and all the facilities. I don't think any other country, including the US, has so many facilities,\" the former India shuttler added.\n\nALSO READ | Nisha Dahiya Leaves Wrestling Mat In Tears As Injury Robs Her Off Place In Paris Olympics Semis- WATCH\n\nLakshya Sen reached the bronze medal match, but PV Sindhu, a two-time Olympic medallist, was eliminated in the Round of 16.

The 22-year-old Indian shuttler etched his name in history by becoming the first Indian male badminton player to reach the semifinals of the Olympics.\n\nDespite his valiant effort, he narrowly missed out on a bronze medal, falling short to Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia in a thrilling three-game encounter.\n\nRead More: Young Achievers: The Top 5 Indian Medalists Who Made History at the Olympics\n\nLakshya Sen's path to the brink of a medal was paved with determination and exceptional skill. He displayed nerves of steel throughout the tournament, overcoming challenges at every stage. In the quarterfinals, he staged a thrilling comeback against Chinese Taipei's Chou Tien-chen, a testament to his fighting spirit. This victory was especially sweet following an emotional win over compatriot HS Prannoy in the earlier rounds.\n\nWhile the defeat in the bronze medal match was a heartbreaker, experts and fellow competitors acknowledged Sen's immense talent.\n\nDenmark's Viktor Axelsen, who defeated Sen in the semifinals, even hailed him as a potential favorite for the gold medal at the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028. The recognition from such a renowned player underscores the promise Sen holds for future tournaments.\n\nLakshya Sen's Olympic journey was just one chapter in a burgeoning career already brimming with accomplishments. He boasts a bronze medal at the 2021 World Championships, a gold at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, and a pivotal role in India's historic Thomas Cup triumph in 2022. His accolades reflect a steady rise in the badminton world, with numerous junior and senior-level titles under his belt.\n\nWhile India's streak of badminton medals at the Olympics dating back to 2012 ended with Sen's defeat, his performance has ignited a renewed sense of optimism for the future of the sport in the country. Sen's remarkable run serves as an inspiration to aspiring badminton players across India, paving the way for a new generation of champions. His journey has not only showcased his talent but also highlighted the depth of potential within Indian badminton.\n\nBadminton legend Prakash Padukone expressed his disappointment over India's performance in badminton at the Paris Olympics following Lakshya Sen's loss in the men's singles bronze medal match on Monday, August 5. Padukone highlighted that every requirement of Indian athletes was fulfilled in preparation for the Olympics, and he had anticipated a better performance, particularly from the badminton team.\n\nThis marks the first time since 2008 that Indian shuttlers failed to secure a medal at the Olympics. Saina Nehwal won India's first badminton medal, a bronze in women's singles, at the 2012 Olympics. PV Sindhu then clinched a silver at the Rio Olympics and a bronze at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\n\"We were contenders for 3 medals. So, at least, one I would have been happy. I am personally disappointed. But, having said that, this time, the government, the SAI and the foundations, the TOPs, everybody have done their bit. So, I have nothing against it... I don't think anybody could have done anything more than what the government has done, the Sports Ministry, TOPs has done. It's high time the players also need to take some responsibility.\"\n\n\"All these years we could say there were not enough facilities or encouragement. But, I think this time, it's only better. Especially, the top 30 players, I am not just talking about badminton. Across all sports, the top 30-40 who had chances of winning medals, were given whatever they wanted. Sometimes, even if they were unreasonable demands, they have been met,\" he added.\n\nPrakash Padukone clarified that no injury concerns affected the outcome of Lakshya Sen's bronze medal match against Lee. Despite requiring medical attention three times during the match due to bleeding from his elbow, Lakshya's performance remained unaffected by any injury.\n\n\"No, I don't think so. There was no injury at all. That's his way of... he keeps falling. It's becoming a habit with him now, to dive and retrieve. Few areas, we need to work on.

What has been the response?", "body": "Lakshya Sen get cheered on by coaches Vimal Kumar and Prakash Padukone during the Paris Olympics. PTI\n\nShocked at the way Lakshya Sen buckled under pressure in his men's singles bronze medal match at Paris Olympics, legendary Prakash Padukone said it's high time that players take ownership for their results, become accountable and start delivering after receiving support from multiple avenues.\n\nThe former All England champion minced no words and said the young athletes need to be able to counter pressure better. He said that they can't keep putting the onus of defeats on coaches, support staff and federations.\n\nParis Olympics: News, schedule, medals tally and more\n\n\"After Milkha Singh in 64' and PT Usha in the 80s, we have so many fourth place finishes. I think that it's high time that the players also take responsibility,\" Padukone said.\n\n\"At least for the results in this Olympics and the previous one, you cannot hold the federations and government responsible for the results. They have all done whatever they can. Ultimately the responsibility is on the players to go an deliver when it matters the most,\" Padukone stated.\n\n\"The players need to introspect, and not just keep asking for more from the federations. They need to ask themselves whether they are working hard enough, because all of these players have their own physios and all the facilities. I don't think any other country, including the US, has so many facilities.\"\n\nPadukone felt that shooter Manu Bhaker probably could do well because she was not under pressure.\n\n\"People who are favourites are always under pressure and have not done so well as expected. Most of our medals even in the earlier Olympics have come from people whom we have not expected anything because there is no pressure.\"\n\nLakshya Sen made history at the Paris Olympics but lost against Viktor Axelsen and Lee Zii Jia from promising positions. In the semi-final versus Axelsen, Sen squandered three game points in the first set and seven point lead in the second. In the bronze medal play-off, Sen took the opening set but couldn't make the dominance count.\n\n\"I and Vimal are not happy with the fourth position of Lakshya (Sen). He could have definitely gotten a medal. I know (Viktor) Axelsen might say that Lakshya is the next best, but that is not good enough because there was a possibility of a medal.\n\n\"Had he lost comfortably, it would have been a different issue. But to have come this far, to have taken the lead... I know he is young, but he cannot give this as an excuse. Take the responsibility and work harder,\" said Padukone strongly.\n\nFourth places and near finishes\n\nIndia have had at least five near finishes to a podium place at the ongoing Paris Olympics. Instead, the current tally reads three medals - all in shooting.\n\nArjun Babuta finished fourth in the men's 10m air rifle final. Archery team of Dhiraj Bommadevara and Ankita Bhakat made history by going into the semi-finals but lost to USA in the bronze medal play-off. Manu Bhaker, who won two medals, could not add one more to the tally as she missed narrowly in the 25m pistol event. Shuttler Lakshya Sen went down to Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia in his bronze medal clash. And most recently, Maheshwari Chauhan and Anant Jeet Singh Naruka finished second best to China's pairing in the skeet mixed team bronze medal match.\n\nWhat has been the response?\n\nAbhinav Bindra, India's first individual gold medallist at the Olympics, said now is not the time to criticise but to appreciate athletes for reaching this far with support of their coaches, support staff and families.\n\n\"Competing at an Olympics is an extraordinary challenge. It is a testament to the dedication and sacrifice of every athlete. I am incredibly proud of the fight by athletes who have finished fourth at the Paris Olympics. It is a difficult time for them but to come so close to a medal is a monumental achievement. It is important to recognise the hard work of not just the athletes but their coaches, support staff and families. We must always and always stand by our athletes,\" he was quoted as saying by RevSportz Global.\n\n\"This is the essence of sport. Not everyone can win but in their relentless pursuit, they've already proven themselves as winners. There will always be a time to re-assess preparations and training but that time is not now. Now, we must celebrate each of our athletes who represent the hopes and dreams of 1.4 billion Indians. They've made us proud and inspired us all.\"\n\nViren Rasquinha, a former India hockey player and now expert on JioCinema for the Olympics coverage, posted on X, \"There are already 5 athletes/events where India has finished 4th #Paris2024. It is very hard on them, their families & & people who work with them 24/7. There is a time to be tough on our athletes and there is a time to be empathetic. Understanding what to do when is crucial\"\n\nAshwini Ponnappa, who bowed out in the women's doubles group stage at Paris 2024, wasn't pleased to see Padukone throw Lakshya under the bus.\n\n\"Disappointing to see this. If a player wins, everyone jumps on the bandwagon to take credit, and if they lose, it's just the player's fault?!\" Ponnappa wrote in an Instagram story.\n\n\"Why aren't coaches held responsible for lack of preparation and getting the player ready? They are the first ones to take credit for wins; why not take responsibility for their players' losses as well? \"At the end of the day, winning takes team effort and losing is also the team's responsibility.

In each of Sen's matches, Padukone was seen sitting alongside his coach Vimal Kumar to guide him during the game.\n\nTalking to the media persons outside the arena, Padukone was vocal about how the Indian shuttlers weren't up to the mark despite being given optimum facilities by the government.\n\n\"All the support and finances that were needed to perform at the top level were given to the Indian players. It's not like earlier times where our players lacked facilities and funds. So it's high time our players step-up and win as expected,\" he said.\n\n\"Government and federations have done their job. Players need to take responsibility and ask if they are doing enough. Same players have beaten these opponents in other tournaments. Vimal (Kumar) and I are not happy with the result,\" he further added.\n\nSen was crestfallen after the heartbreaking loss and could hardly speak while talking to the broadcaster. The youngster's only silver lining in the Games was getting a first with his name as he became the first Indian male shuttler to reach the Olympic semifinals. After missing the bronze medal, Sen said, \"I had my chances in the second set and could have definitely done better.

If a player wins, everyone jumps on the bandwagon to take credit, and if they lose, it's just the player's fault?! Why aren't coaches held responsible for lack of preparation and getting the player ready? They are the first ones to take credit for wins; why not take responsibility for their players' losses as well?\n\nAt the end of the day, winning takes a team effort and losing is also the team's responsibility. You can't suddenly push the player under the bus and blame it all on the player.\"\n\nPrakash Padukone's Analysis of Indian Athletes\n\nSpeaking to the reporters after Lakshya Sen's defeat on Monday, Prakash Padukone said, \"After Milkha Singh in 1964 and PT Usha in the 80s, we have seen so many fourth-place finishes. I think it's high time that players also take responsibility. At least for the results in this Olympics and the previous one, you cannot hold the federations and government responsible. They have done whatever they can.

Shuttler Lakshya Sen missed out on a bronze medal in the men's singles event after enduring a defeat against Malaysia's Zii Jia Lee.\n\nPadukone believes the athletes were provided everything they asked for and need to take responsibility for their performances.\n\n\"You know, like I said, I think it's high time the players also need to take responsibility. All these years, we could say there were not enough facilities or encouragement. It is only getting better. I am not just talking about badminton, but the top 30 or 40 who had a chance of winning a medal had been given whatever they wanted. They were never said no, even if the demands were sometimes unreasonable,\" Padukone told reporters.\n\n\"And a little bit of effort from the players also, a little more responsibility, a little more accountability, not just ask for whatever you ask. Once you are given that, then you also have to be accountable. I feel that even in the last Olympics, I said that. I think the players have to learn to take responsibility. In India, I think, you know, a lot of the top players, once they, I mean, they have to show the way to the younger generation also, of course, they inspire a lot of young kids to take up a sport,\" he added.\n\nLakshya's defeat was another instance when an Indian athlete failed to deliver when it mattered the most. Shooter Arjun Babuta finished fourth in the men's 10m air rifle event. Archers Ankita Bhakat and Dhiraj Bommadevara suffered a heartbreaking loss in the bronze medal match in the mixed team event.\n\nShooters Maheshwari Chauhan and Anant Jeet Singh Naruka missed a bronze medal in the skeet mixed team competition.\n\n\"Ultimately, you know, everybody, even the federation, the foundation, the academies, can only do so much. We can provide everything we can. Ultimately, they also have to take responsibility and deliver when it matters the most. Because it's not that, you know, we are expecting they've beaten the same players in some other tournaments. So, you know, when it comes to the Olympics, we are not able to, so, you know, you need to introspect, you need to, the players also need to introspect. You cannot just keep asking for more and more and more. You have to introspect, you know, like, okay, what, you know, what am I doing enough? Maybe, you know, the players are not working hard enough. You know, maybe it is not enough to get a medal at the Olympics,\" Padukone stated.\n\nIndia shuttlers returned empty-handed after Lakshya, the last remaining badminton player in the event- suffered heartbreak in the bronze medal match. Meanwhile, India's top medal hopes PV Sindhu, star duo Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty, and HS Prannoy also fell short of claiming a medal for India.\n\nLakshya was in the pole position of claiming a medal for India in badminton after he led against Malyasia's Zii Jia Lee following the conclusion of the first set.\n\nHowever, Jia accelerated and increased the attacking intensity in the next two sets to take away the bronze medal.\n\nTalking about Lakshya's bronze medal match performance against Jia, Padukone said, \"He played well. I am a little disappointed as he could not finish it. Yesterday, he was in a winning position in the first game, and it could have made a difference yesterday itself. Today, after winning the first, he was leading 8-3 in the second. He has always been a little uncomfortable playing on the faster side or playing with the wind. He needs to work a little more on that. He was low on confidence. There are a few areas on which we definitely need to work on. I am disappointed that we could not even win one medal in badminton.

A lot, it seems, as last hope Lakshya Sen also out of game", "body": "Lakshya Sen during his bronze medal match loss to Lee Jia Zii on Monday PTI\n\nLakshya Sen could har\u00addly speak in the mixed zone of the Porte de La Chapelle Are\u00adna. Minutes ago his dream of an Olympic Games medal was dashed, losing to Lee Jia Zii in the bronze medal play-off.\n\nIt was an all too familiar story coming out of the badminton arena. Great hopes, bigger hype, whimpering end. Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty were billed as potential medal winners in doubles, PV Sindhu for a 'hat-trick', and Lakshya.\n\nHS Prannoy was eliminated by Lakshya in the Round of 16, whereas Ashwini Ponnappa and Tanisha Crasto did not even make it out of the group stage in the women's doubles event.\n\nHow the shuttle stars have fallen. For the first time in 12 years, India return home from an Olympic Games without a medal in badminton.\n\nLakshya threw away his chances for two consecutive days -- against gold medal winner Viktor Axelsen in the semi-final and versus Lee on Monday.\n\n\"Just do not know what happened to him,\" Vimal Kumar, who has been working with Lakshya since the shuttler was a child, told The Telegraph.\n\n\"This is something we have to work on. We are all gutted. He was absolutely fine. Still not able to understand what went through his mind when he was up and comfortable on both days. He will have to figure it out. I am sure when he calmly thinks, he will come out with what exactly happened,\" Kumar added.\n\nPrakash Padukone, advisor to the badminton contingent here, was more scathing. \"He needs to work a little bit, when he's playing with the wind. Everybody has a problem but I think he struggles more than others. If you saw the first game, the Malaysian played a lot of them and went out. You were not able to control, so it happens, but you must learn to control yourself and make fewer mistakes. Lakshya needs a little bit of mind training and the focus on mind training plus a little bit of practice and a little better control he needs to work on the court as well.\"\n\nThe moments came but the Indians just did not know how to sieze those. Sindhu was at 19-19 against He Bing Jiao of China in the first game of the pre-quarter final clash. It could have been anybody's game. The former world champion and two-time Olympic Games medallist lost 19-21. In the second game, Bing Jiao ran away with a 21-14 win.\n\n\"I should have controlled that little bit of mistakes,\" she had said after the loss.\n\nLakshya's two matches were replete with unforced errors and the doubles duo of SatChi found the going tough against the Malaysian doubles specialists Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik. \"I will try to analyse why I made those unforced errors,\" Lakshya said.\n\nAfter Sunday's win, Axelsen had good things to say about the 22-year-old from Almora. \"He will be a gold medal contender in 2028.\"\n\nPadukone though was not impressed. \"He has always been a little uncomfortable playing on the faster side. There were no injury concerns too.\"\n\nLakshya had to change the bandage on his right elbow as blood was dripping onto the floor.\n\n\"You cannot use that as an excuse. No, I don't believe that. There was no damage. He keeps falling in this manner. He's starting to dive and retrieve as a habit. We have to work on that too.\"\n\nStrong words from India's first All England badminton champion.\n\nThe future also does not look good for Indian badminton, particularly women's. At 29, PV Sindhu is not getting younger and the men's scenario is not that bright too.

Padukone stated that all of the Indian athletes' requests were fulfilled in the run-up to the Olympics, and he anticipated a stronger performance from them, particularly the badminton team.\n\nIt was the first time since 2008 that an Indian shuttler did not win a medal at the Olympics. Bronze in women's singles badminton was earned by Saina Nehwal at the 2012 Olympics, the nation's first badminton medal. PV Sindhu did likewise, winning a silver at the Rio Olympics and a bronze in Tokyo.\n\nAfter Lakshya Sen's bronze medal match, Prakash Padukone told reporters in Paris, \"I am a little disappointed that we couldn't get one medal from badminton.\"\n\nPrakash Padukone lamented the underwhelming performances in Paris but applauded the Sports Ministry and other stakeholders for providing the athletes with unwavering support in the run-up to the Olympics.\n\n\"We competed for three medals. So I would have been satisfied with one, at least. Personally, I'm let down. Having said that, everyone has contributed this time, including the government, SAI, foundations, and TOPs. I therefore have nothing against it. Nobody could have gone above and beyond what the government, the Sports Ministry, and TOPs have done, in my opinion. It's time for the players to assume some accountability as well.\n\n\"We have been able to claim for years that there weren't enough resources or support. However, I believe that this time is even better. I'm not just referring about badminton here; I'm also talking about the top 30 players. In every event, the top 30-40 players with medal possibilities received whatever they want. He continued, \"On occasion, demands that were irrational have been fulfilled.\n\nIndia hoped to bring home multiple badminton medals to the Olympics in Paris. While PV Sindhu, HS Prannoy, and Lakshya Sen competed in the singles division, the Asian Games winners Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty were favored to capture a historic gold medal.\n\nSeven shutters made the trip to Paris with great expectations, but Lakshya -- the last person to be selected for the Games -- arrived at the furthest distance.\n\nAdditionally, according to Prakash Padukone, Lakshya's bronze medal match versus Lee was not affected by any concerns about injuries. Lakshya was bleeding from his elbow during the battle, so three times he needed medical attention.\n\n\"No, I don't believe that. There was absolutely no damage. He keeps falling in this manner. He's starting to dive and retrieve as a habit. We still have a few things to improve. \"We are pleased with his performance, but we were hoping for at least one badminton medal,\" Padukone remarked.\n\nIn the meantime, the former All England champion, who currently oversees the Prakash Padukone Academy in Bengaluru, acknowledged that PV Sindhu's immediate replacement in the women's singles division isn't there and encouraged the organization to provide more support for emerging shuttlers.\n\n\"I believe that when an Indian sports team produces a star, there is often too much attention paid to that one person. Furthermore, we don't focus enough on the players in the following line. The federations should concentrate a bit more on that.\n\nAs you pointed out, there's a significant void in women's singles, but there are still participants in men's singles. Priyanshu Rajawat is there, and Lakshya is still there. Though I wouldn't say it's excellent, we do have some skill. However, we still have a few young females on the women's side; three or four of them are 13, 14, 16, and 17 years old. \"I am uncertain if they will be prepared for the upcoming Olympics,\" he continued.", "source": {"uri": "ptcnews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "PTC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_Sen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya Sen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakash_Padukone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prakash Padukone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Badminton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._V._Sindhu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "P.

Reuters\n\nA day after losing the men's singles badminton bronze medal match at the Paris Olympics, Indian shuttler Lakshya Sen on Tuesday requested for some \"space and privacy\" as he aims to return back stronger.\n\n\"Hi everyone! My journey at the Paris 2024 Olympics has been both an honor and a heartbreak. I gave my all, fought with every ounce of strength, but fell just short of the podium. I am very grateful to all the supporters for their unwavering support,\" Sen wrote on \"X\", formerly Twitter.\n\n\"I am determined to reflect on what went wrong and where I need to improve. I sincerely request space and privacy at this time to regroup, come back stronger, and win laurels for India,\" added the youngster.\n\nThe 22 year-old faced Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia in the bronze medal match after he lost to Denmark's Viktor Axelsen in the semi-finals. Sen lost with a scoreline of 21-13, 16-21, 11-21.

That injury seemed to have hampered his chances big time as he went down in the third game with a 11-21 scoreline.

A seven-member Indian contingent, including two-time Olympic medalist PV Sindhu, participated but failed to secure a place on the podium.\n\nIndian badminton legend and team mentor for the badminton squad at the Olympics, Prakash Padukone, was disappointed with the way Indian players have performed at the Olympics, falling short at the times it mattered the most.\n\n\"I am a little disappointed in our performance that we could not even get a single medal from Badminton,\" he told ANI. \"Like I have said before, we were contenders for three medals so at least one would have made me happy. But having said this, this time, the Government, Sports Authority of India, and Sports Ministry have done their best, and I don't think anyone could have done anything more than what the Government has done, so I think the players also need to take responsibility.\"\n\nLakshya Sen, competing in men's singles, came closest to winning a medal. He reached the semi-finals but lost to Denmark's Viktor Axelsen and subsequently fell short in the bronze medal match against Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia. This defeat ended India's 12-year streak of winning medals in Olympic badminton.\n\n\"He played well but of course, I am a little disappointed, he could not finish it yesterday too, he was in a winning position in the first game, and could have probably made a difference yesterday itself. After winning the first game he was leading 8-3 today, he has always been a little uncomfortable playing on the faster side so he has to work on that,\" Padukone said.\n\nPV Sindhu, who had previously won silver in Rio 2016 and bronze in Tokyo 2020, was eliminated in the round of 16 by China's He Bingjiao. In men's singles, HS Prannoy advanced to the knockout stage but was defeated by compatriot Lakshya Sen in the round of 16.\n\nThe men's doubles pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty, seeded third, progressed through the group stage but were defeated in the quarter-finals by Malaysia's Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik. The women's doubles team of Tanisha Crasto and Ashwini Ponnappa failed to advance beyond the group stage.\n\nThis disappointing outcome mirrors the challenges faced by Indian badminton players at the highest level despite previous successes. The last time India failed to win a badminton medal at the Olympics was in 2008, prior to Saina Nehwal's bronze in London 2012, followed by Sindhu's medals in Rio and Tokyo.\n\n\"All the support and finances needed to perform at the top level were given to the Indian players. It's not like earlier times when our players lacked facilities and funds.

He expressed deep gratitude towards the Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy, where he has honed his skills, and his family for their unwavering support. \"I am eternally grateful to my incredible team, Vimal Sir, Prakash Sir, and my father for their relentless support, my family for being my strength @bai_media @media.iccsai @ppbaindia @ogq_india @redbullindia and everyone associated with my journey,\" he concluded.\n\nThe young shuttler's performance in the bronze medal match was a rollercoaster of emotions. Lakshya Sen started strong, winning the first set against Zii Jia Lee and putting himself in a prime position to claim a medal for India. However, Jia's relentless attacks in the subsequent sets saw him clinch the victory and the bronze medal, leaving Sen to reflect on what might have been.\n\nThis narrow miss adds to a series of near-podium finishes for Indian athletes, underscoring the thin margins that separate victory from defeat at the highest level of sport. Despite the disappointment, Sen's journey at the Paris Olympics has showcased his immense talent, dedication, and potential to achieve greatness in the future.\n\nLakshya Sen's reflections on his Olympic journey underscore the personal and professional growth that such high-stakes competitions can inspire. His commitment to learning from the experience and improving his performance promises a bright future for Indian badminton. As he continues to develop and refine his skills, there is no doubt that Sen will remain a formidable contender on the international stage, with many more opportunities to bring glory to India.\n\nThe Paris Olympics may not have ended with a medal for Lakshya Sen, but his journey and the lessons learned along the way have laid a strong foundation for future success. His story serves as an inspiration to aspiring athletes and a reminder of the dedication required to excel at the highest levels of sport. As he prepares for future competitions, Lakshya Sen's determination and passion for badminton will undoubtedly drive him towards new heights and greater achievements.", "source": {"uri": "liveindia.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "Live India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "appteam@liveindia.tv", "name": "appteam", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_Sen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya Sen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakash_Padukone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prakash Padukone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Badminton"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://liveindia.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Heartfelt-Reflections-Lakshya-Sen-on-Paris-Olympics-Journey.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791908", "eventUri": "eng-9791908", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

On his Instagram story, the actor wrote, \"What a player! What endurance, What agility, What range of shots, What focus, What grit, What smarts, Scintillating badminton on display! It's difficult to encapsulate just how brilliant he's been at the Olympics. Missed out narrowly in a game of extremely small margins. But he's only 22 and he's just getting started.\"\n\nICYDK: Prakash Padukone was \"not happy\" with Lakshya Sen's defeat to Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia after initially leading the match in the Paris Olympics 2024. On Monday, Prakash Padukone expressed disappointment with Lakshya's loss, stating that players need to \"introspect\" and question their efforts to secure Olympic medals. He said that despite the extensive support system available, including sports science teams, physios, trainers and nutritionists, players still need to work harder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said, \"Maybe, you know, the players are not working hard enough. Maybe, it is not enough to get a medal at the Olympics. So you (players) need to work also. You have a full sports science support team. Each of the players has their own physios, strength-and-conditioning trainers and nutritionists. How much more can you do? I don't think any other country... including the US and all, will have so much facilities.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added, \"Mistakes will happen, everybody is comfortable playing against the wind because you can play freely without any hesitation but Lakshya probably needs both.

His bronze medal playoff win over Lakhsya Sen has divided Indians.\n\nFormer singles ace Prakash Padukone has harshly criticised Lakshya over the defeat but Indian's women's doubles international Ashwini Ponnappa has sprung to the young player's defence and hit back at the former All-England champion.\n\nLakshya, 22, started well in the semi-finals but had no answer to Zii Jia's fightback as the Malaysian secured the bronze medal with a 13-21, 21-16, 21-11 win.\n\nPrakash was not all pleased.\n\n\"After Milkha Singh in 1964 and P.T. Usha (1984), we have had so many fourth place finishes. I think that it's high time the players take responsibility,\" Prakash told the Indian media.\n\n\"At least in this Olympics and the previous one, you cannot hold the federations and government responsible for the results. They have all done whatever they can. Ultimately, the responsibility is on the players to go and deliver when it matters the most.\n\n\"He (Laskhya) could have definitely gotten a medal. But to have come this far, to have taken the lead... I know he is young, but he cannot give this as an excuse. Take the responsibility and work harder,\" said Prakash who, with Vimal Kumar, had coached Lakshya in Bangalore.\n\nAshwini retorted in her Instagram post that she was disappointed to see a player being taken to task after a failure without the responsibility being shared by coaches.\n\n\"If a player wins, everyone jumps on the bandwagon to take credit, and if they lose, it's just the player's fault?!\" Ashwini questioned in an Instagram post.\n\n\"Why aren't coaches held responsible for lack of preparation and getting the player ready? They are the first ones to take credit for wins; why not take responsibility for their players' losses as well?\n\n\"At the end of the day, winning is a team effort and losing is also the team's responsibility. You can't suddenly push the player under the bus and blame it all on the player,\" she said.\n\nWorld No. 16 Lakshya had produced some good results before his defeat to Zii Jia. He upset Indonesian title contender and world No. 5 Jonatan Christie, outplayed Taiwan veteran Chou Tien-chen (No. 10) in the quarter-finals before losing to eventual champion Viktor Axelsen, the second player after Lin Dan of China to defend the men's singles crown, in the last four.\n\nIn the bronze medal playoff, Lakshya had held the upper hand but Zii Jia's remarkable fightback ruined things for him.\n\nThe 34-year-old Ashwini, who partnered Tanisha Crasto in the women's doubles, also lost in the group stages in her last Olympics but is expected to continue playing on the international stage.\n\nMeanwhile, former Olympic shooting gold medallist Abhinav Bindra and top Bollywood actor Ranveer Singh, who happens to be Prakash's son-in-law, have come in support of Lakshya.\n\nThey pointed out that Lakshya had been affected by health issues since the beginning of 2023 and was the last player to automatically qualify for the Olympics by finishing in the top 16 at the end of qualifying in April.\n\nLakshya is also the first Indian to reach the semi-finals stage in the highly competitive men's singles in Paris. He should be in his prime at the age of 26 in the 2028 Los Angeles Games to launch another assault on an Olympics medal.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakash_Padukone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prakash Padukone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashwini_Ponnappa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ashwini Ponnappa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Badminton at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_Sen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya Sen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Zii_Jia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Zii Jia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milkha_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milkha Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_England_Open_Badminton_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All England Open Badminton Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._T._Usha", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "P.

However, a crestfallen Lakshya gave his say on the match. \"I had my chances in the second set and could have definitely done better. But credit to Lee Zii Jia, he played better. At the moment I am not able to... Midway in the sets, the blood was on the floor. They had to wipe it, and I lost some of my momentum,\" Lakshya told the broadcasters after his match.\n\n\"I came well prepared for this match as well. It has been quite a tough week overall.

Lakshya Sen, who became the first Indian male shuttler to make the semis in the singles category at the Games, came closest from the seven-member contingent to securing a medal at the Paris Olympics 2024. He even stood a game away from clinching what could have been a historic bronze in the face-off against Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia. But he conceded the match in the next two games to let go of the golden opportunity.\n\nMentor and badminton legend Prakash Padukone harshly criticised Lakshya after the defeat. In an explosive interaction with the media on Monday, Padukone lashed out at the entire badminton contingent, asking them to take responsibility for the poor result. \"his time, the government, the SAI and the foundations, the TOPs, everybody have done their bit. So, I have nothing against it... I don't think anybody could have done anything more than what the government has done, the Sports Ministry, TOPs has done. It's high time the players also need to take some responsibility,\" he said.\n\nIt was for the second time in two days that Lakshya lost from a position of making a considerable difference in a match. Earlier on Sunday, in the semifinal clash against eventual gold medallist Viktor Axelsen, the Indian shuttler roared to a seven-point lead in the second game after a closely fought 20-22 first game. But the defending champion bounced back in style to outlast the Indian in the second game to make the gold-medal round.\n\nSpeaking to RevSportz, Lakshya's coach, Vimal Kumar, was left shocked at his performance as he reckoned that he was well in contention for any of three medals at the Paris Olympics and he now seeks an \"honest answer\" from the Indian shuttler after he has settled down from his disappointment.\n\n\"Personally for me it is very tough to digest the fact that Lakshya couldn't get a medal. Here it could have been any,Gold,Silver or Bronze and he was that close to all.He showed great temperament and as a coach I really enjoyed seeing him displaying that upto the medal contention stage. I am not able to figure out what went wrong in his head in the last 2 days.\n\nWe can say many things from outside but it is him who has to put everything together when situation warrants. I am of the opinion that Lakshya,will give me a honest feedback after he settles down from his disappointment. He is a clever boy and he is tough. I want everyone to respect that fact,\" he said.\n\nEarlier last week, double Olympic-medallist PV Sindhu was knocked out in the round of 16, while the men's doubles pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty, who were India's best bet for an elusive gold, were stunned in the quarters. HS Prannoy, on the other hand, was defeated by Lakshya in the round of 16 and the women's doubles pair of Ashwini Ponnappa and Tanisha Crasto suffered a group-stage exit.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Badminton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakash_Padukone", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prakash Padukone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_Sen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya Sen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Zii_Jia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Zii Jia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Axelsen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Axelsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Authority_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports Authority of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Badminton at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Badminton at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanisha_Crasto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tanisha Crasto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._V._Sindhu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P.

But Prakash Padukone and Vimal Kumar, will have a few things to say in a debrief, bluntly, before Lakshya Sen moves on from this. You could be the brightest prodigy from your country, have scalped the biggest names at the Games early, played an extraordinary valiant match against the eventual gold medallist and impressed the whole world, but Lakshya Sen needed to beat Zii Jia for a bronze, and he floundered.\n\nIndian men's badminton remains medal-less, and Lakshya Sen's absolute effort in a gutting result showed just how tough it is to nail down, and why the biggest names from Pullela Gopichand to Kidambi Srikanth, and now Lakshya Sen, haven't managed to do it. Lakshya Sen's falling apart on two consecutive days, increases appreciation for PV Sindhu and Saina Nehwal, who got the job done in similarly difficult fields.\n\nLakshya Sen started tremendously on Monday, before the blues struck. But he's been finishing poorly all through the qualification period, and his game, however spectacular it looks, remains incomplete. He was error-free in the opening set, hammering those cross courts, and finding the back lines, till the famously fragile Malaysian began finding his own radar on the back lifts. Lakshya Sen had a Plan B on the day. He charged the net imperiously with his explosive stride and led from start to finish going from 14-9 to 21-13. So far, so good.\n\nThe Malaysian who carries hopes of an entire nation, a badminton obsessed nation, in men's singles, where they have three silvers, is not merely ordinary. He was 1-4 against Lakshya Sen going into this playoff, but he boasts of an extraordinary attack in his steep smashing game, dependable control on the backhand at the net, and endless points to prove to those he's bickered back home with. A former All England champion, he knew to pounce on Sen at the first hint of the Indian lapsing.\n\nLakshya Sen led the second 8-3. He was finding ridiculous angles on the cross, furious on the net kills, when Zii Jia started pinging him with body smashes at 8-6. Sen's errors suddenly started piling up, and a large part of it was down to the lifts. His inadvertent and deliberate lifts just didn't go high and deep enough, and were easiest put-downs for Zii Jia on his forehand at the midcourt. Sen criminally flick-served and whatever little circumspection the Malaysian had on his radar was cured in a jiffy.\n\nFrom 8-3 up, Lakshya Sen went into a shell, ceding 8 straight points. In a clump. Zii Jia leveled at 12-12 and raced away to take the set 21-16.\n\nLakshya Sen took a bunch of medical timeouts to tend to an elbow bleed. But all the bandaging was only tampering his own focus, as his poise came undone in the decider. Sen's defense can seem outrageously good, but like Axelsen, Zii Jia has a big attack that can rumble deep, kicking out the doors.\n\nThe Malaysian took the lead at 7-2 in the decider. But the next rally showed how badly he wanted this medal. He slipped and stumbled and was on all fours on all axis, barely hanging in three different ways. But he stuck it out there to win a humongous rally.\n\nNext, Lakshya Sen showed indecision (and tiredness) on the backline twice, letting the shuttle fall in. It was the start of the decline. His usually reliable net tumble cost him points as Zii Jia grew in confidence, and his weak lifts did him no good. It was passivity all over again just like against Axelsen as he watched the match and the bronze slip by. It wasn't even the crunch. He was a good 10 points adrift.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shivani_naik@indianexpress.com", "name": "Shivani Naik", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_Sen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya Sen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Badminton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U._Vimal_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.

From wrestler Vinesh Phogat's heartbreaking disqualification to athlete Neeraj Chopra's silver medal win at men's javelin throw, this edition of the Olympics will be remembered for many years to come. Currently, India have clinched five medals, including four bronze and one silver. India missed out on a big opportunity of clinching a medal in wrestling as Vinesh was disqualified was women's 50kg freestyle wrestling final, as he was 100gms overweight. Apart from this, India shuttler Lakshya Sen, who was looking like a strong medal-contender, also lost the bronze medal match.\n\nBefore Lakshya, the entire badminton team of India had bowed out of the tournament and India remained medal-less in the sport. After Lakshya's loss, coach and former badminton player Prakash Padukone was critical about the result and asked the player's to come forward and take responsibility of the loss.\n\nThis statement by Prakash garnered mixed response from everyone as many players criticised the coach for throwing Lakshya under the bus. However, Tejaswin Shankar, who is an Olympics Expert, JioCinema & Sports18, has a completely different take on it.\n\n\"There are two things to this. I feel like what Prakash (Padukone) sir has said, he is the only person who can make that statement because he is invested with Lakshya Sen. He trains under him and Prakash sir has seen Lakshya grow and been with him through thick and thin. He has also seen him compete in the entire tournament and enter the semi-finals. So, he has the right to say all those things,\" Tejaswin told NDTV.\n\n\"But on the other hand, I feel it's a very debatable topic. From my opinion, I am just an audience, who has who knowledge about badminton. I have nothing to do with Lakshya's performance or his coaching and he has achieved everything on his own merit. For me, it will be unfair to say that he should have done better because I am an athlete myself and I can't say that it's the player's fault. So, it's something I can't say. I just want to say that he did perform really well in the entire tournament,\" he added.\n\nEarlier, Indian shuttler Ashwini Ponnappa, a part of India's badminton contingent in the 2024 Olympics, expressed displeasure over Padukone blaming Lakshya.\n\n\"Disappointing to see this. If a player wins, everyone jumps on the bandwagon to take credit, and if they lose, it's just the player's fault?!\" Ponnappa had written in an Instagram story.\n\n\"Why aren't coaches held responsible for lack of preparation and getting the player ready? They are the first ones to take credit for wins; why not take responsibility for their players' losses as well? At the end of the day, winning takes team effort and losing is also the team's responsibility. You can't suddenly push the player under the bus and blame it all on the player,\" she added.", "source": {"uri": "sports.ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTVSports.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinesh_Phogat", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vinesh Phogat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakash_Padukone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prakash Padukone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Badminton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_javelin_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Athletics at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's javelin throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_Sen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya Sen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports18", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports18"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JioCinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JioCinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tejaswin_Shankar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tejaswin Shankar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDTV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NDTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashwini_Ponnappa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashwini Ponnappa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-08/6sf923b_lakshya-sen-ani_640x480_06_August_24.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791908", "eventUri": "eng-9791908", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

He wanted more and that is why he ripped apart the Indian shuttler after the 22-year lost the bronze medal match.\n\nPadukone mentored Lakshya throughout the Paris Olympics 2024. And under his and Vimal Kumar's tutelage, Lakshya has improved by leaps and bounds. But still, it was not enough to evade that dreadful fourth-place finish.\n\nIt was not that Lakshya was not a better player than his opponents. It was just some mistakes and pressure that got to Sen and ultimately resulted in his demise in the tournament.\n\nPrakash Padukone is an Indian legend and was not in a happy mood that Lakshya once again gave away his lead and lost the match. He was not only unhappy with the shuttles but also with the other athletes who crumbled under pressure situation.\n\n'Take Responsibility'\n\nPadukone stated After Milkha Singh in 64' and PT Usha in the 80s, we have so many fourth-place finishes. I think that it's high time that the players also take responsibility. At least for the results in this Olympics and the previous one, you cannot hold the federations and government responsible for the results.\n\nThey have all done whatever they can. Ultimately the responsibility is on the players to go and deliver when it matters the most. The players need to introspect, and not just keep asking for more from the federations.\n\nThey need to ask themselves whether they are working hard enough because all of these players have their physios and all the facilities. I don't think any other country, including the US, has so many facilities.\"\n\nPrais Olympics 2024: Dreadful Position\n\nLakshya made history when he reached the semi-final in the Paris Olympics 2024. But he was not able to clinch the medal and finished fourth. A position that every athlete dreads from the bottom of their heart.\n\nBut not only Lakshya, India has lost almost 5 medals courtesy of that fourth position. Arjun Babuta, Dhiraj Bommadevara, Ankita Bhakat, Anantjeet Singh Naruka Maheshwari Chauhan, and even Manu Bhaker finished fourth and lost that third historic medal.\n\nWhile these finishes are heartbreaking all these athletes are still young. They will learn from this experience and will come back even stronger.

The Malaysian walked up to the net and the two exchanged a lengthy embrace, after which the Indian stood and acknowledged the crowd.\n\nLakshya then trudged towards his box and slammed the racquet on his bag.\n\nIt was the first real display of frustration from the youngster. Otherwise, it was all sadness. Of not just losing the bronze medal men's singles match but caving in spectacularly in it. Of letting a match slip out in no time that was well within grasp. Of having to live with a similar feeling twice in two days. Of falling painstakingly short of a medal after just about qualifying for the Olympics and wriggling out of a difficult group stage draw.\n\nUp in the first game and away to a five-point lead in the second against the Malaysian Lee, Lakshya somehow found himself down during the third game and soon out. The bronze medal, which would've been a first by a male in Indian badminton history, had somehow gone from being extremely close to eerily afar. And all the first-time Olympian could take away was a 21-13, 16-21, 11-21 scoreline.\n\nAs those numbers stayed put for a while on the giant screen on the court, Lakshya walked off the court. A few moments later, he was largely at a loss of words to explain it all.\n\n\"How do I start?\" he said, his first few words barely audible.\n\nHow about when the sensational slide started, at 21-13, 8-3 as Lee won eight straight points and zoomed past in a flash to leave him in a state of blur?\n\n\"I started this match really well, but couldn't keep the lead. Once he started playing well, it was hard for me to find the answers in the rallies,\" Lakshya said, the first sentence he could barely piece together.\n\nLakshya had hoped to find the answers to something similar a day earlier on Sunday. Then, against the eventual gold medallist Viktor Axelsen, he let a 20-17 edge in the first game and 7-0 gap in the second go up in the air to lose in straight games. Axelsen, from his own experience, was sure the Indian's mind, looking too far ahead, faltered there. Maybe it did again with a lot more to lose the next day.\n\n\"Mind training is important,\" the legendary Prakash Padukone, Lakshya's mentor who was seated courtside, told reporters after the match. \"Across sports, we don't give enough attention to sports psychology, which is very important. Especially in the Olympics.\"\n\nIn his young and promising career, Lakshya has been there and done that several times -- at the 2021 World Championships (bronze), at the 2022 Commonwealth Games (gold), during India's 2022 Thomas Cup triumph. He even beat the same opponent earlier this year at the All England Championships. The Olympics, and its \"lot of unexpected moments\", as Lee put it, was where the mind did not complement the body.\n\n\"At times when the score is crucial, you have to be mentally really strong. Credit to him (Lee), he played a solid game in the second,\" Lakshya said.\n\nLakshya was solid all through the first game and the first bit of the second. He was sharp, his smashes were sensational and, unlike against Axelsen, he pounced to convert the first game point opportunity. Opening an early lead in the second, a lucky net chord too dropped the shuttle on the other side. Everything seemed to be going Lakshya's way. Until everything went the other.\n\nA couple of errors into the net from Lakshya kickstarted a run of eight straight points by Lee. At the break, coach Vimal Kumar rushed to Lakshya, perhaps sensing a tipping point. Lakshya rallied to make it 12 points apiece, but Lee was at it again, revving up the pace and intensity behind his strokes and forcing Lakshya to go into the defensive.\n\n\"I tried to turn the game to an attacking game,\" Lee said.\n\nIt left Lakshya bruised, literally too as his right elbow had to be frequently attended to and taped. Lee raced to a 9-2 lead in the decider after a tentative back line misjudgement by the Indian. Lakshya was clouded. Lee was thunderous. At 16-8, the Malaysian leapt forward full stretch, both legs up in the air, put the shuttle back dipping across, got up on his feet and placed it over the Indian's head. It was the first point Lee celebrated animatedly as Lakshya stood stunned at the net.\n\nLakshya remained so after the match. Padukone minced no words in saying it was introspection time for the youngster.\n\n\"Ultimately, even the federation, the foundation, the academies can only do so much.

It's not like earlier times when our players lacked facilities and funds. So, it's high time our players step up and win as expected,\" Padukone told reporters, as quoted by IANS.\n\n\"I am a little disappointed in our performance that we could not even get a single medal from Badminton. Like I have said before, we were contenders for three medals so at least one would have made me happy. But having said this, this time the Government, Sports Authority of India, and Sports Ministry everybody has done their best and I don't think anyone could have done anything more than what the Government has done so I think the players also need to take responsibility,\" added the veteran.\n\nSen's journey, though historic, ended in a heartbreaking 13-21, 21-16, 11-21 defeat. Despite a strong start in the final match, Sen faltered in the latter stages, allowing Lee Zii Jia to seize control.\n\nPadukone attributed the loss partly to Sen's discomfort playing on the faster side of the court.\n\n\"He played well but of course, I am a little disappointed, he could not finish it yesterday too, he was in a winning position in the first game, and could have probably made a difference yesterday itself. After winning the first game he was leading 8-3 today, he has always been a little uncomfortable playing on the faster side so he has to work on that,\" explained Padukone.\n\nOther Indian shuttlers also faced early exits. P.V. Sindhu, a strong medal contender, lost in the Round of 16 to China's He Bing Jiao. The men's doubles pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty exited in the quarterfinals, while H.S. Prannoy lost to Sen in the Round of 16. The women's doubles pair of Ashwini Ponnappa and Tanisha Crasto were unable to progress beyond the group stage.\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

She questioned why only players were being held accountable for failures, while coaches, who play a critical role in preparation and strategy, were not similarly scrutinised.\n\n\"Disappointing to see this,\" Ponnappa wrote in her Instagram story. \"If a player wins, everyone jumps on the bandwagon to take credit, and if they lose, it's just the player's fault?! Why aren't coaches held responsible for lack of preparation and getting the player ready? They are the first ones to take credit for wins; why not take responsibility for their players' losses as well?\"\n\nShe also argued that both victories and defeats should be seen as the result of a collective team effort, including players, coaches, and support staff.\n\n\"At the end of the day, winning takes a team effort and losing is also the team's responsibility. You can't suddenly push the player under the bus and blame it all on the player,\" she added.\n\nPadukone's comments followed Sen's defeat in the bronze medal match against Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia, which marked a painful end to India's badminton medal hopes at the Olympics.\n\nAddressing the press, Padukone stated, \"After Milkha Singh in 1964 and PT Usha in the 80s, we have seen so many fourth-place finishes. I think it's high time that players also take responsibility...

PTI\n\nLee Zii Jia described it the right way. What does it mean to play in the Olympic Games?\n\n\"Expect the unexpected. In badminton here, the bronze medal match was between Lakshya and myself. I am the seventh seed and he is 19th, maybe? And the final (he points to the television screen where Viktor Axelsen and Kunlavut Vitidsarn were fighting for the gold medal -- the Dane won 2-0) is between No.2 and No. 8. That means you do not have the top seed, the third, the fourth, fifth and the sixth in contention. These rings (Olympic rings) can do anything. It's a stage where the mental aspect is the most important thing.\"\n\nMental aspect. Lee hit at the right spot. Nobody knows better than Lakshya that he lost both the semi-final and the bronze medal playoff matches in the mind. For the second successive day, he failed to kill the game and now would return empty-handed from the Olympic Games where he promised so much.\n\nOn Monday, at the Porte de La Chapelle Arena, fighting for the bronze medal, Lakshya was one game up and leading 8-3 in the second. And he imploded. Lee, with nothing to lose, went for the broke. \"It worked in my favour,\" he would say later.\n\nThe Malaysian, bringing out all those winning smashes and diving returns won nine points on the trot and changed the course of the match. Lakshya, with a bruised elbow, could only watch as Lee walked away with a 13-21, 21-16, 21-11 win in 71 minutes. This was Malaysia's second podium finish in Paris.\n\n\"I could have done better in the second game. I had my chances. But credit to him, he played a really good game,\" a teary-eyed Lakshya could barely speak in the mixed zone. \"I will try to come back stronger,\" he said though one could hardly hear him speak. He was devastated by the thought of missing out on what could have been a deserving Olympic medal on debut. With Lakshya's loss, India's forgettable badminton campaign also ended.\n\nAfter 12 years, the country failed to win a single medal in badminton. Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty were one of the favourites for the gold and there was hope that PV Sindhu would be able to up her game to have a podium finish for the third time. Those were not to be.\n\nSen, who had a bruised right elbow, needed to replace his bandage thrice during the match. The Indian said it affected his momentum. \"In between the points the blood was on the floor, so they had to wipe it. Sometimes, I was losing the momentum of just having a break in the game and then coming again and trying to refocus on the match.\"", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "angshuman_roy@telegraphindia.com", "name": "Angshuman Roy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_Sen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya Sen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunlavut_Vitidsarn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kunlavut Vitidsarn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Axelsen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Axelsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Zii_Jia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Zii Jia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Badminton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diving (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._V._Sindhu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P.

On the 10th day of the competition, Lakshya Sen, who became the first Indian male shuttler to make the semis in singles badminton, had the chance to win a fourth medal for the country, and so did the skeet mixed team pair of Maheshwari Chauhan and Anant Naruka, both in their respective bronze-medal face-offs. However, it ended in a heartbreak for India, with both medal chances lost.\n\nBadminton legend Prakash Padukone, in particular, was not impressed with the missed opportunity, especially from Lakshya, who won the opening game against Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia, before conceding the next two to lose the opportunity to become the first Indian male shuttler to win a medal the Games.\n\nWith Lakshya's loss, India's badminton contingent failed to clinch a single medal at the Olympics for the first time since 2008. Earlier last week, double-Olympic medallist PV Sindhu incurred a heartbreaking exit in the pre-quarters, while the pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty, the Asian Games champions, who were touted for the elusive gold, were stunned in the quarters. HS Prannoy, on the other hand, was defeated by Lakshya in the round of 16 and the women's doubles pair of Ashwini Ponnappa and Tanisha Crasto suffered a group-stage exit.\n\n\"... I am a little disappointed that we couldn't get one medal from badminton,\" Prakash Padukone told reporters in Paris on Monday. \"We were contenders for 3 medals. So, at least, one I would have been happy. I am personally disappointed. But, having said that, this time, the government, the SAI and the foundations, the TOPs, everybody have done their bit. So, I have nothing against it... I don't think anybody could have done anything more than what the government has done, the Sports Ministry, TOPs has done. It's high time the players also need to take some responsibility.\n\n\"All these years we could say there were not enough facilities or encouragement. But, I think this time, it's only better. Especially, the top 30 players, I am not just talking about badminton. Across all sports, the top 30-40 who had chances of winning medals, were given whatever they wanted. Sometimes, even if they were unreasonable demands, they have been met,\" he added.\n\nAmid the rising support over Padukone's statement, India's lone Olympic gold medalist in shooting Abhinav Bindra, on Monday came in support of not just Lakshya, but the other six athletes who incurred a fourth-place finish in their respective disciplines.\n\n\"Competing at the Olympics is an extraordinary challenge. It's a testament to the dedication and sacrifice of every athlete. I'm incredibly proud of the five Indian athletes who finished fourth in the Paris Olympics. It's a difficult time for them, but to come so close to a medal is a monumental achievement for them. It is important to recognise the hard work of not just the athletes but also the coaches, their families and the support staff. We must always stand by our athletes and appreciate the fight and resilience they demonstrate. This is a sport, not everyone can win, but in their relentless pursuit, they have already proven themselves. There will always be a time to reassess, but that time is not now. Now is the time to celebrate these athletes who represent the hopes and dreams of 1.4 billion Indians,\" he told RevSportz.\n\nManu Bhaker, who won two historic bronze in shooting, fell short of a third medal in the 25m rapid pistol final to finish fourth.

Perhaps like RCB, India is destined to keep falling short at the Games.\n\nPrakash Padukone, in his illustrious playing days, even though he was an aggressive player wasn't exactly known for powerful smashes. His game was built more on speed, accuracy and athleticism. But from time to time, he used to uncork the hard-hitting game to drive across some message.\n\nThat's what he seems to be doing even long after his retirement as evidenced by his no-nonsense utterances in Paris yesterday (5 August). The coach and mentor of the Indian badminton team, without ever looking flustered or angry, came down hard on India's performance in the Olympics.\n\n\"All the support and finances needed to perform at the top level were given to the Indian players. It's not like earlier times when our players lacked facilities and funds. So, it's high time our players step up and win as expected,\" the 1980 All England Champion said immediately after Lakshya Sen's agonising defeat at the hands of Lee Zii Jia of Malaysia in the Bronze medal match.\n\nPadukone was scathing and unforgiving of the players in his summation. That he was speaking in the immediate aftermath of Lakshya Sen's inexplicable performance in the last segment of his match against Lee Zii Jia can possibly be the extra edge in Padukone's words.\n\nFor, Lakshya just lost his grip in the match -- in which he won the first game and was comfortable for the most part in the second game, too -- in a manner that was difficult to fathom. Was it a case of nerves? Was it because he had a sudden attack of the badminton equivalent of spinner's yips? Was it something physical?\n\nWhatever it may have been, it did not make for pleasant viewing. Even those who were feeling Lakshya Sen's performance to be quite heroic at the Games couldn't wrap their heads around what was unfolding at the badminton arena in the Paris Olympics yesterday.\n\nAs we said, it kind of explained the mood in the Indian camp, which has already seen too many so-near-so-far kind of misses in this Olympics. Arjun Babuta, mixed team in archery, Manu Bhaker, Nishant Dev, Lovlina Borgohain and the mixed team in skeet shooting were all almost a whisker away from winning a bronze or even progressing further.\n\nBut they all faltered to deceive. Lakshya Sen had his moments against the eventual gold medallist Viktor Axelsen. And against Lee Zii Jia, he virtually had a medal for the taking, but the occasion seemed to have gotten to him.\n\nDid Padukone Throw Lakshya Sen Under The Bus?\n\nAnyway, while the usually mild-toned Padukone did not mince words about players needing to step up and be counted when the occasion demanded, there were others who felt that the coach need not have started the firing immediately after a dispiriting loss.\n\nThe gist of the criticism against Padukone is: There is a time and occasion for criticism and throwing one's star player under the bus without waiting for the dust of the competition to settle is not professionalism.\n\nLakshya Sen, mind you was unseeded at the Games, and in a sense, was punching above his weight all through. But having said that a coach, especially a discerning one like Padukone, would know what will work with his ward.\n\nWell, you can always debate endlessly about the timing of the outburst. But what is beyond argument is the inherent truth in what he said. Not just badminton players, it applies to the entire Indian contingent at the Games on the whole.\n\n\"At least for the results in this Olympics and the previous one, you cannot hold the federations and government responsible for the results. They have all done whatever they can. Ultimately the responsibility is on the players to go and deliver when it matters the most,\" Padukone pointed out.\n\n\"The players need to introspect, and not just keep asking for more from the federations. They need to ask themselves whether they are working hard enough, because all of these players have their own physios and all the facilities. I don't think any other country, including the US, has so many facilities.\"\n\nSame Old Question: If China Can, Why India Can't?\n\nAfter every Olympics, say from 1984 Los Angeles, there has been this rigamarole: Why can't India be good at the Olympics? It is not as if these types of questions were not raised before 1984, but in that particular Games one of India's neighbours, China, made a major impact.\n\nFrom being a total outsider to the traditional sporting superpowers (like the US, Germany, Great Britain and Australia), China became a global star in the sporting arena and has not looked back since then. If China can do it, why can't India?\n\nThis line of thinking launched thousands of impassioned debates and editorials. And in 1988, at its home Seoul, South Korea also struck sporting glory, the assessment of India's mediocrity at the Games became even more incessant.\n\nOther Asian nations like Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand have also had relative successes from time to time. But India's time has not really come, if you want to be honest.\n\nLeander Paes' bronze in Atlanta, Karnam Malleswari's bronze in Sydney, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore silver in Athens were no more than aberrations.\n\nEven Abhinav Bindra's epoch-making gold in Beijing looked to be a result of individual obsession and dedication rather than an outcome of sporting greatness in a country.\n\nIndia, A Work In Progress\n\nIndia is still far away from being a sporting power, and the question that became insistent in 1984 is still valid.\n\nThe answers, as we have seen, over the years, hold water at least partially even now. India does not have a great sporting ethos. Box ticked. We celebrate actual winning more than sporting excellence. Box ticked. Indian sportspersons lack killer instinct and develop fright at the big stage. Box ticked. Indian sporting officialdom is politicised. Box ticked.\n\nBut towards the middle of the last decade, the Indian sporting officialdom did start to get its act together. To be sure, there are issues with many sporting organisations. But overall, the climate of sickening inefficiency and shambolism is removed.\n\nThe best ever performance in Olympics -- seven medals including the watershed gold in javelin from Neeraj Chopra -- came three years ago in Tokyo. No surprises there.\n\nAs Padukone said the federations are a lot different now, and the facilities and the training apparatus are indeed world class at least in pockets of India.\n\nPlayers are also exposed to every kind of world competition, and Indian sportspersons' good show in a variety of world cups and championships confirm this.\n\nAnyway, we are still staring at another unsatisfactory Games show. Irrespective of what happens from now on, the room for disappointment is there. So what is it that is holding us back?\n\nJust like RCB doing everything possible but still falling short every year at the IPL, India's quest at the Olympics is disquieting. And the reasons are hard to nail.\n\nBut we have moved from blaming the federations to pinning the fault on players.\n\nMaybe, we are getting closer to the nub of the issue. Or maybe not. We will perhaps know at the next Games 2028, which incidentally, and appropriately, is in Los Angeles.\n\nPerhaps another Asian nation will come of age in a sporting sense there.", "source": {"uri":

The 22-year-old Sen suffered two heart-breaking losses in the semifinals and bronze medal playoff despite being in advantageous position in both the matches as a medal slipped out of his hands at the Olympics.\n\n\"I was a bit disappointed because both times (in the semifinal and bronze medal match), Lakshya had taken the lead and then wasn't able to sustain it.

Sometimes it could be that you've just lost. It happens to all of us in our everyday lives.\n\n\"Maybe that is something that he needs to look at. I also read somewhere that Prakash says that he maybe should look at mind training, which is something that maybe he has to look at. I don't know how it works in badminton,\" he added.\n\nSen had squandered three game points in the opening game and a 7-0 lead in the second in the semifinal against Denmark's Viktor Axelsen, while wasting an opening game advantage and a 8-3 cushion in the second to go down against Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia in the play-off.\n\nDisappointed by the loss, his mentor Padukone said it's high time that players learn to withstand pressure, take responsibility, and deliver results after receiving significant support from the government.\n\nGavaskar said: \"It's just because with all the shots that he has, with everything that he has, the game that he has and the start that he has, we all were hoping for him to get a medal.\n\n\"But as Victor Axelsen, the winner, says that he's a serious gold medal contender for 2028 so now he's got to look at the next three years and see how he can get there.\"", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_Sen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya Sen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakash_Padukone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prakash Padukone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Gavaskar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunil Gavaskar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_Club_de_Avellaneda", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racing Club de Avellaneda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Axelsen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Axelsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Zii_Jia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Zii Jia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Badminton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112348239,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-182168,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791908", "eventUri": "eng-9791908", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

After all, it was our all-time best performance in the prestigious multi-sport event: one in which we were placed 48th on the medals tally, below Venezuela and above Hong Kong. India had sent a contingent of 119 athletes to Tokyo. Yet, seven medals in the 2020 event were enough to write a new chapter in the nation's sporting history.\n\nHardly anything has changed this time. India has sent 117 athletes to Paris for the ongoing 2024 Summer Olympics. Shooters have won three bronze medals, Manu Bhaker having won one of them in the women's 10m air pistol event and partnered with Sarabjot Singh to win another in the mixed 10m air pistol team event, and Swapnil Kusale having secured the third medal in the men's 50m rifle 3 positions event. The worst news of the day is wrestler Vinesh Phoghat's disqualification because she was found slightly overweight after she had entered the final of women's 50kg category. There are other medal-winning possibilities though - Neeraj Chopra, for instance, has entered the javelin throw final, while the men's hockey team will fight for the bronze - but nobody is hoping for a significant increase in the number of medals compared to Tokyo.\n\nIt is in the context of India's performance that advisor to the Indian badminton squad Prakash Padukone's criticism of our athletes in general, and badminton players in particular, must be understood. The badminton legend, who, most memorably, defeated the Indonesian great Liem Swie King to win the All England Open in 1980, reportedly said after Lakshya Sen's defeat at the hands of Malaysian Lee Zii Jia in the bronze medal play-off in men's singles, \"I and Vimal (coach Vimal Kumar) are not happy with the fourth position of Lakshya (Sen). He could have definitely gotten a medal. I know (Viktor) Axelsen (who beat Sen in the semis) might say that Lakshya is the next best, but that is not good enough because there was a possibility of a medal.\"\n\nIt is easy to understand why Padukone is not a happy man. Sen, who had defeated Jia in four out of five matches before playing against him at the Olympics, lost his way in the second game after winning the first. Jia won the decider easily and denied Sen a precious Olympic bronze. Apart from Sen, whose gradual capitulation made the viewer wonder why he could not sustain his form throughout the match, PV Sindhu failed to complete a hat-trick of women's singles medals after her loss in the round of 16. Chirag Shetty and Satwik Sairajrankireddy lost in the quarters of men's doubles, while the women's doubles team of Ashwini Ponnappa and Tanisha Crasto crashed out in the group stage itself.\n\nWhen Padukone said he was a 'little disappointed' with India's inability to win a single medal in badminton, he shared the view of those who must have responded similarly after Sen went down in the semis and Sindhu lost even earlier. He added, \"Like I have said before, we were contenders for three medals. So, at least one would have made me happy. But having said this, this time the Government, Sports Authority of India, and Sports Ministry, everybody has done their best, and I don't think anyone could have done anything more than what the Government has done. So, I think the players also need to take responsibility.\" After getting the kind of support they do, modern-day Indian sportspersons must start winning when it matters to bring more Olympic medals for the country. Isn't that why they represent the nation?\n\n\"After Milkha Singh in '64 and PT Usha in the 80s, we have had so many fourth-place finishes. I think that it is high time that the players also take responsibility,\" Padukone said. The badminton ace's matter-of-fact statement has originated from his observation of Indians, who have frequently faltered near the finishing line. The long list of fourth-place finishers includes Sen in badminton, shooters Maheshwari Chauhan and Anant Jeet Singh Naruka in the skeet mixed team event, Manu Bhaker (who deserves applause for her overall performance) in the 25m pistol final, archers Ankita Bhakat and Dhiraj Bommadevara in mixed team archery match, and shooter Arjun Babuta in the 10m air rifle final. Nobody wants to see so many sportspersons miss out on medals, more so when the Indian contingent has been able to achieve a podium finish only thrice. That's very few, considering the size of the contingent sent to the Olympics from a nation with a population of more than 1.4 billion.\n\nPadukone's assessment must be accepted gracefully, although that may not be easy because he hasn't minced words. He is in the know, and he says, \"The players need to introspect and not just keep asking for more from the federations. They need to ask themselves whether they are working hard enough, because all of these players have their own physios and all the facilities. I don't think any other country, including the US, has so many facilities.\" The players cannot ask for more, according to Padukone, but what they do need is mental conditioning so that they can deal with high-stress situations. Padukone suggests the introduction of foreign sports psychologists, which our authorities must consider as India looks forward to the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles after the present event ends.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, India must take a giant stride forward to become a powerhouse in international sports. As is always the case, numbers show the real picture. Medal tally leader United States has won 86 medals, including 24 golds, followed by our neighbour China, which has won 59 medals, including 22 golds, so far. Even a war-torn Ukraine has won seven medals, including two golds, whereas India shares the 60th spot on the medals chart with Tajikistan. Quite simply, in other words, we must fare far better as a nation. That will happen only after our average sportsperson competing at the highest level is hungry for a podium finish.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Badminton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_doubles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Badminton at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's doubles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U._Vimal_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.

Nonetheless, the Indian contingent had a fair shot at a medal but was not able to deliver the goods.\n\nSen was the only one who was able to make his way to play for the bronze medal but he lost out against the seventh-seeded Jia Lee Zii to end the Indian badminton contingent's campaign on a disappointing note.\n\nThis also marks the first instance since London 2012 where India has returned without a single medal, adding even more disappointment to the performances that were on display.\n\nLet us take a look at how each Indian shuttler performed at the Paris Olympics 2024:\n\nArguably the most disappointing showing amongst the Indian shuttles was certainly the women's doubles duo of Tanisha Crasto and Ashwini Ponappa. The latter's experience was not enough as the pair suffered a group-stage exit, losing all three of their games without winning a single set. Following their final game, Ponappa also announced that it would be her last game at the Olympics.\n\nThe 32-year-old shuttler from Kerala was able to get past the group stages undefeated but was up against the fellow countryman in Lakshya Sen where the latter took the win in a straight-set victory, thus ending his campaign. It is to be noted that Prannoy was suffering from Chikungunya before the Olympics which might have hampered his performances.\n\nAfter a strong show in the group stages where she did not concede a single set in the two matches, Sindhu was up against the sixth-seeded He Bing Jiao from China. Despite a fighting performance in the first set, the Chinese shuttler was able to take the game away in the second set with a more dominant show.\n\nA contender for a possible medal, the experienced Indian duo of Satwik-Chirag had a strong showing in the group stages where they dominated in the two games with straight-set victories. But in the quarterfinals, the third-seeded Indian duo fell against the Malaysian pair of Aaron Chia and Wooi Yik Soh.\n\nBy far India's best showing in badminton for the Parisian games, Sen had a strong start to his tournament by blitzing through the group stages. He also went past fellow compatriot, HS Prannoy in the Round of 16 clash with yet another dominant performance.\n\nBut he was tested in the quarterfinal where Sen was up against Chou Tien-Chen from Taiwan who was the 12th seed. But after conceding the first set, Sen came back strong to win the next two and move ahead.\n\nIn the semi-final, however, the luck of the draw was not in his favour as he was up against the defending champion, Viktor Axelsen from Denmark. Sen looked to take on the challenge but ultimately fell short as the Danish champion took a straight-set victory and went on to win the gold medal.\n\nHowever, Sen had a shot at taking the bronze but Lee Zii Jia from Malaysia was able to come back after conceding the first set to take the bronze medal, thus ending India's campaign on a disappointing yet heartbreaking note.\n\nThe former World No 1, Saina Nehwal was able to create history with India's first medal in Badminton at the Olympics as her opponent Wang Xin from China was forced to pull out in the bronze medal match due to an injury.\n\nPV Sindhu was able to create history as India's first silver-winning medalist in badminton at the Olympic Games. She was also the first Indian woman to claim a silver medal as well. The shuttler made it to the final where she was up against Spain's Carolina Marin where Sindhu suffered a defeat but brought pride to the nation nonetheless.\n\nSindhu was able to create history yet again at the Olympic Games as she became the first Indian woman to have won two medals at the quadrennial event. The 2019 World Champion was defeated by Tai Tzu-Ying of Chinese Taipei en route to the gold medal match. Sindhu was able to beat He Bing Jiao of China to take the bronze medal to bring make the nation proud yet again.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Badminton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_Sen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya Sen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakash_Padukone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prakash Padukone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanisha_Crasto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tanisha Crasto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._V._Sindhu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "P.

What endurance, what agility, what a range of shots, what focus, what grit, what smarts, scintillating badminton on display! It's difficult to encapsulate just how brilliant he's been at the Olympics. Missed out narrowly in a game of extremely small margins. But he's only 22 and he's just getting started.\"\n\nWhen asked if players were pampered too much, hampering their chances of winning, Padukone said, \"Maybe, to some extent. That (pampering) is also required. I hope the players also realize... when you ask for certain things, they also need to deliver. If they don't deliver, then I think you need to be a little firm. Maybe the federation or the government can be.

Reuters\n\nThere will be no badminton medal for India at the Olympics for the first since 2008.\n\nThere was never a badminton medal for India at the Games before 2008 but since 2012 it has always been a contributor. Ever since Saina Nehwal broke the glass ceiling in London 2012 with a bronze, India won three medals in total. Apart from Saina, PV Sindhu won the other two - a silver and another bronze.\n\nThe winning run, however, came to an end at the Paris Olympics 2024 with Lakshya Sen being the only one coming close to a medal in the sport.\n\nSindhu, who has an impressive big tournament record with two Olympic and five world championship medals, for the first in her career, failed to win a medal at the Games.\n\nThe 29-year-old ace shuttler had been struggling for form for a while while fighting a battle with injuries at the same time. She returned to action only in February after recovering from a knee injury but suffered first or second round exits at the All England Open, Swiss Open, Asia Championships, Singapore Open, and Indonesia Open.\n\nThe Malaysia Masters was the only tournament where she reached and final but lost after winning the first game.\n\nPoor form wasn't the biggest concern, as the Hyderabad player had never entered an Olympics in top form but had always managed to win a medal. The real issue was her fitness and injury rehabilitation.\n\nAt the Olympics, the drop in fitness level and the lack of cutting edge ended her chances.\n\nAfter securing one-sided wins over lower-ranked players in the group, Sindhu faltered at her first real test, against China's sixth seed He Bing Jiao in the Round of 16.\n\nThree years ago, Sindhu defeated He Bing Jiao to win bronze in Tokyo. However, in Paris, Sindhu struggled to gain a lead as Bing Jiao's solid defensive game and attacking forehand left Sindhu with no opportunity to relieve the pressure, highlighting the impact of age on her performance.\n\nSindhu, however, is hurt but not out.\n\n\"This loss is possibly one of the hardest of my long career. It will take time to accept, but as life moves forward, I know I will come to terms with it,\" she wrote on social media after the Olympics exit.\n\n\"Regarding my future, I want to be clear: I will continue, albeit after a small break. My body, and more importantly, my mind need it.\"\n\nSatwik-Chirag disappoint\n\nGiven Sindhu's struggle with poor form and injury, her exit was disappointing but not entirely surprising. However, Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty in men's doubles were seen as strong medal contenders. The former world No.1 pair has earned a reputation of being carefree but formidable opponents capable of beating the best on their day.\n\nThey advanced to the Round of 16 with easy wins in the group stage but stumbled at their first real challenge against Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik of Malaysia in the quarter-finals.\n\nThe No.3 seeded Indian pair led after the first game and seemed destined for a semi-final spot. However, the Tokyo bronze medallists staged a comeback, eventually winning the match. The Malaysians also secured bronze at Paris 2024.\n\nAlthough Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik once held an 8-0 head-to-head record against Satwik-Chirag, that dominance had been overturned with the Indian duo winning the last three encounters. In this crucial quarter-final, Satwik and Chirag struggled with nerves and rushed their play after falling behind, rather than taking their time and adjusting their strategy.\n\nAs Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik began to control the match, the Indian pair wilted under pressure, losing 21-13, 14-21, 16-21.\n\nThe women's doubles pair of Tanisha Crasto and Ashwini Ponnappa failed to get out of their group.\n\nIn the men's singles, HS Prannoy reached the Round of 16 where he was thumped by compatriot Lakshya Sen 21-12, 21-6 when the senior shuttler didn't look physically ready for the game.\n\nSen's brush with history\n\nLakshya, however, had a lot left in the gas as he went on to produce one of his best performances against higher-ranked Chou Tien-chen of Taiwan in the quarter-finals. The CTC match was seen as a potential stumbling block for Sen and while the Taiwanese won the first game 21-19, the Indian was quick to reply and blew him out of competition with a 21-15, 21-12 win in the last two games.\n\nSen's supercharged badminton of quick reflexes, flat smashes, and the ability to cover the court and return almost anything proved too tough for the veteran who fought cancer last year.\n\nWith that win, the 22-year-old from Almora created history by becoming the first male shuttler from India to cross the quarter-finals barrier at the Olympics.\n\nHe entered the semi-final against reigning champions Viktor Axelsen with the same energy, taking a 20-17 lead in the first game and 7-0 in the second, before losing both and the opportunity to secure a first badminton medal for an Indian male shuttler at the Games.\n\nMore than anything it felt like Sen slipped under pressure and not Axelsen's long reach, lethal forehands, quick returns, or mental fortitude.\n\nThe bronze medal match against Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia proved to be something similar where Sen won the first game but then dropped the tempo as the match progressed and saw the medal slip away from his hands. Lee was highly error-prone in the first game and sort of gifted the initiative to Sen but the young shuttler wasn't ready to grab them with both hands.\n\nThe failure has kicked off a major controversy with his coach Prakash Padukone taking him to the cleaners with his media byte.\n\nPadukone's method can be questioned but his words can't be.\n\nSatwik-Chirag and Sen did become victims of pressure and expectations at the Games as shuttlers returned empty hands.\n\nBut then again Rome wasn't built in one day. Before Saina Nehwal won that bronze in 2012, many tried and failed.\n\nIf we take that as a precursor, then good things should happen in the future and if we are mistaken then Indian badminton is in for a tough time.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._V._Sindhu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "P.

I think that it's high time that the players also take responsibility. At least for the results in this Olympics and the previous one, you cannot hold the federations and government responsible for the results. They have all done whatever they can. Ultimately the responsibility is on the players to go and deliver when it matters the most,\" Padukone stated in talks with reporters after Sen's loss in the Bronze medal match.\n\nPadukone stated that it was in fact on the players, at this point, to introspect, and find a way to win, rather than demand the federations to do more for them.\n\n\"The players need to introspect, and not just keep asking for more from the federations. They need to ask themselves whether they are working hard enough, because all of these players have their own physios and all the facilities. I don't think any other country, including the US, has so many facilities.\"\n\nPadukone's comments have left everyone torn. On one hand, the former shuttler's comments may seem harsh, especially when Sen had just lost out on a medal in a heartbreaking defeat.\n\nBut, on the other hand, Padukone is not wrong. India have failed to register success and this time around especially, the trend has been in full effect at the Paris Olympics, with multiple fourth-place finishes and even more disappointing early exits from touted favorites.\n\nA lot has been said about federations not supporting players. But, to quote Padukone himself, that argument can't hold its weight anymore.\n\nFederations across sports have grown to accommodate the demands of the top athletes, with schemes such as the TOPS (Target Olympic Podium Scheme) well into its 10th year of implementation to aid the growth of athletes in the country.\n\nOver the past half a decade especially, much can be said about the commercial exposure many sports have garnered too, thanks to the hosting of league-style tournaments, to bring more eyes and money into the sport as well.\n\nSuperstar players across these sports do exist and they are usually in a position to have their demands met, sometimes to the fault of the federations themselves. But, this time around, there has been no proven superstar talent who has brought home Olympic glory yet.\n\nThere are quite a few opportunities for India to rake in some more silverware, but for the time being, let's take a look at the Indian contingent's performances so far, and peruse through the dejections that the nation has had to endure so far.\n\nBADMINTON:\n\nPadukone unfortunately will now bear the load of having coached the Indian badminton contingent to their first medal-less finish at the Olympics since 2008.\n\nObviously the whole conversation was birthed right after Indian shuttler Lakshya Sen's crushing defeat on Monday. So, let's start there.\n\nSen, 22, was in blazing form through the Olympics, putting away his opponents with ease, and cruising to a historic first semifinal where he faced off against the reigning champion Viktor Axelsen.\n\nDespite the inherent challenge of taking on the top seed, Sen got off to a sensational start, piling the pressure on Axelsen to take a huge lead, all for it to be demolished by the Dane and to be swept away by him in 2 straight games.\n\nIn a bronze medal match, where Sen once again dominated his opponent out the gate to take the lead, disaster would striker again, and Sen would end up losing the ordeal in three games as the almost seemingly-assured Bronze slipped right out of his fingers.\n\nBut, it does not end there in badminton. PV Sindhu, a two-time Olympic medallist, herself came up short when she was needed.\n\nFollowing a poor season lately, it was understandable that Sindhu would have been shaky for a bit. But, as a two-time Olympic medallist, one would have expected the ace to clean up her act and go for glory again. But, alas, she lost in the quarterfinal of the Women's Individual event.\n\nA rather shocking and almost silent disappointment in the Badminton contingent was none other than the pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty.\n\nSatiwk-Chirag, arguably the best men's duo in world badminton currently, was another pair expected to bring home a medal with ease. But, just like Sindhu, they faltered in the quarterfinals, going down in three sets to Malaysia's Aaron Chia and Soh Wooi Yik after taking the lead. But, again, they were hailed for making it this far, but not criticised for losing out.\n\nARCHERY:\n\nAfter a strong showing in the international circuit, much was expected from the Indian archery contingent. But, yet again, like always, they failed to make it count, as India still remains medal-less in the discipline at the Olympics.\n\nThere exists a severe problem with former Korean coach Woong Ki being denied accreditation for the Paris Olympics, and in his place, former archer Purnima Mahato being sent.\n\nBut, yet again, when it boiled down to hitting the mark personally, the archers missed terribly.\n\nIndian's veteran archer Deepika Kumari once again missed out on making her way to a medal finish, as she slumped to a bad loss in the quarterfinal of the Women's Individual event.\n\nAnother pair who joined the regretful club of fourth-place finishers was Dhiraj Bommadevara and Ankita Bhakat, who both fell at the very last step to let a Bronze medal slip away from India's grasps.\n\nSHOOTING:\n\nAnother contingent that had its fair share of athletes who failed to hit the mark was Shooting.\n\nNow, bear in mind, that this is currently the only contingent that has brought in any and every bit of silverware for India. So, there has been a new ray of light shining through for Indian Athletics, especially in the form of Manu Bhaker.\n\nBut still, one would be remiss to miss out on those who could have joined Bhaker and Sarabjot to bring home more Olympic glory.\n\nAmongst those names, lie Maheshwari Chauhan and Ananjteet Naruka. The Skeet duo were one win away from securing the Bronze right when they fell and lost the bou by 1 point to settel for the consolation 4th.\n\nWhy even the glorious Manu Bhaker herself was a victim of the curse, as a hat-trick of medals was on the cards after Bhaker had claimed two bronzes earlier. But despite taking second place in the qualifiers, she was not able to replicate her performance as she finished fourth after a shoot-off against Hungary's Veronika Major.\n\nAnother Indian shooter who fell in the last step was Arjun Babuta, who was a mere 1.4 points away from clinching a medal as Babuta finished with a score of 208.4 while Croatia's Miran Maricic did better with a score of 209.8 in the men's 10m Air Rifle Shooting.\n\nBut, the biggest disappointment of all was Sift Kaur Samra.\n\nSift Kaur Samra became the first individual gold medallist for India at the Asian Games 2023 claiming the top prize in the Women's 50m Rifle 3 Position event and did it in style setting a world record en route to the same.\n\nBut, as the shooter came into the Olympics, she slumped to an abysmal exit in the qualification round for the Women's 50m Air Rifle, finishing a dismal 31st in rankings.\n\nBOXING:\n\nTop medal contenders like Lovlina Borgohain and Nikhat Zareen also came back empty but not a word has been said about their performance.\n\nLovlina Borgohain led the charge for the boxing contingent, as the Indian fought her way to the quarterfinal of the Women's 75kg event. But, as she stood just possibly a win or two away from a medal finish, she was ousted by China's Li Qian by a split decision, as another Indian once again failed to deliver when it mattered.\n\nNow, to be slightly fair to Borgohain, Qian was in fact the top-seeded boxer in the division and would most definitely prove to be a handful for anyone. But then again, champions are only made when one usurps an existing one.\n\nWhat cannot be taken lightly though is how the remainder of the boxing contingent performed. Especially two of the biggest names in Indian boxing: Nikhat Zareen and Amit Panghal.\n\nComing into the Olympics, Zareen was undoubtedly looked up to as a potential medal-winner for India. But, nobody could have foreseen an embarrassing exit at the round of 16 itself, as China's Wu Yu dominated Zareen.\n\nLike the case was with Borgohain, Zareen was also going up against the top-seeded boxer in her division. But, to lose in the manner she did, a 5-0 unanimous decision against Zareen, was nothing less than shocking and embarrassing.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakash_Padukone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prakash Padukone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Badminton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_Sen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya Sen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._V._Sindhu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "P.

The Indian had just done what he should have avoided throughout the evening at the La Chapelle Arena - lifting the shuttle high from the net.\n\nOnly this time, it was the match point for Lee. The Malaysian not only connected the shot, he picked the bones out of the shuttle. It went down and down within the blink of an eye before hitting Sen flush on the thigh.\n\nIt was probably one of the fastest smashes of the match. Or so it seemed, as it shattered the Olympic dream for Sen.\n\nAfter a splendid run into the 2024 Paris Olympics semi-finals - the first-ever for an Indian in the men's singles event - the 22-year-old from Almora fell agonisingly short of a spot on the podium. He had conceded the bronze medal match to Lee 21-13, 16-21, 11-21 after being a game up.\n\nSen, after all the hard work over the course of last week, lost his second match in two days. Three days back, he was just a win away from a historic Olympic podium. On Monday, he stood a broken man.\n\n\"I had my chances,\" Sen muttered to the broadcasters, fighting back tears. \"I could have done better in the second game.\"\n\nIn hindsight, he could have done much, much better.\n\nSen, much like during his semi-final against Viktor Axelsen on Sunday, was in control of the bronze medal match. He had a 8-3 lead in the second game after dominating the first, as Lee struggled to control the shuttle from the faster end.\n\nBut much like the past, Sen lost the plot once again. Having called the shots in the match until then, the 2021 World Championships bronze medallist went into a shell.\n\nAs has been the case with him countless times in the past, Sen lost points in clusters. As soon as Lee started to take the attack to him, the Indian crumbled. His defence, as usual, was watertight, but he failed to create winning opportunities out of them.\n\nA couple of judgement errors at the backline from Sen combined with lifts gone long due to the drift, and a few poor shots in general meant that the 26-year-old Malaysian went on nine-point run. The scoreline went from 8-3 in Sen's favour to 8-12 as he kept playing the shuttle towards Lee's backhand.\n\nSen rectified his errors soon with inputs from the coaching bench of Prakash Padukone and Vimal Kumar and equalised at 12-12. But, the joy did not last long.\n\nHaving sensed the opportunity, Lee continued to pose tough questions. Sen's mid-court lifts set up easy smashing opportunities and the Malaysian wasn't complaining. Lee upped the ante in the latter stages to force a decider.\n\nSen never seemed at his best in the decider. A bleeding elbow on his playing right arm did not help either. He had to call for medical assistance twice as he trailed 6-11 before the change of sides.\n\n\"In between points, there was blood on the floor,\" said Sen. \"It was breaking the momentum, having to go off and then trying to refocus.\"\n\nEven as Sen tried to fight back, Lee wasn't having it. Leading 8-15, the Malaysian put up a stunning display - possibly the play of the match. As Sen disguised a clever drop shot, Lee came running forward and dove full length to return the shuttle.\n\nThe Indian was ready at the net and just tapped it back. Lee, back to his feet in a jiffy, flicked the shuttle back onto the open backcourt to finish the point, while Sen was rooted at the net.\n\nSen was stunned. He knew there was no miraculous comeback on the cards. Lee just would not allow it.\n\nSen's loss brought an end to India's medal winning spree in badminton at the Olympic Games. For the first time since Saina Nehwal's bronze at the 2012 edition in London, no Indian shuttler would stand on the Olympic podium.\n\nSen gave it his all. He played seven matches - the most by a men's singles shuttler - in a span of ten days at the La Chapelle Arena. He had his first-ever Olympic win deleted as Guatemala's Kevin Cordon withdrew with an injury.\n\nHe emerged out on top from the group of death. He beat three higher-ranked players in a row enroute to the semi-final.\n\nSen, unseeded, kept Indian hopes alive after a men's doubles favourites Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty and two-time women's singles medallist PV Sindhu were knocked out.\n\nHaving made a late dash to qualify for the Olympics, Sen held his own. He could have returned with a historic medal, but he can hold his head high.\n\nSen even impressed the eventual gold medallist Axelsen, who termed their semi-final as one of the toughest battles of his career.\n\n\"Four years from now, he'll be one of the favourite to win the gold,\" said Axelsen.\n\nThis time, what he had was not enough.\n\nSen sports a tattoo on his neck with the words \"Sky is the limit.\"", "source": {"uri": "scroll.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scroll.in"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhijit_nair@scroll.in", "name": "Abhijit Nair", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_Sen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya Sen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Zii_Jia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Zii Jia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almora", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Almora"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Almora"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_ICF_Canoe_Slalom_World_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021 ICF Canoe Slalom World Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Axelsen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Axelsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U._Vimal_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.

Prakash, a former All England champion, did not hold back as he urged players to take more responsibility and repay the faith shown in them by the coaching, sporting bodies and the government.\n\n\"Disappointing to see this.

This also brought an end to Indian badminton's streak of Olympic medals stretching back to London 2012.\n\nThe 22-year-old Indian went down 21-13, 16-21, 11-21 to Malaysia's Lee Zii Jia in the bronze medal match, squandering a lead of a game and five points. It was a breakdown under pressure as he visibly unravelled against an opponent on whom he held a positive 4-1 record.\n\nINDIA'S OLYMPIC MEDAL TALLY | INDIA AT PARIS OLYMPICS | LATEST OLYMPIC NEWS | KEY DATES AT PARIS 2024\n\nAfter a path-breaking campaign in Paris, where Lakshya knocked out higher-ranked opponents as an unseeded player and was a win away from a historic medal, to end up with nothing is an unimaginably difficult position to be in.\n\nMake that two losses on consecutive days from advantageous positions after coming so close and it tells of a fundamental problem.\n\nThis isn't the first time he has been let down by his instinct and mentality under the pump. But this also gives him an opportunity to build for the future.\n\nAs eventual gold medallist Viktor Axelsen said after their semifinal, Lakshya has the potential to be a genuine contender for the next Olympics gold -- once he gets enough experience of being in such situations.\n\n\"He has shown in this Olympics that he is a very, very strong competitor and I am sure in four years from now, he will be one of the favourites to win the gold,\" Axelsen. \"Lakshya thought a lot about it. It was a big thing for him obviously, I know what the rings does to your mind.\"\n\nThat pressure is evidently what got to Lakshya.\n\nThe Indian was still processing the result when he spoke right after the match, his eyes almost glazed over as in the final stages of the match against Lee where the pressure of the situation got to him.\n\nOn the face of it, there are very few positives to take home from these two days.\n\nHe had three game points and a lead of 7-0 against the best player in the world. He had the first game and a 5-point advantage against a player he has lost only once to before. He lost both when the enormity of the situation kicked in. In the same spot before, he had raised his game on a court he had spent the most time in. This time, he lost his bearings and made several line misjudgements and unforced errors.\n\nBut there are some positives from the matches before.\n\nHe came out of the group that has third seed Jonatan Christie, he beat compatriot HS Prannoy and won a tough quarterfinal against Chou Tien Chen playing one of the highest quality matches he has in his young career.\n\nHe exhibited the same quality at the start of his next two matches, but he couldn't close out when things mattered, and this will be the thought that will haunt him for a while to come.\n\nWhere does he go from here? How does he look back on his Paris sojourn?\n\nThere is the white, the black and the grey. The ability to be among the best, the absolute collapse under pressure and the grey matter needed to get over that obvious weakness.\n\nFirst, he has to regroup and then comes the introspection and the mental work. Physically, he is at the peak of his game but it's the intangibles of emotions that he has to work on.\n\nLakshya is not a stranger to turning around from rock-bottom confidence. Around this time last year, he went through a rough patch which continued till the start of this years. He lost to virtual unknowns on the national circuit and had seven-straight first-round exits on the BWF Tour. His childhood coach Vimal Kumar said it was a purely mental crisis as he was physically fit. He had to pull himself out of the depths of his confidence crisis.\n\nHe split from his coach Anup Sridhar, got Vimal back on the road, along with mentor Prakash Padukone, and incredibly turned around a corner to qualify for the Olympics in one of the final legs of the Race to Paris. With some help from mental coach Paddy Upton, who famously was with the Indian cricket team during the 2011 World Cup win.\n\nLakshya will have to now go back to that template, perhaps get more sessions with Upton, who is currently with the Indian hockey team in Paris, and form scar tissue over the very fresh wound.\n\nBadminton is a sport that happens week in and week out, which gives him plenty of time to get in the match time and recover from this. Lakshya has never lacked talent but it's the temperament that is missing. And that will only come in with more consistency on the BWF Tour.\n\nHe needs to put himself in big finals again, and win them. He has plenty of big wins - over almost every top player - in his short career but it's the titles he should target next. The Commonwealth gold and India Open as a Super 500 can't be his biggest wins as he goes into the next Olympic cycle.\n\nIf he can do that, then with his potential and physicality, he can fulfil two-time reigning Olympic champion Axelsen's prophecy and be one to watch out for at Los Angeles 2028.", "source": {"uri": "espn.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zenia_d_cunha@espn.in", "name": "Zenia D'Cunha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Axelsen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Axelsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_Sen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya Sen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Zii_Jia", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Zii Jia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Badminton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonatan_Christie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonatan Christie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Badminton World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_men's_national_field_hockey_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India men's national field hockey team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anup_Sridhar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anup Sridhar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U._Vimal_Kumar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.

It helped the Malaysian that he was on the better side of the court in the second half of the decider, playing against the drift after the change of ends, and benefitting from the fact that the shuttle stayed in at the opposite baseline, forcing Sen repeatedly into errors of judgment.\n\nAlso Read: India's Day 11 schedule: Men's hockey team set eyes on gold, Vinesh in action\n\nA grazed elbow, which had been taped even before the match, but bled at times during the encounter, making it mandatory as per the rules to have it attended to by a (bumbling) official doctor, proved more of a distraction than a source of any real discomfort for Sen. As he admitted after the match, the blood on the court and mopping up operations caused him to lose momentum on more than one occasion.\n\nPerhaps a podium spot was not destined to be. After the totally tepid gold medal match between Axelsen and Thailand's reigning world champion, Kunlavut Vitidsarn ended with a 21-11, 21-11 demolition of the Thai's challenge, it was small comfort for the Indian badminton lover to conclude that their compatriot had given the Dane a far more harrowing time than the Thai, and could be considered the second-best male player in these Olympics, worthy of a silver medal.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_Sen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya Sen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Axelsen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Axelsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Zii_Jia", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lee Zii Jia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Badminton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartier_de_La_Chapelle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quartier de La Chapelle"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mercury (element)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_men's_national_field_hockey_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India men's national field hockey team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunlavut_Vitidsarn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kunlavut Vitidsarn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/aug/sen-alex-a_d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791908", "eventUri": "eng-9791908", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

AFP\n\nNeeraj Chopra did exactly what was hoped of him. He qualified for the men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s javelin throw final at the Paris Olympics 2024 with just one throw of 89.34m.\n\nOut of the 12 athletes who qualified for the final, only Neeraj crossed the 89m mark. Anderson Peters of Grenada followed with 88.63m, and Germany\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Julian Weber recorded 87.76m.\n\nQualification is not final, but Neeraj's dominant and reassuring performance, also with just one throw, once again highlighted that he remains a few levels above any Indian athletes of all time.\n\nThis wasn't the first time Neeraj had done something like this, stamping his mark on a competition with his very first throw (or at times with just his second or third attempt). He won India's first Olympic gold in athletics three years back with just his second throw of 87.58m.\n\nThe swift qualification, however, comes at a very interesting time in Indian sports where the opinions are highly divided after badminton legend Prakash Padukone decided to go the whole hog over athletes failing to win medals at the Olympics after getting into the winning positions.\n\nAfter his trainee Lakshya Sen lost the bronze medal match despite winning the first game, Padukone lost his cool.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153After Milkha Singh in 64' and PT Usha in the 80s, we have so many fourth place finishes. I think that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s high time that the players also take responsibility,\u00e2\u20ac Padukone told the Indian media in Paris.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153At least for the results in this Olympics and the previous one, you cannot hold the federations and government responsible for the results. They have all done whatever they can. Ultimately the responsibility is on the players to go an deliver when it matters the most,\u00e2\u20ac Padukone stated.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The players need to introspect, and not just keep asking for more from the federations. They need to ask themselves whether they are working hard enough, because all of these players have their own physios and all the facilities. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think any other country, including the US, has so many facilities.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nWas Padukone wrong to say what he said?\n\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no surprise that Padukone, who became world No 1 in badminton and won the prestigious All England tournament in 1980 despite the lack of support for the sport at the time, did not hesitate in speaking without mincing words.\n\nRead | Why Prakash Padukone lashed out at athletes? What has been the response?\n\nYou can question the timing or his quotes, but it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to say there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no truth in what he was saying.\n\nSen didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just lose the bronze medal match; even in the semi-final against the eventual gold medal winner Viktor Axelsen,\u00c2 the 22-year-old was 20-17 up in the first game and 7-0 in the second before losing both.\n\nAfter surviving miraculously, Axelsen was curt in his assessment of Sen's defeat.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153(At 20-17) I could definitely feel he was tense,\u00e2\u20ac Axelsen said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was a big thing for him, of course, no Indian men\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s singles player has done what he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing at the moment, so he maybe started to think about what he was doing, and the pressure was there.\"\n\nBadminton men's doubles pair Satwaiksairaj Ranki Reddy and Chirag Shetty, who were one of the biggest medal hopes for the country, also lost in their quarter-finals after winning the first game.\n\nDhiraj Bommadevara and Ankita Bhakat lost in the mixed team archery bronze medal match.\n\nThere have been two fourth-place finishes in shooting as well and while the margins are too small in this sport, some countries and athletes are still able to churn out results consistently.\n\nOlympics: India's fourth-place finishes at the Summer Games\n\nNow you can understand what Padukone meant. There wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t malice in his comments; rather, he aimed to highlight the stumbling blocks.\n\nHowever, public rebukes and media criticism are likely to do less to motivate athletes and more to add fuel to the fire against them.\n\nNo wonder India's first individual gold medallist Abhinav Bindra was quick to douse the fire.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Competing at an Olympics is an extraordinary challenge. It is a testament to the dedication and sacrifice of every athlete. I am incredibly proud of the fight by athletes who have finished fourth at the Paris Olympics. It is a difficult time for them but to come so close to a medal is a monumental achievement. It is important to recognise the hard work of not just the athletes but their coaches, support staff and families. We must always and always stand by our athletes,\u00e2\u20ac Bindra told RevSportz Global.\n\nIn this context, it's refreshing to see Neeraj not being bothered by the weight of expectations. It's a quality that is extremely rare in the Indian sporting world and mind you even the super popular Indian men's cricket team is not untouched. It took them 13 years to win a second World Cup after their 2011 triumph in a sport where there are always only a few contenders.\n\nNeeraj shared a few secrets after taking just one throw to reach the final in Paris.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153My biggest motivation is that I always go out to do my best because I know I have not reached my peak,\u00e2\u20ac Chopra said when asked about his motivation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I am not yet as good as I would like to be technically or in distance, so I want to improve and throw further.\n\n\"And I want to set an example for other Indian athletes so that we can compete here with the best countries in athletics.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nMany might say that Neeraj is gifted, but as the only Indian athlete to win both Olympic and World Championship gold said, the secret lies in his approach and mindset.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neeraj_Chopra", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neeraj Chopra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakash_Padukone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prakash Padukone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "\u00c2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Badminton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Weber", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julian Weber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_Sen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya Sen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anderson Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Axelsen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Axelsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milkha_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milkha Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._T._Usha", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "P.

Padukone, current India badminton coach, witnessed Lakshya Sen bow out in fourth place on Monday (August 5) and add to flurry of missed medals.\n\nParis Olympics: News, schedule, medals tally and more\n\nIndia have had multiple cases of so near yet so far at the Paris Olympics. Shooters Arjun Babuta, Manu Bhaker, Maheshwari Chauhan-Anant Jeet Singh Naruka; archers Dhiraj Bommadevara-Ankita Bhakat and now Sen have come narrowly close to winning a medal.\n\nInstead, India's current tally reads three - all bronzes in shooting - and are glaring at the possibility of poorer show than the high of seven medals at Tokyo 2020.\n\nEven though Sen created history with his deep run, Padukone didn't mince any words on India's lacklustre show.\n\n\"After Milkha Singh in 64' and PT Usha in the 80s, we have so many fourth-place finishes.

Maybe, you know, the players are not working hard enough. You know, maybe it is not enough to get a medal at the Olympics.\" he added.\n\nIn response to Padukone's remarks, Bindra, a Beijing 2008 gold medallist, said, \"Competing at an Olympics is an extraordinary challenge.

The embers of the badminton revolution are slowly dying.\n\nIt was not a happy sight for the coach of the team Prakash Padukone either. He sounded morose during a brief interaction with the waiting media outside the Porte de la Chapelle arena.\n\nLakshya's loss has stirred his emotions. He didn't mince his words. He said that there is no point blaming the federations, foundations or the academies. \"They can only do so much,\" he said. \"We can provide everything we can. But ultimately players also have to take responsibility and go out there and deliver when it matters the most.\n\nBecause it's not what we are expecting... they have beaten the same players in some other tournaments. So when it comes to the Olympics, we are not able to. We need to introspect, the players also need to introspect.\"\n\nPadukone also felt that the shuttlers have been backed in every possible way. \"You cannot keep asking for more and more and more,\" he said.\n\n\"You have to introspect, 'okay, am I doing enough?'\" He felt that it could be that the players are not working hard enough. \"Maybe whatever they are doing is not enough to get a medal at the Olympics.\" He felt the players also need to work and one cannot just expect only the coaches to work all the time.", "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indraneel_das@newindianexpress.com", "name": "Indraneel Das", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Badminton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_Sen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya Sen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prakash_Padukone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prakash Padukone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshya_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakshya (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ground meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/TNIE%2Fimport%2F2021%2F5%2F13%2Foriginal%2FPrakash_Padukone_PTI.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791908", "eventUri": "eng-9791908", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 97, "relevance": 1}

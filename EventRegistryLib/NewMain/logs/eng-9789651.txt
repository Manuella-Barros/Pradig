Ceccon had picked up 2 medals at the games this year as he won gold in the 100m backstroke event and bronze in the men's 4x100m freestyle relay. This had come after Ceccon had complained about the living conditions.\n\nIn an Instagram story which was shared by Saudi Arabian rower Husein Alireza, Ceccon was spotted sleeping in a park. The Italian swimmer had put a towel on the ground and was seen sleeping on his side. The timing of the photo, whether it was taken before or after Ceccon and his teammates' unsuccessful attempt to reach the men's 4x100m medley relay final, remains uncertain. You can see the image below:\n\nParis Olympics 2024: India Schedule | Full Coverage | Medal Tally\n\nCeccon had complained about the living conditions inside the village and claimed there was no air conditioning in the village and the food was bad. He said that many athletes have moved out of the Olympics village for this reason.\n\nCeccon said that he struggles to have a nap in the afternoon due to the heat and the noise in the afternoon.\n\n\"There is no air conditioning in the village, it's hot, the food is bad.\"\n\n\"Many athletes move for this reason: it's not an alibi or excuse, it's the reality of what perhaps not everyone knows.\"\n\n\"I'm disappointed that I didn't make the final but I was too tired.

The entire US tennis team, apart from Gauff had left the village for alternate lodging elsewhere.

also a world record holder in the 100m backstroke - is not the only athlete to find serious faults with the living arrangements.\n\nOrganisers believed the design of the 2,807 'self-cooling' apartments would make air conditioning redundant - but they have been proved wrong.\n\nFrench swimmer Assia Touati said: \"We had no AC in the bedroom but they installed it anyway because it was getting too hot.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Andy Anson, chief of the British Olympic Association admitted that private chefs had to be called in as an emergency measure.\n\nHe told The Times: \"There are not enough of certain foods: eggs, chicken, certain carbohydrates, and then there is the quality of the food, with raw meat being served to athletes.\"\n\nAnd Tom Daley had fans in stitches when he showed himself bouncing around on the cardboard \"anti-sex\" beds- which have been criticised.\n\nThe recyclable beds were first introduced at Tokyo 2020 but athletes were quick to joke they were only meant to support one person, ruling out any romantic encounters.\n\nAnd seven-time Olympic gymnastic champion Simone Biles wrote on TikTok that the \"beds suck\" but noted her team were \"getting mattress toppers.\"\n\nAustralian water polo player Matilda Kearns posted to social media that she \"already had a massage to undo the damage\" from sleeping on the mattress.", "source": {"uri":

It's hard to sleep both at night and in the afternoon.\n\n\"Usually, when I'm at home, I always sleep in the afternoon: here I really struggle between the heat and the noise\".\n\nAnd Ceccon - who is also a world record holder in the 100m backstroke - is not the only athlete to find serious faults with the living arrangements.\n\nAmerican star Coco Gauff revealed her fellow female tennis team quit the village after finding the quarters \"too cramped.\"\n\nThe World No2 made an amazing revelation on a TikTok video she shared with her millions of followers.\n\nOrganisers believed the design of the 2,807 'self-cooling' apartments would make air conditioning redundant - but they have been proved wrong.\n\nFrench swimmer Assia Touati said: \"We had no AC in the bedroom but they installed it anyway because it was getting too hot.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Andy Anson, chief of the British Olympic Association admitted that private chefs had to be called in as an emergency measure.\n\nHe told The Times: \"There are not enough of certain foods: eggs, chicken, certain carbohydrates, and then there is the quality of the food, with raw meat being served to athletes.\"\n\nAnd Tom Daley had fans in stitches when he showed himself bouncing around on the cardboard \"anti-sex\" beds- which have been criticised.\n\nThe recyclable beds were first introduced at Tokyo 2020 but athletes were quick to joke they were only meant to support one person, ruling out any romantic encounters.\n\nStill more than 300,000 condoms were placed around the village - which is often cited as 'sex mad' - for the 15,000 residents.\n\nAnd seven-time Olympic gymnastic champion Simone Biles wrote on TikTok that the \"beds suck\" but noted her team were \"getting mattress toppers.\"\n\nAustralian water polo player Matilda Kearns posted to social media that she \"already had a massage to undo the damage\" from sleeping on the mattress.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US

Saudi rower Husein Alireza spotted Ceccon napping on a towel in a park and posted a snap of the bizarre image on Instagram. He tagged the Olympic Village grounds as the location where the Italian had a snooze.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the picture was taken before or after Ceccon and Italy were eliminated from the men's 4x100m medley heats. However, it is just the latest episode in a long and winding series of criticisms aimed at the Paris oragnisers for the poor state of the Olympic village.\n\nRelated Today at the Olympics - Things You May Have Missed from Paris 2024\n\nThe little stories that slipped through the net but make the Olympics so special.\n\n2 Olympic Village Continues To Attract Criticism The backlash isn't new\n\nCeccon isn't the first - nor is he expected to be the last - to make a comment on the poor living conditions at this summer's Games. Indeed, the 23-year-old has been joined by Coco Gauff, Ariarne Titmus and Assia Touati in complaining about the accommodation provided by Paris organisers.\n\nAfter defending her Olympic gold medal in the 400m freestyle, Aussie swimmer Titmus felt she could have broken the world record had she been staying in better accommodation. \"It probably wasn't the time I thought I was capable of, but living in the Olympic Village makes it hard to perform,\" she admitted in an interview after the race.\n\n\"It's definitely not made for high performance, so it's about who can really keep it together in the mind.\"\n\nThe beds in the Olympic Village have been the focus of controversy for their lack of comfort and their supposed 'wokeness'.

Then you have to come back down that next day to swim the heats of the 200m freestyle, very hard to do,\" Magnussen said.\n\nIt came after organisers of the Paris Olympic village were lambasted for the poor living conditions athletes faced, with Magnussen telling Johns many athletes would \"miss out\" on a medal due to being \"unsettled by this new environment\".\n\nThe discontent has been so severe the American tennis team has left the Olympic Village for a nearby hotel.\n\n\"We haven't seen this at an Olympic Games before.

'Many athletes move for this reason: it's not an alibi or excuse, it's the reality of what perhaps not everyone knows.\n\n'Usually, when I'm at home, I always sleep in the afternoon: here I really struggle between the heat and the noise.'\n\nNow, an image that has gone viral on social media has shown Ceccon taking extreme measures to get some rest.\n\nSaudi rower Husein Alireza spotted Ceccon napping on a towel in a park and posted a snap of the bizarre image on Instagram.

Ceccon also won a bronze medal in the 4x100m freestyle earlier in the week.\n\nCeccon also earned some attention for his looks, with some viral attention when he accidentally showed off his abs during the medal ceremony for the 4x100m final. One viral post dubbed Ceccon the \"hottest swimmer\" at the Paris Olympics, and several other reports noted the way the internet swooned at his appearance.\n\nCeccon is now going viral again. A video posted on August 4 showed the Italian swimmer curled up beside a bench at a park in Paris, lying on a white sheet with his Olympic bag near his head.\n\nCeccon was apparently escaping the conditions inside the Olympic Village, where he complained about a lack of air conditioning.\n\n\"There is no air conditioning in the village, it's hot, the food is bad,\" Ceccon said earlier in the week. \"Many athletes move for this reason: it's not an alibi or excuse, it's the reality of what perhaps not everyone knows.\"\n\nCeccon also added context to the viral video, saying he usually sleeps in the afternoon when he is at home but was struggling to find rest in the Olympic Village.\n\nRelated: Simone Biles Sent Four-Word Message to Suni Lee Before Record-Setting Medal", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nathan_dougherty@postandcourier.com", "name": "Nathan Dougherty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Ceccon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Ceccon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Backstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunisa_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunisa Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789651", "eventUri": "eng-9789651", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 327, "textEnd": 334}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 822, "textEnd": 830}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

The facilities have been widely criticized throughout the Paris Games. After failing to reach the 200-meter backstroke final on Wednesday, Ceccon voiced his frustrations. \"There is no air conditioning in the village, it's hot, the food is bad,\" he told The Sun.\n\n\"Many athletes move for this reason: it's not an alibi or an excuse, it's the reality of what perhaps not everybody knows,\" he said. \"I'm disappointed that I didn't make the final, but I was too tired.

Perhaps she should try sleeping on the ground for a more restful night.\n\nThe Indian contingent also faced discomfort due to the soaring temperatures and lack of cooling systems in the Olympic Village. The Indian sports ministry intervened by sending 40 portable air conditioners to the village, according to PTI.

Ceccon smashed his own world record to win a gold medal in the 100-meter backstroke earlier this week. It was Italy's first-ever medal in the event.\n\nHowever, he completely choked in the 200. Ceccon was considered likely to get on the podium but didn't even make the eight-swimmer field for the Final. He flopped out during the qualification heats.\n\nAnd heat was apparently part of the issue!\n\nCeccon blamed his poor performance on the Olympic Village. The highly-contentious living situation made him tired.\n\nIn the Village there is no air conditioning, it's hot, the food is bad. Many athletes move because of this. It is not an alibi it is the pure chronicle of what perhaps not everyone knows.\n\nFrance put an emphasis on the environment for this year's Olympics in Paris. The Games are supposed to be the \"greenest\" of all-time.\n\nTo keep with those efforts, athletes are sleeping on uncomfortable cardboard beds (which can be fully recycled) without air conditioning. Apartments were designed to keep temperatures between 72 and 79 degrees Fahrenheit through some kind of special water cooling system.\n\nA lot, if not most, places in Europe don't have air conditioning because it's not normally necessary. It doesn't get that hot in the summer. It might not be that big of an issue if these apartments weren't housing the world's greatest athletes during a brutal heatwave, but that's exactly what is happening.\n\nSome delegations told the Olympics to kick rocks over the beds and brought their own. Some countries did the same with the air conditioning and brought individual units for their athletes.\n\nItaly apparently did not.\n\nThomas Ceccon felt like the lack of A/C played a huge role in his 200-meter flop. He is exhausted and he feels like the food -- which has received some complaints -- is also not up to his standard.\n\nI gave up in the semi-final. I am a little tired. You have a hard time sleeping both at night and in the afternoon, between noise and heat.\n\nYes it's hot for me too, in the Village there is no air conditioning, we don't eat well and there are problems with the food. Many athletes move for these reasons.\n\nItaly could've solves this problem by getting its athletes what they need to be best set up for success. Ceccon also understands that his countrymen are dealing with the same conditions, as well as other athletes from other delegations. He doesn't want to make excuses.\n\nI emphasize that this is not meant to be an excuse or an alibi, we are all experiencing the same situations and are in the same conditions. It is one thing many people probably do not know and it is right to tell the story.\n\nMaybe I did not go into the water with the same conviction that I had in the 100, and that was my mistake, it will serve me well in the future.

Somehow we were lucky that it was not so hot outside so we didn't need it so much but it is now hot and you can feel it is too hot in the room.\n\n\"[The fan] is not powerful enough and when it is pointing at you it is good but after it is turning you don't feel it. We are sleeping with the door open in the night.

French swimmer Assia Touati has also complained: \"We had no AC in the bedroom but they installed it anyway because it was getting too hot.\"\n\nOlympic organisers had boasted of Michelin chefs but GB athletes have complained of shortages and insufficient quality of food, prompting them to instead flock to the private British performance lodge which is full of supplies from Aldi and has a team of on-site chefs overseen by the sports nutritionist Wendy Martinson. The lodge, which Team GB regard as a key performance advantage, is only 15 minutes by bus from the village and also has extensive facilities to relax and train.\n\n\"At the beginning of every Games there's usually two or three issues... the big one this time is the food in the village, which is not adequate,\" said Andy Anson, the Team GB chief executive.

Ceccon, who won gold in the men's 100m backstroke, publicly criticized the living conditions, citing a lack of air conditioning, poor food quality, and inadequate supplies as major issues. He expressed that many athletes were relocating for these reasons, emphasizing that it was a widespread problem, not an excuse.\n\n\"There is no air conditioning in the village, it's hot, and the food is bad,\" Ceccon told The Sun. \"Many athletes move for this reason: it's not an alibi or an excuse; it's the reality of what perhaps not everybody knows. Usually, when I'm at home, I always sleep in the afternoon: here I really struggle between the heat and the noise.\"\n\nThe International Olympic Committee faced backlash for the absence of air conditioning and the use of cardboard \"anti-sex\" beds, which were part of their environmental sustainability efforts. Athletes, including Ceccon, complained about the heat, noise, and subpar food, which included insufficient quantities of essential items like eggs and chicken and instances of raw meat being served. The British Olympic Association also reported similar food quality issues.\n\n\"There are not enough certain foods: eggs, chicken, certain carbohydrates,\" British Olympic Association Chief Andy Anson told The Times of London. \"And then there is the food quality, with raw meat being served to athletes.\"\n\nCeccon's sentiments were echoed by other athletes like Coco Gauff, Ariarne Titmus, and Assia Touati, who also found the accommodations unsuitable. After winning the Olympic gold in the 400m freestyle, Titmus mentioned that better living conditions might have enabled her to break the world record. She criticized the village for not being conducive to high performance.\n\n\"It probably wasn't the time I thought I was capable of, but living in the Olympic Village makes it hard to perform,\" she said in an interview after the race. \"It's definitely not made for high performance, so it's about who can really keep it together in the mind.\"\n\nOrganizers defended the accommodations, emphasizing their commitment to sustainability. The recyclable mattresses and cardboard bed frames were chosen to reduce the event's carbon footprint. Before the Games, some delegations, including India, had already expressed concerns about the lack of air conditioning, forcing the Indian government to send 40 portable units for their athletes.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_as_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egg as food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noise pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Olympic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Olympic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Backstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowing_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rowing (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cardboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbohydrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assia_Touati", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assia Touati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon footprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariarne_Titmus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ariarne Titmus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern_Pentathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Modern Pentathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/08/05/1600x900/thomas_ceccon_1722860740264_1722860745286.jfif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789651", "eventUri": "eng-9789651", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Thomas Chaccon claims he \"gave up\" on one of his events due to problems with sleeping at the village. A lack of food, poor sleeping facilities and air conditioning problems have all been blamed.\n\nItaly's Thomas Chaccon has revealed that the strain of life inside the Olympic Village caused him to 'give up' on winning a third medal at the Games. The 23-year-old won gold in the men's 100m backstroke and a bronze in the men's 4 x 100m relay, but had reached his limit by the time the semi-finals for the men's 200m backstroke took place.\n\nExhausted after struggling to get a good quality of sleep while living in the village, Chaccon admitted that he was mentally broken when he entered the pool.\n\nAcross the Olympics as a whole, more than 10,000 athletes will compete in 329 events. Many of these competitors stay in the purpose-built Olympic Village. However, within days of the accomodation opening, there were complaints about it from athletes.\n\nRelated Why Olympic Shooting Medalist Yusuf Dikec Competes With 'No Equipment'\n\nThe 51-year-old become a viral sensation after winning a silver medal in Paris...\n\nDespite boasting what would appear to be an impressive line-up of amenities, the standard of the accomodation has fallen well short of expectations. Issues with the food provided to athletes has been a regular source of complaint, with a number of teams resorting to bringing in their own chefs to cater for their stars.\n\nThe beds at the Olympic Village have also caused plenty of issues. Earlier this week, Australian swimmer Ariarne Titmus blamed conditions in the village for 'costing her a gold medal' and many other competitors share his grievevances, including Chaccon.\n\nIn an interview with Italian media, Chaccon revealed that a number of athletes had been forced to seek alternative accomodation because of the problems, before giving an insight into how poor his own experience had been.\n\nChaccon Claims it was 'Impossible to Sleep' in the Olympic Village Issues with air-conditioning were a major problem\n\n\"In the Village there is no air conditioning, it's hot, the food is bad. Many athletes move because of this ... it is not an alibi it is the pure chronicle of what perhaps not everyone knows,\" he said, per Swim Swam.\n\nLaurent Michaud, the director of Paris 2024, said before the Games that traditional air conditioning would not be necessary \"thanks to the insulation of the buildings we can contain the coolness of the night until the next day and this helps to maintain an acceptable indoor temperature.\" The testimony of Chaccon and others indicates that this has not been the case.\n\n\"I emphasize that this is not meant to be an excuse or an alibi, we are all experiencing the same situations and are in the same conditions. It is one thing many people probably do not know and it is right to tell the story.\"\n\nSpeaking on his performance in the 200m backstroke semi-final, Chaccon stated: \"Maybe I did not go into the water with the same conviction that I had in the 100m, and that was my mistake, it will serve me well in the future. I'm disappointed that I didn't make a finals time, but I was tired too.\n\n\"I gave up in the semi-final ... a little tired you have a hard time sleeping both at night and in the afternoon, between noise and heat.\"\n\nBefore the swimming competition even began on the 27th of July, the South Korean team had left the village. A few days later, more competitors decided to do the same, choosing instead to remain in hotels or even chateaus in the mountains.\n\nThe Olympic Games is supposed to be the pinnacle of sport. While catering for such a large number of individuals is no easy task, that so many elite athletes have come out and complained about the conditions inside the village is damning. Lessons will need to be learned for when Los Angeles hosts the next summer Games in 2028.\n\nRelated Swimmer Blames Olympic Village Conditions for Missing out on Gold\n\nAriarne Titmus has been criticised by her own coach for her negative comments about the village...", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_at_the_2010_Commonwealth_Games_\u2013_Men's_200_metre_backstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming at the 2010 Commonwealth Games \u2013 Men's 200 metre backstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_\u00d7_100_metres_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4 \u00d7 100 metres relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Backstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusuf_Dike\u00e7", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yusuf Dike\u00e7"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shooting sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariarne_Titmus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ariarne Titmus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/thomas-ceccon-on-the-olympic-village.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789651", "eventUri": "eng-9789651", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-27", "textStart": 3426, "textEnd": 3438}], "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

On Saturday morning, he swam 53.56 on the leadoff leg of the Italian men's 400 medley relay that placed 9th in prelims and didn't advanced, which ended his Olympic competition. He swam 52.00 to win the individual 100 back earlier in the meet.\n\nCeccon also won a bronze medal early in the meet by splitting 47.44 on the 2nd leg of Italy's men's 400 free relay.\n\nTemperatures in Paris have cooled considerably in the last few days.

If the beds didn't break under the strain of two athletes, they certainly failed the test of comfort for one.\n\nSo, in a move as old as humanity itself, Ceccon took to the ground.

There's been headache after headache for Paris Games officials through the first week of competition - and two of the biggest talking points have been the athletes' village and River Seine.\n\nThe cardboard beds have been a huge point of contention for the athletes in Paris, with many complaining they're too hard and not conducive to a good night's sleep. The beds are designed to be environmentally friendly and can be re-used after the Games, but the athletes hate them.\n\nOne such athlete is Italian swimming champion Thomas Ceccon, who won gold in the 100m backstroke. Ceccon had previously aired his complaints about the beds and overall conditions in the village, but the situation took a staggering turn on Sunday night.\n\nThe Italian was snapped by another athlete sleeping outside in a park on nothing more than a towel. Ceccon had clearly grown fed-up with the situation and decided he'd be better off out in the elements. The 23-year-old had previously complained about the conditions in the village after failing to make the 200m breaststroke final.\n\n\"There is no air-conditioning in the village. It's hot, the food is bad,\" Ceccon had told The Sun. \"Many athletes move for this reason. It's not an alibi or an excuse, it's the reality of what perhaps not everybody knows. I'm disappointed that I didn't make the final, but I was too tired. It's hard to sleep both at night and in the afternoon. Here, I really struggle between the heat and the noise.\"\n\nAussie superstar Ariarne Titmus had also aired her complaints about the village, suggesting it might have cost her a world record in the 400m freestyle. Titmus won the gold, but her time was noticeably slow.\n\nMeanwhile, the water quality in the River Seine is also back in the spotlight after a number of athletes came down ill. The mixed relay is due to take place on Monday morning, but could be pushed back after heavy rain on Wednesday and Thursday again caused levels of bacteria in the water to rise.\n\nBut the Belgian team won't be taking part, even if the pollution levels subside. Claire Michel, who finished 38th in the women's triathlon on Wednesday, has fallen ill after swimming in the Seine and won't be able to compete.\n\nThe Belgian Olympic and Interfederal Committee said in a statement that Michel \"is unfortunately ill and will have to withdraw from the competition.\" The statement did not elaborate on Michel's illness, but Belgian media have reported it is due to E. coli.\n\nConcerns have been raised over the iconic river's water quality, but officials deemed it safe for the men's and women's triathlons last week. Organisers had said bacteria levels in the river were at a level that was considered safe for the athletes. But Swiss triathlete Adrien Briffod has also fallen ill following the men's race.\n\nThe Belgian committee said it \"hopes that lessons will be learned for future triathlon competitions at the Olympic Games\", adding: \"We are thinking here of the guarantee of training days, competition days and the competition format, which must be clarified in advance and ensure that there is no uncertainty for the athletes, entourage and supporters.\"\n\nRELATED:\n\nThe men's race was postponed from Tuesday to Wednesday last week - the same day as the women's competition. Athletes were unable to swim in the river until the day of the race after organisers were forced to cancel training sessions.\n\nSpeaking at Sunday morning's IOC briefing, Paris 2024 director of communications Anne Descamps added: \"We are expecting improvement regarding the weather forecast.

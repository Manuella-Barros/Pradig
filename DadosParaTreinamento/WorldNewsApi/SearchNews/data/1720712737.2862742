{"id": 232084588, "title": "'Bad Boys: Ride or Die' boosts Will Smith's comeback and the box office with $56 million opening", "text": "\u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die,\u201d the fourth installment in the Will Smith-Martin Lawrence action comedy series, opened with an estimated $56 million in theaters over the weekend, handing Hollywood a much-needed summer hit and Smith his biggest success since he slapped Chris Rock at the Academy Awards. Expectations were all over the map for \u201cRide or Die\u201d given the dismal moviegoing market thus far this summer and Smith\u2019s less certain box-office clout. In the end, though, the Sony Pictures release came in very close to, or slightly above, its tracking forecast. \u201cRide or Die,\u201d produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, is Smith\u2019s first theatrical test since his 2022 slap of Rock earned him a 10-year Oscar ban. The \u201cBad Boys\u201d film was in development at the time and was momentarily put on hold, but ultimately went forward with about a $100 million production budget. Smith starred in the Apple release \u201cEmancipation,\u201d but that film \u2014 released in late 2022 \u2014 was shot before the slap and received only a modest theatrical release before streaming. This time around, Smith largely avoided soul-searching interviews looking back on the Oscars and instead went on a whistle-stop publicity tour of red carpets from Mexico to Saudi Arabia, where he attended what was billed as the country's first Hollywood premiere. The 55-year-old Smith, who for years was one of Hollywood's most bankable stars, appeared on \u201cThe Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon,\" the YouTube series \u201cHot Ones\" and on Friday, made a surprise appearance at a Los Angeles movie theater. Given that \u201cBad Boys\u201d trailed May disappointments like \u201cFuriosa: A Mad Max Saga\u201d and \u201cThe Fall Guy\u201d \u2013 both of which struggled to pop with ticket buyers despite very good reviews \u2013 the \u201cRide or Die\u201d opening counts as a critical weekend win for the movie business. \u201cThe fact that a movie overperformed is the best possible news,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cIt seems like all we\u2019ve been doing over the past few weeks and almost since the beginning of the year, with a couple of exceptions, is try to figure out why seemingly well-marketed, well-reviewed movies have underperformed. This ignites the spark that the industry has been waiting for.\u201d \u201cRide or Die\u201d still didn\u2019t quite manage to match the opening of the previous \u201cBad Boys\u201d film: 2020\u2019s \u201cBad Boys for Life.\u201d That movie, released in January 2020, debuted with $62.5 million. After the pandemic shut down theaters, it was the highest grossing North American release of that year, with $204 million domestically. \u201cRide or Die\u201d added $48.6 million internationally. Though reviews were mixed (64% on Rotten Tomatoes), audiences gave the film a high grade with an \u201cA-\u201d CinemaScore. Black moviegoers accounted for 44% of ticket buyers, the largest demographic. In the film, which comes 29 years after the original, Smith and Lawrence reprise their roles as Miami detectives. The plot revolves around uncovering a scheme to frame their late police captain (Joe Pantoliano). In one of the movie's most notable scenes, Lawrence slaps Smith and calls him a \u201cbad boy.\u201d Movie theaters will need a lot more than \u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die,\u201d though, to right the ship. Ticket sales are down 26% from last year and more than 40% below pre-pandemic totals, according to Comscore. A big test comes next weekend with the release of Pixar\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2.\u201d After sending several Pixar releases straight to Disney+, the studio has vowed a lengthy, traditional theatrical rollout this time. Last weekend\u2019s top film \u201cThe Garfield Movie,\u201d slid to second place. Also from Sony, the family animated comedy collected $10 million in ticket sales over its third weekend, bringing its domestic gross to $68.6 million. The weekend's other new wide release, \u201cThe Watchers,\" failed to click with moviegoers. The horror film, directed by Ishana Night Shyamalan, daughter of M. Night Shyamalan, is about a stranded 28-year-old artist in Ireland. Following poor reviews, the Warner Bros. release grossed $7 million in 3,351 theaters. That allowed \u201cIf,\u201d the Ryan Reynolds imaginary friend fantasy, to grab third place in its fourth weekend of release, bringing the Paramount Pictures cumulative domestic total to $93.5 million. Rounding out the top five was \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes,\u201d which added $5.4 million in its fifth weekend of release. It has grossed $150 million domestically and $360 million worldwide.", "summary": "\u201cBad Boys: Ride or Die\u201d opened with an estimated $56 million in theater sales over the weekend", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/will-smith-ap-new-york-chris-rock-hollywood-b2559483.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/09/17/Film_Review_-_Bad_Boys__Ride_or_Die_75136.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:54:50", "author": "Jake Coyle", "authors": ["Jake Coyle"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.045}

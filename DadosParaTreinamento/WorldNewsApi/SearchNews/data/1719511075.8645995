DAILY POST gathered that the incident happened last Wednesday at Evbomore community in Ovia North-East Local Government Area of the State during a disagreement, which led to a physical attack. In the course of the physical attack, the suspect was alleged to have run into the kitchen, took a pestle and smashed his 74- year-old father's head in the sitting room. His stepmother, who was said to have rushed to the scene to see what happened after hearing her husband scream, was also hit. The pair were said to have died instantly. He was said to have dragged their corpses to the back of the house where he dumped them near a soak away. A source in the community, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the suspect used weed to cover the bodies, cleaned up the blood stains and relaxed in the house. The source further said the suspect collected his late father's mobile phone and sold it for N25,000 at the kings square in Benin City. He added that when other children of the deceased returned home, they started looking for their parents, unknown to them that their brother had killed them. He said the suspect also joined the other children in search of their parents. The source explained that when the children did not see their parents, they reported a case of missing persons to the Ugbowo Division of the Nigeria Police Force. He added that upon investigations, the bodies of the deceased were recovered in the house while the boy told them how he killed them. The suspect, who could not give any genuine reason for the killing, was subsequently arrested on the spot. When contacted, Edo State Police Public Relations Officer, Chidi Nwabuzor, who confirmed the incident, said the suspect is going through interrogation to ascertain why he committed the crime. Nwabuzor said the suspect has been transferred to the Homicide Department of the command for discrete investigation. He said the corpses have been deposited in the mortuary for autopsy and other investigations.", "summary": "<img width=\"1432\" height=\"1312\" src=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/edo-state-map.png\" class=\"webfeedsFeaturedVisual wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 5px;max-width: 100%;\" link_thumbnail=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/edo-state-map.png 1432w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/edo-state-map-300x275.png 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/edo-state-map-1024x938.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1432px) 100vw, 1432px\" /><p>The Edo State Police Command has arrested a 32-year-old man, Etinosa Aiguokun, who allegedly killed his 74-year-old father, simply identified as Pa Aiguokun, and his wife, Mrs Roseline, with a pestle.

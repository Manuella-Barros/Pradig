With the drop on the day, the major averages have more than offset the modest gains posted in the previous session.\n\nCurrently, the major averages remain firmly in negative territory. The Dow is down 121.90 points or 0.6 percent at 21,902.97, the Nasdaq is down 51.29 points or 0.8 percent at 6,293.82 and the S&P 500 is down 15.68 points or 0.6 percent at 2,452.43.\n\nThe weakness on Wall Street comes amid concerns about political turmoil in Washington, D.C. as President Donald Trump faces backlash for his handling of white nationalist violence over the weekend.\n\nTrump disbanded two corporate advisory councils after facing criticism from executives over his comments seeming to draw an equivalency between the actions of neo-Nazis and counter-protesters.\n\nA negative reaction to the latest earnings news is also weighing on the markets, with Wal-Mart (WMT) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) moving notably lower after reporting their quarterly results.\n\nThe drop by Wal-Mart comes even though the retail giant reported second quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Cisco reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings that matched estimates.\n\nOn the U.S. economic front, the Labor Department released a report showing a bigger than expected drop in initial jobless claims in the week ended August 12th.\n\nThe report said initial jobless claims dropped to 232,000, a decrease of 12,000 from the previous week's unrevised level of 244,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to edge down to 240,000.\n\nA separate report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed a modest slowdown in the pace of growth in regional manufacturing activity in the month of August.\n\nThe Philly Fed Index edged down to 18.9 in August from 19.5 in July, although a positive reading still indicates growth in regional manufacturing activity. The index has been expected to dip to 18.5.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve released a report showing industrial production rose by slightly less than expected in the month of July.\n\nThe report said industrial production edged up by 0.2 percent in July after climbing by 0.4 percent in June. Economists had expected production to rise by 0.3 percent.\n\nSector News\n\nElectronic storage stocks continue to see considerable weakness in mid-day trading, with the NYSE Arca Disk Drive Index down by 1.5 percent.\n\nNetApp (NTAP) is leading the storage sector lower after reporting fiscal first quarter earnings that beat estimates but providing disappointing guidance.\n\nSignificant weakness is also visible among telecom stocks, as reflected by the 1.3 percent drop by the NYSE Arca Telecom Index. CenturyLink (CTL), Frontier Communications (FTR), and Level 3 (LVLT) are posting standout losses.\n\nSemiconductor, railroad, and brokerage stocks have also shown notable moves to the downside on the day, moving lower along with most of the other major sectors.\n\nOther Markets\n\nIn overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index dipped by 0.1 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index climbed by 0.7 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, the major European markets all moved to the downside on the day. While the German DAX Index fell by 0.5 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the French CAC 40 Index both slid by 0.6 percent.\n\nIn the bond market, treasuries have moved modestly higher over the course of the session. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by 1.1 basis points at 2.215 percent.\n\nby RTT Staff Writer\n\nFor comments and feedback:

Economists had expected production to rise by 0.3 percent.\n\nSector News\n\nElectronic storage stocks continue to see considerable weakness in mid-day trading, with the NYSE Arca Disk Drive Index down by 1.5 percent.\n\nNetApp (NTAP) is leading the storage sector lower after reporting fiscal first quarter earnings that beat estimates but providing disappointing guidance.\n\nSignificant weakness is also visible among telecom stocks, as reflected by the 1.3 percent drop by the NYSE Arca Telecom Index. CenturyLink (CTL), Frontier Communications (FTR), and Level 3 (LVLT) are posting standout losses.\n\nSemiconductor, railroad, and brokerage stocks have also shown notable moves to the downside on the day, moving lower along with most of the other major sectors.\n\nOther Markets\n\nIn overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index dipped by 0.1 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index climbed by 0.7 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, the major European markets all moved to the downside on the day. While the German DAX Index fell by 0.5 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the French CAC 40 Index both slid by 0.6 percent.\n\nIn the bond market, treasuries have moved modestly higher over the course of the session. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is down by 1.1 basis points at 2.215 percent.\n\nFor comments and feedback: contact

With the sell-off on the day, the S&P 500 dropped to its lowest closing level in over a month.\n\nThe major averages ended the session at their worst levels of the day. The Dow tumbled 274.14 points or 1.2 percent to 21,750.73, the Nasdaq plummeted 123.19 points or 1.9 percent to 6,211.91 and the S&P 500 slumped 38.10 points 1.5 percent to 2,430.01.\n\nThe broad based weakness on Wall Street reflected concerns about ongoing political turmoil in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe backlash to President Donald Trump's response to last weekend's violent events in Charlottesville, Virginia, has led to worries about the president's pro-business agenda.\n\nReports that Gary Cohn is considering resigning as Trump's top economic advisor weighed on Wall Street, although the White House has denied the claims.\n\nCohn, former president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs (GS), currently serves as the Director of the National Economic Council.\n\n\"Nothing has changed,\" a White House official said. \"Gary is focused on his responsibilities as NEC Director and any reports to the contrary are 100% false.\"\n\nCohn was reportedly \"upset\" and \"disgusted\" with Trump's remarks indicating blame for the clashes between white supremacists and counter-protesters should be shared by both sides.\n\nTraders also reacted negatively to the latest batch of earnings news, with Wal-Mart (WMT) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) moving lower after reporting their quarterly results.\n\nOn the U.S. economic front, the Labor Department released a report showing a bigger than expected drop in initial jobless claims in the week ended August 12th.\n\nThe report said initial jobless claims dropped to 232,000, a decrease of 12,000 from the previous week's unrevised level of 244,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to edge down to 240,000.\n\nA separate report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed a modest slowdown in the pace of growth in regional manufacturing activity in the month of August.\n\nThe Philly Fed Index edged down to 18.9 in August from 19.5 in July, although a positive reading still indicates growth in regional manufacturing activity. The index has been expected to dip to 18.5.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve released a report showing industrial production rose by slightly less than expected in the month of July.\n\nThe report said industrial production edged up by 0.2 percent in July after climbing by 0.4 percent in June. Economists had expected production to rise by 0.3 percent.\n\nSector News\n\nAirline stocks showed a substantial move to the downside on the day, dragging the NYSE Arca Airline Index down by 3.2 percent. With the steep drop, the index fell to a five-month closing low.\n\nThe sell-off by airline stocks may reflect concerns about the impact a terrorist attack in Barcelona that killed at least 12 people will have on air travel.\n\nConsiderable weakness was also visible among computer hardware, as reflected by the 2.8 percent slump by the NYSE Arca Computer Hardware Index. NetApp (NTAP) led the sector lower after providing disappointing guidance.\n\nSemiconductor, steel, railroad, and telecom stocks also showed significant moves to the downside on the day, reflecting broad based weakness on Wall Street.\n\nOther Markets\n\nIn overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index edged down by 0.1 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index climbed by 0.7 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, the major European markets all moved to the downside on the day. While the German DAX Index fell by 0.5 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the French CAC 40 Index both slid by 0.6 percent.\n\nIn the bond market, treasuries moved higher over the course of the session after seeing early weakness. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, fell by 2.7 basis points to 2.199 percent.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nTrading on Friday may be impacted by reaction to the University of Michigan's preliminary report on consumer sentiment in the month of August. The consumer sentiment index is expected to inch up to 94.0 in August from 93.4 in July.\n\nOn the earnings front, Gap (GPS), Applied Materials (AMAT) and Ross Stores (ROST) are among the companies releasing their quarterly results after the close of today's trading.\n\nDeere (DE), Estee Lauder (EL) and Foot Locker (FL) are also due to release their results before the start of trading on Friday.\n\nby RTT Staff Writer\n\nFor comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com\n\nBusiness News\n\nFlights of Fancy: Flops Among The 10 Most Expensive Fims Of All Time\n\nRace For A New Alzheimer

The Dow tumbled 274.14 points or 1.2 percent to 21,750.73, the Nasdaq plummeted 123.19 points or 1.9 percent to 6,211.91 and the S&P 500 slumped 38.10 points 1.5 percent to 2,430.01.\n\nThe broad based weakness on Wall Street reflected concerns about ongoing political turmoil in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe backlash to Trump's response to last weekend's violent events in Charlottesville, Virginia, has led to worries about the president's pro-business agenda.\n\nReports that Gary Cohn is considering resigning as Trump's top economic advisor weighed on Wall Street, although the White House has denied the claims.\n\nCohn, former president and chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs (GS), currently serves as the Director of the National Economic Council.\n\n\"Nothing has changed,\" a White House official said. \"Gary is focused on his responsibilities as NEC Director and any reports to the contrary are 100% false.\"\n\nCohn was reportedly \"upset\" and \"disgusted\" with Trump's remarks indicating blame for the clashes between white supremacists and counter-protesters should be shared by both sides.\n\nTraders also reacted negatively to the latest batch of earnings news, with Wal-Mart (WMT) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) moving lower after reporting their quarterly results.\n\nOn the U.S. economic front, the Labor Department released a report showing a bigger than expected drop in initial jobless claims in the week ended August 12th.\n\nThe report said initial jobless claims dropped to 232,000, a decrease of 12,000 from the previous week's unrevised level of 244,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to edge down to 240,000.\n\nA separate report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed a modest slowdown in the pace of growth in regional manufacturing activity in the month of August.\n\nThe Philly Fed Index edged down to 18.9 in August from 19.5 in July, although a positive reading still indicates growth in regional manufacturing activity. The index has been expected to dip to 18.5.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve released a report showing industrial production rose by slightly less than expected in the month of July.\n\nThe report said industrial production edged up by 0.2 percent in July after climbing by 0.4 percent in June. Economists had expected production to rise by 0.3 percent.\n\nAirline stocks showed a substantial move to the downside on the day, dragging the NYSE Arca Airline Index down by 3.2 percent. With the steep drop, the index fell to a five-month closing low.\n\nConsiderable weakness was also visible among computer hardware, as reflected by the 2.8 percent slump by the NYSE Arca Computer Hardware Index. NetApp (NTAP) led the sector lower after providing disappointing guidance.\n\nSemiconductor, steel, railroad, and telecom stocks also showed significant moves to the downside on the day, reflecting broad based weakness on Wall Street.\n\nCommodity, Currency Markets\n\nCrude oil futures are up $0.23 at $47.32 a barrel after rising $0.31 to $47.09 a barrel on Thursday. Meanwhile, after jumping $9.50 to $1,292.40 an ounce in the previous session, gold futures are climbing $9.10 to $1,301.50 an ounce.\n\nOn the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 109.03 yen compared to the 109.57 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1741 compared to yesterday's $1.1723.\n\nAsia\n\nAsian stocks joined a global slide on Friday as the ongoing political turmoil in Washington put President Donald Trump's stimulus and tax plans in jeopardy and a deadly attack in Spain that killed at least 13 people and injured more than 100 others left the world shocked.\n\nInvestors also adopted a cautious stance ahead of controversial joint military exercises by South Korea and the U.S., scheduled to start next week.\n\nJapanese shares hit 3-1/2-month lows as the yen strengthened amid U.S. political worries, the deadly terror attack in Spain and renewed concerns about U.S.-North Korea tensions.\n\nThe Nikkei 225 Index tumbled 232.22 points or 1.2 percent to 19,470.41, its lowest level since May 2nd. The broader Topix Index closed 1.1 percent lower at 1,597.36.\n\nExporters and financials underperformed, with Sony, Panasonic, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and T&D Holdings declining 2-3 percent.\n\nAustralian shares fell notably, led by banks on concerns over Trump's stalled legislative agenda and a move by the government to strengthen its money laundering laws.\n\nThe benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index dropped 32.10 points or 0.6 percent to 5,747.10 but ended the week up by 0.9 percent. The broader All Ordinaries Index ended down 28.70 points or 0.5 percent at 5,798.50.\n\nThe big four banks fell between 0.6 percent and 1.6 percent. Miners also succumbed to selling pressure, with Forescue Metals Group and BHP Billiton losing 1-2 percent, as base metal prices edged down from multi-year highs.\n\nPrimary Health Care rallied 2.8 percent despite the company reporting a full-year loss, reflecting impairment charges related to its medical centers business.\n\nChinese shares closed on a steady note amid optimism over earnings and improving growth. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index finished marginally higher at 3,268.72, although Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slumped 296.65 points or 1.1 percent to 27,047.57.\n\nEurope\n\nEuropean stocks have come under pressure on Friday after a deadly terrorist attack in Barcelona, Spain, left the world shocked.\n\nA van mowed down pedestrians in the heart of Spain's second-largest city on Thursday, killing at least 13 people in an attack claimed by Islamic State. More than 100 others were reportedly injured, many so severely that the death toll could rise.\n\nWhile the German DAX Index has fallen by 0.3 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is down by 0.9 percent and the French CAC 40 Index is down by 1 percent.\n\nBanks are broadly lower, while travel and leisure stocks have also been hit hard amid concerns about the impact of the latest terrorist attack in Europe.\n\nMeanwhile, Shanta Gold shares have rallied in London. The company narrowed its first-half loss and said it would not acquire Helio as previously announced.\n\nOn a light day on the economic front, ECB data showed that the euro area current account surplus declined to the lowest in nearly three years in June. The current account surplus fell to 21.2 billion euros in June from 30.5 billion euros in May.\n\nSeparately, Eurostat reported that Eurozone construction output decreased for the second straight month in June. Construction output declined 0.5 percent in June, bigger than the 0.2 percent decrease seen in May.\n\nU.S. Economic Reports\n\nThe University of Michigan is scheduled to release its preliminary report on consumer sentiment in the month of August at 10 am ET. The consumer sentiment index is expected to inch up to 94.0 in August from 93.4 in July.\n\nAt 10:15 am ET, Dallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan is due to participate in a moderated Q&A session at the Dallas County Community College District Conference Day.\n\nStocks In Focus\n\nShares of Ross Stores (ROST) are moving sharply higher in pre-market trading after the discounter retailer reported second quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines.\n\nSemiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT) may also move to the upside after reporting better than expected fiscal third quarter results and providing upbeat guidance for the current quarter.\n\nShares of Gap (GPS) are also seeing pre-market strength after the apparel reported second quarter results that beat estimates and raised its full-year forecast.\n\nOn the other hand, shares of Foot Locker (FL) are likely to come under pressure after the athletic footwear and apparel retailer reported weaker than expected second quarter results.\n\nHibbett Sports (HIBB) is also seeing notable pre-market weakness after reporting a narrower than expected second quarter loss but lowering its full-year guidance.\n\nShares of Deere (DE) may also move to the downside after the farm equipment maker reported fiscal third quarter earnings that beat estimates but on weaker than expected sales.\n\nby RTT Staff Writer\n\nFor comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com\n\nFlights of Fancy: Flops Among The 10 Most Expensive Fims Of All Time\n\nRace For A New Alzheimer

The major averages have all moved to the upside, with the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 climbing further off the one-month lows set last Thursday\n\nThe Dow climbed 135.39 points or 0.6% to 21,993.71, the Nasdaq jumped 83.68 points or 1.3% to 6,340.23 and the S&P 500 surged up 24.52 points or 1% to 2,465.84.\n\nThe strength on Wall Street was partly due to bargain hunting, as traders continued to pick up stocks at relatively reduced levels.\n\nTrading activity was somewhat subdued, however, with a lack of major US economic data keeping some traders on the sidelines.\n\nSemiconductor stocks showed a significant move to the upside, driving the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up by 2.6%. Nvidia (NVDA) and Micron (MU) posted standout gains.\n\nFinancial, computer hardware and transportation stocks also showed strong moves to the upside, moving higher along with most of the other major sectors.\n\nIn overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index slumped by 1%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped by 1.4%.\n\nMeanwhile, the major European markets all moved to the upside on the day. While the UK's FTSE 100 Index advanced by 0.7%, the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index both jumped 1.4%.\n\nIn the bond market, treasuries gave back ground after trending higher in recent sessions. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, climbed 3 basis points to 2.219%.", "id": "9187370", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "Stocks Show Strong Move To The Upside - US Commentary", "image": "http://cdn1.iii.co.uk.s3.amazonaws.com/pics/ii-Twitter-profile-photo.png", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 1, "id": "74", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "label": {"eng": "France"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "113", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "65590", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "196013", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "NASDAQ"}, "id": "303007", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bond market"}, "id": "303058", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_market"}, {"label": {"eng": "Stock market"}, "id": "303101", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trade"}, "id": "303410", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}, "id": "304201", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average"}, {"label": {"eng": "CAC 40"}, "id": "304662", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAC_40"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nikkei 225"}, "id": "304663", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikkei_225"}, {"label": {"eng": "FTSE 100 Index"}, "id": "304664", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100_Index"}, {"label": {"eng": "DAX"}, "id": "304666", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAX"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}, "id": "307968", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street"}, {"label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "id": "309819", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific"}, {"label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}, "id": "310675", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Computer hardware"}, "id": "312008", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware"}, {"label": {"eng": "Economic data"}, "id": "313321", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_data"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}, "id": "322941", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hang Seng Index"}, "id": "336044", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_Seng_Index"}, {"label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}, "id": "1210925", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 21, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 22, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 91, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 153, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 479, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 644, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Moving Services", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Moving_Services"}], "time": "20:20:00"}

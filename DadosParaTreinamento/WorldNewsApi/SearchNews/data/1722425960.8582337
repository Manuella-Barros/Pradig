Chris Wiggs thought up the tiny portable house in 1983 - with its own little doll - before rushing home to create a version for his daughter in his basement workshop, using a repurposed makeup compact. It became a licensed product of Bluebird Toys, based in Swindon, in 1989, and from there its popularity exploded - dazzling children with their eclectic styles and portability. By 1994 an estimated three quarters of British girls owned a Polly Pocket, with the company selling more than \u00a3100million worth of the pocket-sized product. And when it was sold to Barbie-producer Mattel in 1998, the doll soon increased in size - alongside the launch of new removable clothing styles. Mr Wiggs died peacefully at his home in France surrounded by his family, the New York Post reports, shortly after he was diagnosed with a rare form of neurological cancer. He is survived by his wife Carolyn, his daughter Kate, his son Ben and his five grandchildren. The Polly Pocket dolls became a childhood staple for 90s children with their portability and eclectic styles after their first release in 1989. The dolls were priced at around \u00a310 during their original release, but prices have escalated thanks to a hunger for vintage toys still in their packaging. While vintage editions of the toys do have extortionate asking prices it is later models that are fetching the highest prices on eBay. Mattel redesigned Polly Pocket in the late 1990s the doll became two to three inches tall and was made of plastic. Users could dress her up in rubber clothing and accessories, giving her a more lifelike appearance, and it is these sets that are priced highest with an unopened 2002 Swim Party listed at \u00a31,115.63. Nearly three decades after they were first released, nostalgia-stuck adults proved their popularity as they saw have again seen demand shoot through the roof. Sets of the popular Polly Pocket toys are now selling for thousands of pounds on eBay as enthusiasts strive to complete their collections. Mattel relaunched the dolls in 2018 in both their mini and larger versions - alongside an animated series. They also created the Keepsake Collection, releasing re-creations and new compacts. And now it appears the 90s doll could get its own film - just like the Barbie movie. Lena Dunham is set to direct with Lily Collins playing Polly, the New York Post reports.", "summary": "Chris Wiggs thought up the tiny portable house in 1983 - with its own little doll - before rushing home to create a version for his daughter in his basement workshop.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13581661/British-inventor-created-hit-90s-toy-Polly-Pocket-dies-aged-74-battle-rare-cancer.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/28/22/86714537-0-image-m-13_1719608865354.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:57:24", "author": "Editor,Iwan Stone", "authors": ["Editor", "Iwan Stone"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.436}

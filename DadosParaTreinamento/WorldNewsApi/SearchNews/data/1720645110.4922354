China's foreign ministry said on Friday it will allow the Philippines to deliver supplies and evacuate personnel if Manila notifies Beijing in advance.Ano described such suggestions as \"absurd, nonsense and unacceptable\".He added: \"We do not and will never need China's approval for any of our activities therein.\"But the Philippines remains open to dialogue and peaceful negotiations to resolve disputes in the entire South China Sea, the council said. The Philippine coastguard on Friday accused its Chinese counterpart of blocking efforts to evacuate a sick member of its armed forces in the South China Sea.Also Read: | Swedish defense chief says actions against Philippines in South China Sea threaten global securityIt was the latest dispute in a longstanding territorial spat with China, which claims almost all of the South China Sea, a conduit for more than $3 trillion in annual ship commerce.In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague said China's claims had no legal basis, a decision Beijing has rejected.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/world/philippines-security-independence-south-china-sea-tension-9380469/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Untitled-design-2024-06-08T220527.757.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:38:55", "author": "Reuters", "authors": ["Reuters"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.051}

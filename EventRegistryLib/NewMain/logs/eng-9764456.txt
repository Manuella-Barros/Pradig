That final approval may come on July 30 when the team asks for more than $300 million in tax money for the project.\n\nThe commission vote comes after the City of St. Petersburg gave its part of the stadium deal a green light by a 5-3 vote of the city council.\n\nAfter historic vote, Rays owner promises \"greatest ballpark baseball has ever seen\"\n\nIf the Pinellas Commission approves the deal, it will be the end of a lengthy journey for the Rays that has included plans for a stadium in Tampa, Ybor City, or even splitting the team's home games with Montreal.\n\nOnce approved, the multi-billion dollar stadium plan will also include a complete redevelopment of the Historic Gas Plant District. The deal is also expected to keep the Rays in St. Petersburg for the next three decades.\n\nThe new stadium will replace the aging Tropicana Field. The stadium, which also had the names Florida Suncoast Dome and the ThunderDome, has been near the bottom of the list in every stadium ranking released in the last several years.\n\nJust for comparison, Tropicana Field cost approximately $130 million in 1986 to build, which would be approximately $372 million in today's dollars. The new stadium deal will have a projected total cost of approximately $1.3 billion, but that also includes the redevelopment of the Gas Plant District.\n\nThe Florida Department of Juvenile Justice removed TrueCore from a five-year, $31.5 million contract after a girl died at Lake Academy.

PETERSBURG, Fla. - After St. Pete city council's historic vote that approved the Tampa Bay Rays' stadium deal last week, Pinellas County commissioners now have to give their blessing to spend more than $3 million on the project.\n\nCommissioners held their first meeting on Thursday, and the hope is to approve it next week. However, some of the Pinellas commissioners are raising concerns.\n\n\"They have, what, three or four or five of those full-day meetings,\" Pinellas Commissioner Dave Eggers said of St. Pete City councilors. \"We had, what, a three-hour meeting today?\"\n\nRELATED: St. Pete City Council approves proposed Rays stadium in historic vote, ending decades-long saga\n\nThursday's commission session was a workshop designed to iron out any last-minute questions before voting on Tuesday.\n\nEggers had two questions: Could infrastructure money committed by the county's CRA be used by the Rays to pay off the team's own debt? And would the county's other commitments be jeopardized by spending $312.5 million of tourist taxes on the stadium?\n\n\"Where does that leave us in the event of something that's not normal from the beach renourishment perspective?\" he asked.\n\nPREVIOUS: Tampa Bay Rays offer glimpse into proposed ballpark with newly updated renderings\n\nThe St. Pete City Council approved a $700 million package last week, including $287.5 million of city bonds, the debt on those bonds and a land transfer.\n\nSt. Pete Mayor Ken Welch reiterated to Pinellas commissioners that the project, including billions of dollars of development around the stadium, creates 37,000 jobs, affordable housing and office space. He also said it would boost county bed tax receipts.\n\n\"We're shooting for a unanimous vote, because this makes so much sense for our county and our city moving forward in terms of economic benefit, in terms of keeping the Rays here.\"\n\nREAD: New mixed use development planned at site of St. Pete YMCA\n\nIf county commissioners ask for changes to be made to the agreements over the CRA, the city council could be asked to vote again on that part of the 12-part agreement.\n\nThe county administrator's office said they do not believe that funding the stadium will impact other line items like beach renourishment.\n\nSt. Pete city officials are hoping for a vote on Tuesday.\n\nMORE: Rays announce plans for new $1.3 billion stadium in St. Petersburg: 'Our Rays are here to stay'\n\n\"Let's not rush this deal,\" said Eggers. \"On the other hand, if we come together on Tuesday and have the questions answered that we have asked, and have the opportunity to have further dialog. Yeah, we would probably have a vote on Tuesday.\"\n\nAnother question commissioners have echoes what some opponents on city council have wondered about, and that is the valuation of the land and why it was sold below its supposed market value.\n\nCity leaders said the opponents were unfairly comparing values between different uses for the land, i.e. a stadium versus mixed-use residential.\n\nThe mayor, who is a former member of the county commission, said he appreciates how diligently they're examining every aspect of the biggest deal in county history.", "source": {"uri": "fox13news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 13 Tampa Bay"}, "authors": [{"uri": "evan_axelbank@fox13news.com", "name": "Evan Axelbank", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinellas_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinellas County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinellas County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Eggers", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dave Eggers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballpark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ken Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Affordable housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_nourishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beach nourishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YMCA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YMCA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-use_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mixed-use development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Construction_and_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Construction and Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox13news.com/www.fox13news.com/content/uploads/2024/07/1280/720/RAYS-STADIUM-DEAL-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764456", "eventUri": "eng-9764456", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Now, the Rays need at least four yes votes from seven county commissioners to have shovels in the ground early next year and a stadium ready for Opening Day 2028.\n\nThe county commission has a simpler decision that will be put to a vote Tuesday: whether to commit $312.5 million from its tourist tax chest toward a $1.37 billion stadium. Yet commissioners, who have been less publicly critical than City Council members, asked tough questions of city and county officials at a two-and-a-half hour workshop Thursday. Two skeptics emerged, one as a potential no vote.\n\nCommissioner Dave Eggers expressed frustration at not having enough opportunities to publicly discuss the details of the deal over the past few years. He said that if he felt rushed going into the vote Tuesday, \"I'm a no.\"\n\n\"This is our time to make sure that we're clear on what the ramifications of the stadium deal are and how they're interacting with the development,\" he said.\n\nEggers questioned the city's sale of public land to the Rays and Hines below appraised value and if the county had enough in the coffers to pay for beach renourishment, the county's top priority, after future hurricanes.\n\nHe also shared concerns raised by commissioner Chris Latvala, who wanted to know about Rays owner Stu Sternberg's ability to have a done stadium and redevelopment deal only to turn around and sell the team, the development rights or both. The city and county's negotiating consultant, David Abrams from Inner Circle Sports, said Sternberg would have the ability to do that but it would be unlikely, because there would be more economic benefit in staying in the real estate development and \"controlling your front door\" rather than selling it to other entities.\n\nLatvala also asked how much the Rays' value would increase once the stadium and redevelopment deal passes. Abrams said he didn't know, but said he thought it would go up. Latvala also brought up how the Rays and Hines' commitment to building affordable housing is contingent on receiving future funding from the city, county, state and federal level -- a concern raised by City Council member Richie Floyd.\n\nCounty administrator Barry Burton said he would follow up with commissioners individually with answers to their concerns. He stressed the economic impact the project could have on the county: $443 million in total economic output and 15,000 jobs, including construction jobs that pay livable wages.\n\n\"Whether you're in Palm Harbor or in St. Pete or Pinellas Park, that has an economic benefit throughout the entire region and throughout Pinellas County,\" Burton said.\n\nSt. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch, who spent five terms on the county commission, spoke at the meeting. He and his top officials who negotiated the deal gave a presentation and answered commissioners' questions. Representatives from the Rays, including president Matt Silverman, were present but did not speak publicly.\n\n\"I had the pleasure of working with many of these commissioners. I know their due diligence and their way of work,\" Welch said after the meeting. \"I totally expected that type of question from Commissioner Eggers and others. They want to get all the facts and understand the entire picture.\"\n\nThe city is contributing $287.5 million to the stadium and millions more for surrounding roads and sewers, plus selling roughly 65 acres of public land below appraised value. The Rays would pay $700 million for the stadium and all cost overruns, including in the surrounding redevelopment.\n\nFlowers, an ally of the mayor, asked why off-site affordable housing can't be built sooner, even though the county's role in the deal only concerns the stadium.\n\n\"It would be really nice if they could be pushed up and moved forward,\" she said. \"Off site has no bearing as what happens on site.\"", "source": {"uri": "tampabay.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tampa Bay Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "County commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Eggers", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dave Eggers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yankee Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opening Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Petersburg, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinellas_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinellas County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinellas County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearwater,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clearwater, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clearwater, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Latvala", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Latvala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ken Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Silverman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Silverman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_administrator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County administrator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewerage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sewerage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affordable housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinellas_Park,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinellas Park, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinellas Park, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Harbor,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palm Harbor, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Harbor, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Construction_and_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Construction and Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.tampabay.com/resizer/BNFwghlQt1Cht0N3twGhJIo7Uc4=/1200x675/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tbt/GVS5HGYMTRGZDGMF7PVSYS4OMA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764456", "eventUri": "eng-9764456", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Clearwater, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

But during that time, some crucial questions came up that still need to be answered before some commissioners said they would feel comfortable voting in favor of the plan.\n\n\"We currently have a stadium, an old stadium, and a parking lot, but this would be a $6.5 billion -- probably the largest economic development project ever built in Pinellas County,\" said Pinellas County Administrator Barry Burton, as he opened the discussion at Thursday's County Commission workshop.\n\nWith nearly $312.5 million potentially coming from Pinellas County, it's a decision commissioners said the weren't taking lightly.\n\n\"If I felt rushed today for this vote on Tuesday, I'm a no,\" said Commissioner Dave Eggers.\n\nEggers said even after Thursday's meeting, he still had concerns about the county using its bed-tax money for the stadium, and how the expenditure would impact other projects, like beach renourishment.\n\n\"It is enough for me to truly vote no on it,\" he said. \"I think there's a real issue here with opportunity availability for use of the funds we're putting into the project. I understand the benefits of the project -- I've heard them, I've gone through them, but we have a different responsibility to make sure it's fair.\"\n\nSt. Petersburg Mayor Ken Welch said he understood commissioners having questions about the project, because it was a lengthy process for city council members to get to the point they were ready to vote. But ultimately, he said he's not worried.\n\n\"The first time we had a committee of the whole, there were a ton of questions,\" Welch said. \"We took those questions one by one -- you saw a lot of those end up in the ultimate agreements. I foresee the same process happening here.\"\n\nPinellas County commissioners are set to take the $312.5 million vote on July 30, with four of the seven required to vote in favor of it for the measure to pass.\n\nEggers said that while he's just one vote, he needs more information before he can vote to approve the plan.\n\n\"If I feel like this is being pushed through on Tuesday, I'll vote no,\" he said. \"Even if I might be in favor of it, let's not rush this deal.

All Rays' ownership has to do is get one yard and that may be coming soon from Pinellas County, Florida politicians. Pinellas County Commissioners need to approve a $312.5 million expenditure with that money coming from a Tourist Development Tax fund to help pay for the ballpark. If the commissioners say yes, the long trek to get a new ballpark built in St. Petersburg, Florida will be over. The Rays' ownership will have won the most important game in franchise history.\n\nOn July 18, the St. Petersburg City Council in a 5-3 vote approved plans for a new ballpark and development. The city's present ballpark is located in the same area. The St. Petersburg council approved a measure to spend nearly $430 million over the length of the deal and sell 65 acres of public land to the Rays ownership group. It will cost $6.5 billion, which includes the $1.3 billion ballpark, to build a stadium-village and the project needs Pinellas County money.

It came a week after St. Petersburg City Council members approved a $6.7 billion proposal to anchor a vastly reimagined Historic Gas Plant District with a new stadium.\n\nThe discussion was more straightforward and less time-consuming than the council's meetings. That is due to the county's financing structure and primary focus on the ballpark rather than the surrounding 65-acre redevelopment.\n\nAdministrator Barry Burton noted the site currently consists of an aging stadium and sprawling parking lots. Five of eight commissioners must decide that the \"largest economic development project ever built in Pinellas County\" deserves $312.5 million from tourist development tax coffers.\n\n\"We want to keep the Rays - we've got generations that have grown up with them,\" Burton said. \"But this is far different than just a baseball stadium. It's about so much more than that ... this becomes another destination that compliments all the attractions we have here in Pinellas County.\"\n\nDespite some remaining questions, commissioners will likely vote on their contribution July 30. The city will provide $287.5 million to offset stadium construction costs and $130 million for infrastructure improvements.\n\nThe county will own the stadium site and lease it to the city, which will then license it to the Rays. The team will pay $1 million annually for 25 years.\n\nThe Rays and Hines development team will contribute over $700 million to the project and cover inevitable cost overruns. In addition, they must dedicate $50 million to affordable and workforce housing, small-business assistance, inclusive hiring, job creation and educational programs, and a new Woodson African American Museum of Florida.\n\n\"The development will create jobs, housing, hotel and meeting space, economic growth and tourism, and honor the promises that were made to the Gas Plant community,\" Mayor Ken Welch told the commission. \"That I grew up in, and Commissioner (Renee) Flowers, as well.\"\n\nThe project seemingly has the county's approval. While Commissioners Dave Eggers and Chris Latvala vocalized some tepid concerns, the workshop lacked the ardent opposition found in several city meetings.\n\nThe most discussed potential hurdle was the county's ability to help subsidize a new Major League Baseball stadium while ensuring it has enough money to renourish beaches. Eggers said he wanted \"crystal clear\" data showing \"we're not close\" to lacking that funding, particularly after a storm.\n\nCounty officials considered over 21 of the county's 35 miles of beaches \"critically eroded\" before Hurricane Idalia's storm surge decimated the coastline in August 2023. An impasse with the Army Corps of Engineers has increased the need to maintain restoration resources.\n\nHowever, Burton noted that a September 2023 presentation showed Pinellas has plenty of bed tax dollars - a 6% surcharge on overnight stays - to self-fund beach projects and subsidize the stadium. At the time, administrators expected to accrue $3 billion over the next 40 years based on a \"conservative\" 3% growth estimate.\n\nThat war chest has likely increased as the county subsequently set new tourism records. Overnight stays provided $98 million in bed taxes throughout fiscal year 2023. Officials must dedicate 40% to projects that increase visitation.\n\n\"We've set aside money for fully funding our beach renourishment,\" Burton said Thursday. \"That is our first priority. We did that before we committed to this model.\"\n\nBurton explained that 37% of the redevelopment would occur in the 30-year project's first phase. He said the developers must \"build this right with the stadium\" to create their desired destination.\n\nSimilarly, Burton said the Rays must maintain the ballpark to enforceable standards. An independent firm will review those efforts every five years. That incentivizes the team to not \"build it on the cheap.\"\n\nBurton believes communities from South St. Petersburg to Palm Harbor will benefit from its $443 million economic impact that will exponentially increase once construction concludes. Officials expect the project to provide $1.46 billion in new local property taxes through the first 30 years.\n\nCommissioner Brian Scott said many constituents bemoan subsidizing \"rich sports teams,\" and \"fundamentally, I agree with that.\" However, he noted the reality \"is a heck of a lot more complicated.\"\n\nScott called it a \"real challenge\" to explain that limited-use bed tax dollars would create additional general fund revenue. Burton agreed but said it allows commissioners to \"do what you're doing this year, which is to roll back that property tax rate.\"\n\nEggers opposed the city using Intown Community Redevelopment Area (CRA) funding to offset construction costs. \"It going for infrastructure on this project is fine with me,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm concerned about the stadium piece,\" Eggers added. \"I'm also concerned about leftover money going to paying off debt for the team.\" Burton noted that property within the CRA would generate roughly $8 million annually in county property tax revenue once it sunsets in 2032.\n\nEggers also questioned why the city would sell land valued at $280 million to the Rays for just $105 million. Welch said the team offered more than any previous proposal.\n\nHe also reiterated the importance of fulfilling long-deferred promises of economic opportunity and inclusion at the site. \"It was never my focus going in to sell the land for the highest price,\" Welch said. \"It would be luxury condos.\"\n\nBurton said he could provide an update on beach renourishment funding within 24 to 48 hours. Commissioners will discuss that and other minor, unresolved issues before voting Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "stpetecatalyst.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St Pete Catalyst"}, "authors":

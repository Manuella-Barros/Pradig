{"id": 232138860, "title": "15 bonkers things Alex Jones said on his way to $1.5 billion judgment", "text": "Notorious right-wing radio host Alex Jones is going through some things, and it\u2019s not just because people suddenly found out that adjudicated sexual assaulter and convicted felon Donald Trump claimed he had an \u201camazing\u201d reputation. The infamous \u201cfalse flag\u201d flapper, 9/11 truther, and amphibian homophobe is reportedly liquidating his assets to pay the hefty damages he owes to the Sandy Hook families he defamed in the wake of the horrific school shooting. And according to some media reports, this could finally be his Waterloo\u2014if Waterloo is a place where a guy who believes in secret Obama weather machines was forced to cough up $1.5 billion for being an unrepentant asshole. And hey, it\u2019s about effing time. To paraphrase Martin Luther King Jr., the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward Alex Jones sitting in his grandma\u2019s basement eating off-brand Funyuns and watching Spanish-dubbed \u201cSaved by the Bell\u201d reruns. From the CNN story: The seismic move paves the way for a future in which Jones no longer owns Infowars, the influential conspiracy empire he founded in the late 1990s. Over the years, Jones has not only used the media company to poison the public discourse with vile lies and conspiracy theories, but also to enrich himself to the tune of millions of dollars. Prior to Thursday, Jones had resisted converting his personal bankruptcy into a Chapter 7 liquidation. But facing mounting legal pressure, he reversed course and caved to the demands of the Sandy Hook families, who have still not seen a penny from Jones since juries in Connecticut and Texas found him liable in 2022 for defamation and emotional distress. Fun, right? So in honor of Jones\u2019 defenestration, we\u2019re presenting 15 of his worst greatest hits\u2014one for every $100 million he owes to the innocent grieving families he continually tormented by insisting that the massacre never took place. Hope it was worth it, Alex! (Note: This list is by no means exhaustive, though depending on your nonsense tolerance, it may very well be exhausting. You\u2019ve been warned) 1. Sandy Hook This is the big one: the conspiracy-laden lie that led to Jones\u2019 upcoming comeuppance. Jones was rightly\u2014and righteously\u2014sued by families of the Sandy Hook mass shooting victims for making numerous false and hurtful statements, which he repeated ad nauseam with zero regard for decency or truth. In a September 2022 retrospective, The New York Times collected just a few of these: \u201cMy gut is, with the timing and everything that happened, this is staged. And you know I\u2019ve been saying the last few months, get ready for big mass shootings, and then magically, it happens.\u201d \u201cFolks, we got to get private investigators up to Sandy Hook right now. Because I\u2019m telling you this \u2014 this stinks to highest heaven.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s as phony as a $3 bill.\u201d \u201cWhy did Hitler blow up the Reichstag \u2014 to get control! Why do governments stage these things \u2014 to get our guns! Why can\u2019t people get that through their head?\u201d Good God, what a vile piece of shit. 2. Gay frogs You might think this was just a one-off, but no. Jones\u2019 rants about gay frogs spanned several years\u2014in the end surviving longer than the Confederate States of America. In 2010, he said, \u201cThe reason there\u2019s so many gay people now is because it\u2019s a chemical warfare operation, and I have the government documents where they said they\u2019re going to encourage homosexuality with chemicals so that people don\u2019t have children.\u201d And in 2017 he was back at it, claiming, \u201cThe majority of frogs in most areas of the United States are now gay.\u201d It remains a mystery why he\u2019s so obsessed with the subject, but he clearly is. 3. Government weather machines On May 21, 2013, Jones claimed weather machines were likely responsible for a tornado that had wreaked havoc in Oklahoma the day before. From Media Matters for America: After laying out how insurance companies use weather modification to avoid having to pay ski resorts for lack of snow, Jones said that \u201cof course there's weather weapon stuff going on -- we had floods in Texas like fifteen years ago, killed thirty-something people in one night. Turned out it was the Air Force.\u201d Following a long tangent, Jones returned to the caller's subject. While he explained that \u201cnatural tornadoes\u201d do exist and that he's not sure if a government \u201cweather weapon\u201d was involved in the Oklahoma disaster, Jones warned nonetheless that the government \u201ccan create and steer groups of tornadoes.\u201d Bonkers, right? Well, it apparently wasn\u2019t quite bonkers enough to prevent him from repeating the theory as soon as a Democrat was back in the White House. Following a December 2021 tornado in Kentucky, Jones was back at it, asking, \u201cDid they use weather weapons to cause the tornadoes? That\u2019s a legitimate question to ask.\u201d 4. Robert Mueller, demon and pedophile Naturally, anyone who would agree to investigate Donald Trump while notorious tornado-witch Barack Obama remained at large must have a screw loose. Or else he\u2019s a demon. There\u2019s gotta be something wrong with him, right? Don\u2019t worry, Alex is on the case. From The Hill: \u201cThat\u2019s a demon I will take down, or I\u2019ll die trying. So that\u2019s it. It\u2019s going to happen, we\u2019re going to walk out in the square, politically, at high noon, and he\u2019s going to find out whether he makes a move man, make the move first, and then it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Jones said, miming a pistol with his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s not a joke. It\u2019s not a game. It\u2019s the real world. Politically. You\u2019re going to get it, or I\u2019m going to die trying, bitch. Get ready. We\u2019re going to bang heads. We\u2019re going to bang heads.\u201d Oh, right: Jones also made death threats against Mueller, a decorated military veteran and former head of the FBI. Did I forget to mention that part? In July 2021, Jones also accused Mueller of being a pedophile, saying, \u201cEveryone\u2019s so scared of Mueller, they\u2019d let Mueller rape kids in front of people, which he did.\u201d 5. Bill Gates\u2019 COVID plot Bill Gates was a frequent right-wing punching bag during the COVID-19 pandemic because of his \u2026 vow to donate all his money to save the lives of millions of people who live in poverty? Who really knows anymore? I just know lots of MAGA folks hate him \u2026 and so does Jones. Jones\u2019 overarching conspiracy theory about Gates has many threads, but this is the broad contour: Gates, acting as the public face of a plot by globalist elites to depopulate the earth, created and released the novel coronavirus, spurring efforts to create a vaccine that will then be used by globalists to sterilize or kill the most of the earth\u2019s population. Jones began targeting Gates with coronavirus-related conspiracy theories as early January, when there were few reported coronavirus cases in the U.S. In a video posted January 27 to Infowars\u2019 streaming platform Banned.video, Jones called Gates \u201cthe chief science officer of the private corporate world government\u201d who was helping globalists \u201ccarry out and execute this covert sterilization depopulation plan.\u201d 6. 9/11 truther This is one of the OG anti-government conspiracy theories, so naturally Jones is an adherent. In 2011, Jones told Rolling Stone he was actually one of the first to question the official 9/11 story. \u201cI went on the air and said, \u2018Those were controlled demolitions. You just watched the government blow up the World Trade Center.\u2019 I lost 70 percent of my affiliates that day. Station managers asked me, \u2018Do you want to be on this crusade going nowhere, or do you want to be a star?\u2019 I\u2019m proud I never compromised.\u201d He\u2019s proud, folks. Proud! I wonder if he\u2019s just as proud of sticking to his Sandy Hook story. Because that one didn\u2019t work out quite as well for him, did it? 7. Race wars Okay, maybe this one isn\u2019t so far out there. After all, loads of people have discussed the inevitability of a civilization-disrupting American race war\u2014like Charles Manson, for instance. Jones\u2019 take on the issue in the wake of the unrest that followed the police-involved killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, was typically repulsive. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s going on: Media nationwide is pushing race war,\u201d Jones claimed. \u201cThat\u2019s all they\u2019ve got. Don\u2019t like Obamacare, you\u2019re a racist. Don\u2019t want to turn your guns in, you\u2019re a racist. Michael Moore\u2014\u2018if you own guns and you\u2019re white, it\u2019s because you\u2019re scared of black people.\u2019 That\u2019s a quote from CNN. This is all they\u2019ve got, while these big foreign banks that own the country loot the treasury with bailout money, Obamacare scamming everybody, Obama opening the borders up, giving free welfare to tens of millions of people, all these unconstitutional scams happening. And all they\u2019ve got is getting us to fight with each other.\u201d Yes, God forbid we have a president who encourages people to fight with each other. Thank God Donald Trump came along to save us from ourselves. And just in time, too! 8. Lady Gaga\u2019s satanic Super Bowl halftime show Hey, I already like Lady Gaga; no need to sell me on her. That said, here\u2019s another frothing soliloquy from this fucking guy. \u201cThe organizers of the Super Bowl are deciding to defile America and break our will by having us bow down to this,\u201d Jones said in a rant posted Sunday on his website. [...] \u201cOn top of the stadium, ruling over everyone with drones everywhere, surveilling them in a big swarm,\u201d Jones said. \u201cTo just condition them, \u2018I am the goddess of Satan,\u2019 ruling over you with the rise of the robots in a ritual of lesser magic. They have to tell you what they\u2019re planning in the future.\u201d \u201cThe rise of the machines is here,\u201d Jones continued. \u201cYou are broken, you are fallen, and I squat on top of you and basically piss all over you. Just like at the Hillary event, she wore the clear Nazi pure black uniform with the SS hat and the red insignia to again, flaunt it, rub it in, dominate you and say, \u2018I am the dark one, I am the beast.'\u201d 9. Goblins! If this were anyone else, you\u2019d naturally assume Jones is using the term \u201cgoblins\u201d metaphorically. But with Jones you never really know. Either way, this is super fucking weird, man. 10. Pizzagate In case you remain unconvinced that Jones is a coward\u2014despite his evident pride in sticking with his 9/11 conspiracy theories\u2014get a gander at his reaction when the infamous Pizzagate conspiracy theory suddenly went cattywampus. From Media Matters: Alex Jones suggested last month on his radio show that \u201csomething\u2019s being covered up\u201d at the restaurant that\u2019s been falsely accused in the \u201cpizzagate\u201d conspiracy theory and \u201cit needs to be investigated.\u201d Days later an Alex Jones listener attempted to \"self-investigate\u201d Comet Ping Pong and ended up firing his gun inside the restaurant. After the shooting\u2014and after media began reporting that the shooter is a fan of Jones\u2014Jones deleted the YouTube video. Come on, man. When shit like this happens you\u2019re supposed to YELL LOUDER, not meekly give in to the globalists. 11. Picklegate During her 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton opened a jar of pickles on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d to prove she was hale and hearty enough to handle a 3 AM crisis. Well, because this was Hillary Clinton, millions of right-wingers were outraged. And, naturally, Jones was among them. \"Thousands of people, even millions of people, are convinced I rigged the pickle jar,\" the host said on Thursday's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" One believer, conservative conspiracy theorist and radio host Alex Jones, dedicated a great deal of his radio show to explaining how Kimmel allegedly conspired with the Democratic presidential candidate in loosening the jar's lid ahead of taping. \"If you're ever feeling bad about your job,\" Kimmel joked, \"just remember there's a grown man who spent a full seven minutes yelling about me and a pickle jar on television.\" 12. Antonin Scalia was murdered Both Jones and Trump (see below) have suggested that uber-conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was actually whacked. The supposed evidence? He was found dead in his bed with a pillow on his head. \u201cYou just get used to this \u2018Scalia found, it\u2019s natural, nothing going on here, he just died naturally,\u2019\u201d Jones said in a video on Facebook. \u201cAnd you\u2019re like, \u2018Whoa. Red flag.\u2019 Then you realize, Obama is one vote away from being able to ban guns, open the borders and actually have the court engage in its agenda and now Scalia dies. I mean, this is hardcore.\u201d Jones went on to wonder whether Justice Clarence Thomas, former presidential candidate Ron Paul or GOP front-runner Donald Trump could be next. Oh, and look who agrees with him! Trump raised questions about the circumstances surrounding Scalia's death. \"I'm hearing it's a big topic -- that's the question. And it's a horrible topic, but they say they found a pillow on his face, which is a pretty unusual place to find a pillow,\" he told radio host Michael Savage on \"The Savage Nation.\" Okay, all I can say about this is: worst hitmen ever! \u201cSay, did you put the pillow back under his head?\u201d \u201cI thought you did!\u201d \u201cNo. Shit! Oh, well. As long as Alex Jones and Donald Trump don\u2019t find out, we\u2019re probably in the clear.\u201d \u201cYeah. Say, did you get the latest specs on Barack\u2019s gay-frog tornado machine? The miracles of modern technology\u2014I tells ya.\u201d 13. \u2018Cyborg slaves of Satan\u2019 Wait, I thought \u201ccyborg slaves of Satan\u201d referred to the dozen or so people who bought Google Glass back in 2014. Apparently not. Jones: I declare this July 4, 2022, to be a declaration of independence against the alien force on this planet today waging war against humans and our biology and our very future, that is attempting to exterminate the majority of us and force the minority that\u2019s left to merge with AI computers and become cyborg slaves of Satan. Hmm, looks like someone sprinkled a little too much butter and bath salts on their popcorn before watching \u201cIndependence Day\u201d for the 20th time. 14. Disgusting homophobic Adam Schiff rant Okay, this one\u2019s really gross. Too gross for me to transcribe, in fact. So I\u2019ll just leave it here. Warning: Not safe for work. Or home. Or a tucked-away library carrel. Or a backyard cockfight, for that matter. Watch at your own risk. The virulently homophobic rant picks up at 42 seconds, right after Jones says \u201cI\u2019m not against gay people.\u201d 15. Giving Donald Trump ideas Donald Trump isn\u2019t bright enough to come up with his own conspiracy theories, but Jones has always been more than happy to do the legwork for him. Not only did Trump echo Jones\u2019 suggestion that President Obama had Antonin Scalia murdered, he\u2019s also regularly loaded Trump\u2019s nonsense-filled head with still more nonsense. Trump has echoed Jones\u2019s allegations that climate change is a myth, that President Obama wasn\u2019t born in America, that Muslims in New Jersey celebrated on 9/11, that Antonin Scalia was murdered, that Clinton used drugs before a debate, that \u201cglobalists\u201d (read: prominent Jews) are trying to take over America, that vaccines cause autism and that Ted Cruz\u2019s father was involved in the John F. Kennedy assassination. Jones, who says he advises Trump privately, boasts that Trump repeats his ideas \u201cword for word.\u201d Thanks for that, Alex. Thanks for everything, in fact. It\u2019s been real. Daily Kos\u2019 Postcards to Swing States campaign is back, and I just signed up to help. Please join me! Let\u2019s do this, patriots!

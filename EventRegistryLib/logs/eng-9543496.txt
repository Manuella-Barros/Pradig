Our long history of innovating on a highly secure, best-in-class self-custodial digital wallet provides a gateway for people to enter a decentralized future by making it seamless for people to trade across a broad range of exchanges and digital assets.\n\nWe believe our technological innovation coupled, with our healthy financial profile, strongly positions us for a wealth of future opportunities ahead. As part of the opportunity to drive Exodus' brand awareness, we are scheduled to be uplisted on the NYSE American on May 9th and are thrilled to be part of this new community.\"\n\nFirst Quarter Operational and Other Financial Highlights\n\n\"We achieved Q1 record revenue of $29.1 million up 118% year-over-year and strong operating leverage,\" said James Gernetzke, CFO of Exodus. \"These results demonstrate the strength of our business model that sets us up for durability in bear markets and strong growth in bull markets.\"\n\n\"We are also excited by the momentum in our Wallet-as-a-Service capabilities and the early traction we are seeing. One example is the Magic Eden wallet which enables people to trade NFTs across a broad range of digital assets. Our fiat onboarding services also continue to demonstrate healthy growth as we make it easier for people to onboard and offboard from decentralized applications.\"\n\nQ1 2024 Webcast\n\nExodus will host a webcast of its preliminary first quarter 2024 fiscal results beginning at 5:00PM (Eastern Time) on May 6, 2024.

Available for desktop, mobile and browser, Exodus allows users to secure, manage and exchange cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and more across an industry-leading 10,000+ asset pairs from a beautiful, easy-to-use wallet.

We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison.\n\nA reconciliation of net income, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA to net income can be found below in the table captioned \"Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA.\" Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income, adjusted to exclude provision for or benefit from income taxes, depreciation and amortization, interest (income) expense, stock-based compensation expense, impairment, investment income, fair value gain or loss on derivatives, non-recurring legal reserves and related costs, and other loss, net.\n\nThe Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. Management's determination of the components of Adjusted EBITDA are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by industry analysts. Net income attributable to Exodus stockholders is reconciled to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as follows:\n\nPreliminary Reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (Unaudited)\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that are based on our beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to us as of the date hereof. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words: \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"would,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" or other comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements in this document include, but are not limited to, quotations from management regarding confidence in our products, services, business trajectory and plans, and certain business metrics. These statements involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that are difficult to predict and may cause actual results or performance to be materially and adversely different.\n\nFactors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: expectations regarding future customer adoption of Exodus for dApps, DeFi and NFTs compared to its competitors; the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the impact of sanctions or other restrictive actions, by the United States and other countries, and the potential response by Russia thereto; difficulties predicting user behavior and changes in user spending habits as a result of, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wages, inflation and consumer confidence; unexpected or rapid changes in the growth or decline of our domestic and/or international markets; increasing competition from existing and new competitors; rapidly evolving and groundbreaking advances that fundamentally alter the digital asset and cryptocurrency industry; continued compliance with regulatory requirements; volatility in the price of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, and other digital assets; the possibility that the development and release of new products or enhancements to existing products do not proceed in accordance with the anticipated timeline or may themselves contain bugs or errors requiring remediation and that the market for the sale of these new or enhanced products may not develop as expected; the risks relating to our ability to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods (or minimize declines) while controlling expenses; the compromise of user data for any reason; foreign operational, political and other risks relating to our operations; unexpected delays encountered during the audit process; and the loss of key personnel, labor shortages or work stoppages.\n\nMore information on the factors, risks and uncertainties that could cause or contribute to such differences is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" sections of Amendment No. 1 to our Registration Statement on Form 10 for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed on May 1, 2024.

(OTCQX: EXOD), (the \"Company\" or \"Exodus\") the leading self-custodial cryptocurrency software platform, today announced its preliminary results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024. The preliminary results are unaudited, subject to completion of the Company's financial reporting processes, based on information known by management as of the date of this press release and do not represent a comprehensive statement of our financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\nPreliminary First Quarter 2024 Financial Highlights (Unaudited)\n\n\"We are proud to have delivered an exceptional Q1 with record revenue, strong profitability and growing momentum in our emerging product categories including our Wallet-as-a-Service capabilities and fiat onboarding\" said JP Richardson, CEO and co-founder of Exodus.\n\n\"We empower both crypto newcomers as well as veterans to control their wealth. The demand for cryptocurrency continues to grow at a rapid rate as indicated by the appreciation of Bitcoin in Q1 and the growing users on our platform. Our long history of innovating on a highly secure, best-in-class self-custodial digital wallet provides a gateway for people to enter a decentralized future by making it seamless for people to trade across a broad range of exchanges and digital assets.\n\nWe believe our technological innovation coupled, with our healthy financial profile, strongly positions us for a wealth of future opportunities ahead. As part of the opportunity to drive Exodus' brand awareness, we are scheduled to be uplisted on the NYSE American on May 9th and are thrilled to be part of this new community.\"\n\nFirst Quarter Operational and Other Financial Highlights\n\n\"We achieved Q1 record revenue of $29.1 million up 118% year-over-year and strong operating leverage,\" said James Gernetzke, CFO of Exodus. \"These results demonstrate the strength of our business model that sets us up for durability in bear markets and strong growth in bull markets.\"\n\n\"We are also excited by the momentum in our Wallet-as-a-Service capabilities and the early traction we are seeing. One example is the Magic Eden wallet which enables people to trade NFTs across a broad range of digital assets. Our fiat onboarding services also continue to demonstrate healthy growth as we make it easier for people to onboard and offboard from decentralized applications.\"\n\nQ1 2024 Webcast\n\nExodus will host a webcast of its preliminary first quarter 2024 fiscal results beginning at 5:00PM (Eastern Time) on May 6, 2024.

The preliminary estimated financial results described above constitute forward-looking statements. The preliminary estimated financial information presented above is subject to change, and our actual financial results may differ from such preliminary estimates and such differences could be material. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance upon these preliminary estimates.\n\nAbout Exodus\n\nExodus is on a mission to help the world exit the traditional finance system.

We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison.\n\nA reconciliation of net income, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA to net income can be found below in the table captioned \"Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA.\" Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income, adjusted to exclude provision for or benefit from income taxes, depreciation and amortization, interest (income) expense, stock-based compensation expense, impairment, investment income, fair value gain or loss on derivatives, non-recurring legal reserves and related costs, and other loss, net.\n\nThe Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board of Directors. Management's determination of the components of Adjusted EBITDA are evaluated periodically and based, in part, on a review of non-GAAP financial measures used by industry analysts. Net income attributable to Exodus stockholders is reconciled to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as follows:\n\nPreliminary Reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (Unaudited)\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements that are based on our beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to us as of the date hereof. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the following words: \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"would,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" or other comparable terminology.

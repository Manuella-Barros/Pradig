{"id": 225004142, "title": "Cheese Recall Update as FDA Issues Highest Level of Concern", "text": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently warned consumers that a brand of cheese recalled in April could have fatal consequences if consumed.Tama Corporation recalled 24-ounce containers of \"Queso de Mano PAISA\" in April after a laboratory analysis identified the product was contaminated by Listeria monocytogenes.Listeria is a \"bacterium that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems,\" the press release warned. It is particularly dangerous for pregnant women, who can suffer miscarriages or stillbirths if infected.On May 23, the FDA updated the recall classification to Class 1. Class 1 is the highest classification of recall issued by the FDA, signifying that \"there is a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to a violative product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death.\"The cheese was sold at Rancho Markets stores in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Tama Corporation voluntarily initiated the recall, which affected 216 units of the cheese.Upon learning of the contamination, the company \"immediately contacted the involved supermarket chain to halt its sale and account for all the product belonging to that vat.\"Tama Corporation said no illnesses have been reported to date. Newsweek reached out to the company via email for comment.\"We assure all our consumers, clients and distributors that we have taken all necessary actions, hand in hand with the product manufacturer, the FDA, and the USDA, to prevent the situation from happening again,\" the press release said.A number of other cheese and dairy products were also recalled earlier this year over fears of listeria contamination.The Centers for Disease Control & Prevention warned that soft cheeses are more likely to be contaminated with listeria than hard cheeses \"because of their high moisture, low salt content, and low acidity.\"\"These conditions support the growth of Listeria,\" the CDC warned.Unheated deli meat, premade deli salads, smoked fish, raw sprouts, and raw dairy products are more likely than other food items to be contaminated by listeria.If pregnant, symptoms of listeria infection include fever and flu-like symptoms such as fatigue and muscle aches, the CDC said. In people who are not pregnant, symptoms can include fever, flu-like symptoms, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and seizures.Symptoms are usually mild in pregnant people, although the newborn can face life-threatening problems. In nonpregnant people, a listeria infection is fatal for nearly 1 in 20 people.", "summary": "The recall impacted a brand of cheese sold in Utah.", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/cheese-recall-utah-fda-1905514", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2400519/cheese-recall-fda-issues-class-1.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:13:27", "author": "Anna Skinner", "authors": ["Anna Skinner"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.498}

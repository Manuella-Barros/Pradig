He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nMayall protested in interviews that he was not a talent scout, but played for the love of the music he had first heard on his father's 78-rpm records.\n\n\"I'm a band leader and I know what I want to play in my band -- who can be good friends of mine,\" Mayall said in an interview with the Southern Vermont Review. \"It's definitely a family. It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" signaled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nAmong this year's new members of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, he is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; and Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat.\n\nClapton and McVie both played on the 1966 release \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" which Rolling Stone magazine has ranked among the 500 greatest albums.\n\n\"He was a great pioneer of British blues and had a wonderful eye for talented musicians,\" Mick Jagger wrote on X, adding that it was Mayall who recommended Taylor as a replacement in 1969 for founding Stones guitarist Brian Jones, \"ushering in a new era\" for the band.\n\nMayall protested in interviews that he was not a talent scout, but played for the love of the music he had first heard on his father's 78-rpm records.\n\n\"I'm a band leader and I know what I want to play in my band -- who can be good friends of mine,\" Mayall said in an interview with the Southern Vermont Review. \"It's definitely a family. It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nThough Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues.

He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" markeda permanent move to the United States and a change in direction.

Mayall, the British blues musician whose influential band the Bluesbreakers was a training ground for Eric Clapton, Mick Fleetwood and many other superstars, died Monday, July 22, 2024, at his home in California. He was 90.\n\nJohn Mayall, the British blues musician whose influential band the Bluesbreakers was a training ground for Eric Clapton, Mick Fleetwood and many other superstars, has died. He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nMayall protested in interviews that he was not a talent scout, but played for the love of the music he had first heard on his father's 78-rpm records.\n\n\"I'm a band leader and I know what I want to play in my band -- who can be good friends of mine,\" Mayall said in an interview with the Southern Vermont Review. \"It's definitely a family. It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" signaled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.\n\nWith Joe Biden out and Kamala Harris in as the Democratic Party nominee, ABC Action News anchor Paul LaGrone took to the streets of Tampa to get your voice on the campaign shakeup.\n\nYour Voice | How do you feel about the presidential race\n\nSalt Lake City will host the 2034 Winter Olympics\n\nAssociated Press\n\n6:36 AM, Jul 24, 2024\n\nSunday, July 21 was the hottest day ever measured on Earth\n\nScripps News Staff\n\n10:41 PM, Jul 23, 2024\n\nCould Harris beat Trump?

Mayall, the British blues musician whose influential band the Bluesbreakers was a training ground for Eric Clapton, Mick Fleetwood and many other superstars, died Monday, July 22, 2024, at his home in California. He was 90. (Sandro Campardo/Keystone via AP, File)\n\nJohn Mayall, the British blues musician whose influential band the Bluesbreakers was a training ground for Eric Clapton, Mick Fleetwood and many other superstars, has died. He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nAmong this year's new members of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, he is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; and Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat.\n\nClapton and McVie both played on the 1966 release \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" which Rolling Stone magazine has ranked among the 500 greatest albums.\n\n\"He was a great pioneer of British blues and had a wonderful eye for talented musicians,\" Mick Jagger wrote on X, adding that it was Mayall who recommended Taylor as a replacement in 1969 for founding Stones guitarist Brian Jones, \"ushering in a new era\" for the band.\n\nMayall protested in interviews that he was not a talent scout, but played for the love of the music he had first heard on his father's 78-rpm records.\n\n\"I'm a band leader and I know what I want to play in my band -- who can be good friends of mine,\" Mayall said in an interview with the Southern Vermont Review. \"It's definitely a family. It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nThough Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" markeda permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall", "type": "person",

He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death on Tuesday, local time, saying the musician died on Monday at his home in California.\n\n\"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s.\n\nAt various times, the Bluesbreakers included Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with The Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nMayall protested in interviews that he was not a talent scout, but played for the love of the music he had first heard on his father's 78-rpm records.\n\n\"I'm a band leader and I know what I want to play in my band -- who can be good friends of mine,\" Mayall said in an interview with the Southern Vermont Review. \"It's definitely a family. It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nThough Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination for Wake Up Call which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins.\n\nHe received a second nomination in 2022 for his album The Sun Is Shining Down. He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton, is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on November 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favourite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up\".\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, Blues Alone.\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined the Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen\".\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career\".\n\n\"I think he is a great musician.

He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nMayall protested in interviews that he was not a talent scout, but played for the love of the music he had first heard on his father's 78-rpm records.\n\n\"I'm a band leader and I know what I want to play in my band -- who can be good friends of mine,\" Mayall said in an interview with the Southern Vermont Review. \"It's definitely a family. It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" signaled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.", "source": {"uri": "wral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WRAL"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall", "type": "person", "score": 5,

In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage.

He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death, saying the musician died on Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nMayall protested in interviews that he was not a talent scout, but played for the love of the music he had first heard on his father's 78rpm records.\n\n\"I'm a band leader and I know what I want to play in my band - who can be good friends of mine,\" Mayall said in an interview with the Southern Vermont Review. \"It's definitely a family. It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nThough Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination for Wake Up Call and a second nomination in 2022 for his album The Sun Is Shining Down. He also won official recognition in Britain with an OBE in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class, and his 1966 album Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton, is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall was born on 29 November 1933 in the Cheshire town of Macclesfield, south of Manchester. Sounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said: \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album Blues Alone.\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues\", but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene. The Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen\".\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: he disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career\".\n\nClapton added: \"I think he's a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness.\"\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the 70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for DownBeat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed - shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage.

He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nMayall protested in interviews that he was not a talent scout, but played for the love of the music he had first heard on his father's 78-rpm records.\n\n\"I'm a band leader and I know what I want to play in my band -- who can be good friends of mine,\" Mayall said in an interview with the Southern Vermont Review. \"It's definitely a family. It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nRelated Story: Shannen Doherty, 'Beverly Hills, 90210' Star, Dies at 53\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" markeda permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage.

He was 90.A statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.He is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.Mayall protested in interviews that he was not a talent scout, but played for the love of the music he had first heard on his father's 78-rpm records.\"I'm a band leader and I know what I want to play in my band -- who can be good friends of mine,\" Mayall said in an interview with the Southern Vermont Review. \"It's definitely a family. It's a small kind of thing really.\"A small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"Known for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.He was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.Mayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"Mayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.Sounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"His father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.Mayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"The piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"Mayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.The Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.Mayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"Mayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.Clapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.Mayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.Mick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nJohn Mayall, the British blues musician whose influential band the Bluesbreakers was a training ground for Eric Clapton, Mick Fleetwood and many other superstars, has died.

He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album The Sun Is Shining Down and was made an OBE in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nBorn on November 29, 1933, in Macclesfield, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favourite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album Blues Alone.\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 he aimed to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands.\n\nMayall's 1968 album Blues from Laurel Canyon signalled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall a low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title":

He was 90.\n\nA statement posted on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. The health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally brought peace to one of the world's greatest road warriors, the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping to develop the English version of Chicago-style urban rhythm and blues that played a significant role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who later formed the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nMayall protested in interviews that he was not a talent scout, but played for the love of music he first heard on his father's 78 rpm records.\n\n\"I'm a bandleader and I know what I want to play in my band and who my good friends are,\" Mayall said in an interview with the Southern Vermont Review. \"It's really a family. It's really a small thing.\"\n\nA small success that endures. Although Mayall never achieved the fame of some of his illustrious former students, he was still performing in his late 80s, playing his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition bothered him a little, and he was not shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit, I've never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a single article about me,\" he said in a 2013 interview with the Santa Barbara Independent. \"I'm still an underground artist.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall was nominated for a Grammy for \"Wake Up Call\" with guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album The Sun Is Shining Down. He also gained official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame's Class of 2024, and his 1966 album, Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton, is considered one of the finest British blues albums.\n\nMayall was once asked whether he continued to play because there was demand or simply to show that he could still do it.\n\nFortunately, the demand is there. But it's really not for those two reasons, it's just for the love of music, he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. I just get together with these guys and we work out.\n\nMayall was born on 29 November 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester, in central England.\n\nEchoing the voice of the down-on-his-luck bluesman, Mayall once said: \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favourite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his piano boogie-woogie records captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time, one year on the left hand, one year on the right, so I wouldn't get confused.\n\nThe piano was his primary instrument, but he also played guitar and harmonica, all the while singing in a characteristically strained voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played every other instrument on his 1967 album, Blues Alone.\n\nMayall has often been considered the father of British blues, but when he moved to London in 1962, his aim was to immerse himself in the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon, among others, were drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers relied on a fluid community of musicians who came and went from different bands. Mayall's greatest achievement was Clapton, who had left the Yardbirds and joined the Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later recalled that Mayall had the most incredible record collection I've ever seen.\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's whims: he disappeared a few months after joining the group, then reappeared later that year, pushing aside newly arrived Peter Green, then left permanently in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which enjoyed meteoric commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, admitted that to some extent I used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\n\n\"I think he's a great musician. I admire and respect his perseverance,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his songwriting abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, appreciated the great latitude Mayall gave his soloists.\n\n\"You would have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could also make as many mistakes as you wanted.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album Blues from Laurel Canyon marked a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released The Turning Point, arguably his most successful album, featuring an atypical four-piece acoustic lineup, including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move\", a song from this album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nBy the 1970s, Mayall was at a personal low, but he continued to tour, performing over 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I did most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in a 1990 interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that nearly broke one of Mayall's heels and left him limping.\n\nIt was an incident that made me stop drinking, Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the lineup changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was retiring the Bluesbreakers name permanently, and in 2013 he led the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall", "type": "person",

At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nMayall protested in interviews that he was not a talent scout, but played for the love of the music he had first heard on his father's 78-rpm records.\n\n\"I'm a band leader and I know what I want to play in my band -- who can be good friends of mine,\" Mayall said in an interview with the Southern Vermont Review. \"It's definitely a family. It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" signaled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall", "type": "person", "score": 5,

He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nAs police kill Native Americans on this reservation, families left afraid and in the dark Seven veterans honored with Quilts of Valor at North Platte Pow Wow Nebraska's first Lego store could be opening soon.

It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nAlthough Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for Wake Up Call which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album The Sun Is Shining Down and was made an OBE in 2005.\n\nBritish Blues pioneer John Mayall performs with his band the Bluesbreakers in Munich, West Germany on June 5, 1969 (AP)\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nBorn on November 29, 1933, in Macclesfield, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favourite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album Blues Alone.\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 he aimed to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nFILE - British Blues pioneer John Mayall performs with this band the Bluesbreakers at the Deutsche Museum in Munich, West Germany, on Jan. 21, 1970. (Claus Hampel/AP)\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands.\n\nMayall's 1968 album Blues from Laurel Canyon signalled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall a low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

The musician died at his home in California on Monday surrounded by family, a statement on his Instagram page said.\n\nThe British blues pioneer led the Bluesbreakers band that influenced stars including Eric Clapton and Mick Fleetwood . He stopped touring in 2021 because of health issues, which his family referred to when they announced his passing.\n\nIn a statement, they said: 'It is with heavy hearts that we bear the news that John Mayall passed away peacefully in his California home on July 22, 2024, surrounded by loving family. 'Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors. 'John Mayall gave us 90 years of tireless efforts to educate, inspire and entertain.'\n\nMayall, who was born in Macclesfield and grew up in Cheadle, Greater Manchester, formed the Bluesbreakers in the early 1960s. He has been credited with helping develop a blues revival of the late 1960s and has been described as the 'father of British blues'.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers started out playing at the Marquee Club -- a small and relatively cheap club -- situated at the heart of London 's West End. In 1964, Mayall obtained his first record date with producer Ian Samwell. The band recorded two tracks: 'Crawling Up a Hill' and 'Mr James'.\n\nBut it wasn't until April 1965 when former Yardbirds guitarist Eric Clapton replaced Roger Dean, that Mayall's career really took off. In 1965, with Eric Clapton as their new guitar player, the Bluesbreakers began attracting considerable attention. When Clapton left that summer on a jaunt to Greece, Peter Green -- founder of Fleetwood Mac -- took his place, while Jack Bruce -- of the rock band Cream -- played bass. In November 1965 Clapton returned, and Green departed.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers has been considered a training ground for other major musicians including John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac, Mick Taylor who played with the Rolling Stones, Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band. Mayall protested in interviews that he was not a talent scout, but played for the love of the music he had first heard on his father's 78-rpm records. Although he admitted in an interview with The Guardian that he had 'managed to pick out some pretty special people'.\n\n'I'm a band leader and I know what I want to play in my band - who can be good friends of mine,' Mayall said in an interview with the Southern Vermont Review. 'It's definitely a family. It's a small kind of thing really.' Although Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s. 'I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,' he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. 'I'm still an underground performer.'\n\nMayall had a Grammy nomination for Wake Up Call which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He also received a second nomination in 2022 for his album The Sun Is Shining Down. He was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton is considered one of the best British blues albums. He was made an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nMayall's father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son. Mayall once said: 'The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favourite pub was.' He learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right -- so 'I wouldn't get all tangled up'.\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album Blues Alone. The Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's 1968 album Blues from Laurel Canyon signalled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall a low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year. In 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht.\n\n\"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album 'Blues from Laurel Canyon' signalled a permanent move to the US and a change in direction.\n\nHe disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released 'The Turning Point' arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond.\n\n'Room to Move', a song from that album, was a frequent audience favourite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990.\n\nOne consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again.\n\nIn 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_merrifield@the-sun.com", "name": "Ryan Merrifield", "type": "author",

He is pictured here performing on stage with Miles Davis during the 42nd Montreux Jazz Festival in Montreux, Switzerland\n\nThe Bluesbreakers started out playing at the Marquee Club -- a small and relatively cheap club -- situated at the heart of London's West End.\n\nIn 1964, Mayall obtained his first record date with producer Ian Samwell. The band recorded two tracks: 'Crawling Up a Hill' and 'Mr James'.\n\nBut it wasn't until April 1965 when former Yardbirds guitarist Eric Clapton replaced Roger Dean, that Mayall's career really took off.\n\nIn 1965, with Eric Clapton as their new guitar player, the Bluesbreakers began attracting considerable attention.\n\nWhen Clapton left that summer on a jaunt to Greece, Peter Green -- founder of Fleetwood Mac -- took his place, while Jack Bruce -- of the rock band Cream -- played bass. In November 1965 Clapton returned, and Green departed.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers has been considered a training ground for other major musicians including John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac, Mick Taylor who played with the Rolling Stones, Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nJohn Mayall (pictured) in London, March 4, 1971\n\nJohn Mayall's Bluesbreakers: John Mayer, Eric Clapton, John McVie, Hughie Flint\n\nJohn Mayall poses during an interview in Madrid, Spain, on February 13 2017\n\nThe Bluesbreakers (pictured) in 1969 in Hyde Park, London.

'I'm still an underground performer.'\n\nMayall had a Grammy nomination for Wake Up Call which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins.

It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nAlthough Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for Wake Up Call which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album The Sun Is Shining Down and was made an OBE in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nBorn on November 29, 1933, in Macclesfield, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favourite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album Blues Alone.\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 he aimed to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands.\n\nMayall's 1968 album Blues from Laurel Canyon signalled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall a low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

In their message, they said: \"It is with heavy hearts that we bear the news that John Mayall passed away peacefully in his California home yesterday, July 22, 2024, surrounded by loving family. Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world 's greatest road warriors.\n\n\"John Mayall gave us ninety years of tireless efforts to educate, inspire and entertain.\" The musician helped to train the ground for music giants including Eric Clapton and Mick Fleetwood. Mayall is credited with helping to develop the English take on Chicago-style rhythm and blues from the late 1960s.\n\nHe was born in Macclesfield and relocated to London in the early 1960s. Mayall launched the Blues Breakers in 1963 as he pioneered the British blues and rock scene. Throughout the decade, the group would include many soon-to-be rock royalty from Eric Clapton, Peter Green, Jack Bruce, John McVie, Mick Fleetwood, Aynsley Dunbar and future Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor.\n\nIn the 1970s, Mayall returned to the US where he continued to work with rising talents. As he experiemented with jazz, funk and rock, he worked with the likes of Paul Butterfield, Patti Smith, Canned Heat's Larry Taylor and Harvey Mandel, Jesse Ed Davis, Rick Vito and Freebo.\n\nMayall released and recorded well over 30 albums over his career. This included being a member of the band as well as a solo artist. His last recording was The Sun Is Shining Down in 2022. He continued to perform into his late 80s and never reached the same level of fame as some of his alumni.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\" Mayall's father also played the guitar and banjo and he once said: \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favourite pub was.\"\n\nIn 2005, Mayall was awarded an OBE and was due to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this October. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nTributes have poured in for the musician following his death. Bluesbreakers bandmate Walter Trout wrote: \"He is and will always be my musical mentor, my greatest supporter, and an incredible talent. We just lost a giant. I loved him like a father, and I always will.\" One fan shared: \"John Mayall has left the building.\n\n\"He was ground zero for so many other bands: Cream, early Fleetwood Mac, Mick Taylor era Stones, and more. He was much more than just a blues guy - he performed fabulous jazz and folk music too - his catalog of albums is remarkably rich and deep.\" Another added: \"John Mayall, the godfather of British blues, has died at age 90. He was a monumental force in music with his innovative sound and legendary lineup of musicians like Eric Clapton, Peter Green, Mick Taylor, and Jack Bruce shaping blues history and inspired countless more artists.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"},

He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s.

It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" signaled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.\n\nPhotos: Notable deaths in 2024 Chita Rivera Carl Weathers Wayne Kramer Ian Lavender Toby Keith Henry Fambrough Bob Edwards Don Gullett Lefty Driesell Andreas Brehme Golden Richards Richard Lewis Nikolai Ryzhkov Brian Mulroney Akira Toriyama Iris Apfel Andy Russell Ed Ott Chris Mortensen Steve Lawrence Naomi Barber King Paul Alexander Thomas P.

It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" signaled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.\n\nPhotos: Notable deaths in 2024 Glynis Johns Adan Canto Bud Harrelson Dejan Milojevic Jack Burke Mary Weiss Norman Jewison Charles Osgood Melanie Safka Chita Rivera Carl Weathers Wayne Kramer Ian Lavender Toby Keith Henry Fambrough Bob Edwards Don Gullett Lefty Driesell Andreas Brehme Golden Richards Richard Lewis Brian Mulroney Iris Apfel Andy Russell Ed Ott Chris Mortensen Paul Alexander Thomas P.

He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician.

He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice.

He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" signaled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.\n\nPhotos: Notable deaths in 2024 Glynis Johns Adan Canto Bud Harrelson Dejan Milojevic Jack Burke Mary Weiss Norman Jewison Charles Osgood Melanie Safka Chita Rivera Carl Weathers Wayne Kramer Ian Lavender Toby Keith Henry Fambrough Bob Edwards Don Gullett Lefty Driesell Andreas Brehme Golden Richards Richard Lewis Brian Mulroney Iris Apfel Andy Russell Ed Ott Chris Mortensen Paul Alexander Thomas P.

He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" signaled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.\n\nPhotos: Notable deaths in 2024 Glynis Johns Adan Canto Bud Harrelson Dejan Milojevic Jack Burke Mary Weiss Norman Jewison Charles Osgood Melanie Safka Chita Rivera Carl Weathers Wayne Kramer Ian Lavender Toby Keith Henry Fambrough Bob Edwards Don Gullett Lefty Driesell Andreas Brehme Golden Richards Richard Lewis Brian Mulroney Iris Apfel Andy Russell Ed Ott Chris Mortensen Paul Alexander Thomas P.

It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" signaled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.\n\nPhotos: Notable deaths in 2024 Glynis Johns Adan Canto Bud Harrelson Dejan Milojevic Jack Burke Mary Weiss Norman Jewison Charles Osgood Melanie Safka Chita Rivera Carl Weathers Wayne Kramer Ian Lavender Toby Keith Henry Fambrough Bob Edwards Don Gullett Lefty Driesell Andreas Brehme Golden Richards Richard Lewis Brian Mulroney Iris Apfel Andy Russell Ed Ott Chris Mortensen Paul Alexander Thomas P.

At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nPeople are also reading...

He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" signaled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.\n\nPhotos: Notable deaths in 2024 Glynis Johns Adan Canto Bud Harrelson Dejan Milojevic Jack Burke Mary Weiss Norman Jewison Charles Osgood Melanie Safka Chita Rivera Carl Weathers Wayne Kramer Ian Lavender Toby Keith Henry Fambrough Bob Edwards Don Gullett Lefty Driesell Andreas Brehme Golden Richards Richard Lewis Nikolai Ryzhkov Brian Mulroney Akira Toriyama Iris Apfel Andy Russell Ed Ott Chris Mortensen Steve Lawrence Naomi Barber King Paul Alexander Thomas P.

He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" signaled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" signaled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.\n\nPhotos: Notable deaths in 2024 Glynis Johns Adan Canto Bud Harrelson Dejan Milojevic Jack Burke Mary Weiss Norman Jewison Charles Osgood Melanie Safka Chita Rivera Carl Weathers Wayne Kramer Ian Lavender Toby Keith Henry Fambrough Bob Edwards Don Gullett Lefty Driesell Andreas Brehme Golden Richards Richard Lewis Brian Mulroney Iris Apfel Andy Russell Ed Ott Chris Mortensen Paul Alexander Thomas P.

Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" signaled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.\n\nPhotos: Notable deaths in 2024 Glynis Johns Adan Canto Bud Harrelson Dejan Milojevic Jack Burke Mary Weiss Norman Jewison Charles Osgood Melanie Safka Chita Rivera Carl Weathers Wayne Kramer Ian Lavender Toby Keith Henry Fambrough Bob Edwards Don Gullett Lefty Driesell Andreas Brehme Golden Richards Richard Lewis Nikolai Ryzhkov Brian Mulroney Akira Toriyama Iris Apfel Andy Russell Ed Ott Chris Mortensen Steve Lawrence Naomi Barber King Paul Alexander Thomas P.

He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately.

He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" signaled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.\n\nPhotos: Notable deaths in 2024 Chita Rivera Carl Weathers Wayne Kramer Ian Lavender Toby Keith Henry Fambrough Bob Edwards Don Gullett Lefty Driesell Andreas Brehme Golden Richards Richard Lewis Brian Mulroney Iris Apfel Andy Russell Ed Ott Chris Mortensen Paul Alexander Thomas P.

At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nMr. Mayall protested in interviews that he was not a talent scout, but played for the love of the music he had first heard on his father's 78-rpm records.\n\n\"I'm a band leader and I know what I want to play in my band -- who can be good friends of mine,\" Mr. Mayall said in an interview with the Southern Vermont Review. \"It's definitely a family. It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mr. Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mr. Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor, and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMr. Mayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMr. Mayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933, in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mr. Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMr. Mayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mr. Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nMr. Mayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mr. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined the Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMr. Mayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mr. Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMr. Mayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mr. Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMr. Mayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude that Mr. Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMr. Mayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" signaled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mr. Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mr. Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mr. Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mr. Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" he said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mr. Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news",

Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" signaled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.\n\nPhotos: Notable deaths in 2024 Glynis Johns Adan Canto Bud Harrelson Dejan Milojevic Jack Burke Mary Weiss Norman Jewison Charles Osgood Melanie Safka Chita Rivera Carl Weathers Wayne Kramer Ian Lavender Toby Keith Henry Fambrough Bob Edwards Don Gullett Lefty Driesell Andreas Brehme Golden Richards Richard Lewis Nikolai Ryzhkov Brian Mulroney Akira Toriyama Iris Apfel Andy Russell Ed Ott Chris Mortensen Steve Lawrence Naomi Barber King Paul Alexander Thomas P.

The legendary musician died \"peacefully in his California home\" on Monday, July 22, \"surrounded by loving family.\"\n\nA statement posted to Mayall's website read:\n\n\"It is with heavy hearts that we bear the news that John Mayall passed away peacefully in his California home yesterday, July 22, 2024, surrounded by loving family. Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors. John Mayall gave us ninety years of tireless efforts to educate, inspire and entertain.\"\n\nBorn on November 29, 1933, in Macclesfield, England, Mayall was motivated by his father's record collection and developed a deep love for music from a young age. He taught himself to play piano, guitar and harmonica, driven by blues pioneers like Leadbelly and the boogie-woogie of Albert Ammons and Pete Johnson.\n\nIn the 1960s, Mayall formed the influential John Mayall & The Bluesbreakers. The band served as a proving ground for some of the most notable British blues and rock musicians of the era, including Eric Clapton, Peter Green, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Mick Taylor, Jack Bruce, Aynsley Dunbar and many others.\n\nMayall had over 60 albums credited to his name, blending traditional blues with elements of rock and jazz. His soulful vocals, combined with his virtuosity on multiple instruments, earned him critical acclaim and a dedicated fanbase. His music and mentorship influenced countless musicians and helped shape the sound of British blues and rock.\n\nMayall's landmark 1966 album Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton showcased Clapton's impressively skillful musicianship, establishing Mayall as a central figure in the British blues scene. Mayall's signature approach to the blues can be heard on the 1969 live album, The Turning Point, which featured the hit \"Room To Move.\"\n\nThroughout the 1970s and beyond, Mayall continued to experiment and evolve, continuing to blend jazz, rock, and blues in innovative ways. He collaborated with musicians like Blue Mitchell, Red Holloway and Harvey Mandel, leading to the reformation of The Bluesbreakers in the 1980s with guitarists Coco Montoya and Walter Trout revitalized his career, leading to well-received albums like Behind The Iron Curtain and Wake Up Call.\n\nIn 2008, Mayall officially retired The Bluesbreakers name. The following year saw the establishment of a new group with Mayall backed by guitarist Rocky Athas, bassist Greg Rzab and drummer Jay Davenport. This lineup performed live regularly over numerous years and recorded several albums together.\n\nIn 2013, Mayall signed with Forty Below Records and experienced a late-career resurgence, releasing several albums for the label. Mayall's final studio album was 2022's The Sun Is Shining Down. The archival live album, John Mayall's Bluesbreakers Live In 1967 Vol 3 featuring the original members of Fleetwood Mac - Peter Green, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, was issued last fall.\n\nMayall's contributions to music were recognized with many honors and awards, including induction into the Blues Hall Of Fame and the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. In 2005, Mayall was was honored by the British government with appointment as Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). He continued to perform and record well into his later years, until recent health issues forced Mayall to cease his \"epic road dog days.\"\n\nAccording to Mayall's website:", "source": {"uri":

He was a great pioneer of British blues and had a wonderful eye for talented young musicians, including Mick Taylor - who he recommended to me after Brian Jones died - ushering in a new era for the Stones.\"\n\nIn 1963 Mayall's band the Bluesbreakers, formerly the Blues Syndicate, started performing regularly at London's Marquee Club.\n\nHis first album, John Mayall plays Mayall, was recorded live at West Hampstead R&B Club.\n\nWhile that first recording was not a commercial success. Mayall added Eric Clapton to his band after Clapton left the Yardbirds, releasing the 1966 album Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton.\n\nMayall is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and his Bluesbreakers band over the years included not only Clapton but also their Stones' Mick Taylor and several members of the future Fleetwood Mac, including John McVie and Mick Fleetwood.\n\nMayall's Instagram account statement added, \"It is with heavy hearts that we bear the news that John Mayall passed away peacefully in his California home... surrounded by his loving family.\"\n\nAfter the Bluesbreakers formed in 1963, the band charted nearly 20 albums from 1968-75.\n\nAmong the band's biggest sellers was 1969's The Turning Point that went gold peaking on the charts at No. 32. The band's best-selling U.S. album was 1970's USA Union that reached No. 22.\n\nMayall was known as \"the Godfather of British Blues.\" Born in 1933, Mayall played guitar, piano and harmonica in his youth.\n\nHe studied graphic design at Manchester Art School, moved to London and formed the Bluesbreakers while in his early thirties.\n\nIn comments to The Guardian in 2014, Mayall said, \"The blues fitted in with the early '60s, the social way of life at the time. It happened here, rather than in America, because at the time, the scene in America was racially segregated-over there, never the twain would meet.\"\n\nMayall formed the Bluesbreakers with McVie, Peter Ward and others after moving to London in 1963.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II made him an OBE, Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 2005.

It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" signaled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

blues musician John Mayall - whose influential band the Bluesbreakers was a springboard for stars including Eric Clapton - has died aged 90.\n\nThe songwriter died at his home in California on Monday surrounded by his family, a statement on his Instagram page said.\n\n\"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" it said.\n\n\"John Mayall gave us 90 years of tireless efforts to educate, inspire and entertain,\" the statement added.\n\nMayall, who was born in Macclesfield and grew up in Manchester, founded the Bluesbreakers in the 1960s.\n\nHe was credited with helping to develop a blues revival among white musicians in England - and has been described as the \"godfather of British blues\".\n\nMayall told the Guardian in 2014 that \"at the time, the scene in America was racially segregated\" - but in Europe and England \"the black blues began to be heard by an audience that was not listening to them in America\".\n\nAfter their 1966 album featuring guitarist Clapton, the Bluesbreakers were acclaimed by music critics as one of the world's most influential blues bands.\n\nThe group also became a training ground for other famous rock musicians including Fleetwood Mac's Peter Green, John McVie and Mick Fleetwood, as well as Mick Taylor of the Rolling Stones - cementing Mayall's reputation as a \"serious talent magnet\".\n\nHe told the Guardian he \"managed to pick out some pretty special people\", choosing band members based on the specific sound he was after.\n\nMayall moved to Los Angeles in 1969 and continued to lead bands, release dozens of albums and tour throughout the US and Europe, according to his biography on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nHe was made an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nMayall is survived by his six children, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, the family statement said.\n\n\"He is also surrounded with love by his previous wives, Pamela and Maggie, his devoted secretary, Jane, and his close friends,\" it added.\n\n\"We, the Mayall family, cannot thank his fans and long-list of bandmembers enough for the support and love we were blessed to experience secondhand over the last six decades.\"", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"},

Mayall's family announced the news on his official social media accounts, stating that the musician died in his California home on Monday, July 22, \"surrounded by loving family.\" The statement cited unspecified health issues, but did not reveal an exact cause of death. John Mayall was 90 years old.\n\nDubbed \"the Godfather of British Blues,\" John Mayall was a nurturing figure to a slew of musicians at the start of their careers. Mayall formed the Bluesbreakers in the early 1960s after moving to London, and the band's shifting lineup included a post-Yardbirds, pre-Cream Eric Clapton, who recorded with Mayall on the highly influential 1966 LP Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton. When Clapton left to start Cream, he was replaced by eventual Fleetwood Mac guitarist Peter Green and Mick Taylor, who was ultimately snatched up by the Rolling Stones.\n\nBorn in 1933 in Macclesfield, England, Mayall learned guitar, piano, and harmonica while growing up. He also spent time poring through his father's record collection, which included jazz and blues 78s by the likes of Big Bill Broonzy, Leadbelly, and Brownie McGhee. After studying graphic design at Manchester Art School and serving in Korea, Mayall worked in advertising agencies before shifting focus to music full-time.\n\nMayall moved to London and formed the Bluesbreakers in his early thirties, playing regularly around his new city. The Bluesbreakers ultimately caught attention from Decca, and the label offered Mayall a contract in 1964. Mayall released his debut album with the Bluesbreakers, John Mayall Plays John Mayall, in 1965. One year later, Clapton replaced the band's guitarist Roger Dean.\n\nMayall was a central figure in the narrative of young white British rockers who were fascinated with Black blues musicians from the Mississippi Delta. \"The blues fitted in with the early '60s, the social way of life at the time,\" Mayall told The Guardian in 2014. \"It happened here, rather than in America, because at the time, the scene in America was racially segregated -- over there, never the twain would meet.\"\n\nMayall's output during the 1960s and 1970s was dense, and the prolific artist continued at this pace for decades. In 2013, Mayall experienced a late-career renaissance when he signed to Forty Below Records, releasing a number of studio albums before his death. It was during this fruitful period that Mayall was inducted into Blues Hall of Fame (in 2016).\n\nMayall retired from touring in 2022, but continued releasing records up until last year, with the third installment of his Live in 1967 series, which features Peter Green, Mick Fleetwood, and John McVie.", "source": {"uri": "pitchfork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pitchfork"}, "authors":

He also introduced Mayall to key contacts on the London club scene and helped him to find gigs.\n\nIn 1963 Mayall's band, now renamed the Bluesbreakers, began regular performances at the Marquee Club, a venue that would prove the springboard for many famous bands including the Rolling Stones and the Who.\n\nA canny businessman, Mayall would often stand outside the venue counting audience numbers to ensure he received a fair share of the ticket money.\n\nMayall was already showing himself expert at spotting talented musicians and his line-up featured John McVie on bass, who would later help form Fleetwood Mac.\n\nHis debut album, John Mayall plays John Mayall, was released in 1965, a live set recorded at a West Hampstead R&B club. The album was not a success and his short-term contract with Decca expired.\n\nAt the same time he recruited Eric Clapton, who had just quit the Yardbirds over their decision to abandon the blues for a more commercial style.\n\nThe presence of Clapton, already an acknowledged star, raised the profile of Mayall's band.\n\nHowever, the frequent arrival and departure of musicians began to dog the Bluesbreakers.\n\nClapton made an unannounced three-month trip to Greece in August 1965, leaving Mayall with the problem of finding a new guitarist.\n\nHis troubles multiplied in October when bassist John McVie was fired, because of his heavy drinking; he was replaced by Jack Bruce.\n\nMayall finally found a guitarist in Peter Green, who spent just three days as a Bluesbreaker before Eric Clapton returned and Green was summarily dismissed.\n\nAt the same time Jack Bruce walked out after a row over his wages and Mayall was forced to rehire John McVie.\n\nIn March 1966, Decca was persuaded to re-sign the Bluesbreakers and they recorded what would be Mayall's first studio album.\n\nDetermined to cash in on the popularity of his talented guitarist, the album was entitled, Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton.\n\nFans would later dub it The Beano Album because of the comic Clapton is shown reading on the record cover.\n\nThe album was well received, reaching sixth place in the charts and providing Mayall with the commercial breakthrough that had previously eluded him.\n\nThe album was still riding high when Clapton announced he was quitting to form Cream with Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker.\n\nMayall persuaded an initially reluctant Peter Green to rejoin the band and he featured as the guitarist on Mayall's next album, Hard Road, released in 1967.\n\nIt was to be Green's only appearance on a Bluesbreakers album, the cover of which featured a painting of the band done by Mayall himself.\n\nThe band's line-up continued to change as musicians left for other projects and Mayall discovered new talent.\n\nMick Fleetwood, Aynsley Dunbar, Mick Taylor and Keef Hartley were just some of the names that passed through the band during 1967 although many had quit by the time Mayall released a solo album, The Blues Alone\n\nEric Clapton once commented: \"John Mayall has actually run an incredibly great school for musicians.\"\n\nA strict disciplinarian, Mayall ruthlessly fired band members who he felt were not up to his exacting standards.\n\nIn 1968 the band began a US tour which featured a gig at the legendary Fillmore West in San Francisco alongside Jimi Hendrix.\n\nFollowing the release of Blues from Laurel Canyon in April 1969, Mayall dropped the Bluesbreakers name and his new line-up experimented with playing without drums.\n\nThe acoustic album, The Turning Point, recorded at the Fillmore East in New York by the new line-up, earned Mayall's only gold disc.\n\nThe seventies saw Mayall move to live in the United States, and form a series of bands with American musicians.\n\nHe moved away from the electric blues that had made his name, and began experimenting with funk, pop and jazz.\n\nHe continued to tour in the UK, however, often backing US blues legends such as John Lee Hooker and Sonny Boy Williamson.\n\nIn 1979 a fire destroyed his home in Laurel Canyon and he lost his master recordings, his diaries and much of his career memorabilia.\n\nThe influence of the blues had declined in the UK but, by 1982, Mayall decided the time was right to re-form the Bluesbreakers.\n\nJohn McVie and Mick Taylor rejoined their old boss for a short time and the enthusiastic reception received by the band encouraged Mayall to put together a more permanent line-up.\n\nMayall continued to tour and record throughout the 1990s and the arrival of Texas guitarist Buddy Whittington in 1993 added a new dimension to the band's sound.\n\nIn 2003 Mayall celebrated his 70th birthday with a concert in Liverpool that featured some of his former musicians including Eric Clapton and Mick Taylor.\n\nIn a career spanning seven decades, John Mayall released more than 50 albums and included some of the foremost musicians of the day in a bewildering series of line-ups.\n\nHe never achieved huge commercial success in his own right but his dedication to keeping the blues alive was a major influence on the rock explosion of the 60s and 70s.\n\nMayall was credited with helping to develop a blues revival among white musicians in England - and has been described as the \"godfather of British blues\".\n\nMayall told the Guardian in 2014 that \"at the time, the scene in America was racially segregated\" - but in Europe and England \"the black blues began to be heard by an audience that was not listening to them in America\".\n\nAfter their 1966 album featuring guitarist Clapton, the Bluesbreakers were acclaimed by music critics as one of the world's most influential blues bands.\n\nHe told the Guardian he \"managed to pick out some pretty special people\", choosing band members based on the specific sound he was after.\n\nHe was made an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nMayall is survived by his six children, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, the family statement said.\n\n\"He is also surrounded with love by his previous wives, Pamela and Maggie, his devoted secretary, Jane, and his close friends,\" it added.\n\n\"We, the Mayall family, cannot thank his fans and long-list of bandmembers enough for the support and love we were blessed to experience secondhand over the last six decades.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall", "type": "person", "score": 5,

He was 90.\n\nThe blues musician died at his California home Monday, July 22 \"surrounded by his loving family,\" according to a post from the late singer's Instagram.\n\n\"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post reads. \"Mayall gave us ninety years of tireless efforts to educate, inspire and entertain.\"\n\nMayall, who was among this year's inductees for the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, was born on Nov. 29, 1933. He grew up in a village not too far from Manchester, England, the musician's biography states.\n\nIn the 1960s, Mayall formed his band called John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, sometimes referred to as the Blues Breakers.\n\nThe band featured some of the most famous blues/rock musicians like Eric Clapton, Peter Green, John McVie, Mick Fleetwood, Harvey Mandel, Larry Taylor and Mick Taylor.\n\nMayall is credited with developing an English twist on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s, the Associated Press reported. His 1966 album \"Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums of all time.\n\nMayall also had success in the United States with the 1969 singles \"Room to Move\" and \"Don't Waste My Time.\" The latter peaked at No. 81 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nA singer, guitarist, harmonica player and keyboardist, Mayall remained an active musician until his death, releasing his last studio album \"The Sun Is Shining Down\" in 2022.\n\nThe album earned Mayall a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional Blues Album at 65th annual Grammy Awards. This was his second Grammy nomination overall.\n\nMayall also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nThe musician leaves behind his six children, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, the Instagram post states.\n\n\"We, the Mayall family, cannot thank his fans and long-list of bandmembers enough for the support and love we were blessed to experience secondhand over the last six decades,\" the post concludes.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [],

blues icon", "body": "TRIBUTES have poured in following the death of a Cheshire-born music legend.\n\nJohn Mayall, known as 'the godfather of British blues', has died aged 90.\n\nHe was perhaps best known for his influential band, the Bluesbreakers, which was a training ground for superstars such as Eric Clapton and Mick Fleetwood.\n\nA statement shared on his Instagram announced Mayall died on Monday (July 22) at his home in California, surrounded by his family.\n\n\"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" read the post.\n\n\"John Mayall gave us ninety years of tireless efforts to educate, inspire and entertain.\"\n\nFollowing the announcement, tributes have been paid from across the music world.\n\nRolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger said: \"So sad to hear of John Mayall's passing.\n\n\"He was a great pioneer of British blues and had a wonderful eye for talented young musicians, including Mick Taylor - who he recommended to me after Brian Jones died - ushering in a new era for the Stones.\"\n\nSteve Hackett, lead guitarist of Genesis, said: \"I'm very sad to hear about the death of John Mayall.\n\n\"He was a true champion of the blues.\n\n\"He remains a huge inspiration to me and a legion of other musicians.\"\n\nMayall was born on November 29, 1933, in Macclesfield.\n\nHe once said: \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favourite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nWhile piano was his main instrument, he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers first formed in 1963 and over the years helped launch the careers of several musical icons, including Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played for five years with the Rolling Stones; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nAlthough Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was nominated for a Grammy for Wake Up Call which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins.\n\nHe received a second nomination in 2022 for his album The Sun Is Shining Down and was made an OBE in 2005.\n\nMayall was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame class of 2024 and was due to be inducted later this year.\n\n\"2024 Inductee John Mayall was the godfather of British blues,\" read a tribute from the awards.\n\n\"As a singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and bandleader, Mayall displayed a talent for mentoring gifted young musicians, many of whom he recruited for his groundbreaking band the Bluesbreakers.\n\n\"With a rugged individuality and distinctive voice and style, he made visionary recordings that expanded the reach of the blues without ever watering them down.\n\n\"Mayall exerted a major influence on rock and roll, inspiring countless musicians and fans with a lifetime's worth of unforgettable and influential music.\"", "source": {"uri": "northwichguardian.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Northwich Guardian - Beta site"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In November 1965 Clapton returned, and Green departed.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers has been considered a training ground for other major musicians including John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac, Mick Taylor who played with the Rolling Stones, Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nMayall protested in interviews that he was not a talent scout, but played for the love of the music he had first heard on his father's 78-rpm records.\n\nAlthough he admitted in an interview with The Guardian that he had 'managed to pick out some pretty special people'.\n\n'I'm a band leader and I know what I want to play in my band - who can be good friends of mine,' Mayall said in an interview with the Southern Vermont Review. 'It's definitely a family. It's a small kind of thing really.'\n\nAlthough Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s.\n\n'I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,' he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. 'I'm still an underground performer.'\n\nAlthough Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s. He is pictured on stage during the 42nd Montreux Jazz Festival in Montreux\n\nMayall performing with the Bluesbreakers at the Deutsche Museum in Munich, West Germany, on January 21, 1970\n\nMayall's father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall once said: 'The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favourite pub was.'\n\nHe learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right -- so 'I wouldn't get all tangled up'.\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice.\n\nAided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album Blues Alone.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands.\n\nMayall's 1968 album Blues from Laurel Canyon signalled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall a low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again.\n\nMayall pictured during a concert in Milan in 2015\n\nMayall performing with his band the Bluesbreakers in Munich in 1969. The influential band was a training ground for Eric Clapton, Mick Fleetwood and many other superstars\n\nIn 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall had a Grammy nomination for Wake Up Call which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He also received a second nomination in 2022 for his album The Sun Is Shining Down.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nHe was made an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe is survived by his six children - Gaz, Jason, Red, Ben, Zak and Samson - seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

That's the nice thing about the blues is you can tell your stories through words and music. You know, there's never any shortage of things that happen to a person. And you can put those experiences into music.\"\n\nThe death was confirmed in a statement on Mr. Mayall's official Facebook page that read, \"It is with heavy hearts that we bear the news that John Mayall passed away peacefully in his California home yesterday, July 22, 2024, surrounded by loving family. Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors. John Mayall gave us ninety years of tireless efforts to educate, inspire and entertain.\"\n\nBorn in Cheshire, England, Mayall developed an early penchant for American jazz and blues, teaching himself to play the piano, guitar, and harmonica. His friend Alexis Korner talked him into moving to London where he formed the Bluesbreakers. When Eric Clapton left the Yardbirds in 1965, Mayall jumped at the chance to hire him. The band's debut album, Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton, known as The Beano Album to aficionados, soon became a bestseller. After Clapton left the band to form Cream with bassist Jack Bruce, Mayall recruited Peter Green. When Green later left with McVie and Fleetwood to form the first incarnation of Fleetwood Mac, Mayall brought in Mick Taylor, who remained in the Bluesbreakers for about a year before joining the Rolling Stones.\n\nIn 1967, during his initial U.S. tour, Mr. Mayall found himself captivated by California. Two years later, he relocated to the Laurel Canyon area of Los Angeles, which was then burgeoning with a vibrant music scene. Transitioning away from the Bluesbreakers moniker, he released Blues From Laurel Canyon in 1968, despite having recorded it in England. This album marked a departure from his previous work.\n\nThe Turning Point, released in 1969, represented a significant shift in Mr. Mayall's musical direction. It was a live album that pioneered the \"unplugged\" concept within the rock genre by eschewing amplified instruments. Instead, the album featured acoustic guitars, bass, and saxophones, omitting drums entirely. One of the standout tracks was \"Room to Move,\" a lively shuffle tune that quickly became one of Mr. Mayall's most renowned compositions. This track showcased his ability to adapt and innovate within the evolving landscape of blues and rock music during that era.\n\nIn the 1980s, John Mayall underwent a significant personal transformation by quitting drinking. This period also saw him revive the Bluesbreakers, occasionally reuniting with notable musicians like Eric Clapton, Mick Taylor, and John McVie for concerts. Over the years, he collaborated with several standout guitarists including Harvey Mandel, Coco Montoya, and Walter Trout, all of whom contributed to the evolving sound of his groups.\n\nIn 2008, Mayall made the decision to retire the Bluesbreakers name, but this did not slow down his musical career. He continued to tour extensively and collaborated with prominent American blues artists such as Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, and Albert Collins. Critics continued to acclaim his work, with several of his later albums receiving high praise.\n\nOne notable album from this later period is Talk About That, released in 2016, which featured guitarist Joe Walsh. This album was particularly well-received, with many critics considering it among the best efforts of Mayall's extensive career. Throughout these decades, John Mayall's dedication to the blues genre and his ability to adapt and collaborate with a diverse range of musicians ensured his continued influence and relevance in the music world.\n\nMayall won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005. He was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class, along with Alexis Korner and Big Mama Thornton.", "source": {"uri": "americanbluesscene.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Blues

Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors. John Mayall gave us ninety years of tireless efforts to educate, inspire and entertain.\"\n\nOften heralded as 'The Godfather of British Blues', Mayall was a singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist with a love of American blues and jazz and a keen sense for spotting young talent, often giving them a platform through his band the Blues Breakers.\n\nBorn in America, Mayall relocated to London in the early '60s and launched the Blues Breakers - then stylised as Bluesbreakers - in 1963, through which he pioneered the British blues and rock scene.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the group would include a revolving door of rock royalty - many of whom would go on to become icons in their own rights - such as Eric Clapton, Peter Green, Jack Bruce, John McVie, Mick Fleetwood, Aynsley Dunbar and future Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Mayall returned to America, where he would continue working with rising talents. Experimenting with elements of jazz, funk and rock into his blues sound, he had collaborated with the likes of Paul Butterfield, Patti Smith, Canned Heat's Larry Taylor and Harvey Mandel, Jesse Ed Davis, Rick Vito, Freebo, and more.\n\nIn 2005, Mayall was appointed as an OBE (Officer of the British Empire). He was due to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame at its ceremony in Cleveland this October.\n\nOver the course of his illustrious and lengthy career, Mayall recorded and released well over 30 albums - both as the member of a band, and as a solo artist - with his last recording coming in the form of 2022's 'The Sun Is Shining Down'.\n\nFollowing the news of his death, several musicians have paid tribute to John Mayall.\n\nMayall's Bluesbreakers bandmate Walter Trout wrote on Facebook: \"He is and will always be my musical mentor, my greatest supporter, and an incredible talent. We just lost a giant. I loved him like a father, and I always will.\"", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music News, Reviews, Videos, Galleries, Tickets and Blogs | NME.COM"}, "authors":

He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nMayall protested in interviews that he was not a talent scout, but played for the love of the music he had first heard on his father's 78-rpm records.\n\n\"I'm a band leader and I know what I want to play in my band -- who can be good friends of mine,\" Mayall said in an interview with the Southern Vermont Review. \"It's definitely a family. It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.", "source": {"uri":

He was a great pioneer of British blues and had a wonderful eye for talented young musicians, including Mick Taylor - who he recommended to me after Brian Jones died - ushering in a new era for the Stones.\"\n\nIn 1963 Mayall's band the Bluesbreakers, formerly the Blues Syndicate, started performing regularly at London's Marquee Club.\n\nHis first album, John Mayall plays Mayall, was recorded live at West Hampstead R&B Club.\n\nWhile that first recording was not a commercial success. Mayall added Eric Clapton to his band after Clapton left the Yardbirds, releasing the 1966 album Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton.\n\nMayall is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and his Bluesbreakers band over the years included not only Clapton but also their Stones' Mick Taylor and several members of the future Fleetwood Mac, including John McVie and Mick Fleetwood.\n\nMayall's Instagram account statement added, \"It is with heavy hearts that we bear the news that John Mayall passed away peacefully in his California home... surrounded by his loving family.\"\n\nAfter the Bluesbreakers formed in 1963, the band charted nearly 20 albums from 1968-75.\n\nAmong the band's biggest sellers was 1969's The Turning Point that went gold peaking on the charts at No. 32. The band's best-selling U.S. album was 1970's USA Union that reached No. 22.\n\nMayall was known as \"the Godfather of British Blues.\" Born in 1933, Mayall played guitar, piano and harmonica in his youth.\n\nHe studied graphic design at Manchester Art School, moved to London and formed the Bluesbreakers while in his early thirties.\n\nIn comments to The Guardian in 2014, Mayall said, \"The blues fitted in with the early '60s, the social way of life at the time. It happened here, rather than in America, because at the time, the scene in America was racially segregated-over there, never the twain would meet.\"\n\nMayall formed the Bluesbreakers with McVie, Peter Ward and others after moving to London in 1963.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II made him an OBE, Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 2005. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2016 and joined the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "upi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPI"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

We love you,\" the statement added.\n\nBorn November 29, 1933, in Cheshire, England, Mayall is credited with being one of the most influential rock musicians of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nA vocalist and songwriter who also played guitar, keyboards and harmonica, Mayall was the frontman for English blues rock band John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, which formed in London in 1963. The Bluesbreakers included and helped launched the careers of legendary musicians such as Eric Clapton, Mick Fleetwood, Peter Green, John McVie and Mick Taylor.\n\nMayall's final performance was March 26, 2022, at the Couch House in San Juan Capistrano, California.\n\nEarlier this year, Mayall was announced as a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Class of 2024, which will hold its induction ceremony in October in Cleveland. Mayall will posthumously receive the Music Influence Award alongside fellow British blues legend Alexis Korner and American blues-rock pioneer Big Mama Thornton.\n\nMayall is survived by his six children, Gaz, Jason, Red, Ben, Zak and Samson; seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. He is also \"surrounded with love\" by his previous wives, Maggie and Pamela, as well as his devoted secretary, Jane, and his close friends, the Mayall family said.", "source": {"uri":

He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" signaled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He recruited musicians like John McVie, a future Fleetwood Mac member.\n\nThe band debuted in 1964 and was the backing band for the Black American blues singer John Lee Hooker in the same year.\n\nMayall also played with blues legends such as Sonny Boy Williamson and T-Bone Walker, using his band to popularise blues in the UK with both covers and original songs.\n\nIn 1965, Eric Clapton joined the Bluesbreakers after leaving the Yardbirds, with their first sessions produced by a young Jimmy Page.\n\nClapton was briefly replaced by Peter Green, another future Fleetwood Mac star, and Jack Bruce played bass for a time. After Clapton returned, they recorded the hit album Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton in 1966.\n\n\"(Blues) is about - and it's always been about - that raw honesty with which [it expresses] our experiences in life, something which all comes together in this music, in the words as well.

We love you,\" his family wrote.\n\nMayall is credited as being a blues pioneer in England in the late Sixties. His band, The Bluesbreakers, once included the likes of Eric Clapton, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, and Mick Taylor. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is set to induct Mayall in October, after the organization's committee granted him the Musical Influence Award, alongside Alexis Korner and Big Mama Thornton, earlier this year.\n\nMayall was born in Cheshire, England, and loved American blues and jazz from an early age. He taught himself how to play piano, guitar, and harmonica before he moved to London to form the Blues Breakers, which included Clapton after he departed the Yardbirds.\n\nMayall's most-revered body of work was his debut LP, Blues Breakers, which Rolling Stone ranked No. 195 on its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list in 2003. \"Ex-Yardbird Eric Clapton's solos here inspired his 'Clapton Is God' cult,\" read Rolling Stone's description. \"The band expertly covers Robert Johnson and Freddie King, and blows up Ray Charles' 'What'd I Say' with a long drum solo that predicts Cream.\"\n\nMayall released several albums through the Seventies after moving to Los Angeles in 1969. He was appointed Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005 and was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nIn 2020, Mayall released a 1967 recording of the song \"Curly\" alongside the late Peter Green and John McVie. The recording was done for BBC Sessions before Green left the band to form Fleetwood Mac. The track was included in a box set titled The First Generation: 1966-1974, which dropped in 2021.\n\nThat year, Mayall told Rolling Stone, as he turned 88, that he had decided to \"hang up my road shoes,\" though he promised to release another album, The Sun Is Shining Down.\n\nThe obituary post pointed to an interview Mayall did with The Guardian, sharing how he connected with blues because of its \"raw honesty, connection, and community.\" The statement also shared a quote from Mayall about the future of blues that read, \"To be honest, I don't think anyone really knows exactly what it is. I just can't stop playing it.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall", "type":

He remained in the area afterwards.\n\nMayall released more than three dozen albums during his career, remaining faithful to American blues music while showing an ear for talent, utilizing countless support players, many of whom eclipsed the leader with their own bands or as members of other highly successful groups.\n\nFor British blues guitarists of the 1960s, Mayall's band was a kind of finishing school. Introducing Clapton on the 1966 album, \"Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton,\" Mayall allowed his young side man to take center stage, giving birth to a guitar-heavy sound that dominated rock music for the next 20 years.\n\nClapton famously quit Mayall's band without notice after less than a year, replaced by Green, who left the Bluesbreakers shortly afterwards with drummer Fleetwood in tow to form the highly successful Fleetwood Mac, which was founded by Green.\n\nMayall next hired a teenage Taylor to fill the Bluesbreakers' closely watched guitar spot, and four albums later, Mayall's young prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 departed to accept an offer from the Rolling Stones.\n\nIn the many bands he led, Mayall wrote songs, handled vocals, played harmonica, organ and guitar, and often produced his own album artwork. Although he usually remained true to American blues with little deviation, a drummerless jazz-inspired outfit he ran in the 1970s proved to be his most popular group since the days of the big name guitarists to whom he handed the spotlight. Yet he remained a draw in the clubs and at summer festivals around the world until his retirement from touring in 2022 after a final gig at The Coach House in San Juan Capistrano.\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester, in central England. He once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nMayall was appointed as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005. His selection as a recipient of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Musical Influence Award: was announced April 21. The two-time Grammy nominee will be inducted into the hall of fame posthumously Oct. 19.\n\nMayall is survived by two ex-wives, six children, Gaz, Jason, Red, Ben, Zak and Samson, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.", "source": {"uri": "mynewsla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My News LA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall", "type":

Members of the Bluesbreakers eventually went on to join or form groups including Cream, Fleetwood Mac, the Rolling Stones and many more.\n\nAt age 30, Mayall moved to London from northern England in 1963. Sensing revolution in the air, he gave up his profession as a graphic designer to embrace a career in blues, the musical style born in Black America.\n\nHe teamed up with a series of young guitarists including Clapton, Peter Green, later of Fleetwood Mac, and Mick Taylor who helped form the Rolling Stones.\n\nIn the Bluesbreakers' debut album in 1966, \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" John Mayall enthralled music aficionados with a melding of soulful rock and gutsy, guitar-driven American blues featuring covers of tunes by Robert Johnson, Otis Rush and Ray Charles.\n\nThe blues music he was playing in British venues was \"a novelty for white England,\" he told AFP in 1997.\n\nThat album was a hit, catapulting Clapton to stardom and bringing a wave of popularity to a more raw and personal blues music.\n\nMayall moved to California in 1968 and toured America extensively in 1972.\n\nHe recorded a number of landmark albums in the 1960s including \"Crusade,\" \"A Hard Road,\" and \"Blues From Laurel Canyon.\" Dozens more followed in the 1970s and up to his latest, \"The Sun Is Shining Down,\" in 2022.\n\nMayall was awarded an OBE, an Officer of the Order of the British Empire,

Mick Jagger mourned Mayall's passing, calling him a great pioneer of British blues.\n\n\"It is with heavy hearts that we bear the news that John Mayall passed away peacefully in his California home,\" the statement said. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors.\"\n\nJagger's statement on his Instagram account said, \"So sad to hear of John Mayall's passing. He was a great pioneer of British blues and had a wonderful eye for talented young musicians, including Mick Taylor - who he recommended to me after Brian Jones died - ushering in a new era for the Stones.\"\n\nIn 1963 Mayall's band the Bluesbreakers, formerly the Blues Syndicate, started performing regularly at London's Marquee Club.\n\nWhile that first recording was not a commercial success. Mayall added Eric Clapton to his band after Clapton left the Yardbirds, releasing the 1966 album Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton.\n\nMayall is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and his Bluesbreakers band over the years included not only Clapton but also their Stones' Mick Taylor and several members of the future Fleetwood Mac, including John McVie and Mick Fleetwood.\n\nAfter the Bluesbreakers formed in 1963, the band charted nearly 20 albums from 1968-75.\n\nAmong the band's biggest sellers was 1969's The Turning Point that went gold peaking on the charts at No. 32. The band's best-selling U.S. album was 1970's USA Union that reached No. 22.\n\nMayall was known as \"the Godfather of British Blues.\" Born in 1933, Mayall played guitar, piano and harmonica in his youth.\n\nHe studied graphic design at Manchester Art School, moved to London and formed the Bluesbreakers while in his early thirties.\n\nIn comments to The Guardian in 2014, Mayall said, \"The blues fitted in with the early '60s, the social way of life at the time. It happened here, rather than in America, because at the time, the scene in America was racially segregated-over there, never the twain would meet.\"\n\nQueen Elizabeth II made him an OBE, Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 2005.

Mayall passed away at his home in California on Monday, July 22, according to a statement shared to his Instagram page Tuesday night. He was 90.\n\nMayall's cause of death was not disclosed, but the statement said \"health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors.\" It added that the rocker \"gave us ninety years of tireless efforts to educate, inspire and entertain,\" and his \"raw honesty, connection, community and playing of his will continue to affect the music and culture we experience today, and for generations to come.\"\n\nConsidered to be \"the godfather of British blues,\" Mayall is credited with helping develop the English take on Chicago-style rhythm and blues. Born in the town of Macclesfield in Cheshire in November 1933, Mayall was drawn to the sound of the blues musicians from the Mississippi Delta at an early age. He told The Guardian in 2014, \"[It has] always been about that raw honesty with which [it expresses] our experiences in life, something which all comes together in this music, in the words as well. Something that is connected to us, common to our experiences. To be honest, I don't think anyone really knows exactly what it is. I just can't stop playing it.\"\n\nAfter completing a George Formby Teach Yourself Ukulele course and teaching himself to play piano as a teen, per the BBC, Mayall formed the Powerhouse Four in 1956, later going on to join a band called Blues Syndicate in 1962. The band was heavily influenced by Alexis Korner, who eventually persuaded Mayall to move to London, where he founded the Bluesbreakers in 1963. Over the years, the Bluesbreakers' members included Eric Clapton, Peter Green, Jack Bruce, John McVie, Mick Fleetwood, Aynsley Dunbar, and future Rolling Stone Mick Taylor, according to Deadline. The Bluesbreakers was not only a commercial force in the Swinging '60s UK, with five Top 10 LPs from 1966-70, but also a success in the U.S., where the group charted nearly 20 albums from 1968-75, including The Turning Point (1969), which went gold and peaked at No. 32.\n\nIn 1969, Mayall relocated to the U.S., where he continued to front bands, eventually recruiting Taylor and McVie to reform the Bluesbreakers in 1982. In 2008, he announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nThe musician released dozens of albums and scored two Grammy nominations - Best Contemporary Blues Album in 1993 for Wake Up Call, and Best Traditional Blues Album in 2022 for The Sun Is Shining Down. He was named an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005 and inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2016. He was recently announced as a 2024 inductee into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, which said, \"continually expanding the reach of the blues without ever watering them down, John Mayall has had a major influence on rock music. He is the Godfather of British Blues.\"", "source": {"uri": "popculture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebrity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall",

Members of the Bluesbreakers eventually went on to join or form groups including Cream, Fleetwood Mac, the Rolling Stones and many more.\n\nAt age 30, Mayall moved to London from northern England in 1963.

American blues featuring covers of tunes by Robert Johnson, Otis Rush and Ray Charles.\n\nThe blues music he was playing in British venues was \"a novelty for white England,\" he told AFP in 1997.\n\nThat album was a hit, catapulting Clapton to stardom and bringing a wave of popularity to a more raw and personal blues music.\n\nMayall moved to California in 1968 and toured America extensively in 1972.\n\nHe recorded a number of landmark albums in the 1960s including \"Crusade,\" \"A Hard Road,\" and \"Blues From Laurel Canyon.\" Dozens more followed in the 1970s and up to his latest, \"The Sun Is Shining Down,\" in 2022.\n\nMayall was awarded an OBE, an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, in 2005.\n\nmlm/jgc/rsc/mtp", "source": {"uri": "wfxg.com", "dataType":

That career, which started well before Mayall formed his famous Bluesbreakers in 1963, was not defined by blindness so much as by a single-minded, near-messianic vision that the music created by Black artists of the Mississippi Delta and Chicago's South Side possessed beauty, honesty, and strength that transcended race, age, and geography. And so, thanks to Mayall -- along with the like-minded musician Alexis Korner and a growing number of aficionados -- American blues took root in London's coffee bars, the domain of trad jazz. From there it migrated to subterranean clubs packed with sweaty youths, and on to record players and radios in bedsitter flats from Bournemouth to Belfast.\n\nSoon, a generation had its mojo working as the British R&B scene exploded: the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, Them, and much of what came after, including Cream and Fleetwood Mac, two epochal rock bands that Mayall had a hand in creating. The blues-focused vision that Mayall brought to popular music in the 1960s turns out to have been, in retrospect, 20/20.\n\nIn the 21st century, conversations about the British blues boom have focused on these important foundational aspects -- and raised thorny questions regarding cultural appropriation. But there is no doubt that Mayall's adoration of the blues was genuine and uncynical, not to mention daring, vanguard, and subversive -- an important dent in the armor of postwar, stiff-upper-lip, class-divided Britain. As Mayall and other proselytizers brought the work of Otis Rush, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, and Elmore James to ravenous young audiences on the other side of the Atlantic, those blues legends began to find themselves in demand as concert attractions, sought out as musical mentors, and anointed as cultural icons in Europe, America, and, in time, across the globe.\n\nJohn Mayall was born in 1933 and grew up in the town of Cheadle Hulme, outside of Manchester. His parents divorced when he was a boy. The best-known exploit of Mayall's childhood was that he built a treehouse out of window frames and tarps in a sturdy oak behind his mother's house, outfitting it with a bed and paraffin lamp. This, he said, \"became my room, my world.\" (In 1970, he wrote a song about it, \"Home in a Tree.\") His father made a hobby out of jazz guitar and, the young Mayall, at age 12, had likewise begun to play the instrument, along with the piano. By the late 1940s, he had become besotted with jazz, Hoovering up 78 rpm records. And then he stumbled on the blues -- the genre that would transfix him for the rest of his days.\n\nAs a white suburban kid growing up in England after the war, listening to the blues brought Mayall face to face with the genre's outsized personalities and the harsh conditions they often sang about. As Mayall told the Guardian in 2021, \"So-called 'race records' told the story of the vile lynchings and racial injustices in the south that were a black man's reality in the early 20th century. Not many other people I knew were all that interested in this music, but it was something I was really passionate about.\"\n\nIn 1956, Mayall had returned from national service in Korea to attend art college in Manchester, forming his first band, the Powerhouse Four. This was followed by the Blues Syndicate, which traveled to London in 1961, whereupon Mayall met Korner, who encouraged him to move south. Mayall threw himself into the London blues scene, forming his Bluesbreakers and becoming a mainstay at such clubs as the Marquee. If the blues-infused Rolling Stones were on a trajectory of international pop stardom, the Bluesbreakers were musician's musicians, all about integrity -- the spirit of the blues. They were the perfect band for record-collecting blues trainspotters, a group that would never be tainted by huge commercial success: the stuff of the purist, not the tourist.\n\nMayall's Bluesbreakers were a clearinghouse for generational talent. Eric Clapton quit the Yardbirds and joined the band; his playing was featured on its debut LP, released in 1966. When Clapton left, Peter Green, later to found Fleetwood Mac, joined. And when Green left, Mick Taylor, later of the Rolling Stones, joined. Mayall was to British blues guitarists what Leo Castelli was to New York painters; his group was the blue-chip gallery you wanted to show your work in. The bassist Jack Bruce met Clapton in the Bluesbreakers, then went on to found Cream. Other future rock stars who were Mayall alumni: Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, later of Fleetwood Mac, and the well-traveled drummer Aynsley Dunbar. In these Bluesbreakers incarnations, and in many more that would follow, Mayall moved between guitar and keyboards, with spotlight moments to demonstrate his prowess on harmonica. Even so, Mayall's chief talent may have been his uncanny, unselfish capacity for spotting it in others.\n\nIn the late '60s, Mayall expatriated to California, moving into a house in Laurel Canyon that became affectionately known as The Brain Damage Club, based on the kind of personalities and diversions one could find there. The house burned to the ground in the 1979 Kirkwood Bowl-Laurel Canyon Fire, which consumed all of Mayall's archives, along with the trove of vintage erotica his father had amassed. (\"My father was a pornography collector,\" Mayall would unabashedly say. \"A totally irreplaceable collection.\") Throughout the ensuing decades, there were more concerts, tours, collaborations, and albums, as Mayall became invariably known as the Godfather of the British Blues. In 2005, he was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire. A 35-disc boxed set of Mayall's work was released in 2021. Three years later he was inducted, at age 90, into the Rock & Roll Hall of fame. Mayall married twice; he had six children and several grandchildren.\n\nA cornerstone of the Mayall songbook was \"Room to Move,\" powered by his propulsive, almost orgiastic harmonica. But if one song defined him, it was perhaps \"All Your Love,\" a mambo-inflected Chicago blues classic by Otis Rush, which was the Bluesbreakers' calling card and an early showcase for Clapton's fretboard pyrotechnics. (Peter Green recast \"All Your Love\" as \"Black Magic Woman,\" which became a 1968 single for Fleetwood Mac and a subsequent signature for Carlos Santana.)\n\nIn February of 2020, on the eve of the coronavirus pandemic, Mayall, shockingly spry at 86, sang \"All Your Love\" with gusto at the London Palladium as part of an all-star tribute concert organized by Mick Fleetwood to celebrate Green's music. (Green died about five months later.) It would be difficult to conjecture how many times Mayall performed that number and others like it -- typically three-chord, 12-bar blues songs.\n\nWhen a reporter once asked John Mayall about his unwavering fidelity to the blues, the music that took him from a tree house in a Manchester suburb to concert stages around the world, Mayall responded, \"There's nothing else I can play.\"",

The statement did not give a cause or specify where he died, saying only that he died \"in his California home.\"\n\nThough he played piano, organ, guitar and harmonica and sang lead vocals in his own bands with a high, reedy tenor, Mayall earned his reputation as \"the godfather of British blues\" not for his own playing or singing but for recruiting and polishing the talents of one gifted young lead guitarist after another.\n\nIn his most fertile period, between 1965 and 1969, those budding stars included Eric Clapton, who left to form the band Cream and eventually became a hugely successful solo artist; Peter Green, who left to found Fleetwood Mac; and Mick Taylor, who was snatched from the Mayall band by the Rolling Stones.\n\nA more complete list of the alumni of Mayall's band of that era, known as the Bluesbreakers, reads like a Who's Who of British pop royalty. Drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie were also founding members of Fleetwood Mac. Bassist Jack Bruce joined Clapton in Cream. Bassist Andy Fraser was an original member of Free. Aynsley Dunbar would go on to play drums for Frank Zappa, Journey and Jefferson Starship.\n\nIn his book \"Clapton: The Autobiography\" (2007), Clapton described playing in the Bluesbreakers under Mayall's tutelage as a demanding but rewarding kind of musical finishing school. After leaving the Yardbirds and joining the Mayall band in April 1965, \"grateful that someone saw my worth,\" he wrote, he moved into \"a tiny little cupboard room at the top of John's house\" so that he could better soak up all the lessons he wanted Mayall to teach him.\n\n\"With long curly hair and a beard, which gave him a look not unlike Jesus, he had the air of a favourite schoolmaster who still manages to be cool,\" Clapton recalled. \"He had the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen,\" and \"over the better part of a year, when I had any spare time, I would sit in this room listening to records and playing along with them, honing my craft.\"\n\nThe one album that Clapton recorded with Mayall, \"Blues Breakers\" (1966), is often credited with kick-starting the electric blues boom of the 1960s among young Americans and Britons. With songs by Robert Johnson, Otis Rush, Freddie King and Ray Charles, as well as Mayall himself, the album provided a repertoire, arrangements and a thick guitar sound that would be widely copied by hundreds of bands in both countries. In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine ranked \"Blues Breakers\" No. 195 on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\"\n\nJohn Mayall was born in Macclesfield, England, just outside Manchester, on Nov 29, 1933. His father, Murray, who played guitar in local pubs and collected records, and his mother, Beryl, stimulated his interest in music, but he trained as an artist and graphic designer at the Manchester College of Art and, after doing military service in Korea, worked for several years for advertising agencies. (He would later put that experience to use by designing the covers of many of his albums.)\n\nMayall was already 30 when he decided to become a full-time musician and moved to London, where performers like Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies had already carved out a niche for the blues. Financially, it was tough going: Even when he had future stars like Clapton, Green and Taylor in his band, the Bluesbreakers followed a gruelling routine of touring by van and playing short engagements on cramped stages in small clubs, often for audiences of only a few dozen people.\n\nBut after guitarists everywhere took notice of the \"Blues Breakers\" album and its equally influential follow-up, \"A Hard Road\" (1967), featuring Green, Mayall's horizons expanded. He started touring regularly in the United States and Europe: \"The Diary of a Band,\" a two-disc set recorded live in the Netherlands and other locales with Taylor, was released officially, and performances at the Fillmore West and in Germany and Italy eventually circulated in bootleg versions. In 1969, after recording the album \"Blues From Laurel Canyon\" and befriending members of the American blues band Canned Heat, Mayall moved to the Los Angeles area, where he lived for the rest of his life. That led to a fundamental shift in the composition of his bands, with British musicians giving way to Americans.\n\nHis first \"American\" group included Harvey Mandel on guitar and Sugarcane Harris on electric violin. Later units featured guitarists Sonny Landreth, Walter Trout and Coco Montoya, all of whom went on to successful solo careers.\n\nMayall had already begun moving away from what Clapton called his \"textbook blues\" style before coming to the United States, forming the jazzy, drummerless acoustic band that recorded \"The Turning Point\" in 1969. In the 1970s, however, he would go deeper into, as the title of a 1972 album put it, a \"Jazz Blues Fusion,\" working with jazz musicians like trumpeter Blue Mitchell and saxophonists Ernie Watts and Red Holloway.\n\nBut Mayall never abandoned the blues altogether, and in the 1980s he re-formed the Bluesbreakers, with which he would continue to tour and record, with constantly shifting personnel, well into the 21st century. In some editions of the band, he was joined by alumni like Taylor and McVie; Clapton would occasionally play with him as well.\n\nIn all, Mayall released more than 70 albums, the most recent of which was \"The Sun Is Shining Down\" (2022). He also issued several DVDs, including one of a 70th-birthday concert in 2003 at which he was joined by many of his most prominent former sidemen.\n\nHe is survived by his children, Gaz, Jason, Red, Ben, Zak and Samson; seven grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. His two marriages ended in divorce.\n\nIt was announced in April that Mayall, along with his fellow blues artists Alexis Korner and Big Mama Thornton, would receive this year's musical influence awards from the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 1979, a fire destroyed Mayall's house in Los Angeles. Lost in that blaze was most of the record collection that had so impressed Clapton and other blues initiates, which by that time had grown to include thousands of discs, including many rare 45 and 78 rpm blues singles, as well as many of the live tapes Mayall had made of his own bands in the 1960s.\n\nIn 2014, Mayall sat down for an evening-long interview at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles, in which he reminisced about the challenges of being a crusader for the blues in London in the early 1960s. He recalled playing 11 shows a week in \"dens of iniquity\" and having to persuade McVie's parents to let their son, who was underage at the time, join his band.\n\n\"It was extremely exciting,\" he said of those times. \"We all felt we were part of the same family and that we really were connecting with people, a new generation of people, and also having a great time playing. You just continually played; it wasn't worth going home.\"", "source": {"uri": "bangkokpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangkok Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A singer, guitarist and multi-instrumentalist, he formed John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers in 1963, and they would rise to be the undisputed champions of the British blues scene, and provide an incubator for some of the country's most lauded artists. This earned him the nickname 'Godfather of the British blues'.\n\nAmong those who graced the stage with the Bluesbreakers include Eric Clapton, Peter Green, Mick Taylor, Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Aynsley Dunbar and Jack Bruce, to name but a few. These names clearly outline his importance to British music and culture.\n\nAccording to a statement released by Mayall's family on social media, the revered artist died at his California residence on July 22nd. It followed his retirement from touring due to ongoing health issues. It did not include any information about the cause of death, which will likely be shared at a later date.\n\nThe statement began: \"It is with heavy hearts that we bear the news that John Mayall passed away peacefully in his California home yesterday, July 22nd, 2024, surrounded by loving family. Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors. John Mayall gave us ninety years of tireless efforts to educate, inspire and entertain.\"\n\nIt added: \"John is survived by his six children, Gaz, Jason, Red, Ben, Zak and Samson, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. He is also surrounded with love by his previous wives, Pamela and Maggie, his devoted secretary, Jane, and his close friends. We, the Mayall family, cannot thank his fans and long list of bandmembers enough for the support and love we were blessed to experience secondhand over the last six decades.\"\n\nInducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame earlier this year, Mayall's legacy continues to live on through his music, that of those he gave starts to, and the spirit of the British blues today.\n\nRemembering Mayall's impact on X, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame wrote: \"In Memoriam: 2024 Inductee John Mayall was the godfather of British blues. As a singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and bandleader, Mayall displayed a talent for mentoring gifted young musicians, many of whom he recruited for his groundbreaking band theBluesbreakers.\"\n\n\"With a rugged individuality and distinctive voice and style, he made visionary recordings that expanded the reach of the blues without ever watering them down,\" they added. \"Mayall exerted a major influence on rock & roll, inspiring countless musicians and fans with a lifetime's worth of unforgettable and influential music.\"\n\nFounding member of The Cure, Lol Tolhurst, shared a personal memory of the late legend: \"RIP John Mayall . A road warrior I met him once in the eighties at an airport ( of course ) - lovely man as I recall. A pioneer- we all owe him something for sure - Thank you.\"\n\nIconic guitarist Joe Bonamassa also took to the social media platform to share a series of images of his favourite Mayall records, as well as an image of the pair together. Bonamassa captioned the heartbreaking post: \"Rest in Peace my friend.'\n\nAmerican guitarist and singer Walter Trout, a friend of Mayall, posted an image with Mayall from the late pioneer's 90th birthday last November, writing, \"On John Mayall's 90th Birthday last November, I had no idea, it would be one of the last times I'd see him. As usual, he was funny, generous, and kind. He is and will always be my musical mentor. We just lost a giant. I loved him like a father, and I always will.\"\n\nSinger-songwriter Peter Case simply wrote on X: \"John Mayall, R.I.P. what a great musician\".

songwriter died at his home in California on Monday surrounded by his family, a statement on his Instagram page said.\n\n\"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" it said.\n\n\"John Mayall gave us 90 years of tireless efforts to educate, inspire and entertain,\" the statement added.\n\nMayall, who was born in Macclesfield and grew up in Manchester, founded the Bluesbreakers in the 1960s.\n\nHe was credited with helping to develop a blues revival among white musicians in England - and has been described as the \"godfather of British blues\".\n\nMayall told the Guardian in 2014 that \"at the time, the scene in America was racially segregated\" - but in Europe and England \"the black blues began to be heard by an audience that was not listening to them in America\".\n\nAfter their 1966 album featuring guitarist Clapton, the Bluesbreakers were acclaimed by music critics as one of the world's most influential blues bands.\n\nThe group also became a training ground for other famous rock musicians including Fleetwood Mac's Peter Green, John McVie and Mick Fleetwood, as well as Mick Taylor of the Rolling Stones - cementing Mayall's reputation as a \"serious talent magnet\".\n\nHe told the Guardian he \"managed to pick out some pretty special people\", choosing band members based on the specific sound he was after.\n\nMayall moved to Los Angeles in 1969 and continued to lead bands, release dozens of albums and tour throughout the US and Europe, according to his biography on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nHe was made an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nMayall is survived by his six children, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, the family statement said.\n\n\"He is also surrounded with love by his previous wives, Pamela and Maggie, his devoted secretary, Jane, and his close friends,\" it added.\n\n\"We, the Mayall family,

He also performed on the guitar and harmonica, and sang in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice.\n\nHe moved to London in 1962 with the aim of soaking up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies.\n\nAt the time, he told The Guardian in a 2014 interview, the scene in America was racially segregated but, in Europe and England, \"the black blues began to be heard by an audience that was not listening to them in America\".\n\nOver the years, the Bluesbreakers' members included Clapton and Jack Bruce, who went on to form Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nClapton joined in 1965 after quitting the Yardbirds, having been unhappy with his former band's creative direction. He recalled that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records\" he had ever seen.\n\nInterviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, he confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall often rejected the suggestion that he was a \"talent scout\", instead calling himself a band leader who knew \"what I want to play in my band\".\n\n\"It's definitely a family. It's a small kind of thing really,\" he told the Southern Vermont Review.\n\nHe moved to Los Angeles in 1969 and continued to lead bands, as well as releasing dozens of albums and touring around Europe and the US. Despite his renown, he was vocal about feeling underappreciated by the music industry, telling the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013: \"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me.\n\n\"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nHe continued with live performances well into his eighties. Asked about his prolific nature, he told The Guardian: \"To be honest, I don't think anyone really knows exactly what it is. I just can't stop playing it.\"\n\nMayall was appointed an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005, and was selected for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame class of 2024.\n\nHe is survived by his six children, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, the family statement said.\n\n\"He is also surrounded with love by his previous wives, Pamela and Maggie, his devoted secretary, Jane, and his close friends,\" it added.\n\n\"We, the Mayall family, cannot thank his fans and long-list of band members enough for the support and love we were blessed to experience

Mayall was passionate about Blues music and is credited for playing an integral role in the blues revival of the 1960s, according to The Associated Press (AP).\n\n\"It is with heavy hearts that we bear the news that John Mayall passed away peacefully in his California home yesterday, July 22, 2024, surrounded by his loving family,\" the statement reads. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors.\"\n\nThe famous musician was known for his talents with a blues harmonica and keyboard and for his decades-long devotion to his love of music.\n\n\"John Mayall gave us ninety years of tireless efforts to educate, inspire and entertain,\" the social media statement reads.\n\nMayall was best known for developing The Bluesbreakers, a band whose alumni is loaded with some of music's most impactful artists. He played with Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, as well as Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac. Mayall also brought in Mick Taylor, who went on to play with the Rolling Stones for five years, as well as Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor, who went on to gain fame with Canned Heat, according to The AP.\n\nMayall never rose to independent fame, but those who knew him respected him and were in awe of his skills as a musician and keen eye for talent.\n\nHis love for blues music was captured in a quote pulled from a 2014 interview with The Guardian that was shared in the announcement of his death.\n\n\"[Blues] is about - and it's always been about - that raw honesty with which [it expresses] our experiences in life, something which all comes together in this music, in the words as well. Something that is connected to us, common to our experiences.\"\n\nThe star was an appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire, a two-time Grammy-nominated artist and recent inductee to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. His nominations were for \"Wake Up Call\" and \"The Sun Is Shining Down,\" according to The AP.\n\nMick Jagger paid tribute to the star on Twitter and acknowledged the impact Mayall had on his band.\n\n\"He was a great pioneer of British blues and had a wonderful eye for talented young musicians, including Mick Taylor - who he recommended to me after Brian Jones died - ushering in a new era for the Stones,\" Jagger wrote.\n\nJohn is survived by his 6 children, Gaz, Zek, Red, Jason, Ben and Samson, seven grandchildren and 4 great-grandchildren, as well as his previous wives, Pamela and Maggie, his secretary Jane and close friends.\n\n\"We, the Mayall family, cannot thank his fans and long-list of bandmembers enough for the support and love we were blessed to experience secondhand over the last six decades,\" the statement says.

He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nLa Crosse man faces charges for driving under the influence of marijuana Steve Cahalan: Pastissimo closing Sunday in La Crosse, moving to Texas Steve Cahalan: LAX Grille opens, Pastissimo is leaving and Ichiddo Ramen is coming to La Crosse Steve Cahalan: Ichiddo Ramen franchise to open in La Crosse's former Fayze's Baseball: Viroqua community mourns loss of legendary coach Pete Swanson 'Slow, long crunch and then a bang': Neighbor hears car crash through roof of La Crescent garage Galesville man charged with hit-and-run in La Crosse, eluding police in Holmen Tavern owners celebrate 'Old Style Day' in La Crosse with beer's return to City Brewery Felony charge for man who allegedly punched off-duty officer in La Crosse RNC: Trump campaign upset with empty Wisconsin delegate floor seats Complaint says La Crosse man found with seven grams of cocaine Yang family celebrates homeownership through La Crosse Habitat for Humanity's sweat equity program Kevin Patrick Ritter Charges against anti-war protester dropped following confrontation with US Rep.

It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" signaled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.\n\nPhotos: Notable deaths in 2024\n\nGlynis Johns\n\nAdan Canto\n\nBud Harrelson\n\nDejan Milojevic\n\nJack Burke\n\nMary Weiss\n\nNorman Jewison\n\nCharles Osgood\n\nMelanie Safka\n\nChita Rivera\n\nCarl Weathers\n\nWayne Kramer\n\nIan Lavender\n\nToby Keith\n\nHenry Fambrough\n\nBob Edwards\n\nDon Gullett\n\nLefty Driesell\n\nAndreas Brehme\n\nGolden Richards\n\nRichard Lewis\n\nBrian Mulroney\n\nIris Apfel\n\nAndy Russell\n\nEd Ott\n\nChris Mortensen\n\nPaul Alexander\n\nThomas P.

Mayall's family announced the news on his official social media accounts, stating that the musician died in his California home on Monday, July 22, \"surrounded by loving family.\" The statement cited unspecified health issues, but did not reveal an exact cause of death. John Mayall was 90 years old.\n\nDubbed \"the Godfather of British Blues,\" John Mayall was a nurturing figure to a slew of musicians at the start of their careers. Mayall formed the Bluesbreakers in the early 1960s after moving to London, and the band's shifting lineup included a post-Yardbirds, pre-Cream Eric Clapton, who recorded with Mayall on the highly influential 1966 LP Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton. When Clapton left to start Cream, he was replaced by eventual Fleetwood Mac guitarist Peter Green and Mick Taylor, who was ultimately snatched up by the Rolling Stones.\n\nBorn in 1933 in Macclesfield, England, Mayall learned guitar, piano, and harmonica while growing up. He also spent time poring through his father's record collection, which included jazz and blues 78s by the likes of Big Bill Broonzy, Leadbelly, and Brownie McGhee. After studying graphic design at Manchester Art School and serving in Korea, Mayall worked in advertising agencies before shifting focus to music full-time.\n\nMayall moved to London and formed the Bluesbreakers in his early thirties, playing regularly around his new city. The Bluesbreakers ultimately caught attention from Decca, and the label offered Mayall a contract in 1964. Mayall released his debut album with the Bluesbreakers, John Mayall Plays John Mayall, in 1965. One year later, Clapton replaced the band's guitarist Roger Dean.\n\nRead more: https://pitchfork.com/news/john-mayall-the-godfather-of-british-blues-dies-at-90/", "source": {"uri":

He was 90.\n\nA statement on Mayall's Instagram page announced his death Tuesday, saying the musician died Monday at his home in California. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors,\" the post said.\n\nHe is credited with helping develop the English take on urban, Chicago-style rhythm and blues that played an important role in the blues revival of the late 1960s. At various times, the Bluesbreakers included Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, later of Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; Mick Taylor, who played five years with the Rolling Stones; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond Band.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It's a small kind of thing really.\"\n\nA small but enduring thing. Though Mayall never approached the fame of some of his illustrious alumni, he was still performing in his late 80s, pounding out his version of Chicago blues. The lack of recognition rankled a bit, and he wasn't shy about saying so.\n\n\"I've never had a hit record, I never won a Grammy Award, and Rolling Stone has never done a piece about me,\" he said in an interview with the Santa Barbara Independent in 2013. \"I'm still an underground performer.\"\n\nKnown for his blues harmonica and keyboard playing, Mayall had a Grammy nomination, for \"Wake Up Call\" which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins. He received a second nomination in 2022 for his album \"The Sun Is Shining Down.\" He also won official recognition in Britain with the award of an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in 2005.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class and his 1966 album \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" is considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall once was asked if he kept playing to meet a demand, or simply to show he could still do it.\n\n\"Well, the demand is there, fortunately. But it's really for neither of those two things, it's just for the love of the music,\" he said in an interview with Hawaii Public Radio. \"I just get together with these guys and we have a workout.\"\n\nMayall was born on Nov. 29, 1933 in Macclesfield, near Manchester in central England.\n\nSounding a note of the hard-luck bluesman, Mayall once said, \"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favorite pub was.\"\n\nHis father also played guitar and banjo, and his records of boogie-woogie piano captivated his teenage son.\n\nMayall said he learned to play the piano one hand at a time -- a year on the left hand, a year on the right, \"so I wouldn't get all tangled up.\"\n\nThe piano was his main instrument, though he also performed on guitar and harmonica, as well as singing in a distinctive, strained-sounding voice. Aided only by drummer Keef Hartley, Mayall played all the other instruments for his 1967 album, \"Blues Alone.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nMayall was often called the \"father of British blues,\" but when he moved to London in 1962 his aim was to soak up the nascent blues scene led by Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Eric Burdon were among others drawn to the sound.\n\nThe Bluesbreakers drew on a fluid community of musicians who drifted in and out of various bands. Mayall's biggest catch was Clapton, who had quit the Yardbirds and joined he Bluesbreakers in 1965 because he was unhappy with the Yardbirds' commercial direction.\n\nMayall and Clapton shared a passion for Chicago blues, and the guitarist later remembered that Mayall had \"the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen.\"\n\nMayall tolerated Clapton's waywardness: He disappeared a few months after joining the band, then reappeared later the same year, sidelining the newly arrived Peter Green, then left for good in 1966 with Bruce to form Cream, which rocketed to commercial success, leaving Mayall far behind.\n\nClapton, interviewed for a BBC documentary on Mayall in 2003, confessed that \"to a certain extent I have used his hospitality, used his band and his reputation to launch my own career,\"\n\n\"I think he is a great musician. I just admire and respect his steadfastness,\" Clapton added.\n\nMayall encouraged Clapton to sing and urged Green to develop his song-writing abilities.\n\nMick Taylor, who succeeded Green as a Bluesbreaker in the late 1960s, valued the wide latitude which Mayall allowed his soloists.\n\n\"You'd have complete freedom to do whatever you wanted,\" Taylor said in a 1979 interview with writer Jas Obrecht. \"You could make as many mistakes as you wanted, too.\"\n\nMayall's 1968 album \"Blues from Laurel Canyon\" signaled a permanent move to the United States and a change in direction. He disbanded the Bluesbreakers and worked with two guitars and drums.\n\nThe following year he released \"The Turning Point,\" arguably his most successful release, with an atypical four-man acoustic lineup including Mark and Almond. \"Room to Move,\" a song from that album, was a frequent audience favorite in Mayall's later career.\n\nThe 1970s found Mayall at low ebb personally, but still touring and doing more than 100 shows a year.\n\n\"Throughout the '70s, I performed most of my shows drunk,\" Mayall said in an interview with Dan Ouellette for Down Beat magazine in 1990. One consequence was an attempt to jump from a balcony into a swimming pool that missed -- shattering one of Mayall's heels and leaving him with a limp.\n\n\"That was one incident that got me to stop drinking,\" Mayall said.\n\nIn 1982, he reformed the Bluesbreakers, recruiting Taylor and McVie, but after two years the personnel changed again. In 2008, Mayall announced that he was permanently retiring the Bluesbreaker name, and in 2013 he was leading the John Mayall Band.\n\nMayall and his second wife, Maggie, divorced in 2011 after 30 years of marriage. They had two sons.\n\nPhotos: Notable deaths in 2024 Glynis Johns Adan Canto Bud Harrelson Dejan Milojevic Jack Burke Mary Weiss Norman Jewison Charles Osgood Melanie Safka Chita Rivera Carl Weathers Wayne Kramer Ian Lavender Toby Keith Henry Fambrough Bob Edwards Don Gullett Lefty Driesell Andreas Brehme Golden Richards Richard Lewis Nikolai Ryzhkov Brian Mulroney Akira Toriyama Iris Apfel Andy Russell Ed Ott Chris Mortensen Steve Lawrence Naomi Barber King Paul Alexander Thomas P.

He never indulged in drug-fuelled excess or political activism, but stuck doggedly to the 12-bar blues format even when it went out of fashion, writing countless songs in the idiom, incorporating tried and tested riffs.\n\nAlthough Mayall may have fallen short in originality, he redeemed himself with energy and remained one of the most hard-working and dependable names in the business. His band, the Bluesbreakers, went through countless incarnations over nearly half a century (with interruptions), acting as a \"finishing school\" for many of the greatest names in pop.\n\nMayall's virtuoso work with Clapton on the classic album Bluesbreakers in 1966, and with Clapton's replacement Peter Green on A Hard Road in 1967, set the standard for all other blues bands. Mayall remained the one common factor throughout, never going solo, concentrating on albums and pursuing a relentless routine of touring and recording. The high turnover rate among band members probably owed something to his perfectionist demands.\n\nHe believed it was the responsibility of the musician to back up his records by going on the road. Even into his 70s he followed a gruelling schedule that could take him to 120 cities in 15 countries in four months.\n\nThe blues star BB King is said to have remarked that if it had not been for Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, \"a lot of us Black musicians in America would still be catchin' the hell that we caught long before.\"\n\nThe seeds of Mayall's achievement were sown in the Mayall family home in Macclesfield where he was born, the eldest of three, on November 29 1933. His father, Murray, a clerk, was an amateur jazz guitarist with a large collection of American jazz and blues records. Influenced by such musicians as Leadbelly, Albert Ammons, Pinetop Smith and Eddie Lang, young John taught himself piano, harmonica, guitar and ukelele, although he never learnt to read or write music.\n\nMayall first came to (local) public attention not for his music but for his decision as a teenager to move out of the family home and take up residence in a treehouse in the garden. He even brought his first wife Pamela - briefly - to live with him there. He later wrote the track Home in a Tree on his 1971 Memories album which told the story of his Macclesfield childhood.\n\nAfter training at art college, Mayall did his National Service with the Army in Korea, where he managed to avoid frontline duties by learning to type. On his return he found work as a graphic designer and his music took a back seat while he established a home for his wife and three children. From 1956 until 1962 he played gigs in his spare time, fronting the Powerhouse Four and, later, the semi-professional Blues Syndicate.\n\nIt was at one Blues Syndicate gig that Alexis Korner suggested that Mayall should try his luck in London. Mayall moved south with his family and formed the Bluesbreakers in 1963 with Bernie Watson (guitar), John McVie (bass) and Martin Hart (drums). This line-up lasted for less than a year and ended in April 1964 when Watson and Hart were replaced by Roger Dean and Hughie Flint respectively.\n\nAfter the band failed to hold down a residency at the Flamingo he managed to talk Manfred Mann into giving them the interval spot at the Marquee Club. \"At the time, top groups could choose their own interval band,\" he recalled, \"but it soon got to the stage when we were blowing them off stage.\" In 1964 Mayall released his first Decca single, Crawling Up a Hill and the following year his first album, the live set John Mayall Plays John Mayall.\n\nMayall's early music had a distinct R'n'B flavour; the move to a more pure blues sound came after he succeeded in persuading Eric Clapton to leave the Yardbirds in 1965. Mayall's relationship with the mercurial Clapton was not an easy one. Clapton's tendency to miss occasional gigs infuriated Mayall, who banned drink and drugs during concerts and recording sessions. Meanwhile, Clapton and colleagues complained about Mayall's monopoly of the bunk at the back of the touring van.\n\nAfter four months as a Bluesbreaker, Clapton took indefinite leave and was replaced by Peter Green, but a brief return in 1966 yielded the seminal album Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton, which established Clapton as the \"God\" of the guitar.\n\nWhen Clapton, along with Jack Bruce, left the band to form Cream in mid-1966, Mayall brought back Peter Green. The next album, A Hard Road, reached the top 10 and the drummer, Mick Fleetwood, joined temporarily before leaving with Green to form Fleetwood Mac. Mick Taylor was recruited to replace Peter Green and the 1967 album Crusade reached No 8, before bassist John McVie also left to join Fleetwood Mac.\n\nIn 1968 Diary of a Band and Diary of a Band (Volume 2) reached 27 and 28 respectively in the British charts. The same year, bassist Andy Fraser left to form Free, while the drummer Jon Hiseman, later of Colosseum, joined to record the Bare Wires album, which reached No 3 in the British charts and also made it into the American charts.\n\nWhen his Blues from Laurel Canyon album (1968) only reached 33 in Britain, Mayall changed the band yet again, losing Mick Taylor to the Rolling Stones. In 1969 the live (and drummerless) The Turning Point album , with its classic track Room to Move, reached No 11 in Britain and 32 in America, becoming Mayall's biggest-selling album.\n\nEncouraged by his growing success in the US, Mayall moved there for good in 1969, building a house at Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, though he never took American citizenship.\n\nUntil then white Americans had taken little notice of black music, though Elvis Presley and Bill Haley had borrowed from black blues traditions. Mayall's more faithful interpretations of the genre helped lead to a rediscovery of black music among white audiences.\n\nThroughout the 1970s Mayall continued to form and reform bands with American musicians, including Blue Mitchell, Red Holloway, Larry Taylor, and Harvey Mandel, though these were not his greatest years. A late starter with the booze, he lowered his guard and indulged in what he described as \"15 years of party drinking\"; by the end of the decade he was struggling to keep his career afloat.\n\nIn 1979 a brush fire destroyed his home in Laurel Canyon, taking with it his meticulously kept records and diaries and, more sadly, his father's diaries, which included many fond memories of Macclesfield.\n\nMayall made no recordings for the next five years, too busy rebuilding his house and starting a second family with the singer Maggie Parker. In 1982, however, he reformed the old Bluesbreakers with Mick Taylor and John McVie for a couple of nostalgia tours and a video concert film entitled Blues Alive, which led to a resurgence of interest in blues among younger audiences.\n\nIn 1984 he formed yet another incarnation of the Bluesbreakers with American guitarists Coco Montoya and Walter Trout, and the drummer Joe Yuele.\n\nThe new band revived the classic Bluesbreakers sound with the albums Behind the Iron Curtain (1986), Chicago Line (1988) and A Sense of Place (1990). His 1993 album Wake Up Call received a Grammy nomination, while Spinning Coin (1995), Blues For the Lost Days (1997) and Padlock on the Blues (1999) - the last of which featured a notable collaboration with John Lee Hooker - also won critical acclaim. By this time the band consisted of Rick Cortes, Joe Yuele and Buddy Whittington.\n\nLean and sharp-eyed, with a flowing beard and long grey hair, Mayall came to be regarded as a father figure to the international blues community. On his 2001 release Along For The Ride he teamed up with many of his former band members, including Green, Taylor, Fleetwood and McVie, as well as American musicians, for a virtuoso bluesfest.\n\nThe same year he expanded the Bluesbreakers to five to include Tom Canning and Hank Van Sickle with Joe Yuele and Buddy Whittington. In August 2002, his album Stories reached No 1 in the Billboard blues charts.\n\nTo celebrate his 70th birthday in 2003 Mayall reunited with Clapton, Mick Taylor and Chris Barber for a Unicef fundraiser concert at the Liverpool Arena.\n\nTowards the end of November 2008, Mayall announced that he was disbanding the Bluesbreakers, but he continued to work with other musicians and toured with a backing band until recently. In 2022 he received a second Grammy nomination for his album The Sun Is Shining Down.\n\nIn 2019 Mayall published an autobiography, Blues from Laurel Canyon: My Life as a Bluesman, co-written with Joel McIver.\n\nMayall was appointed OBE in 2005 and inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2016. Earlier this year he was selected for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the musical influence category.\n\nMayall's second marriage to Maggie Parker was dissolved in 2011, though they remained close. He is survived by six children.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Green_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Green (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall_&_the_Bluesbreakers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McVie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John McVie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Clapton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mick Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mick Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleetwood_Mac", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fleetwood Mac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Rolling Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macclesfield", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Macclesfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Macclesfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinetop_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinetop Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Lang", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Lang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Ammons", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albert Ammons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-bar_blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twelve-bar blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostinato", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ostinato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuoso", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtuoso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_Belly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lead Belly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harmonica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.B._King", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "B.B.

of the genre in the late 1960s.\n\nHe was born in Macclesfield and grew up in Manchester, before founding his band the Bluesbreakers in London in 1963.\n\n\"The only reason I was born in Macclesfield was because my father was a drinker, and that's where his favourite pub was,\" he once said.\n\nOver the years, Bluesbreakers members included Clapton and Jack Bruce, who later went on to found Cream; Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green of Fleetwood Mac; future Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor; Harvey Mandel and Larry Taylor of Canned Heat; and Jon Mark and John Almond, who went on to form the Mark-Almond band.\n\nMayall released over 30 albums throughout his career, both as a member of bands and as a solo artist.\n\nHis 1966 album Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton is often considered one of the best British blues albums.\n\nMayall received his first Grammy nomination for Wake Up Call, which featured guest artists Buddy Guy, Mavis Staples, Mick Taylor and Albert Collins, and gained a second nod in 2022 for his album The Sun Is Shining Down.\n\nHe was selected for the 2024 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class, and was made an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire)

He bought his first guitar in Japan while serving his country in Korea in the '50s and when he got back to England and enrolled in Manchester College he played in his first band. Over the next few years he would lead a series of bands before forming The Bluesbreakers who would begin performing regularly at the London's famed Marquee Club in 1963.\n\nOne of Mayall's greatest gifts was spotting young talent and The Bluesbreakers ever-changing lineup at various points included John McVie, Mick Fleetwood and Peter Green who would go on to be in Fleetwood Mac; Eric Clapton who had just quit The Yardbirds (and helped raise the profile of the Bluesbreakers); Clapton's future Cream bandmate Jack Bruce; drummers Aynsley Dunbar and Keef Hartley; Mick Taylor (later of The Rolling Stones), and more. Clapton once said, \"John Mayall has actually run an incredibly great school for musicians.\"\n\nIn 1970, Mayall disbanded the Bluesbreakers and moved to the United States where he continued to make music with an ever-rotating cast of musicians.

The legendary musician known as the Godfather of British Blues passed away in his sleep at his home on Monday. He was 90.\n\nThe news broke today on Mayall's official Instagram. The tribute reads:\n\nIt is with heavy hearts that we bear the news that John Mayall passed away peacefully in his California home yesterday, July 22, 2024, surrounded by his loving family. Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors. John Mayall gave us ninety years of tireless efforts to educate, inspire and entertain.\n\nIn a 2014 interview with The Guardian, John reflected, \"[blues] is about - and it's always been about - that raw honesty with which [it expresses] our experiences in life, something which all comes together in this music, in the words as well. Something that is connected to us, common to our experiences.\" That raw honesty, connection, community and playing of his will continue to affect the music and culture we experience today, and for generations to come.\n\nAn appointed OBE (Officer of the British Empire), 2x Grammy-nominated artist and recent inductee to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, John is survived by his 6 children, Gaz, Jason, Red, Ben, Zak and Samson, 7 grandchildren and 4 great-grandchildren. He is also surrounded with love by his previous wives, Pamela and Maggie, his devoted secretary, Jane, and his close friends. We, the Mayall family, cannot thank his fans and long-list of bandmembers enough for the support and love we were blessed to experience secondhand over the last six decades.\n\nJohn closed that same Guardian interview by reflecting further on the blues, \"To be honest, I don't think anyone really knows exactly what it is. I just can't stop playing it.\" Keep on playing the blues somewhere, John. We love you.\n\nJohn Mayall was born in Macclesfield, Cheshire in 1933. He taught himself to play the piano, guitar, and harmonica before serving in the army. On a period of leave, he purchased his first electric guitar, later enrolling at Manchester College of Art and playing in several groups. Alexis Korner, known as a founding father of British Blues, served as Mayall's mentor and convinced him to move to London and start a full-time music career.\n\nIn 1963, Mayall formed his band the Bluesbreakers with Peter Ward, John McVie, and Bernie Watson, the latter of whom would be replaced by Roger Dean. They released a live album that failed commercially. However, Eric Clapton replaced Dean and the group garnered attention and their second album charted well.\n\nClapton was later replaced by Peter Green, who stayed with the band for a few years beginning with 1967's A Hard Road, but he soon left to found Fleetwood Mac. Then came Mick Taylor, who was only 18 when he was recruited for the group, as well as drummer Colin Allen. Taylor played on four Mayall albums between 1967 and 1969, then departed to join the Rolling Stones. Allen exited to join Stone The Crows. Acoustic fingerstyle guitarist Jon Mark and flautist-saxophonist John Almond entered, and Mayall attempted a new format with no drummer. They recorded the live album The Turning Point and the studio album Empty Rooms. Soon, he welcomed guitarist Harvey Mandel and bassist Larry Taylor, both from Canned Heat.\n\nMayall released over a dozen solo albums before reviving the Bluesbreakers in the early '80s. His final studio album was 2022's The Sun Is Shining Down. In April of this year, he was named as an inductee into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in the Musical Influence category.", "source": {"uri": "stereogum.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The bandleader, composer, singer, and instrumentalist who had a hand in Eric Clapton and other distinctive figures in music's early successes died peacefully at his home in California, according to an official statement released via the artist's social media platforms. Mayall was 90.\n\n\"It is with heavy hearts that we bear the news that John Mayall passed away peacefully in his California home yesterday, July 22, 2024, surrounded by his loving family. Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors. John Mayall gave us ninety years of tireless efforts to educate, inspire and entertain,\" the official statement began.\n\nUsing Mayall's own words, the release turned toward a 2014 interview with The Guardian, in which the musician reflected, '\"[blues] is about - and it's always been about - that raw honesty with which [it expresses] our experiences in life, something which all comes together in this music, in the words as well. Something that is connected to us, common to our experiences.\" That raw honesty, connection, community and playing of his will continue to affect the music and culture we experience today, and for generations to come.\"'\n\nBorn in Macclesfield, Cheshire, on Nov. 29, 1933, Mayall was exposed to music at an early age due to his father's role as a guitarist and performer at local pubs. From a boy, he cited American blues players as inspiration, referencing Lead Belly, Albert Ammons, Pinetop Smith and Eddie Lang. A self-taught performer, Mayall transferred interest in the piano, guitar and harmonica into a fully-fledged musical understanding and use of the instruments.\n\nAfter a stint in Korea as part of his national service and ensuing educational experience at Manchester College of Art, Mayall left his role as an art designer and committed himself to music in 1963. However, his previous skill would be used in album art. Musically, Mayall was involved in the Blues Syndicate, a follow-up gig that proceeded his Peter Ward co-founded Powerhouse Four role. The former group, which transitioned into the Bluesbreakers, and even backed John Lee Hooker on his British tour in 1964.\n\nClapton joined the ensemble in 1965, and in the years that followed, there was some back-and-forth involvement and shifting lineups, inevitably leading to the release of Blues Breaks LP, otherwise known as The Beano Album, which followed Mayall and the band's first drop, John Mayall Plays John Mayall. Eventually, the creation of Cream led Clapton to perform his last scheduled concert with Bluesbreakers.\n\nWith Clapton's intention cemented, Mayall and company ran through years of differing guitarists, including stints with Peter Green (resulting in A Hard Road), Mick Taylor, Harvey Mandel and others. By the onset of the '70s, Mayall relocated to California and spent the next 15 years recording with various labels, including turning out live LP, Jazz Blues Fusion.\n\nThe mid-to-late 1970s represented a prolific period for Mayall, who continued to jump labels and release many records, some of which were produced by Allen Toussaint, Tom Wilson and Don Nix. During the ensuing years, he added elements of jazz, funk, pop and other elements-distinctive markers of his original approach. Notably, his albums topped charts and ran up listens, solidifying his status as one of the best to blues expressionist out of Britain.\n\n\"An appointed OBE (Officer of the British Empire), 2x Grammy-nominated artist and recent inductee to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, John is survived by his 6 children, Gaz, Jason, Red, Ben, Zak and Samson, 7 grandchildren and 4 great-grandchildren.

Mayall presents a curious figure in music history, a bit-part player in his own story, yet at the centre of a fabulous web of music and talent, weaving magic that touched us all.\n\nThe passionate, gregarious, sociable and vocationally driven multi-instrumentalist wrote hundreds of songs and released about 70 albums across a career spanning six decades.\n\nA road warrior of the old school, Mayall played hundreds of gigs a year right up until 2022, when he retired due to declining health, sailing off in a farewell blast of harmonica and keyboards. He was often referred to as the Godfather of British Blues, awarded an OBE in 2005 and inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year, in the musical excellence category.\n\nYet Mayall will be remembered more for the connections he made and his influence on others than for his recorded work. The greatest album that bears his name is chiefly celebrated for the presence of another musician.\n\nBlues Breakers, John Mayall's 1966 album, represented a decisive turning point in rock history and is justly regarded as a classic. It was the first album to signal the arrival of a new kind of guitar hero playing a fierce, overloaded, sustained lead that elevated the blues to a new plane.\n\nBut the album's hero was Eric Clapton, not Mayall. Clapton was already causing such a sensation with his unrivalled playing that his name appears on the cover, \"With Eric Clapton\" flashing right underneath Mayall's. Clapton would go on to become a rock god. Mayall would content himself with providing a platform to launch a whole generation of stars.\n\nA key figure in the British blues boom of the 1960s as a band leader, mentor and innovator, the constantly shifting line-ups of the Bluesbreakers, Mayall's backing group, provided a showcase for some of the greatest players of all time: Clapton, Peter Green (later of Fleetwood Mac) and Mick Taylor (of The Rolling Stones). In a social media post paying tribute, Sir Mick Jagger credited Mayall with recommending Taylor to replace Brian Jones, following Jones's sudden death in 1969 aged 27.\n\nBassists Jack Bruce (of Cream) and John McVie and drummer Mick Fleetwood (the rhythm section of Fleetwood Mac) all came up through Mayall's ranks. For five years in the second half of the 1960s, Mayall provided a showcase for British electric blues music to transform into the harder, wilder, freer and more aggressive sound we now characterise as rock.\n\nHe was an ambitious band leader, but only in terms of music rather than career, and he would genially if ruthlessly swap players whenever he spotted another interesting talent to investigate. There were 15 different line ups of the Bluesbreakers in the 1960s, and when Mayall moved to California in the 1970s, he began to explore jazz-blues fusions in more acoustic flavoured set ups, with line-ups that included such gifted players as saxophonist John Almond and violinist Don Harris.\n\nMayall was a prodigious multi-instrumentalist himself, playing guitar, organ, piano and harmonica, often at the same time with mad-cap exuberance. On The Blues Alone, his 1967 solo album, he played nearly every instrument. Had it not been for his reliance on contributions from session drummers it would hold a historic position as the first multi-tracked one-man-band album, preceding McCartney, Paul McCartney's solo debut, by three years.\n\nFive Mayall albums made the top 30 in the British charts in the first five years of his career, yet it is not hard to understand why Mayall is less revered than many of his contemporaries. You had to see him live to feel the full impact of his talents. Once converted his audience has remained loyal.\n\nAs a singer on record, Mayall's voice was thin and flavourless. You can't help but wish he'd done what other blues band leaders of the era opted to do and hire Rod Stewart, Chris Farlowe, Robert Plant or some other young gun with a bit of grit and texture to front proceedings.\n\nAnd as a songwriter, it surely says something that he filled so many albums with his compositions but never had so much as a sniff at a hit single. Unfortunately, Mayall was a banal lyricist, whose prodigious output was partly fuelled by the simple expedient of apparently singing whatever was on his mind over a blues chord sequence.\n\n\"What's wrong with me? / I still got virginity,\" he lamented on Wish I Knew A Woman, from Memories (1971). \"Guys are driving me mad with all the women that they've had / All I got is my hand for satisfaction every night.\"\n\nToo many Mayall songs dwelled on lecherous views of women, and have not dated well. When his house in Laurel Canyon, California burned down in a brush fire in 1979, he lamented that he had lost a valuable pornography collection dating from the 1800s. A more honourable obsession was environmentalism, but I am not convinced the greatest vocalist on earth could do much with lines like \"Make manufacturers uncomfortable / Containers that are non-returnable\" from Nature's Disappearing on USA Union (1970).\n\nHe plunged to William McGonagall depths of oratorial triteness on Accidental Suicide, his misguided \"tribute\" to Jimi Hendrix from Back to the Roots (1971). \"Drugs may bring you joy / But the danger there's that they destroy / So watch what you do / Or you can be the next to go.\" Let that be a lesson to you, kids.\n\nThe real rewards to be found in his copious output manifest every time Mayall drifts from the microphone and lets his players express themselves. Many Mayall albums were recorded live, because that is the environment in which his bands flourished, revelling in a weave and tangle of instrumentation around the blues frameworks he provided.\n\nHis shows were filled with extended jams, with guitars and later violins flying off into the stratosphere, lots of nimble bass solos and a few too many drum solos. His early recorded work remains fascinating in terms of the different touches and instincts of Clapton, Green and Taylor. Without Mayall's discernment and encouragement in setting stellar talents on their paths, the history of rock may have turned out very differently.\n\nMayall lived a long musical life, cast a long shadow, helped carry the blues from its acoustic American origins into a new electric forum and reshape as rock, then spend decades simply playing it with unbounded joy. That is a life to be celebrated. So long, John.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall", "type": "person",

He never indulged in drug-fuelled excess or political activism, but stuck doggedly to the 12-bar blues format even when it went out of fashion, writing countless songs in the idiom, incorporating tried and tested riffs.\n\nAlthough Mayall may have fallen short in originality, he redeemed himself with energy and remained one of the most hard-working and dependable names in the business. His band, the Bluesbreakers, went through countless incarnations over nearly half a century (with interruptions), acting as a \"finishing school\" for many of the greatest names in pop.\n\nMayall's virtuoso work with Clapton on the classic album Blues Breakers in 1966, and with Clapton's replacement Peter Green on A Hard Road in 1967, set the standard for all other blues bands. Mayall remained the one common factor throughout, never going solo, concentrating on albums and pursuing a relentless routine of touring and recording. The high turnover rate among band members probably owed something to his perfectionist demands.\n\nHe believed it was the responsibility of the musician to back up his records by going on the road. Even into his 70s he followed a gruelling schedule that could take him to 120 cities in 15 countries in four months.\n\nThe blues star BB King is said to have remarked that if it had not been for Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, \"a lot of us black musicians in America would still be catchin' the hell that we caught long before.\"\n\nThe seeds of Mayall's achievement were sown in the family home in Macclesfield where he was born John Brumwell Mayall, the eldest of three, on November 29 1933. His father, Murray, a clerk, was an amateur jazz guitarist with a large collection of American jazz and blues records. Influenced by such musicians as Leadbelly, Albert Ammons, Pinetop Smith and Eddie Lang, young John taught himself piano, harmonica, guitar and ukelele, although he never learnt to read or write music.\n\nMayall first came to (local) public attention not for his music but for his decision as a teenager to move out of the family home and take up residence in a treehouse in the garden. He even brought his first wife Pamela - briefly - to live with him there. He later wrote the track Home in a Tree on his 1971 Memories album, which told the story of his Macclesfield childhood.\n\nAfter training at art college, Mayall did his National Service with the Army in Korea, where he managed to avoid frontline duties by learning to type. On his return he found work as a graphic designer and his music took a back seat while he established a home for his wife and three children. From 1956 until 1962 he played gigs in his spare time, fronting the Powerhouse Four and, later, the semi-professional Blues Syndicate.\n\nIt was at one Blues Syndicate gig that Alexis Korner suggested that Mayall should try his luck in London. Mayall moved south with his family and formed the Bluesbreakers in 1963 with Bernie Watson (guitar), John McVie (bass) and Martin Hart (drums). This line-up lasted for less than a year and ended in April 1964 when Watson and Hart were replaced by Roger Dean and Hughie Flint respectively.\n\nAfter the band failed to hold down a residency at the Flamingo he managed to talk Manfred Mann into giving them the interval spot at the Marquee Club. \"At the time, top groups could choose their own interval band,\" he recalled, \"but it soon got to the stage when we were blowing them off stage.\" In 1964 Mayall released his first Decca single, Crawling Up a Hill, and the following year his first album, the live set John Mayall Plays John Mayall.\n\nMayall's early music had a distinct R'n'B flavour; the move to a more pure blues sound came after he succeeded in persuading Eric Clapton to leave the Yardbirds in 1965. Mayall's relationship with the mercurial Clapton was not an easy one. Clapton's tendency to miss occasional gigs infuriated Mayall, who banned drink and drugs during concerts and recording sessions. Meanwhile, Clapton and colleagues complained about Mayall's monopoly of the bunk at the back of the touring van.\n\nAfter four months as a Bluesbreaker, Clapton took indefinite leave and was replaced by Peter Green, but a brief return in 1966 yielded the seminal album Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton, which established Clapton as the \"God\" of the guitar.\n\nWhen Clapton, along with Jack Bruce, left the band to form Cream in mid-1966, Mayall brought back Peter Green. The next album, A Hard Road, reached the top 10 and the drummer, Mick Fleetwood, joined temporarily before leaving with Green to form Fleetwood Mac. Mick Taylor was recruited to replace Peter Green and the 1967 album Crusade reached No 8, before bassist John McVie also left to join Fleetwood Mac.\n\nIn 1968 Diary of a Band and Diary of a Band (Volume 2) reached 27 and 28 respectively in the British charts. The same year, bassist Andy Fraser left to form Free, while the drummer Jon Hiseman, later of Colosseum, joined to record the Bare Wires album, which reached No 3 in the British charts and also made it into the American charts.\n\nWhen Mayall's Blues from Laurel Canyon album (1968) only reached 33 in Britain, he changed the band yet again, losing Mick Taylor to the Rolling Stones. In 1969 the live (and drummerless) The Turning Point album, with its classic track Room to Move, reached No 11 in Britain and 32 in America, becoming Mayall's biggest-selling album.\n\nEncouraged by his growing success in the US, Mayall moved there for good in 1969, building a house in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, though he never took American citizenship.\n\nUntil then white Americans had taken little notice of black music, though Elvis Presley and Bill Haley had borrowed from black blues traditions. Mayall's more faithful interpretations of the genre helped lead to a rediscovery of black music among white audiences.\n\nThroughout the 1970s Mayall continued to form and reform bands with American musicians, including Blue Mitchell, Red Holloway, Larry Taylor and Harvey Mandel, though these were not his greatest years. A late starter with the booze, he lowered his guard and indulged in what he described as \"15 years of party drinking\"; by the end of the decade he was struggling to keep his career afloat.\n\nIn 1979 a brush fire destroyed his home in Laurel Canyon, taking with it his meticulously kept records and diaries and, more sadly, his father's diaries, which included many fond memories of Macclesfield.\n\nMayall made no recordings for the next five years, too busy rebuilding his house and starting a second family with the singer Maggie Parker. In 1982, however, he reformed the old Bluesbreakers with Mick Taylor and John McVie for a couple of nostalgia tours and a video concert film entitled Blues Alive, which led to a resurgence of interest in blues among younger audiences.\n\nIn 1984 he formed yet another incarnation of the Bluesbreakers with the American guitarists Coco Montoya and Walter Trout and the drummer Joe Yuele.\n\nThe new band revived the classic Bluesbreakers sound with the albums Behind the Iron Curtain (1986), Chicago Line (1988) and A Sense of Place (1990). His 1993 album Wake Up Call received a Grammy nomination, while Spinning Coin (1995), Blues for the Lost Days (1997) and Padlock on the Blues (1999) - the last of which featured a notable collaboration with John Lee Hooker - also won critical acclaim. By this time the band consisted of Rick Cortes, Joe Yuele and Buddy Whittington.\n\nLean and sharp-eyed, with a flowing beard and long grey hair, Mayall came to be regarded as a father figure to the international blues community. On his 2001 release Along for the Ride he teamed up with many of his former band members, including Green, Taylor, Fleetwood and McVie, as well as American musicians, for a virtuoso bluesfest.\n\nThe same year he expanded the Bluesbreakers to five to include Tom Canning and Hank Van Sickle with Joe Yuele and Buddy Whittington. In August 2002, his album Stories reached No 1 in the Billboard blues charts.\n\nTo celebrate his 70th birthday in 2003 Mayall reunited with Clapton, Mick Taylor and Chris Barber for a Unicef fundraiser concert at the Liverpool Arena.\n\nTowards the end of November 2008, Mayall announced that he was disbanding the Bluesbreakers, but he continued to work with other musicians and toured with a backing band until recently. In 2022 he received a second Grammy nomination, for his album The Sun Is Shining Down.\n\nIn 2019 Mayall published an autobiography, Blues from Laurel Canyon: My Life as a Bluesman, co-written with Joel McIver.\n\nMayall was appointed OBE in 2005 and inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2016. Earlier this year he was selected for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the musical influence category.\n\nMayall's second marriage, to Maggie Parker, was dissolved in 2011, though they remained close. He is survived by six children.\n\nJohn Mayall, born November 29 1933, died July 22 2024", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "telegraph_obituaries@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Telegraph Obituaries", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Green_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Green (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall_&_the_Bluesbreakers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McVie", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John McVie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Clapton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.B._King", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "B.B.

After graduating from the Manchester College of Art, he maintained a side hustle playing with local musicians. In 1963, he founded the Bluesbreakers with drummer Peter Ward, bassist John McVie (who would later join Fleetwood Mac) and guitarist Bernie Watson. Together they helped bring the sound of American Delta blues -- artists like Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker and Elmore James -- to English venues and audiences. In 1965, Eric Clapton, who'd quit the Yardbirds, joined the lineup.\n\n\"The blues fitted in with the early '60s, the social way of life at the time,\" Mayall explained to The Guardian in 2014. \"Things were changing anyway - in fashion, art, political views. ... It happened here, rather than in America, because at the time, the scene in America was racially segregated - over there, never the twain would meet. In Europe, however - not just England - the Black blues began to be heard by an audience that was not listening to them in America. We discovered Elmore James, Freddie King, JB Lenoir, and they spoke to our feelings, our life stories and that was it. Hooked.\"\n\nREAD MORE: When John Mayall Retooled for 'Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton'\n\nThe band's lineup would shift over the years -- Peter Green later of Fleetwood Mac, Mick Taylor of the Rolling Stones and Jack Bruce of Cream were all members at one time, along with many others -- but Mayall remained.\n\n\"I had certain ideas and I needed to go out and find the right people to realize them,\" he said in 2014. \"I was a bandleader in that traditional role, as well as a frontman. I used my ears to pick out what I thought would work, and I suppose that in the long term the careers of the people involved show that I managed to pick out some pretty special people.\"\n\nThe Bluesbreakers remained a recording group until 1970, then stalled for 12 years. It was revived in 1982, when a \"Return of the Bluesbreakers\" was announced. The band dissolved for good in 2008, but Mayall continued to record and perform.\n\nWatch John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers Perform in 1970\n\nCollectively with the Bluesbreakers and on his own, Mayall released 35 studio albums and 34 live ones. His most recent studio release arrived in 2022, titled The Sun Is Shining Down. In 2024, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the musical influence category.\n\n\"I don't really have any favorites,\" Mayall, looking back on his career, said in a 2022 interview with Blues Blast Magazine. \"I've just enjoyed playing with different people because of what they bring to the palette. I've have been very lucky that people enjoyed the music I've played, so all of my memories have a special place.\"", "source": {"uri": "ultimateclassicrock.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ultimate Classic Rock"}, "authors": [{"uri": "allison_rapp@ultimateclassicrock.com", "name": "Allison Rapp", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall_&_the_Bluesbreakers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitarist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guitarist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lee_Hooker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Lee Hooker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delta blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yardbirds", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Yardbirds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Green_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Green (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McVie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McVie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmore_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elmore James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muddy_Waters", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muddy Waters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleetwood_Mac", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fleetwood Mac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Clapton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harmonica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drummer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bass guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vanity Fair (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macclesfield", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Macclesfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Macclesfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Lenoir", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

The late Blues warrior wielded an outsized influence\n\nJohn Mayall has died aged 90, cutting a vital link between British music and the rest of the world's rocking-blues past. Mayall presents a curious figure in music history, a bit-part player in his own story, yet at the centre of a fabulous web of music and talent, weaving magic that touched us all.\n\nThe passionate, gregarious, sociable and vocationally driven multi-instrumentalist wrote hundreds of songs and released about 70 albums across a career spanning six decades.\n\nA road warrior of the old school, Mayall played hundreds of gigs a year right up until 2022, when he retired due to declining health, sailing off in a farewell blast of harmonica and keyboards. He was often referred to as the Godfather of British Blues, awarded an OBE in 2005 and inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year, in the musical excellence category.\n\nYet Mayall will be remembered more for the connections he made and his influence on others than for his recorded work. The greatest album that bears his name is chiefly celebrated for the presence of another musician.\n\nBlues Breakers, John Mayall's 1966 album, represented a decisive turning point in rock history and is justly regarded as a classic. It was the first album to signal the arrival of a new kind of guitar hero playing a fierce, overloaded, sustained lead that elevated the blues to a new plane.\n\nBut the album's hero was Eric Clapton, not Mayall. Clapton was already causing such a sensation with his unrivalled playing that his name appears on the cover, \"With Eric Clapton\" flashing right underneath Mayall's. Clapton would go on to become a rock god. Mayall would content himself with providing a platform to launch a whole generation of stars.\n\nA key figure in the British blues boom of the 1960s as a band leader, mentor and innovator, the constantly shifting line-ups of the Bluesbreakers, Mayall's backing group, provided a showcase for some of the greatest players of all time: Clapton, Peter Green (later of Fleetwood Mac) and Mick Taylor (of The Rolling Stones). In a social media post paying tribute, Sir Mick Jagger credited Mayall with recommending Taylor to replace Brian Jones, following Jones's sudden death in 1969 aged 27.\n\nBassists Jack Bruce (of Cream) and John McVie and drummer Mick Fleetwood (the rhythm section of Fleetwood Mac) all came up through Mayall's ranks. For five years in the second half of the 1960s, Mayall provided a showcase for British electric blues music to transform into the harder, wilder, freer and more aggressive sound we now characterise as rock.\n\nHe was an ambitious band leader, but only in terms of music rather than career, and he would genially if ruthlessly swap players whenever he spotted another interesting talent to investigate. There were 15 different line ups of the Bluesbreakers in the 1960s, and when Mayall moved to California in the 1970s, he began to explore jazz-blues fusions in more acoustic flavoured set ups, with line-ups that included such gifted players as saxophonist John Almond and violinist Don Harris.\n\nMayall was a prodigious multi-instrumentalist himself, playing guitar, organ, piano and harmonica, often at the same time with mad-cap exuberance. On The Blues Alone, his 1967 solo album, he played nearly every instrument. Had it not been for his reliance on contributions from session drummers it would hold a historic position as the first multi-tracked one-man-band album, preceding McCartney, Paul McCartney's solo debut, by three years.\n\nFive Mayall albums made the top 30 in the British charts in the first five years of his career, yet it is not hard to understand why Mayall is less revered than many of his contemporaries. You had to see him live to feel the full impact of his talents. Once converted his audience has remained loyal.\n\nAs a singer on record, Mayall's voice was thin and flavourless. You can't help but wish he'd done what other blues band leaders of the era opted to do and hire Rod Stewart, Chris Farlowe, Robert Plant or some other young gun with a bit of grit and texture to front proceedings.\n\nAnd as a songwriter, it surely says something that he filled so many albums with his compositions but never had so much as a sniff at a hit single. Unfortunately, Mayall was a banal lyricist, whose prodigious output was partly fuelled by the simple expedient of apparently singing whatever was on his mind over a blues chord sequence.\n\n\"What's wrong with me? / I still got virginity,\" he lamented on Wish I Knew A Woman, from Memories (1971). \"Guys are driving me mad with all the women that they've had / All I got is my hand for satisfaction every night.\"\n\nToo many Mayall songs dwelled on lecherous views of women, and have not dated well. When his house in Laurel Canyon, California burned down in a brush fire in 1979, he lamented that he had lost a valuable pornography collection dating from the 1800s. A more honourable obsession was environmentalism, but I am not convinced the greatest vocalist on earth could do much with lines like \"Make manufacturers uncomfortable / Containers that are non-returnable\" from Nature's Disappearing on USA Union (1970).\n\nHe plunged to William McGonagall depths of oratorial triteness on Accidental Suicide, his misguided \"tribute\" to Jimi Hendrix from Back to the Roots (1971). \"Drugs may bring you joy / But the danger there's that they destroy / So watch what you do / Or you can be the next to go.\" Let that be a lesson to you, kids.\n\nThe real rewards to be found in his copious output manifest every time Mayall drifts from the microphone and lets his players express themselves. Many Mayall albums were recorded live, because that is the environment in which his bands flourished, revelling in a weave and tangle of instrumentation around the blues frameworks he provided.\n\nHis shows were filled with extended jams, with guitars and later violins flying off into the stratosphere, lots of nimble bass solos and a few too many drum solos. His early recorded work remains fascinating in terms of the different touches and instincts of Clapton, Green and Taylor. Without Mayall's discernment and encouragement in setting stellar talents on their paths, the history of rock may have turned out very differently.\n\nMayall lived a long musical life, cast a long shadow, helped carry the blues from its acoustic American origins into a new electric forum and reshape as rock, then spend decades simply playing it with unbounded joy. That is a life to be celebrated. So long, John.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_mccormick@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Neil McCormick", "type": "author",

He was 90.\n\nAmong the fans and organizations posting condolences was the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which was set to induct him into its ranks in October.\n\nNo cause of death was given in the family's initial statement, although it did refer to Mayall's recent health setbacks. \"It is with heavy hearts that we bear the news that John Mayall passed away peacefully in his California home yesterday, July 22, 2024, surrounded by his loving family,\" the statement read. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors.\"\n\nMayall, whose keening, jazz-inflected tenor vocals reflected the heavy influence of the American singer Mose Allison, fronted his group - known variously as the Blues Breakers or Bluebreakers in its earliest incarnation - on keyboards, harmonica and occasional guitar, and penned dozens of original songs. Among the players he brought into his bands were such legends as Eric Clapton, Peter Green, Mick Taylor, Jack Bruce, John McVie, Mick Fleetwood and Aynsley Dunbar.\n\nHe was perhaps best known in America for the song \"Room to Move,\" a staple on FM radio in the early '70s.\n\nThat was the song Mayall chose to end his touring career with, at the close of his final concert, which took place March 26, 2022 at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, Calif.\n\nBeginning his pro career in in London during the early '60s among such purist Brit-blues bandleaders as Alexis Korner (an early sponsor in the English blues clubs), Cyril Davies and Graham Bond, Mayall featured front line players who were among the cream of the highly competitive blues scene.\n\nHis own talents were often overshadowed by the legendary musicians who played behind him. Between 1965 and 1969, he employed in succession three staggeringly gifted lead guitarists: Clapton, Green and Taylor.\n\nClapton exited Mayall's unit to found the rock supergroup Cream with bassist Jack Bruce (another of his sidemen) and drummer Ginger Baker. Green himself bowed out of the Bluesbreakers to form Fleetwood Mac with Mayall's onetime rhythm section of Fleetwood and McVie. And, on Mayall's recommendation, teenage phenom Taylor replaced Brian Jones in the Rolling Stones.\n\nFor years, Mayall's blues-rock outfit prevailed as a distinguished finishing school on the order of Miles Davis' jazz bands. Other vets enjoyed noteworthy careers on their own: saxophonist Dick Heckstall-Smith, bassist Tony Reeves and drummer Jon Hiseman founded the horn-driven jazz-rock band, while acoustic guitarist John Mark and flutist-saxophonist Johnny Mark formed their own eponymous unit.\n\nDuring the Mark-Almond era - a unique period in which Mayall eschewed the use of a trap drummer - the musician released what was probably his best-known American single, the riff-based \"Room to Move\"; the live album from which it was drawn, \"The Turning Point,\" was his lone LP to achieve gold status.\n\nIn the early '70s, Mayall relocated to Los Angeles, where he worked with such notable American blues players as guitarist Harvey Mandel, violinist Don \"Sugarcane\" Harris and bassist Larry Taylor. A 1970 album featuring them, \"USA Union,\" peaked at No. 22, the bandleader's highest chart position.\n\nMayall achieved his greatest eminence as a front man and touring presence in the early '70s, but he remained a tireless road warrior for decades, playing concerts into his 80s. In 1982, he reunited with Mick Taylor and John McVie for a lengthy world tour.\n\nA new edition of the Bluebreakers, founded in 1984, featured a fierce two-guitar lineup of Coco Montoya and Walter Trout that incited new interest in Mayall's music. He also landed a high-profile label deal with Silvertone Records, the U.S. label that refreshed Buddy Guy's blues career.\n\nMayall began the new millennium with a milestone-marking, celebrity-filled album, \"Along for the Ride,\" and a 70th-birthday concert in Liverpool that reunited him with Clapton and Taylor. His latter-day bands included such top guitarists as Sonny Landreth, Robben Ford and Carolyn Wonderland.\n\nHe was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 2005, and was inducted into America's Blues Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nHe was born Nov. 29, 1933, in the midlands city of Macclesfield. His father was an amateur guitarist and jazz enthusiast, and young Mayall fell under the sway of American jazz and blues stars as a youth, teaching himself piano, guitar and harmonica.\n\nAfter an army stint, Mayall enrolled in Manchester College of Art; his design training there later served him - he painted the band portrait for the cover of his 1967 album \"A Hard Road\" and crafted the look of 1969's \"The Turning Point.\"\n\nWhile in school, he formed some semi-professional groups that performed locally and jammed at local all-nighters. After meeting Alexis Korner, the foremost exponent of the early-'60s British blues sound, at a Manchester date, the older musician took him under his wing; in 1963, he began playing in London with the first edition of the Bluesbreakers.\n\nA debut live album for Decca Records featuring Mayall, McVie, drummer Hughie Flint and guitarist Roger Dean failed commercially, but the Bluesbreakers' fortunes soared with the addition of the Yardbirds' dissident lead guitarist Clapton, a rising rock star who was seeking a more purist environment for his playing.\n\nThe second Bluesbreakers album, featuring Clapton, reached the top 10 in the U.K. in 1966 and became a cult hit in the U.S. However, the guitarist seemed unable to commit full-time to Mayall's group, and by 1967 he had been displaced by Peter Bardens' lead guitarist Peter Green, who flexed a similarly powerful Chicago-style electric attack.\n\n\"A Hard Road\" was a potent showcase for Green, whose album-closing instrumental \"The Super-Natural\" served as a blueprint for his later composition \"Black Magic Woman.\" But his time with Mayall was also short-lived, and he wooed his bandleader's rhythm section to form an even harder-edged blues-rock combo, Fleetwood Mac.\n\nProdigious 18-year-old Mick Taylor, who had fatefully sat in with the Bluesbreakers after Clapton failed to show for a 1965 date near London, was recruited to fill Green's slot. He appeared on four Mayall albums between 1967 and 1969. Mayall himself magnanimously suggest Taylor as Brian Jones' replacement in the Stones.\n\nAfter several clamorous years of electric blues power, Mayall abruptly ratcheted down the volume for two albums with Mark and Almond. Though it failed to climb above No. 102 in the States, the novel single \"Room to Move\" remained Mayall's best-recalled tune thanks to plentiful FM airplay; another track featuring the Mark-Almond combine, \"Don't Waste My Time,\" peaked at No. 81 in 1970.\n\nBesides \"USA Union,\" Mayall's most distinctive recordings of his early American epoch included \"Back to the Roots\" (1971), featuring an all-star ensemble including guests Clapton and Taylor, and \"Jazz Blues Fusion\" (1972), a self-descriptive live set with the American jazz and R&B instrumentalists Blue Mitchell and Clifford Solomon.\n\nIn September 1979, a fast-moving brush fire in L.A.'s Laurel Canyon destroyed Mayall's home and consumed all his possessions, including what was reputed to be one of the world's largest and most valuable collections of vintage pornography.\n\nMayall recorded prolifically for Polydor and ABC, among others, through the '70s and '80s with no commercial traction. His Silvertone releases \"Wake Up Call\" (1993) and \"Spinning Coin\" (1995) briefly returned him to prominence.\n\n\"Along for the Ride\" proved his highest-profile release in years, uniting him with such guitar-slinging ex-band mates, peers and acolytes as Green, Taylor, Otis Rush, Gary Moore, Steve Cropper, Steve Miller, Billy Gibbons, Jeff Healey and Jonny Lang.\n\nMayall is survived by his six children -- Gaz, Jason, Red, Ben, Zak and Samson -- along with seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. His death announcement also mentioned the support of his previous wives, Pamela and Maggie, and a devoted secretary, Jane.", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"},

Rock Musician Passes Away", "body": "Statements have confirmed that English blues and rock musician John Mayall has died. He notably formed the British blues rock band John Mayall & The Bluesbreakers and recently passed away at the age of 90. Due to Mayall's fame in the music world and his iconic status, fans are eager to learn more details about his death and what happened to him.\n\nHere is everything fans need to know about John Mayall's death and the family's statement regarding the musician.\n\nJohn Mayall passes away at 90, claims report\n\nAccording to a report from The New York Times, John Mayall passed away at the age of 90 in his California home. At the time of his death, Mayall was surrounded by his beloved family.\n\nMayall's family confirmed his death via a statement on multiple social media accounts on Tuesday. In the statement, the family revealed that he died peacefully. His family also mentioned in the statement that Mayall suffered from health issues. These issues prompted him to stop touring. The statement also praised his extensive work in the music industry.\n\nHowever, the statement did not disclose Mayall's exact cause of death.\n\nThe statement contains excerpts from his 2014 The Guardian interview, in which he expressed his views on Blues music. It also confirms that John Mayall is survived by his six children, Samson, Zak, Ben, Red, Jason, and Gaz; his two wives, Pamela and Maggie; his seven grandchildren, his four great-grandchildren; his secretary Jane, and his close friends.\n\nJohn Mayall's band, John Mayall & The Bluesbreakers, served as an incubator for British rock and blues musicians. Many famous musicians who would later become part of other well-known bands were, at some point in their lives, members of The Bluesbreakers. These include Mick Taylor, who would later join the Rolling Stones, and Peter Green, who would start Fleetwood Mac.\n\nJohn Mayall was said to be very strict. He would often fire band members who would not meet his strict standards. In the 1970s, Mayall began trying other music forms like funk, pop, and jazz. This was only after his move to the United States.

He was 90.\n\nAmong the fans and organizations posting condolences was the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which was set to induct him into its ranks in October.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nNo cause of death was given in the family's initial statement, although it did refer to Mayall's recent health setbacks. \"It is with heavy hearts that we bear the news that John Mayall passed away peacefully in his California home yesterday, July 22, 2024, surrounded by his loving family,\" the statement read. \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors.\"\n\nMayall, whose keening, jazz-inflected tenor vocals reflected the heavy influence of the American singer Mose Allison, fronted his group - known variously as the Blues Breakers or Bluebreakers in its earliest incarnation - on keyboards, harmonica and occasional guitar, and penned dozens of original songs. Among the players he brought into his bands were such legends as Eric Clapton, Peter Green, Mick Taylor, Jack Bruce, John McVie, Mick Fleetwood and Aynsley Dunbar.\n\nHe was perhaps best known in America for the song \"Room to Move,\" a staple on FM radio in the early '70s.\n\nThat was the song Mayall chose to end his touring career with, at the close of his final concert, which took place March 26, 2022 at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, Calif.\n\nBeginning his pro career in in London during the early '60s among such purist Brit-blues bandleaders as Alexis Korner (an early sponsor in the English blues clubs), Cyril Davies and Graham Bond, Mayall featured front line players who were among the cream of the highly competitive blues scene.\n\nHis own talents were often overshadowed by the legendary musicians who played behind him. Between 1965 and 1969, he employed in succession three staggeringly gifted lead guitarists: Eric Clapton, Peter Green and Mick Taylor.\n\nClapton exited Mayall's unit to found the rock supergroup Cream with bassist Jack Bruce (another of his sidemen) and drummer Ginger Baker. Green himself bowed out of the Bluesbreakers to form Fleetwood Mac with Mayall's onetime rhythm section of drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie. And, on Mayall's recommendation, teenage phenom Taylor replaced Brian Jones in the Rolling Stones.\n\nFor years, Mayall's blues-rock outfit prevailed as a distinguished finishing school on the order of Miles Davis' jazz bands. Other vets enjoyed noteworthy careers on their own: saxophonist Dick Heckstall-Smith, bassist Tony Reeves and drummer Jon Hiseman founded the horn-driven jazz-rock band, while acoustic guitarist John Mark and flutist-saxophonist Johnny Mark formed their own eponymous unit.\n\nDuring the Mark-Almond era - a unique period in which Mayall eschewed the use of a trap drummer - the musician released what was probably his best-known American single, the riff-based \"Room to Move\"; the live album from which it was drawn, \"The Turning Point,\" was his lone LP to achieve gold status.\n\nIn the early '70s, Mayall relocated to Los Angeles, where he worked with such notable American blues players as guitarist Harvey Mandel, violinist Don \"Sugarcane\" Harris and bassist Larry Taylor. A 1970 album featuring them, \"USA Union,\" peaked at No. 22, the bandleader's highest chart position.\n\nMayall achieved his greatest eminence as a front man and touring presence in the early '70s, but he remained a tireless road warrior for decades, playing concerts into his 80s. In 1982, he reunited with Mick Taylor and John McVie for a lengthy world tour.\n\nA new edition of the Bluebreakers, founded in 1984, featured a fierce two-guitar lineup of Coco Montoya and Walter Trout that incited new interest in Mayall's music. He also landed a high-profile label deal with Silvertone Records, the U.S. label that refreshed Buddy Guy's blues career.\n\nMayall began the new millennium with a milestone-marking, celebrity-filled album, \"Along for the Ride,\" and a 70th-birthday concert in Liverpool that reunited him with Clapton and Taylor. His latter-day bands included such top guitarists as Sonny Landreth, Robben Ford and Carolyn Wonderland.\n\nHe was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 2005, and was inducted into America's Blues Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nHe was born Nov. 29, 1933, in the midlands city of Macclesfield. His father was an amateur guitarist and jazz enthusiast, and young Mayall fell under the sway of American jazz and blues stars as a youth, teaching himself piano, guitar and harmonica.\n\nAfter an army stint, Mayall enrolled in Manchester College of Art; his design training there later served him - he painted the band portrait for the cover of his 1967 album \"A Hard Road\" and crafted the look of 1969's \"The Turning Point.\"\n\nWhile in school, he formed some semi-professional groups that performed locally and jammed at local all-nighters. After meeting Alexis Korner, the foremost exponent of the early-'60s British blues sound, at a Manchester date, the older musician took him under his wing; in 1963, he began playing in London with the first edition of the Bluesbreakers.\n\nA debut live album for Decca Records featuring Mayall, McVie, drummer Hughie Flint and guitarist Roger Dean failed commercially, but the Bluesbreakers' fortunes soared with the addition of the Yardbirds' dissident lead guitarist Clapton, a rising rock star who was seeking a more purist environment for his playing.\n\nThe second Bluesbreakers album, featuring Clapton, reached the top 10 in the U.K. in 1966 and became a cult hit in the U.S. However, the guitarist seemed unable to commit full-time to Mayall's group, and by 1967 he had been displaced by Peter Bardens' lead guitarist Peter Green, who flexed a similarly powerful Chicago-style electric attack.\n\n\"A Hard Road\" was a potent showcase for Green, whose album-closing instrumental \"The Super-Natural\" served as a blueprint for his later composition \"Black Magic Woman.\" But his time with Mayall was also short-lived, and he wooed his bandleader's rhythm section to form an even harder-edged blues-rock combo, Fleetwood Mac.\n\nProdigious 18-year-old Mick Taylor, who had fatefully sat in with the Bluesbreakers after Clapton failed to show for a 1965 date near London, was recruited to fill Green's slot. He appeared on four Mayall albums between 1967 and 1969. Mayall himself magnanimously suggest Taylor as Brian Jones' replacement in the Stones.\n\nAfter several clamorous years of electric blues power, Mayall abruptly ratcheted down the volume for two albums with Mark and Almond. Though it failed to climb above No. 102 in the States, the novel single \"Room to Move\" remained Mayall's best-recalled tune thanks to plentiful FM airplay; another track featuring the Mark-Almond combine, \"Don't Waste My Time,\" peaked at No. 81 in 1970.\n\nBesides \"USA Union,\" Mayall's most distinctive recordings of his early American epoch included \"Back to the Roots\" (1971), featuring an all-star ensemble including guests Clapton and Taylor, and \"Jazz Blues Fusion\" (1972), a self-descriptive live set with the American jazz and R&B instrumentalists Blue Mitchell and Clifford Solomon.\n\nIn September 1979, a fast-moving brush fire in L.A.'s Laurel Canyon destroyed Mayall's home and consumed all his possessions, including what was reputed to be one of the world's largest and most valuable collections of vintage pornography.\n\nMayall recorded prolifically for Polydor and ABC, among others, through the '70s and '80s with no commercial traction. His Silvertone releases \"Wake Up Call\" (1993) and \"Spinning Coin\" (1995) briefly returned him to prominence.\n\n\"Along for the Ride\" proved his highest-profile release in years, uniting him with such guitar-slinging ex-band mates, peers and acolytes as Green, Taylor, Otis Rush, Gary Moore, Steve Cropper, Steve Miller, Billy Gibbons, Jeff Healey and Jonny Lang.\n\nMayall's honors included being appointed an OBE (Officer of the British Empire).\n\nMayall is survived by his six children -- Gaz, Jason, Red, Ben, Zak and Samson -- along with seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. His death announcement also mentioned the support of his previous wives, Pamela and Maggie, and a devoted secretary, Jane.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

John Mayall gave us ninety years of tireless efforts to educate, inspire, and entertain.'\n\nJohn Mayall was a singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who is often credited with bringing the American blues and jazz movement to the UK.\n\nBorn in America, Mayall relocated to London in the early 1960s.\n\nHis band, the Blues Breakers, which he founded in 1963 in London, is remembered as one of the most important musical groups of all time.\n\nMembers of the Blues Breakers over the years included: Eric Clapton, Peter Green, Jack Bruce, John McVie, Mick Fleetwood, Aynsley Dunbar, and future Rolling Stones guitarist Mick Taylor.\n\nThe band's 1966 album Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton is often hailed as a seminal work in the blues-rock genre.\n\nThis album not only showcased Clapton's exceptional guitar skills but also highlighted Mayall's ability to blend traditional blues with contemporary rock.\n\nThe Blues Breakers became a training ground for many musicians who would go on to achieve icon status.\n\nEric Clapton left to form Cream, Peter Green and Mick Fleetwood went on to establish Fleetwood Mac, and Mick Taylor joined the Rolling Stones. Mayall's mentorship and eye for talent were crucial in shaping the careers of these iconic musicians.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Mayall returned to America and began to incorporate elements of jazz, funk, and rock into his blues foundation. This period saw collaborations with a diverse array of artists including Paul Butterfield, Patti Smith, Canned Heat's Larry Taylor and Harvey Mandel, Jesse Ed Davis, Rick Vito, and Freebo.\n\nMayall's willingness to evolve and experiment kept his music fresh and relevant, allowing him to maintain a prolific output throughout his career.\n\nMayall recorded and released over 30 albums, both as a member of bands and as a solo artist. His last recording, The Sun Is Shining Down, was released in 2022, and is as fresh and beautiful as even his most iconic work.\n\nFollowing the news of his death, tributes poured in from across the music world. Walter Trout, a former member of the Blues Breakers and a close friend, expressed his sorrow on Facebook: 'He is and will always be my musical mentor, my greatest supporter, and an incredible talent. We just lost a giant. I loved him like a father, and I always will.'\n\nMayall was appointed as an OBE in 2005 and was set to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame this October - fitting honors for a man whose work has had such a profound impact on the music industry.\n\nThis is a breaking news story, more to follow soon...

But for scores of music fans, the legendary godfather of British blues has been a hall of famer since the 1960s when his storied band, the Bluesbreakers, was a pivotal launching pad in the careers of at least seven musicians who are now themselves Rock Hall inductees.\n\nThey include Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, who co-founded the pioneering power trio Cream after leaving Mayall's band, and Fleetwood Mac co-founders Peter Green, Mick Fleetwood Mac and John McVie, whose tenure in The Bluesbreakers laid the foundation for Fleetwood Mac.\n\nOther Bluesbreakers' alums who rose to fame after playing in Mayall's band include Rolling Stones' guitarist Mick Taylor and drummer Aynsley Dunbar, who went on to play in the band of Frank Zappa and co-found the group Journey. Both Taylor and Dunbar are also Rock Hall inductees.\n\n\"When you get in John's band, you've pretty much made it to the pinnacle. I mean: Where do you go from there?\" former Bluesbreakers' guitarist Walter Trout said in a 2021 San Diego Union-Tribune interview.\n\nYet, while Mayall was understandably proud of his unerring ability to discover and nurture talented young musicians who went on to have standout careers of their own, he tended to downplay his skills as a talent scout and mentor.\n\n\"It's just great being able to earn a living doing what I love,\" Mayall said in a 2005 Union-Tribune interview. 'I'm not going away. There's this segment that considers me some legendary figure and it's a pleasure to continue playing because of those people.\"\n\nMayall was born in Macclesfield, England, near Manchester, on Nov. 29, 1933. A trained graphic designer and artist, he was 30 when devoted himself to music after a stint serving in the military in Korea. He was soon sharing his love of such American blues greats as Robert Johnson, Sonny Boy Williamson, Otis Rush, J.B. Lenoir with other musicians in England, where he built a loyal following.\n\nThe lineups of Mayall's bands changed constantly and audiences eagerly welcomed the chance to hear the latest hot young musicians he had discovered. After multiple concert tours of the United States, Mayall became a permanent Southern California resident in 1969.\n\nA distinctive, reedy-voiced singer and harmonica player, Mayall also played guitar and keyboards. While he tirelessly championed songs by American blues pioneers, he was an accomplished songwriter whose lyrics had a distinctly personal stamp.\n\n\"If you're gonna sing something, you should sing something personal,\" Mayall said in his 2005 Union-Tribune interview. \"That's what the main feature of the blues is: you tell your story. I've never been a fan of singing about things I have no experience of.\"\n\nMayall performed numerous times in San Diego over the decades, most often at the Belly Up. His final area performance came in 2021 at the Poway Center for the Performing Arts. He was 88 and it was the final tour of his career.\n\nMayall was in declining health at the time and not available for interviews. Our in-depth 2021 feature story on him, which includes quotes from a number of his musical collaborators and several San Diego musicians, appears in full below.\n\nJohn Mayall, famed 'Godfather of English blues,' on final concert tour, at 88, after bout with COVID-19\n\nJohn Mayall, the famed \"Godfather of British blues\" and a pivotal musical catalyst for at least seven Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductees, was not yet 34 when he released his fifth album, \"A Hard Road,\" in 1967.\n\nNow, 54 years later, the end of that road appears to be looming for the man whose pioneering band, The Bluesbreakers, served as the launching pad for a bevy of talented young musicians bound for stardom. Some key examples include the Rolling Stones' Mick Taylor, Cream's Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, and Fleetwood Mac's Peter Green, Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.\n\n\"When you get in John's band, you've pretty much made it to the pinnacle. I mean: Where do you go from there?\" said guitarist Walter Trout, 70, who played with Mayall for much of the 1980s.\n\nMayall's current concert trek includes a Saturday show at Poway Center for the Performing Arts that will also feature Trout and his band. It is one of six dates Mayall is performing between Friday and Dec. 17, after which he has no other shows currently scheduled.\n\nHis next (and possibly last) album, \"The Sun is Shining Down,\" will be released Jan. 28 - nearly one year to the day after this year's release of his 35-CD career retrospective box set, \"John Mayall: The First Generation.\"\n\nHis pending half dozen concerts could be a bittersweet combination of celebration and reflection for this tireless champion of American blues. Ditto for the three members of his current band and his long-devoted fans.\n\nMayall announced this fall that he is bowing out from touring, although the Woodland Hills-based singer, harmonica player, guitarist and keyboardist hopes to do some periodic one-off gigs in and near Southern California. He moved from his native England to Los Angeles in 1969.\n\n\"I have decided, due to the risks of the pandemic and my advancing age, that it is time for me to hang up my road shoes,\" Mayall, who turned 88 on Monday, said in a Sept. 22 statement.\n\n\"As a result, I will be radically reducing my touring schedule and will be limiting my performances to local shows near my home in California and the occasional concert further afield. My epic road dog days, however, have come to an end.\"\n\nThose days have been epic indeed. The number of concerts Mayall has performed number in the thousands. His career began nearly 60 years ago in England, where he soon earned acclaim as a first-rate band leader, devoted performer and unusually astute judge of young talent.\n\nHis live performances continued almost unabated until May 2019, when - following an extensive European tour - a bad case of pneumonia led him to cancel about six weeks of spring concerts in the U.S.\n\nMayall returned to the road that same summer, followed by another tour of Europe in the fall of 2019. He performed four Southern California dates in early 2020, concluding with a gig at Solana Beach's Belly Up. The venue has hosted numerous concerts by Mayall over the past four decades.\n\nHis Belly Up show was followed a few weeks later by an ill-fated trip to London. Mayall performed there on Feb. 25, 2020, at the \"Mick Fleetwood & Friends Celebrate the Music of Peter Green and the Early Years of Fleetwood Mac\" all-star concert.\n\n\"John got COVID at the end of that trip, and he had a bad case of it,\" Jay Davenport, the drummer in Mayall's band since 2008, told the San Diego Union-Tribune.\n\n\"And, then, we didn't play a note of music together for a year-and-a-half because of the pandemic. I think there were some lingering effects (from COVID) and, basically, some health issues. It just felt very dangerous to do a whole lot of traveling. John seemed more fragile.\"\n\n'Still blows my mind'\n\nMayall happily returned to the road in August, performing anywhere from 90 minutes to 2\u00bd hours per concert. His distinctively reedy singing voice and instrumental prowess were seemingly unaffected by his bout with COVID and he earned glowing reviews for his Aug. 22 show at Chicago's City Winery.\n\nBut at least one write-up of his gig in the Windy City noted that Mayall appeared periodically confused by the sequence of songs in his set list. Apart from that, nothing was amiss.\n\n\"John would announce the same song a few times and lose his place in the set list,\" Davenport, 61, said. \"On the other hand ... once he had the right song, he played his ass off!\n\n\"We did four nights in October in Park City, Utah, and he was unbelievable. We did a different set each night, and - during one of them - he spontaneously wrote two new songs on stage, real songs, right on the spot, that we performed then and there...\n\n\"He can still go out and play piano and harmonica, in unison, and those are two very different musical and mechanical disciplines. Playing harmonica and piano at the same time isn't like walking and chewing gum at the same time. It's more like walking and building a gum factory at the same time! It still blows my mind he is able to do that.\"\n\nMayall began blowing minds in his native England more than half a century ago. He became a full-time musician in 1963 after serving three years in the English army in Korea, during which time he bought his first guitar while on vacation in Japan.\n\nHis love of vibrant American music began when he was a young art student and heard records by American boogie-woogie piano giants Meade Lux Lewis, Pete Johnson and Albert Ammons. After discovering Lead Belly, Blind Lemon Jefferson and Brownie McGhee, his destiny was set.\n\nMayall was delighted to share songs by the American blues masters he revered with English club and concert audiences, for whom he served as a vital musical gateway. He quickly began writing his own songs as well. Some of his best include \"The Laws Must Change,\" \"Country Road\" and \"Room to Move,\" which became an FM radio staple on American stations in the early 1970s.\n\n\"If you're gonna sing something, you should sing something personal,\" Mayall said in a 2005 Union-Tribune interview. \"That's what the main feature of the blues is - you tell your story. I've never been a fan of singing about things I have no experience of.\"\n\nReleased in 1969 the chugging, harmonica-driven \"Room to Move\" remains the most popular song by Mayall, an enduring artist who has never had a hit album or single in the U.S.\n\n\"His rhythmic harmonica playing on songs like 'Room to Move' was revelatory,\" said veteran San Diego musician Andy Robinson.\n\n\"With its virtuoso harmonica hook and extended 'mouth percussion' solo, 'Room to Move' had a feel like nothing else,\" agreed Encinitas singer-songwriter JT Moring. \"That song is still a benchmark for the kind of energy I'd like to bring to live performances.\"\n\nThe impact of Mayall's best-known song extends to Jordan Peimer. He is the executive director of the University of California San Diego's ArtPower, which features established and rising blues and jazz artists in its annual performance seasons.\n\n\"As a young music listener 'Room to Move' opened my eyes and ears to something very basic in music that was always there, but which I'd never been able to name before,\" Peimer recalled.\n\n\"As I grew into a curator, I kept the astonishment that Mayall's 'The Turning Point' album - and, eventually, his live shows - left with me. ... In a lot of ways, it helped motivate me to create ArtPower's 'The American Routes' series.\"\n\nEric Clapton, Peter Green, Mick Taylor\n\nFrom 1965 on, the lineups of Mayall's Bluesbreakers changed on a regular basis as the young musicians he nurtured left to form their own bands.\n\nMuch like a blues-rocking version of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, The Bluesbreakers served as a vital incubator for dozens of musicians. The first major turning point came with Mayall's \"Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton\" album, which was released in 1966 and is informally known as \"The Beano Album.\"\n\nUnder either name, it introduced a generation of young Britons and Americans to Clapton's prodigious guitar skills. It also introduced them to some of the classic American blues songs Mayall treasured, including Robert Johnson's \"Ramblin' On My Mind,\" Otis Rush's \"All Your Love\" and Freddie King's \"Hideaway.\"\n\nClapton soon left to form Cream with drummer Ginger Baker and former Bluesbreakers bassist Jack Bruce. Mayall replaced Clapton with Peter Green, who went on to launch Fleetwood Mac. Green was in turn replaced by the teenaged Mick Taylor, who was hired away by the Rolling Stones in 1969.\n\n\"For me, discovering The Bluesbreakers' 1967 album, 'Crusade,' was a godsend,\" said Billy Thompson, a leading San Diego guitarist and singer now based in Virginia.\n\n\"Mick Taylor played some great and influential guitar on that album. ... Mayall opened doors for me. I learned who many of the great bluesmen were from Mayall and Clapton.\"\n\nBut it wasn't just budding guitar greats who found their footing under Mayall's mentorship.\n\nAt least four drummers - Hughie Flint, Aynsley Dunbar, Jon Heisman and Keef Hartley - launched acclaimed bands of their own in England after establishing themselves in The Bluesbreakers. And Dunbar, after moving to California to play in former San Diegan Frank Zappa's band, became a co-founding member of Journey.\n\nThe band Mark-Almond was formed by saxophonist and flutist Johnny Almond and acoustic guitarist Jon Mark soon after they had recorded two standout albums with Mayall, 1969's \"The Turning Point\" and 1970's \"Empty Rooms.\" Those albums preceded by more than a decade the all-acoustic \"Unplugged\" era that MTV began to spotlight in the 1980s.\n\nBy mid-1970, Mayall was leading his first band of American musicians. His 1972 live album, \"Jazz Blues Fusion,\" featured an all-star brass section that he expanded for his 1973 live album, \"Moving On.\"\n\n'An incredible education'\n\n\"It was an incredible education being a Bluesbreaker,\" guitarist Trout said, speaking from his home in Huntington Beach. \"John and The Bluesbreakers made so many iconic albums when I was in high school in the 1960s, and I studied them all. The first time I got up and played with John in the 1980s, we did 'Hideaway' and 'All Your Love,' and I played the Clapton solos, note for note, which I can still do now.\n\n\"At the end of the night, John said: 'Walter, if I wanted Eric I would have called Eric. I love your playing and want you to play the songs the way you want to.' John freed me that night to come into my own as a musician.\n\n\"I learned to be a band leader by watching John. I think he's one of the great band leaders and I'd rank him alongside Count Basie and Duke Ellington; he knows how to put players together who have the right chemistry. And he's like my surrogate dad. I was heavily into drinking and drugging when I got in John's band and he nurtured me, stood by me, and helped me get sober.\"\n\nDrummer Davenport, 61, performed with such Chicago blues greats as Junior Wells, Pinetop Perkins, Sugar Blue and Melvin Taylor before joining Mayall's band in 2008. Unlike a majority of Mayall's audience and band members over the years, Davenport is not White.\n\n\"I'm Black and live in Chicago, and when I went to hang out at a music club Muddy Waters or Junior Wells was sitting at the end of the bar,\" Davenport said. \"So I didn't need to look too far for the kind of music John exposed people to.\n\n\"What John did do was introduce traditional blues to everyone else in this country. I know so many people that heard John play 'Hideaway' and then went searching for the original version by Freddie King.\n\n\"John was able to re-create that music more authentically and made blues palatable to a lot of people here. ... In England, they were really proud that they weren't hung up on the color of the guys playing the music, they were just focused on the music.\"\n\nDavenport credits a combination of skill, tenacity and leadership for sustaining Mayall's career since the 1960s.\n\n\"John is the sweetest man you could ever imagine being your boss,\" Davenport said, speaking from his Chicago-area home.\n\n\"It's funny because everyone calls him 'Boss,' dating back to the 'Beano' album in 1966. So while Bruce Springsteen has the title 'The Boss,' John had it first and we still call him Boss. John is a fearless, tireless leader and he has zero ego. He has a steely will to keep doing it as long as he can, so for him to come to this decision (to stop touring) is a big deal for us.\"\n\nThe last word goes, as it should, to Mayall, whose autobiography. \"Blues from Laurel Canyon: My Life as a Bluesman,\" was published in 2019.\n\nMayall's devotion to music was underscored in his September announcement of his retirement from touring and in the enthusiasm he expressed for \"The Sun is Shining Down,\" his upcoming new album.\n\n\"It has been a privilege to have spent my life doing what I love and having you along for the ride with me through all of it. I may not be traveling to your location, but I do want to continue to share my love of the blues with you,\" Mayall said at the time.\n\n\"I'm proud of what we came up with (on the album) and excited to share it with you. I look forward to seeing those of you who can attend my local shows, and I will miss all of you who cannot, but as always, keep loving the blues!\"", "source": {"uri": "kansas.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wichita Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "san_diego_union_tribune@kansas.com", "name": "San Diego Union-Tribune", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "george_varga@kansas.com", "name": "George Varga", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_San_Diego_Union-Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The San Diego Union-Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aynsley_Dunbar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aynsley Dunbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Green_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Green (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall_&_the_Bluesbreakers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Bruce", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jack Bruce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mick Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mick Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Trout", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walter Trout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cream (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleetwood_Mac", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fleetwood Mac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Clapton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harmonica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitarist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guitarist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McVie", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John McVie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Rolling Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drummer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concert tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Lenoir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

He was 90.\n\nThe statement didn't specify a cause but attributed the death to the \"health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career.\"\n\nMayall, who'd been performing on the road as recently as 2022, was due to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in October as a recipient of the organization's Musical Influence Award. On its website, the hall hailed Mayall's \"rugged individuality and distinctive voice and style\" and said he \"continually experimented with and stretched the blues.\"\n\n\"The blues is such an everlasting source of inspiration to me,\" he told The Times in 1990. \"It's quite inexhaustible, really.\"\n\nA guitarist, keyboardist, singer, harmonica player and songwriter, Mayall released dozens of albums and played innumerable gigs in a career that stretched over more than half a century. Yet he's best remembered for helping to launch the blues revival of the 1960s that would go on to make pop stars of Clapton, the Rolling Stones and Fleetwood Mac.\n\nHis 1966 LP \"Blues Breakers,\" which featured Clapton on guitar (not long after he'd left the Yardbirds), is widely considered a classic of the form and earned a spot on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\n\nMayall was born in 1933 near Manchester, England, where his father collected records and played music as a hobby. At age 3, he \"got addicted\" to the music of the Mills Brothers, he told The Times; after being discharged from the British Army in his early 20s, he formed his first band \"strictly for my own satisfaction.\"\n\nBy the time he was 30, though, he'd moved to London to pursue music professionally and found a thriving blues scene he described in the Times interview as \"the south's answer to the north, to the Liverpool pop-rock thing dominated by the Beatles.\" Beyond Clapton, the Bluesbreakers eventually attracted Peter Green, who left the band to form Fleetwood Mac; Jack Bruce, who played with Clapton in Cream; and Aynsley Dunbar, who played drums for Frank Zappa, among other artists.\n\nMayall moved to Los Angeles in 1969 and spent the '70s expanding his playing into jazz. But he reformed the Bluesbreakers in the mid-'80s and soon got back to averaging 120 dates a year.\n\n\"There would be more, but I put a ceiling on it,\" he told The Times. \"Otherwise, I wouldn't get any home life, and that's very important to me.\"\n\nMayall is survived by six children, Gaz, Jason, Red, Ben, Zak and Samson; seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. His family's statement said he \"is also surrounded with love by his previous wives, Pamela and Maggie, his devoted secretary, Jane, and his close friends.\"", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com",

He was often referred to as the Godfather of British Blues, awarded an OBE in 2005 and inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year, in the musical excellence category.\n\nYet Mayall will be remembered more for the connections he made and his influence on others than for his recorded work. The greatest album that bears his name is chiefly celebrated for the presence of another musician.\n\nBlues Breakers, John Mayall's 1966 album, represented a decisive turning point in rock history and is justly regarded as a classic. It was the first album to signal the arrival of a new kind of guitar hero playing a fierce, overloaded, sustained lead that elevated the blues to a new plane.\n\nRead more:\n\nBut the album's hero was Eric Clapton, not Mayall. Clapton was already causing such a sensation with his unrivalled playing that his name appears on the cover, \"With Eric Clapton\" flashing right underneath Mayall's. Clapton would go on to become a rock god. Mayall would content himself with providing a platform to launch a whole generation of stars.\n\nA key figure in the British blues boom of the 1960s as a band leader, mentor and innovator, the constantly shifting line-ups of the Bluesbreakers, Mayall's backing group, provided a showcase for some of the greatest players of all time: Clapton, Peter Green (later of Fleetwood Mac) and Mick Taylor (of The Rolling Stones). In a social media post paying tribute, Sir Mick Jagger credited Mayall with recommending Taylor to replace Brian Jones, following Jones' sudden death in 1969 aged 27.\n\nBassists Jack Bruce (of Cream) and John McVie and drummer Mick Fleetwood (the rhythm section of Fleetwood Mac) all came up through Mayall's ranks. For five years in the second half of the 1960s, Mayall provided a showcase for British electric blues music to transform into the harder, wilder, freer and more aggressive sound we now characterise as rock.\n\nHe was an ambitious band leader, but only in terms of music rather than career, and he would genially if ruthlessly swap players whenever he spotted another interesting talent to investigate. There were 15 different line-ups of the Bluesbreakers in the 1960s, and when Mayall moved to California in the 1970s, he began to explore jazz-blues fusions in more acoustic flavoured set-ups, with line-ups that included such gifted players as saxophonist John Almond and violinist Don Harris.\n\nMayall was a prodigious multi-instrumentalist himself, playing guitar, organ, piano and harmonica, often at the same time with mad-cap exuberance. On The Blues Alone, his 1967 solo album, he played nearly every instrument. Had it not been for his reliance on contributions from session drummers it would hold a historic position as the first multi-tracked one-man-band album, preceding McCartney, Paul McCartney's solo debut, by three years.\n\nFive Mayall albums made the top 30 in the British charts in the first five years of his career, yet it is not hard to understand why Mayall is less revered than many of his contemporaries. You had to see him live to feel the full impact of his talents. Once converted his audience has remained loyal.\n\nAs a singer on record, Mayall's voice was thin and flavourless. You can't help but wish he'd done what other blues band leaders of the era opted to do and hire Rod Stewart, Chris Farlowe, Robert Plant or some other young gun with a bit of grit and texture to front proceedings.\n\nAnd as a songwriter, it surely says something that he filled so many albums with his compositions but never had so much as a sniff at a hit single. Unfortunately, Mayall was a banal lyricist, whose prodigious output was partly fuelled by the simple expedient of apparently singing whatever was on his mind over a blues chord sequence.\n\n\"What's wrong with me? / I still got virginity,\" he lamented on Wish I Knew A Woman, from Memories (1971). \"Guys are driving me mad with all the women that they've had / All I got is my hand for satisfaction every night.\"\n\nToo many Mayall songs dwelled on lecherous views of women, and have not dated well. When his house in Laurel Canyon, California burned down in a brush fire in 1979, he lamented that he had lost a valuable pornography collection dating from the 1800s. A more honourable obsession was environmentalism, but I am not convinced the greatest vocalist on earth could do much with lines like \"Make manufacturers uncomfortable / Containers that are non-returnable\" from Nature's Disappearing on USA Union (1970).\n\nHe plunged to William McGonagall depths of oratorial triteness on Accidental Suicide, his misguided \"tribute\" to Jimi Hendrix from Back to the Roots (1971). \"Drugs may bring you joy / But the danger there's that they destroy / So watch what you do / Or you can be the next to go.\" Let that be a lesson to you, kids.\n\nThe real rewards to be found in his copious output manifest every time Mayall drifts from the microphone and lets his players express themselves. Many Mayall albums were recorded live, because that is the environment in which his bands flourished, revelling in a weave and tangle of instrumentation around the blues frameworks he provided.\n\nHis shows were filled with extended jams, with guitars and later violins flying off into the stratosphere, lots of nimble bass solos and a few too many drum solos. His early recorded work remains fascinating in terms of the different touches and instincts of Clapton, Green and Taylor. Without Mayall's discernment and encouragement in setting stellar talents on their paths, the history of rock may have turned out very differently.\n\nMayall lived a long musical life, cast a long shadow, helped carry the blues from its acoustic American origins into a new electric forum and reshape as rock, then spend decades simply playing it with unbounded joy. That is a life to be celebrated. So long, John.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall", "type": "person",

The album established Clapton as a blues guitarist of considerable talent and, largely as a result of Clapton's following, also brought singer/keyboardist/harmonica player Mayall a much bigger and broader audience.\n\nI wouldn't change anything.\" he told Classic Rock in 2016. \"I mean, if you look at all the stuff I've done over the years - I've explored every kind of variation on the blues - it's all added up to a wonderful career.

In a 2014 interview with The Guardian, he said of the blues: \"[It has] always been about that raw honesty with which [it expresses] our experiences in life, something which all comes together in this music, in the words as well. Something that is connected to us, common to our experiences.\" He added, \"To be honest, I don't think anyone really knows exactly what it is. I just can't stop playing it.\"\n\nHe launched the Bluesbreakers in 1963, and during the 1960s the group would include a who's-who of British blues and rock royalty, from Clapton and Peter Green to Jack Bruce, John McVie, Mick Fleetwood, Aynsley Dunbar and future Rolling Stone Mick Taylor. The group was a commercial force in the Swinging '60s UK, with five Top 10 LPs from 1966-70. Their 1966 debut Blues Breakers featured hotshot young guitarist Clapton, who had just left The Yardbirds and whose fiery fretwork inspired \"Clapton is God\" graffiti.\n\nSlowhand left the group in 1966 and was replaced by Green, who left in 1967 to found the first edition of Fleetwood Mac with Bluesbreakers drummer Fleetwood and bassist McVie. Green was replaced by Taylor, who split in 1969 to join The Rolling Stones after Brian Jones' death.\n\nDEADLINE RELATED VIDEO:\n\nMayall and the band found intermittent success in the U.S., charting nearly 20 albums from 1968-75. Among the biggest was The Turning Point (1969), a live disc that went gold and peaked at No. 32. The group's biggest Stateside chart success was 1970's USA Union, which featured recent Canned Heat departees Larry Taylor and Harvey Mandel and reached No. 22.\n\nBorn on November 29, 1933, in Macclesfield, Cheshire, Mayall moved to London in 1963, at the behest of his friend Alexis Korner, to pursue a music career after a stint in the British military. He formed the Bluesbreakers late that year with McVie, Peter Ward and others and began gigging around town. Roster changes were numerous.\n\nBruce joined the band for a spell in 1965 but left to join Manfred Mann and later would team with Clapton and drummer Ginger Baker in Cream, which saw massive success on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nDunbar played in the Bluesbreakers in 1966-67 and played on some of their subsequent albums before going to drum for Frank Zappa, David Bowie and later Journey and Jefferson Starship.\n\nMayall relocated to Los Angeles in 1969 and continued to front bands. He has released dozens of albums and scored two Grammy nominations -- nearly 30 years apart. Wake Up Call was up for Best Contemporary Blues Album in 1993, and his final disc, The Sun Is Shining Down, earned a nom for Best Traditional Blues Album in 2022.\n\nAlong the way, Mayall has worked with the likes of Joe Walsh, Steven Van Zandt, Alex Lifeson, Billy Gibbons, Otis Rush, Billy Preston, Marcus King and Walter Trout.\n\nHe was named an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005, inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2016 and elected to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a \"Musical Influence\" this year, alongside Korner and Big Mama Thornton. He continued to record and tour until about two years ago.\n\nMayall is survived by his children Gaz, Jason, Red, Ben, Zak and Samson, seven grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.", "source":

Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors. John Mayall gave us ninety years of tireless efforts to educate, inspire and entertain.\"\n\nBorn in Macclesfield in 1933, he discovered jazz and blues through his father's record collection. After spending three years in Korea for his National Service, Mayall studied at art college, working as a graphic designer before turning professional musician in 1963.\n\nAs part of the emerging London blues scene, encouraged by Alexis Corner and Cyril Davis, he played with the Powerhouse Four before forming the Bluesbreakers in 1963.\n\n\"There was a lot of driving,\" Mayall told Uncut in 2017. \"If it was within reach, we'd play it. You'd do a Friday night gig at the Flamingo, a Saturday early show, a Saturday late-night show. We'd rack up eight or nine shows a week. It was a lot of hard work, mostly just get in the van and drive to where we're playing. But the reward comes once you get onstage and start playing.\"\n\nFamously, the Bluebreakers provided opportunities for future stars. \"Everybody was given total freedom in my bands and that's one of the things that attracts musicians to me,\" he told us. \"So if someone leaves, it is no big deal, it's a natural process, and you get someone else.\"\n\nMayall moved to California at the end of the 1960s, where he moved away from straight blues towards acoustic music and then into jazz and funk as the '70s progressed.\n\nHe broke-up and then reformed the Bluesbreakers, releasing over 50 albums in a career spanning seven decades and continuing to tour. When Uncut spoke to Mayall, who was then 83, he was still playing 100 shows a year around the world.\n\n\"You get up onstage and you play,\" he told us. \"Is there much room to improvise? Yeah, of course. That's the blues.\"", "source": {"uri": "uncut.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "UNCUT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_bonner@uncut.co.uk", "name": "Michael Bonner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncut_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uncut (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall_&_the_Bluesbreakers", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McVie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McVie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Bruce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Bruce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mick Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mick Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rawlings", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Rawlings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillian_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gillian Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Clapton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conscription in the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Korner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Korner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macclesfield", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Macclesfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Macclesfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarperCollins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HarperCollins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acoustic music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Improvisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Funk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company_Loyalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Company Loyalty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Technostress", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Technostress", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.uncut.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/john-mayall-GettyImages-112143586.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757937", "eventUri": "eng-9757937", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

He was 90.\n\nThe death was confirmed in a statement on Mr. Mayall's official Facebook page. The statement did not give a cause or specify where he died, saying only that he died \"in his California home.\"\n\nThough he played piano, organ, guitar and harmonica and sang lead vocals in his own bands with a high, reedy tenor, Mr. Mayall earned his reputation as \"the godfather of British blues\" not for his own playing or singing but for recruiting and polishing the talents of one gifted young lead guitarist after another.\n\nIn his most fertile period, between 1965 and 1969, those budding stars included Eric Clapton, who left to form the band Cream and eventually became a hugely successful solo artist; Peter Green, who left to found Fleetwood Mac; and Mick Taylor, who was snatched from the Mayall band by the Rolling Stones.\n\nA more complete list of the alumni of Mr. Mayall's band of that era, known as the Bluesbreakers, reads like a Who's Who of British pop royalty. The drummer Mick Fleetwood and the bassist John McVie were also founding members of Fleetwood Mac. The bassist Jack Bruce joined Mr. Clapton in Cream. The bassist Andy Fraser was an original member of Free. Aynsley Dunbar would go on to play drums for Frank Zappa, Journey and Jefferson Starship.\n\nIn his book \"Clapton: The Autobiography\" (2007), Mr. Clapton described playing in the Bluesbreakers under Mr. Mayall's tutelage as a demanding but rewarding kind of musical finishing school. After leaving the Yardbirds and joining the Mayall band in April 1965, \"grateful that someone saw my worth,\" he wrote, he moved into \"a tiny little cupboard room at the top of John's house\" so that he could better soak up all the lessons he wanted Mr. Mayall to teach him.\n\n\"With long curly hair and a beard, which gave him a look not unlike Jesus, he had the air of a favorite schoolmaster who still manages to be cool,\" Mr. Clapton recalled. \"He had the most incredible collection of records I had ever seen,\" and \"over the better part of a year, when I had any spare time, I would sit in this room listening to records and playing along with them, honing my craft.\"\n\nThe one album that Mr. Clapton recorded with Mr. Mayall, \"Blues Breakers\" (1966), is often credited with kick-starting the electric blues boom of the 1960s among young Americans and Britons. With songs by Robert Johnson, Otis Rush, Freddie King and Ray Charles, as well as Mr. Mayall himself, the album provided a repertoire, arrangements and a thick guitar sound that would be widely copied by hundreds of bands in both countries. In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine ranked \"Blues Breakers\" No. 195 on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\"\n\nJohn Mayall was born in Macclesfield, England, just outside Manchester, on Nov. 29, 1933. His father, Murray, who played guitar in local pubs and collected records, and his mother, Beryl, stimulated his interest in music, but he trained as an artist and graphic designer at the Manchester College of Art and, after doing military service in Korea, worked for several years for advertising agencies. (He would later put that experience to use by designing the covers of many of his albums.)\n\nMr. Mayall was already 30 when he decided to become a full-time musician and moved to London, where performers like Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies had already carved out a niche for the blues. Financially, it was tough going: Even when he had future stars like Mr. Clapton, Mr. Green and Mr. Taylor in his band, the Bluesbreakers followed a grueling routine of touring by van and playing short engagements on cramped stages in small clubs, often for audiences of only a few dozen people.\n\nBut after guitarists everywhere took notice of the \"Blues Breakers\" album and its equally influential follow-up, \"A Hard Road\" (1967), featuring Mr. Green, Mr. Mayall's horizons expanded. He started touring regularly in the United States and Europe: \"The Diary of a Band,\" a two-disc set recorded live in the Netherlands and other locales with Mr. Taylor, was released officially, and performances at the Fillmore West and in Germany and Italy eventually circulated in bootleg versions.\n\nIn 1969, after recording the album \"Blues From Laurel Canyon\" and befriending members of the American blues band Canned Heat, Mr. Mayall moved to Los Angeles, where he lived for the rest of his life. That led to a fundamental shift in the composition of his bands, with British musicians giving way to Americans.\n\nHis first \"American\" group included Harvey Mandel on guitar and Sugarcane Harris on electric violin. Later units featured the guitarists Sonny Landreth, Walter Trout and Coco Montoya, all of whom went on to successful solo careers.\n\nMr. Mayall had already begun moving away from what Mr. Clapton called his \"textbook blues\" style before coming to the United States, forming the jazzy, drummerless acoustic band that recorded \"The Turning Point\" in 1969. In the 1970s, however, he would go deeper into, as the title of a 1972 album put it, a \"Jazz Blues Fusion,\" working with jazz musicians like the trumpeter Blue Mitchell and the saxophonists Ernie Watts and Red Holloway.\n\nBut Mr. Mayall never abandoned the blues altogether, and in the 1980s he re-formed the Bluesbreakers, with which he would continue to tour and record, with constantly shifting personnel, well into the 21st century. In some editions of the band, he was joined by alumni like Mr. Taylor and Mr. McVie; Mr. Clapton would occasionally play with him as well.\n\nIn all, Mr. Mayall released more than 70 albums, the most recent of which was \"The Sun Is Shining Down\" (2022). He also issued several DVDs, including one of a 70th-birthday concert in 2003 at which he was joined by many of his most prominent former sidemen.\n\nHe is survived by his children, Gaz, Jason, Red, Ben, Zak and Samson; seven grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren. His two marriages ended in divorce.\n\nIn 1979, a fire destroyed Mr. Mayall's house in Los Angeles. Lost in that blaze was most of the record collection that had so impressed Mr. Clapton and other blues initiates, which by that time had grown to include thousands of discs, including many rare 45 and 78 r.p.m. blues singles, as well as many of the live tapes Mr. Mayall had made of his own bands in the 1960s.\n\nIn 2014, Mr. Mayall sat down for an evening-long interview at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles, in which he reminisced about the challenges of being a crusader for the blues in London in the early 1960s. He recalled playing 11 shows a week in \"dens of iniquity\" and having to persuade Mr. McVie's parents to let their son, who was underage at the time, join his band.\n\n\"It was extremely exciting,\" he said of those times. \"We all felt we were part of the same family and that we really were connecting with people, a new generation of people, and also having a great time playing. You just continually played; it wasn't worth going home.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Mayall's name was writ large on the album cover with many of the songs credited to John Mayall's Bluesbreakers, including the T-Bone Walker classic 'They Call It Stormy Monday' and Mayall's own 'Key To Love.'\n\nJohn Mayall's career had begun in earnest long before then when in 1963 he moved to London at the age of 30 to become a professional musician amid the rhythm and blues boom of that period. The Bluesbreakers were formed around this time, a band helmed by Mayall including John McVie who went on to even greater fame with Fleetwood Mac.\n\nAs their reputation grew John Mayall's Bluesbreakers line-up constantly rotated and amongst those who played with the band in the mid-to-late '60s were Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce - who both went on to form Cream with Ginger Baker - Mick Taylor who would later join The Rolling Stones and Peter Green who formed Fleetwood Mac in 1967.\n\nWith John Mayall on vocals, keyboards, harmonica, and rhythm guitar, the Bluesbreakers released four albums between 1966-68 all of which reached the top 10 in the UK album charts. The last of these albums, Bare Wires featured Mick Taylor on lead guitar. After this, Mayall moved to California and there would not be another album from Mayall featuring the name Bluesbreakers for 17 years.\n\nDuring the 1970s, John Mayall's musical styles moved into the areas of jazz, funk and pop before he restored the name of the Bluesbreakers in 1984 with a line-up that included the twin lead guitars of Walter Trout and Coco Montoya.\n\nThe first time that I saw John Mayall in concert was at the Victoria Theatre in Halifax in May 2000 when he joined Peter Green - who was supporting him on that tour - for a brilliant rendition of Robert Johnson's 'Sweet Home Chicago' that owed much to Mayall's blistering harmonica solo.\n\nI was to see John Mayall on one further occasion, in 2007 at the Rhythm Festival in Bedfordshire a year before he permanently retired the Bluesbreakers, though he was to continue touring and recording regularly until two years ago. His final studio album The Sun Is Shining Down was released in February 2022.\n\nPhotos of John Mayall taken at the Rhythm Festival in August 2007.", "source": {"uri": "godisinthetvzine.co.uk",

After graduating from the Manchester College of Art, he maintained a side hustle playing with local musicians.\n\nIn 1963, he founded the Bluesbreakers with drummer Peter Ward, bassist John McVie (who would later join Fleetwood Mac) and guitarist Bernie Watson. Together they helped bring the sound of American Delta blues -- artists like Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker and Elmore James -- to English venues and audiences. In 1965, Eric Clapton, who'd quit the Yardbirds, joined the lineup.\n\n\"The blues fitted in with the early '60s, the social way of life at the time,\" Mayall explained to The Guardian in 2014. \"Things were changing anyway - in fashion, art, political views. ... It happened here, rather than in America, because at the time, the scene in America was racially segregated - over there, never the twain would meet. In Europe, however - not just England - the Black blues began to be heard by an audience that was not listening to them in America.

The band dissolved for good in 2008, but Mayall continued to record and perform.\n\nWatch John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers Perform in 1970\n\nCollectively with the Bluesbreakers and on his own, Mayall released 35 studio albums and 34 live ones.

In 2024, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the musical influence category.\n\n\"I don't really have any favorites,\" Mayall, looking back on his career, said in a 2022 interview with Blues Blast Magazine. \"I've just enjoyed playing with different people because of what they bring to the palette.

We were all so dedicated to where this music came from and the injustice of the fact that the blues was not appreciated in America. We were damned if we were going to let it go on being unnoticed.\"\n\nMayall, who has died aged 90, did more than most to get the blues noticed in the UK. He composed music, sang, and played several instruments, but above all he was a bandleader, notably with the Bluesbreakers. Ever alert to musicians who might realise his ideas while developing their own, he employed leading blues players across two generations, from Clapton and Peter Green to Walter Trout.\n\nBorn in Macclesfield, Cheshire, John was the son of Beryl (nee Leeson) and Murray Mayall, who played the guitar in pubs. As a boy he absorbed his father's records of Leadbelly and the boogie-woogie pianist Albert Ammons, and learned to play the piano, guitar and harmonica. After army service in Korea and four years at the Regional College of Art in Manchester (now Manchester School of Art), where he formed his first band, the Powerhouse Four, he worked as a graphic designer and led a group called the Blues Syndicate.\n\nIn 1963, encouraged by the blues aficionado and bandleader Alexis Korner, he moved to London, formed the Bluesbreakers and played regularly at the Flamingo club in Soho. Signed to Decca Records, he made his first single in 1964 and the LP John Mayall Plays John Mayall in 1965. Soon afterwards he hired Clapton, who had just left the Yardbirds.\n\nMayall had always been a record collector - I remember him as a fellow searcher for rare American blues 45s at Transat Imports, a fitfully open basement shop off Leicester Square - and at Decca he found another, the producer Mike Vernon. In 1966 they collaborated on Blues Breakers, the most momentous album in British blues history, revealing the 21-year-old Clapton's precocious talent. \"If the blues prophets were Mayall and Korner, and the god Clapton,\" wrote Clapton's biographer Harry Shapiro, \"then this album was the bible.\"\n\nBy the time it was released, Clapton had left to form Cream. He was succeeded by Green, heard on A Hard Road (1966), which got to No 10 in the UK album charts, then by Mick Taylor, who played on Crusade (1967), which reached No 8 and was perhaps the early Bluesbreakers' most cohesive performance as well as the best showcase of Mayall's sometimes inconsistent singing. Through the band's ranks also passed the bassist John McVie and the drummer Mick Fleetwood, on their way, with Green, to found Fleetwood Mac.\n\nOn a scene where many musicians were drugged, drunk or disordered, Mayall had a reputation as a no-nonsense boss, with what Shapiro tactfully called \"a finely tuned sense of discipline\". Band members who broke his rules were summarily fired. The drummer Aynsley Dunbar responded to his sacking by forming a band called Retaliation. For Clapton, however, Mayall was a father figure; his was the one band where he felt most at home. \"John has run an incredibly great school for musicians,\" he said. \"Most of the people that have gone through it have turned out pretty well.\"\n\nBut the curriculum of Mayall's blues academy was not set in stone: though he started out as a devotee of Chicago blues, he was receptive to other strains of American music. The pastoral textures of the album Bare Wires (1968), which reached No 3 in the UK charts, glinted with light refracted through Charles Mingus or early Ornette Coleman, while on The Turning Point (1969) he used the acoustic guitarist Jon Mark \"to explore seldom-used areas within the framework of low volume music\".\n\nBy the end of 1970, with the Bluesbreakers in abeyance, Mayall had moved to Laurel Canyon in Los Angeles. From that point onwards he employed American musicians on various recording projects: the guitarist Harvey Mandel and the bassist Larry Taylor from the blues band Canned Heat, older jazz players such as the violinist Sugarcane Harris, the trumpeter Blue Mitchell and the tenor saxophonist Red Holloway.\n\nThrough five decades he recorded prolifically, making more than 50 albums (not counting reissues and bootlegs), toured regularly and wrote incessantly. From the start of his career he had mixed the older blues repertoire with original compositions, some of them tributes to musicians he revered, such as Leadbelly, John Lee Hooker, Elmore James, Jimmy Reed and, especially, JB Lenoir. But despite his respect for his forerunners, he found it hard in his own songwriting to match their colloquial ease.\n\nIn 1979 a fire at his home destroyed much of his archives, a catastrophe he relived in the song Lost and Gone. \"The late 70s and early 80s were a pretty rough time not just for me, but for a lot of blues players getting record deals,\" he recalled, yet from 1975 to 1979 he released nine albums. In 1982 he re-formed the Bluesbreakers with Taylor and McVie for an extended world tour. The response encouraged him to maintain the band, for which he hired Trout and Coco Montoya, succeeded in 1993 by Buddy Whittington, who helped refresh the band's sound on albums such as Spinning Coin (1995) and Padlock on the Blues (1999).\n\nOn Along for the Ride (2001) he was reunited with Green, Taylor, McVie and Fleetwood, and in 2003 a 70th birthday concert in Liverpool, celebrating the music of his early career, put him back on stage with Clapton. From 2009 to 2016 he had a settled lineup with the guitarist Rocky Athas. In 2018 Carolyn Wonderland became his lead guitarist.\n\nHe was appointed OBE in 2005. In 2016 he was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, and earlier this year into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. His autobiography Blues from Laurel Canyon: My Life As a Bluesman, written with Joel McIver, was published in 2019. Three years later his \"epic road dog days\" came to an end, and he released his final studio album, The Sun Is Shining Down.\n\nHis marriages to Pamela Heap and the musician Maggie Parker ended in divorce. He is survived by six children, Gaz, Jason, Red, Ben, Zak and Samson, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

We were all so dedicated to where this music came from and the injustice of the fact that the blues was not appreciated in America. We were damned if we were going to let it go on being unnoticed.\"\n\nMayall, who has died aged 90, did more than most to get the blues noticed in the UK. He composed music, sang, and played several instruments, but above all he was a bandleader, notably with the Bluesbreakers. Ever alert to musicians who might realise his ideas while developing their own, he employed leading blues players across two generations, from Clapton and Peter Green to Walter Trout.\n\nBorn in Macclesfield, Cheshire, John was the son of Beryl (nee Leeson) and Murray Mayall, who played the guitar in pubs. As a boy he absorbed his father's records of Leadbelly and the boogie-woogie pianist Albert Ammons, and learned to play the piano, guitar and harmonica. After army service in Korea and four years at the Regional College of Art in Manchester (now Manchester School of Art), where he formed his first band, the Powerhouse Four, he worked as a graphic designer and led a group called the Blues Syndicate.\n\nIn 1963, encouraged by the blues aficionado and bandleader Alexis Korner, he moved to London, formed the Bluesbreakers and played regularly at the Flamingo club in Soho. Signed to Decca Records, he made his first single in 1964 and the LP John Mayall Plays John Mayall in 1965. Soon afterwards he hired Clapton, who had just left the Yardbirds.\n\nMayall had always been a record collector - I remember him as a fellow searcher for rare American blues 45s at Transat Imports, a fitfully open basement shop off Leicester Square - and at Decca he found another, the producer Mike Vernon. In 1966 they collaborated on Blues Breakers, the most momentous album in British blues history, revealing the 21-year-old Clapton's precocious talent. \"If the blues prophets were Mayall and Korner, and the god Clapton,\" wrote Clapton's biographer Harry Shapiro, \"then this album was the bible.\"\n\nBy the time it was released, Clapton had left to form Cream. He was succeeded by Green, heard on A Hard Road (1966), which got to No 10 in the UK album charts, then by Mick Taylor, who played on Crusade (1967), which reached No 8 and was perhaps the early Bluesbreakers' most cohesive performance as well as the best showcase of Mayall's sometimes inconsistent singing. Through the band's ranks also passed the bassist John McVie and the drummer Mick Fleetwood, on their way, with Green, to found Fleetwood Mac.\n\nOn a scene where many musicians were drugged, drunk or disordered, Mayall had a reputation as a no-nonsense boss, with what Shapiro tactfully called \"a finely tuned sense of discipline\". Band members who broke his rules were summarily fired. The drummer Aynsley Dunbar responded to his sacking by forming a band called Retaliation. For Clapton, however, Mayall was a father figure; his was the one band where he felt most at home. \"John has run an incredibly great school for musicians,\" he said. \"Most of the people that have gone through it have turned out pretty well.\"\n\nBut the curriculum of Mayall's blues academy was not set in stone: though he started out as a devotee of Chicago blues, he was receptive to other strains of American music. The pastoral textures of the album Bare Wires (1968), which reached No 3 in the UK charts, glinted with light refracted through Charles Mingus or early Ornette Coleman, while on The Turning Point (1969) he used the acoustic guitarist Jon Mark \"to explore seldom-used areas within the framework of low volume music\".\n\nBy the end of 1970, with the Bluesbreakers in abeyance, Mayall had moved to Laurel Canyon in Los Angeles. From that point onwards he employed American musicians on various recording projects: the guitarist Harvey Mandel and the bassist Larry Taylor from the blues band Canned Heat, older jazz players such as the violinist Sugarcane Harris, the trumpeter Blue Mitchell and the tenor saxophonist Red Holloway.\n\nThrough five decades he recorded prolifically, making more than 50 albums (not counting reissues and bootlegs), toured regularly and wrote incessantly. From the start of his career he had mixed the older blues repertoire with original compositions, some of them tributes to musicians he revered, such as Leadbelly, John Lee Hooker, Elmore James, Jimmy Reed and, especially, JB Lenoir. But despite his respect for his forerunners, he found it hard in his own songwriting to match their colloquial ease.\n\nIn 1979 a fire at his home destroyed much of his archives, a catastrophe he relived in the song Lost and Gone. \"The late 70s and early 80s were a pretty rough time not just for me, but for a lot of blues players getting record deals,\" he recalled, yet from 1975 to 1979 he released nine albums. In 1982 he re-formed the Bluesbreakers with Taylor and McVie for an extended world tour. The response encouraged him to maintain the band, for which he hired Trout and Coco Montoya, succeeded in 1993 by Buddy Whittington, who helped refresh the band's sound on albums such as Spinning Coin (1995) and Padlock on the Blues (1999).\n\nOn Along for the Ride (2001) he was reunited with Green, Taylor, McVie and Fleetwood, and in 2003 a 70th birthday concert in Liverpool, celebrating the music of his early career, put him back on stage with Clapton. From 2009 to 2016 he had a settled lineup with the guitarist Rocky Athas. In 2018 Carolyn Wonderland became his lead guitarist.\n\nHe was appointed OBE in 2005. In 2016 he was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame, and earlier this year into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. His autobiography Blues from Laurel Canyon: My Life As a Bluesman, written with Joel McIver, was published in 2019. Three years later his \"epic road dog days\" came to an end, and he released his final studio album, The Sun Is Shining Down.\n\nHis marriages to Pamela Heap and the musician Maggie Parker ended in divorce. He is survived by six children, Gaz, Jason, Red, Ben, Zak and Samson, seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.\n\n* John Brumwell Mayall, musician, born 29 November 1933; died 22 July 2024",

A singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist, Mayall was a central player in the 1960s British blues scene that birthed groups like the Rolling Stones, the Animals, and the Yardbirds. Originally from the Northwest of England, he rose to fame leading long-running London outfit the Bluesbreakers, whose pioneering blues-rock sound introduced the world to several of rock's biggest stars, including Eric Clapton, the Rolling Stones' Mick Taylor, and Fleetwood Mac's Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, and Peter Green.\n\nClose collaborators remember him as a passionate and scholarly devotee of Black-American music who turned an entire generation of British musicians onto the blues, one of the cornerstones of rock music. \"When you went around to John Mayall's house, it was a shrine to the blues,\" Fleetwood told Fairfax Media Australia in 2015. \"He'd sit you down, almost like a school teacher, and he'd bring out this vinyl.\" Clapton shared Fleetwood's impression of Mayall as an eccentric mentor figure. \"With long curly hair and a beard, which gave him a look not unlike Jesus, he had the air of a favourite schoolmaster, while still managing to be cool,\" he wrote in his autobiography. \"He didn't drink and he was a health-food fanatic and the first proper vegetarian I had ever met.\"\n\nInspired by the Chicago and Mississippi blues records he fell in love with as a teen, Mayall developed a distinctive songwriting style that was both heavily indebted to an American art form and uniquely British. A self-taught musician who sang in a Northern British accent and played guitar, piano, and harmonica, among other instruments, he released almost seventy albums across his 60-year career. In the 1960s and 1970s, his idiosyncratic take on the blues made him a fixture in the UK and US rock charts, most notably with his 1969 acoustic album The Turning Point, which was certified gold in the US.\n\nInstead of sticking to traditional blues themes like unfaithful women or bad luck, Mayall distinguished himself by writing about the world around him. On \"Nature's Disappearing,\" from 1970, he tackled pollution; on \"Plan Your Revolution,\" another track from that year, he sang about constructive political and social change. More recently, on \"World Gone Crazy\" from 2014, he explored the relationship between religious conflict and war. \"The blues singer should sing songs about his own life,\" he told The Guardian in 2014. \"I've never thought the blues was a matter of copying other people. You've got to think about representing your own life in the music.\"\n\nMayall remained something of a \"musician's musician\" for most of his career, destined to be eclipsed in name recognition by artists who had graduated from his famed blues academy. \"That's been the story of my life,\" he told ABC Radio in 2016. \"I'm kind of an underground figure even today, and people haven't really cottoned on in the general public.\" That didn't mean that his influence on rock and blues alike wasn't profound. As The Guardian put it in 2014, \"No Brit can be rightly called an institution in the history of the blues like John Mayall.\"\n\nThe eldest of three children, John Brumwell Mayall was born in 1933 in Macclesfield, Cheshire, to parents Murray and Beryl Mayall. His father was a jazz aficionado and amateur musician who collected 78 rpm records and stringed instruments. At ten, inspired by British singer and wartime movie star George Formby, Mayall picked up a ukulele he found in the house and began teaching himself to play.\n\nBy the time he was fifteen, Mayall's obsession with Formby had given way to an interest in Black-American boogie-woogie, a blues-based, piano-driven style of dance music that emerged in 1920s Texas. He began teaching himself to play blues songs on his family's piano and using money he earned from a part-time job as a window dresser to purchase records by American artists like Lead Belly and Blind Lemon Jefferson. \"My record collection reflected my obsession with the piano, and I rounded up any record that had the word 'boogie' in it,\" he would recall in his 2019 autobiography, Blues From Laurel Canyon, which he wrote with Joel McIver.\n\nAfter a stint in the British Army, where he played guitar in a ship band during a two-year assignment in Korea, he returned to Macclesfield and made his first recording, a direct-to-disc boogie-woogie piano tune he captured in someone's front room. Over the next five years, he studied photography at Manchester's Regional College of Art and played in a succession of local blues and jazz groups with names like the Blackfriars Society Jazz Band, the House of Sound, and the Powerhouse Four. Through a job as a concert photographer at Manchester's Free Trade Hall, he continued expanding his network, at one point hosting a private performance by Tennessee country-blues musician Brownie McGhee, one of his idols, at his home.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Mayall was working as a typographer at an advertising agency when he became curious about a new sound that was sweeping London's bar and club scene: Helmed by acts like Blues Incorporated and the Cyril Davis All Stars, it was a raucous fusion of rock & roll, jazz, and American rhythm and blues. When Blues Incorporated came to Manchester for a show in 1962, Mayall was struck that a British band could make music with such an authentic American feel. \"I went home buzzing with ideas and ambitions,\" he wrote in his autobiography.\n\nMayall wasn't the only person who experienced the show as a revelation. Following the concert, he was approached by several like-minded local musicians about forming a new group, based on the idea of using American blues as its source material. The band ended up being called the Blues Syndicate, and Mayall, who sang and contributed piano and harmonica, became its creative nucleus, blending original songs he wrote with covers of authentic American blues songs. With the Beatles, from nearby Liverpool, just breaking on the UK music scene, it was an exciting time to be a young musician in the Northwest of England. \"The Beatles paved the way for the next influential wave to hit America,\" he wrote in his memoir. \"England's take on the blues.\"\n\nEventually, Blues Syndicate played a show in Manchester opening for Blues Incorporated, whose line-up at the time included future Cream members Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker. After the show, frontman Alexis Korner encouraged Mayall to move to London. He relocated just a few weeks later, quickly forming a new band called John Mayall & The Bluesbreakers. After he settled on a stable line-up that included McVie, a bass player from West London, the group quickly became a fixture on the city's R&B scene, which centered around hip nightspots like the Flamingo and the Marquee. \"There was so much energy with people coming from all over the country to get their start in the London clubs and branch out from there,\" Mayall told Ultimate Classic Rock in 2013. \"You had The Animals from Newcastle and Spencer Davis and Steve Winwood from Birmingham... people came from all over.\"\n\nBefore long, the Blues Syndicate had caught the attention of Decca, the storied London record company that was then home to the Rolling Stones. Though it would later be known as one of the musician's signature songs, the group's Mayall-penned first single for the label, \"Crawling Up a Hill,\" didn't make too many waves upon its 1964 release -- its high tempo blues progression and wailing harmonica notwithstanding. But the group's profile continued to rise after a UK tour with American blues legend John Lee Hooker, who would become a lifelong friend of Mayall's. \"When you're working with your heroes, it's a great experience,\" Mayall explained to the website pennyblackmusic in 2019. \"You learn a lot from them about dynamics, without sitting down and talking about it, just by experiencing it alone.\"\n\nThe Bluesbreakers quickly became known for their passionate and energetic live performances. One of them, at a London club called Klook's Kleek, became the basis of the group's first LP for Decca, John Mayall Plays John Mayall, which consisted mainly of original material. But it was the group's 1966 debut studio album, Blues Breakers, that would come to be remembered as a big-bang moment in pop music history. Featuring long solos and distorted guitar lines, with a sound that was louder and more aggressive than the traditional blues, it was the dawn of a genre called blues rock. \"Trad jazz had been ruling the roost for at least ten years and the new generation were looking for something else,\" Mayall told Forbes magazine in 2019. \"A new thing was born.\"\n\nMayall had made a major change to the band's lineup by then, bringing in a 20-year-old Surrey-born guitarist named Eric Clapton, who'd been working on a construction site after a stint playing with the Yardbirds. Clapton's dazzling fretwork and magnetic stage presence breathed new energy into the group. \"Our profile escalated after Eric joined us,\" wrote Mayall in his memoir. \"Thanks to Eric, there was a marked increase in the prevalence of girls at every show.\"\n\nDespite their 11-year age difference, Mayall found a kindred spirit in Clapton. \"He was the first person that I could relate to who had some experience with what the blues was all about,\" Mayall told Forbes. In his memoir, Clapton describes Mayall as something of a father figure. \"Until I came along, he had been quite isolated in his musical tastes, and now he'd found someone just as serious about the blues as he was.\" Their chemistry was apparent on \"I'm Your Witchdoctor,\" from 1965; the first single they recorded together, it was also one of the first records in rock history to feature guitar feedback.\n\nWhen Blues Breakers came out a year later, Mayall gave Clapton equal billing. \"I had decided that as Eric was such a focal point of the band, he should get the credit in a big way for the sound of the tracks,\" Mayall explains in his autobiography. The album would come to be known as the \"Beano\" album, because it featured the guitarist reading the Beano comic on its front cover. Its sound was defined equally by its loose, improvisatory approach and the plaintive emotional cries emanating from Clapton's raspy guitar, most notably on the band's inspired cover of Otis Rush's \"All Your Love.\"\n\n\"We were only doing what we did every night in the clubs and were left to our own devices really,\" Mayall recalled to Ultimate Classic Rock in 2013. \"We just got on with it, and the whole thing ended up being completed in three days, which felt normal to us.\" The album rocketed into the Top 10 of the UK albums chart; in 2003, Rolling Stone would feature it in its 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time issue, at 195.\n\nAfter Clapton left the band in 1966 to form the supergroup Cream, Mayall replaced him with Peter Green, a guitarist from London who was noted for his sweet tone and expressive note-bending. He'd previously played a few gigs with the Bluesbreakers, deputizing for Clapton. \"To my ears, his playing was a revelation,\" Mayall declared in his memoir. \"He played the blues with the purest tone I'd heard since Eric left. The old sound, spirit, and intensity of the Bluesbreakers were back.\"\n\nOn the group's next album, A Hard Road, Green-penned instrumental \"The Supernatural\" showcased the guitarist's soaring melodic lines and distinctive use of sustain. Though the album made the UK Top 10, it would be the last Green would make for the group. In 1967, he would join bassist John McVie and drummer Mick Fleetwood, two other former Bluesbreakers members, in starting a new band called Fleetwood Mac.\n\nBy this point, Mayall was beginning to earn renown as a talent-spotter -- especially when it came to guitarists. That happened once again in 1967, when Mayall brought on an unknown 18-year-old to fill Green's shoes: an untested guitarist from Hertfordshire named Mick Taylor who'd once stepped in for Clapton at a gig. Taylor would stay on until 1969, when he replaced Brian Jones in the Rolling Stones -- on Mayall's recommendation.\n\nCrusade, one of three albums Taylor recorded with the group, was Mayall's first LP to chart in the US, marking the beginning of the country's long love affair with the Macclesfield bluesman. By this time, Mayall had begun branching out to explore new musical territory -- most notably with his 1967 experimental solo album, The Blues Alone, where he played all the instruments except for percussion. But the multi-instrumentalist's fame rested on his work with the Bluesbreakers; following the group's first U.S. tour in 1968, Mayall returned home to discover he had been voted the number-one blues artist in a readers' poll by British music paper Melody Maker.\n\nSmitten by America, Mayall returned to Los Angeles on vacation, where he befriended Frank Zappa and hung out with local blues-rockers Canned Heat. His West Coast sojourn would be a pivotal one, culminating in the release of Blues from Laurel Canyon, a 1968 travelog-style concept album where, in an innovative move for a blues musician, each track segued seamlessly into the next. In 1969, his love for Laurel Canyon would lead him to purchase a house there. Though he traveled frequently back to England, he would live in the Hollywood Hills for the rest of his life.\n\nSeemingly out of nowhere, he shocked fans by dissolving the Bluesbreakers. \"I felt that I had taken the lead guitar, organ, bass and drums line-up as far as it could go, and coupled with my imminent move to Los Angeles, it seemed that now would be a good time to change things up,\" he wrote in his autobiography.\n\nIt was the start of a new chapter for Mayall: In 1969, he released a solo live album for Polydor called The Turning Point, which went gold and put Mayall in the Top 40 of the US albums chart. An all-acoustic affair, he described it in the liner notes as an attempt to make \"low volume music\" that didn't feature \"heavy lead guitar and drums.\" \"Room To Move,\" an infectious number featuring keening harmonica and vocal percussion noises, remains one of Mayall's most popular tunes.\n\n\"These were beautiful days,\" he wrote of this period in the States, where he began playing before larger and larger audiences on tour. \"We were experiencing America's rich, open rock'n'roll world and the ladies who came forth to greet us and make us feel like visiting royalty were most welcome.\" The attention led him to write a song called \"Groupie Girl\"; it also went hand-in-hand with an increasingly hedonistic lifestyle, especially for a man who claimed he didn't drink when he started the Bluesbreakers. According to his memoir, Mayall would become a heavy drinker for thirteen years -- though he maintains that he didn't do drugs. \"My alcoholic excesses were seriously out of control,\" he wrote.\n\nMusically, Mayall continued to experiment, recording his next album, 1970's USA Union, with a new drummer-less band that included ex-Mothers Of Invention violinist Don \"Sugarcane\" Harris; it became his highest-charting album in America, reaching number 22 in the Billboard 200. For his follow-up, a sprawling 1971 double LP called Back To The Roots, he surprised fans by reuniting with Clapton and Taylor; it was the first in a series of line-up changes during his career in America, vesting Mayall with an air of unpredictability. \"My record label - Polydor at the time - asked me for new albums every few months, it seemed,\" he explained in his autobiography. \"To achieve this I needed to keep the music fresh, and that meant rebuilding my line-up from time to time, particularly after long, exhausting tours.\"\n\nOver the next four decades, Mayall continued to explore his love for the blues in a variety of different contexts. After taking a funkier direction in the late 1970s, he reverted back to blues rock in the 1980s, then revived the Bluesbreakers in the 1990s -- a decade which saw him reunite with his old friend John Lee Hooker, on a 1999 album called Padlock On The Blues. In 2008, he disbanded the Bluesbreakers one last time, though he would continue touring and recording as a solo artist well into his eighties.\n\nIn the last 15 years of his life, Mayall was honored with an OBE award, a medal honoring his contribution to music presented by Queen Elizabeth II in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace. He was also inducted into the Blues Hall Of Fame -- a remarkable achievement for a musician from the Northwest of England, but a fitting one. Mayall didn't just play a central role in introducing British audiences to the sound of the blues; he invented an entirely new take on the form and exported it back to its country of origin, turning a younger generation of Americans on to the joys and exquisite sorrows of the blues.\n\nLooking back on his career in his interview with Ultimate Classic Rock, Mayall spoke with modesty of his role in incubating some of the biggest talents in 20th-century rock music. \"It's just a part of my history,\" he said. \"It really sums up the period of my life when I was in London. It was such a swift turnover of musicians. All of them were just young guys who were just trying to find their feet and I was able to help them along.\"\n\nFleetwood, one of many British musicians who owed a musical debt to Mayall, remembered the whole thing a bit differently. \"He created a platform, a stage, for musicians -- me being one of them -- that needs not to be forgotten,\" he wrote in the foreword to Mayall's biography. \"John's legacy is that he has been true to his schooling as a blues player. He has never compromised that, and he has never pretended to be anything other than that. He has stuck to his guns, and he has placed his love of the blues above anything else.\"", "source": {"uri": "udiscovermusic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "uDiscover Music"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But for scores of music fans, the legendary godfather of British blues has been a hall of famer since the 1960s when his storied band, the Bluesbreakers, was a pivotal launching pad in the careers of at least seven musicians who are now themselves Rock Hall inductees.\n\nThey include Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, who co-founded the pioneering power trio Cream after leaving Mayall's band, and Fleetwood Mac co-founders Peter Green, Mick Fleetwood Mac and John McVie, whose tenure in The Bluesbreakers laid the foundation for Fleetwood Mac.\n\nOther Bluesbreakers' alums who rose to fame after playing in Mayall's band include Rolling Stones' guitarist Mick Taylor and drummer Aynsley Dunbar, who went on to play in the band of former San Diegan Frank Zappa and went on to cofound the group Journey. Both Taylor and Dunbar are also Rock Hall inductees.\n\n\"When you get in John's band, you've pretty much made it to the pinnacle. I mean: Where do you go from there?\" former Bluesbreakers' guitarist Walter Trout said in a 2021 San Diego Union-Tribune interview.\n\nYet, while Mayall was understandably proud of his unerring ability to discover and nurture talented young musicians who went on to have standout careers of their own, he tended to downplay his skills as a talent scout and mentor.\n\n\"It's just great being able to earn a living doing what I love,\" Mayall said in a 2005 Union-Tribune interview. 'I'm not going away. There's this segment that considers me some legendary figure and it's a pleasure to continue playing because of those people.\"\n\nMayall was born in Macclesfield, England, near Manchester, on Nov. 29, 1933. A trained graphic designer and artist, he was 30 when devoted himself to music after a stint serving in the military in Korea. He was soon sharing his love of such American blues greats as Robert Johnson, Sonny Boy Williamson, Otis Rush, J.B. Lenoir with other musicians in England, where he built a loyal following.\n\nThe lineups of Mayall's bands changed constantly and audiences eagerly welcomed the chance to hear the latest hot young musicians he had discovered. After multiple concert tours of the United States, Mayall became a permanent Southern California resident in 1969.\n\nA distinctive, reedy-voiced singer and harmonica player, Mayall also played guitar and keyboards. While he tirelessly championed songs by American blues pioneers, he was an accomplished songwriter whose lyrics had a distinctly personal stamp.\n\n\"If you're gonna sing something, you should sing something personal,\" Mayall said in his 2005 Union-Tribune interview. \"That's what the main feature of the blues is: you tell your story. I've never been a fan of singing about things I have no experience of.\"\n\nMayall performed numerous times in San Diego over the decades, most often at the Belly Up. His final area performance came in 2021 at the Poway Center for the Performing Arts. He was 88 and it was the final tour of his career.\n\nMayall was in declining health at the time and not available for interviews. Our in-depth 2021 feature story on him, which includes quotes from a number of his musical collaborators and severa San Diego musicians, appears in full below.\n\nCream and Fleetwood Mac are just some of the bands whose members found their feet playing in Mayall's famed band, The Bluesbreakers\n\nBy George Varga | george.varga@sduniontribune.com | The San Diego Union-Tribune | December 5, 2021 at 2:01 p.m.\n\nJohn Mayall, the famed \"Godfather of British blues\" and a pivotal musical catalyst for at least seven Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductees, was not yet 34 when he released his fifth album, \"A Hard Road,\" in 1967.\n\nNow, 54 years later, the end of that road appears to be looming for the man whose pioneering band, The Bluesbreakers, served as the launching pad for a bevy of talented young musicians bound for stardom. Some key examples include the Rolling Stones' Mick Taylor, Cream's Eric Clapton and Jack Bruce, and Fleetwood Mac's Peter Green, Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.\n\n\"When you get in John's band, you've pretty much made it to the pinnacle. I mean: Where do you go from there?\" said guitarist Walter Trout, 70, who played with Mayall for much of the 1980s.\n\nMayall's current concert trek includes a Saturday show at Poway Center for the Performing Arts that will also feature Trout and his band. It is one of six dates Mayall is performing between Friday and Dec. 17, after which he has no other shows currently scheduled.\n\nHis next (and possibly last) album, \"The Sun is Shining Down,\" will be released Jan. 28 -- nearly one year to the day after this year's release of his 35-CD career retrospective box set, \"John Mayall: The First Generation.\"\n\nHis pending half dozen concerts could be a bittersweet combination of celebration and reflection for this tireless champion of American blues. Ditto for the three members of his current band and his long-devoted fans.\n\nMayall announced this fall that he is bowing out from touring, although the Woodland Hills-based singer, harmonica player, guitarist and keyboardist hopes to do some periodic one-off gigs in and near Southern California. He moved from his native England to Los Angeles in 1969.\n\n\"I have decided, due to the risks of the pandemic and my advancing age, that it is time for me to hang up my road shoes,\" Mayall, who turned 88 on Monday, said in a Sept. 22 statement.\n\n\"As a result, I will be radically reducing my touring schedule and will be limiting my performances to local shows near my home in California and the occasional concert further afield. My epic road dog days, however, have come to an end.\"\n\nThose days have been epic indeed. The number of concerts Mayall has performed number in the thousands. His career began nearly 60 years ago in England, where he soon earned acclaim as a first-rate band leader, devoted performer and unusually astute judge of young talent.\n\nHis live performances continued almost unabated until May 2019, when -- following an extensive European tour -- a bad case of pneumonia led him to cancel about six weeks of spring concerts in the U.S.\n\nMayall returned to the road that same summer, followed by another tour of Europe in the fall of 2019. He performed four Southern California dates in early 2020, concluding with a gig at Solana Beach's Belly Up. The venue has hosted numerous concerts by Mayall over the past four decades.\n\nHis Belly Up show was followed a few weeks later by an ill-fated trip to London. Mayall performed there on Feb. 25, 2020, at the \"Mick Fleetwood & Friends Celebrate the Music of Peter Green and the Early Years of Fleetwood Mac\" all-star concert.\n\n\"John got COVID at the end of that trip, and he had a bad case of it,\" Jay Davenport, the drummer in Mayall's band since 2008, told the San Diego Union-Tribune.\n\n\"And, then, we didn't play a note of music together for a year-and-a-half because of the pandemic. I think there were some lingering effects (from COVID) and, basically, some health issues. It just felt very dangerous to do a whole lot of traveling. John seemed more fragile.\"\n\n'Still blows my mind'\n\nMayall happily returned to the road in August, performing anywhere from 90 minutes to 2\u00bd hours per concert. His distinctively reedy singing voice and instrumental prowess were seemingly unaffected by his bout with COVID and he earned glowing reviews for his Aug. 22 show at Chicago's City Winery.\n\nBut at least one write-up of his gig in the Windy City noted that Mayall appeared periodically confused by the sequence of songs in his set list. Apart from that, nothing was amiss.\n\n\"John would announce the same song a few times and lose his place in the set list,\" Davenport, 61, said. \"On the other hand ... once he had the right song, he played his ass off!\n\n\"We did four nights in October in Park City, Utah, and he was unbelievable. We did a different set each night, and -- during one of them -- he spontaneously wrote two new songs on stage, real songs, right on the spot, that we performed then and there...\n\n\"He can still go out and play piano and harmonica, in unison, and those are two very different musical and mechanical disciplines. Playing harmonica and piano at the same time isn't like walking and chewing gum at the same time. It's more like walking and building a gum factory at the same time! It still blows my mind he is able to do that.\"\n\nMayall began blowing minds in his native England more than half a century ago. He became a full-time musician in 1963 after serving three years in the English army in Korea, during which time he bought his first guitar while on vacation in Japan.\n\nHis love of vibrant American music began when he was a young art student and heard records by American boogie-woogie piano giants Meade Lux Lewis, Pete Johnson and Albert Ammons. After discovering Lead Belly, Blind Lemon Jefferson and Brownie McGhee, his destiny was set.\n\nMayall was delighted to share songs by the American blues masters he revered with English club and concert audiences, for whom he served as a vital musical gateway. He quickly began writing his own songs as well. Some of his best include \"The Laws Must Change,\" \"Country Road\" and \"Room to Move,\" which became an FM radio staple on American stations in the early 1970s.\n\n\"If you're gonna sing something, you should sing something personal,\" Mayall said in a 2005 Union-Tribune interview. \"That's what the main feature of the blues is -- you tell your story. I've never been a fan of singing about things I have no experience of.\"\n\nReleased in 1969 the chugging, harmonica-driven \"Room to Move\" remains the most popular song by Mayall, an enduring artist who has never had a hit album or single in the U.S.\n\n\"His rhythmic harmonica playing on songs like 'Room to Move' was revelatory,\" said veteran San Diego musician Andy Robinson.\n\n\"With its virtuoso harmonica hook and extended 'mouth percussion' solo, 'Room to Move' had a feel like nothing else,\" agreed Encinitas singer-songwriter JT Moring. \"That song is still a benchmark for the kind of energy I'd like to bring to live performances.\"\n\nThe impact of Mayall's best-known song extends to Jordan Peimer. He is the executive director of the University of California San Diego's ArtPower, which features established and rising blues and jazz artists in its annual performance seasons.\n\n\"As a young music listener 'Room to Move' opened my eyes and ears to something very basic in music that was always there, but which I'd never been able to name before,\" Peimer recalled.\n\n\"As I grew into a curator, I kept the astonishment that Mayall's 'The Turning Point' album -- and, eventually, his live shows -- left with me. ... In a lot of ways, it helped motivate me to create ArtPower's 'The American Routes' series.\"\n\nEric Clapton, Peter Green, Mick Taylor\n\nFrom 1965 on, the lineups of Mayall's Bluesbreakers changed on a regular basis as the young musicians he nurtured left to form their own bands.\n\nMuch like a blues-rocking version of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers, The Bluesbreakers served as a vital incubator for dozens of musicians. The first major turning point came with Mayall's \"Bluesbreakers with Eric Clapton\" album, which was released in 1966 and is informally known as \"The Beano Album.\"\n\nUnder either name, it introduced a generation of young Britons and Americans to Clapton's prodigious guitar skills. It also introduced them to some of the classic American blues songs Mayall treasured, including Robert Johnson's \"Ramblin' On My Mind,\" Otis Rush's \"All Your Love\" and Freddie King's \"Hideaway.\"\n\nClapton soon left to form Cream with drummer Ginger Baker and former Bluesbreakers bassist Jack Bruce. Mayall replaced Clapton with Peter Green, who went on to launch Fleetwood Mac. Green was in turn replaced by the teenaged Mick Taylor, who was hired away by the Rolling Stones in 1969.\n\n\"For me, discovering The Bluesbreakers' 1967 album, 'Crusade,' was a godsend,\" said Billy Thompson, a leading San Diego guitarist and singer now based in Virginia.\n\n\"Mick Taylor played some great and influential guitar on that album. ... Mayall opened doors for me. I learned who many of the great bluesmen were from Mayall and Clapton.\"\n\nBut it wasn't just budding guitar greats who found their footing under Mayall's mentorship.\n\nAt least four drummers -- Hughie Flint, Aynsley Dunbar, Jon Heisman and Keef Hartley -- launched acclaimed bands of their own in England after establishing themselves in The Bluesbreakers. And Dunbar, after moving to California to play in former San Diegan Frank Zappa's band, became a co-founding member of Journey.\n\nThe band Mark-Almond was formed by saxophonist and flutist Johnny Almond and acoustic guitarist Jon Mark soon after they had recorded two standout albums with Mayall, 1969's \"The Turning Point\" and 1970's \"Empty Rooms.\" Those albums preceded by more than a decade the all-acoustic \"Unplugged\" era that MTV began to spotlight in the 1980s.\n\nBy mid-1970, Mayall was leading his first band of American musicians. His 1972 live album, \"Jazz Blues Fusion,\" featured an all-star brass section that he expanded for his 1973 live album, \"Moving On.\"\n\n'An incredible education'\n\n\"It was an incredible education being a Bluesbreaker,\" guitarist Trout said, speaking from his home in Huntington Beach. \"John and The Bluesbreakers made so many iconic albums when I was in high school in the 1960s, and I studied them all. The first time I got up and played with John in the 1980s, we did 'Hideaway' and 'All Your Love,' and I played the Clapton solos, note for note, which I can still do now.\n\n\"At the end of the night, John said: 'Walter, if I wanted Eric I would have called Eric. I love your playing and want you to play the songs the way you want to.' John freed me that night to come into my own as a musician.\n\n\"I learned to be a band leader by watching John. I think he's one of the great band leaders and I'd rank him alongside Count Basie and Duke Ellington; he knows how to put players together who have the right chemistry. And he's like my surrogate dad. I was heavily into drinking and drugging when I got in John's band and he nurtured me, stood by me, and helped me get sober.\"\n\nDrummer Davenport, 61, performed with such Chicago blues greats as Junior Wells, Pinetop Perkins, Sugar Blue and Melvin Taylor before joining Mayall's band in 2008. Unlike a majority of Mayall's audience and band members over the years, Davenport is not White.\n\n\"I'm Black and live in Chicago, and when I went to hang out at a music club Muddy Waters or Junior Wells was sitting at the end of the bar,\" Davenport said. \"So I didn't need to look too far for the kind of music John exposed people to.\n\n\"What John did do was introduce traditional blues to everyone else in this country. I know so many people that heard John play 'Hideaway' and then went searching for the original version by Freddie King.\n\n\"John was able to re-create that music more authentically and made blues palatable to a lot of people here. ... In England, they were really proud that they weren't hung up on the color of the guys playing the music, they were just focused on the music.\"\n\nDavenport credits a combination of skill, tenacity and leadership for sustaining Mayall's career since the 1960s.\n\n\"John is the sweetest man you could ever imagine being your boss,\" Davenport said, speaking from his Chicago area home.\n\n\"It's funny because everyone calls him 'Boss,' dating back to the 'Beano' album in 1966. So while Bruce Springsteen has the title 'The Boss,' John had it first and we still call him Boss. John is a fearless, tireless leader and he has zero ego. He has a steely will to keep doing it as long as he can, so for him to come to this decision (to stop touring) is a big deal for us.\"\n\nThe last word goes, as it should, to Mayall, whose autobiography. \"Blues from Laurel Canyon: My Life as a Bluesman,\" was published in 2019.\n\nMayall's devotion to music was underscored in his September announcement of his retirement from touring and in the enthusiasm he expressed for \"The Sun is Shining Down,\" his upcoming new album.\n\n\"It has been a privilege to have spent my life doing what I love and having you along for the ride with me through all of it. I may not be traveling to your location, but I do want to continue to share my love of the blues with you,\" Mayall said at the time.\n\n\"I'm proud of what we came up with (on the album) and excited to share it with you. I look forward to seeing those of you who can attend my local shows, and I will miss all of you who cannot, but as always, keep loving the blues!\"", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "george_varga@sandiegouniontribune.com", "name": "George Varga", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_San_Diego_Union-Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The San Diego Union-Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aynsley_Dunbar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aynsley Dunbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Green_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Green (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall_&_the_Bluesbreakers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "British blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Bruce", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jack Bruce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mick Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mick Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Trout", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walter Trout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cream (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleetwood_Mac", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fleetwood Mac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Clapton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harmonica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitarist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guitarist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McVie", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John McVie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Rolling Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drummer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Lenoir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Mayall's passing comes less than three months before he was set to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nIn the wake of his death, a variety of well-known musicians have paid tribute to the influential artist. On the top of this list is Eric Clapton.\n\nClapton famously joined Mayall's band The Bluesbreakers after leaving The Yardbirds in 1965.\n\n[RELATED: Blues Icon John Mayall Dies Ahead of His Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction]\n\nClapton played on Mayall & the Bluesbreakers' 1966 debut album, Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton (also known as the \"Beano\" album), before exiting the band and co-founding Cream that same year.\n\nThe guitar great has posted a video homage on his socials in which he shared strong praise, gratitude and affection toward Mayall.\n\nClapton Discussed Mayall's Important Role in His Life and Career\n\n\"I want to say a few words about my friend John,\" Clapton began his message. Continuing he wrote, \"I want to say thank you, chiefly, for rescuing me from oblivion and God knows what. I was a young man, around the age of 18, 19, when I decided that I was gonna quit music. He found me and took me into his home, and asked me to join his band.\"\n\nEric then noted, \"And I stayed with him, and I learned all that I really have to draw on today, in terms of technique and desire to play the kind of music I love to play. I did all my research in his home, in his record collection, the Chicago blues that he was such an expert on.\"\n\nClapton went on the discuss his stint with Mayall's Bluesbreakers.\n\n\"I played with his band for a couple of years, with [drummer] Hughie [Flint] and [bassist] John [McVie], and it was a fantastic experience,\" Eric said. \"And [Mayall] taught me that it was OK just to play the music you wanted to play without dressing it up or making anybody else like it, whether it mattered whether they like it or not. To listen to myself, to my inner motivations.\"\n\nConsidered Mayall a \"Mentor\" and \"Surrogate Father\"\n\nClapton, who grew up without a father, said that Mayall \"was my mentor, and a surrogate father too.\" He added, \"He taught me all I really know, and gave me the courage and enthusiasm to express myself without fear or without limit.\"\n\nApologized for Being a Bad Influence on Mayall\n\nAt this point, the message gets a little dark. Clapton admits that he himself was a bad influence on Mayall.\n\n\"[A]ll I gave [John] in return was how much fun it was to drink and womanize, when he was already a family man,\" Eric shared. \"And I wish to make amends for that. I did that while he was alive, and I've obviously since learned that is not the best way to carry on.\"\n\nConclusion of Clapton's Homage\n\nClapton concluded his homage by saying, \"I shall miss him ... but I hope to see him on the other side.

He was 90.\n\nAmong the fans and organizations posting condolences was the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which was set to induct him into its ranks in October. Although he was not part of the standard voting round, the hall's committee had selected him this year to be ushered in under the Musical Influence Award, along with Alexis Korner and Big Mama Thornton.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame Announces 2024 Inductees: Cher, Jimmy Buffett, Mary J.

Among the players he brought into his bands were such legends as Eric Clapton, Peter Green, Mick Taylor, Jack Bruce, John McVie, Mick Fleetwood and Aynsley Dunbar.\n\nHe was perhaps best known in America for the song \"Room to Move,\" a staple on FM radio in the early '70s.\n\nThat was the song Mayall chose to end his touring career with, at the close of his final concert, which took place March 26, 2022 at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano, Calif.\n\nBeginning his pro career in in London during the early '60s among such purist Brit-blues bandleaders as Alexis Korner (an early sponsor in the English blues clubs), Cyril Davies and Graham Bond, Mayall featured front line players who were among the cream of the highly competitive blues scene.\n\nMusicians attested to what it meant to play with Mayall. \"As far as being a blues-guitar sideman, the Bluesbreakers gig is the pinnacle. That's Mount Everest,\" said Walter Trout. \"You could play with B.B. King or Buddy Guy, but you're just gonna play chords all night. This guy features you. You get to play solos. He yells your name after every song, brings you to the front of the stage, and lets you sing. He creates a place for you in the world.\"\n\nHis own talents were often overshadowed by the legendary musicians who played behind him. Between 1965 and 1969, he employed in succession three staggeringly gifted lead guitarists: Clapton, Green and Taylor.\n\nClapton exited Mayall's unit to found the rock supergroup Cream with bassist Jack Bruce (another of his sidemen) and drummer Ginger Baker. Green himself bowed out of the Bluesbreakers to form Fleetwood Mac with Mayall's onetime rhythm section of Fleetwood and McVie. And, on Mayall's recommendation, teenage phenom Taylor replaced Brian Jones in the Rolling Stones.\n\nFor years, Mayall's blues-rock outfit prevailed as a distinguished finishing school on the order of Miles Davis' jazz bands. Other vets enjoyed noteworthy careers on their own: saxophonist Dick Heckstall-Smith, bassist Tony Reeves and drummer Jon Hiseman founded the horn-driven jazz-rock band Coliseum, while acoustic guitarist Jon Mark and flutist-saxophonist Johnny Almond formed their own eponymous unit.\n\nDuring the Mark-Almond era - a unique period in which Mayall eschewed the use of a trap drummer - the musician released what was probably his best-known American single, the riff-based \"Room to Move\"; the live album from which it was drawn, \"The Turning Point,\" was his lone LP to achieve gold status.\n\nIn the early '70s, Mayall relocated to Los Angeles, where he worked with such notable American blues players as guitarist Harvey Mandel, violinist Don \"Sugarcane\" Harris and bassist Larry Taylor. A 1970 album featuring them, \"USA Union,\" peaked at No. 22, the bandleader's highest chart position.\n\nMayall achieved his greatest eminence as a front man and touring presence in the early '70s, but he remained a tireless road warrior for decades, playing concerts into his 80s. In 1982, he reunited with Mick Taylor and John McVie for a lengthy world tour.\n\nA new edition of the Bluebreakers, founded in 1984, featured a fierce two-guitar lineup of Coco Montoya and Walter Trout that incited new interest in Mayall's music. He also landed a high-profile label deal with Silvertone Records, the U.S. label that refreshed Buddy Guy's blues career.\n\nMayall began the new millennium with a milestone-marking, celebrity-filled album, \"Along for the Ride,\" and a 70th-birthday concert in Liverpool that reunited him with Clapton and Taylor. His latter-day bands included such top guitarists as Sonny Landreth, Robben Ford and Carolyn Wonderland.\n\nHe was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 2005, and was inducted into America's Blues Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nHe was born Nov. 29, 1933, in the midlands city of Macclesfield. His father was an amateur guitarist and jazz enthusiast, and young Mayall fell under the sway of American jazz and blues stars as a youth, teaching himself piano, guitar and harmonica.\n\nAfter an army stint, Mayall enrolled in Manchester College of Art; his design training there later served him - he painted the band portrait for the cover of his 1967 album \"A Hard Road\" and crafted the look of 1969's \"The Turning Point.\"\n\nWhile in school, he formed some semi-professional groups that performed locally and jammed at local all-nighters. After meeting Alexis Korner, the foremost exponent of the early-'60s British blues sound, at a Manchester date, the older musician took him under his wing; in 1963, he began playing in London with the first edition of the Bluesbreakers.\n\nA debut live album for Decca Records featuring Mayall, McVie, drummer Hughie Flint and guitarist Roger Dean failed commercially, but the Bluesbreakers' fortunes soared with the addition of the Yardbirds' dissident lead guitarist Clapton, a rising rock star who was seeking a more purist environment for his playing.\n\nThe second Bluesbreakers album, featuring Clapton, reached the top 10 in the U.K. in 1966 and became a cult hit in the U.S. However, the guitarist seemed unable to commit full-time to Mayall's group, and by 1967 he had been displaced by Peter Bardens' lead guitarist Peter Green, who flexed a similarly powerful Chicago-style electric attack.\n\n\"A Hard Road\" was a potent showcase for Green, whose album-closing instrumental \"The Super-Natural\" served as a blueprint for his later composition \"Black Magic Woman.\" But his time with Mayall was also short-lived, and he wooed his bandleader's rhythm section to form an even harder-edged blues-rock combo, Fleetwood Mac.\n\nProdigious 18-year-old Mick Taylor, who had fatefully sat in with the Bluesbreakers after Clapton failed to show for a 1965 date near London, was recruited to fill Green's slot. He appeared on four Mayall albums between 1967 and 1969. Mayall himself magnanimously suggest Taylor as Brian Jones' replacement in the Stones.\n\nAfter several clamorous years of electric blues power, Mayall abruptly ratcheted down the volume for two albums with Mark and Almond. Though it failed to climb above No. 102 in the States, the novel single \"Room to Move\" remained Mayall's best-recalled tune thanks to plentiful FM airplay; another track featuring the Mark-Almond combine, \"Don't Waste My Time,\" peaked at No. 81 in 1970.\n\nBesides \"USA Union,\" Mayall's most distinctive recordings of his early American epoch included \"Back to the Roots\" (1971), featuring an all-star ensemble including guests Clapton and Taylor, and \"Jazz Blues Fusion\" (1972), a self-descriptive live set with the American jazz and R&B instrumentalists Blue Mitchell and Clifford Solomon.\n\nIn September 1979, a fast-moving brush fire in L.A.'s Laurel Canyon destroyed Mayall's home and consumed all his possessions, including what was reputed to be one of the world's largest and most valuable collections of vintage pornography.\n\nMayall recorded prolifically for Polydor and ABC, among others, through the '70s and '80s with no commercial traction. His Silvertone releases \"Wake Up Call\" (1993) and \"Spinning Coin\" (1995) briefly returned him to prominence.\n\n\"Along for the Ride\" proved his highest-profile release in years, uniting him with such guitar-slinging ex-band mates, peers and acolytes as Green, Taylor, Otis Rush, Gary Moore, Steve Cropper, Steve Miller, Billy Gibbons, Jeff Healey and Jonny Lang.\n\nIn 2019, after retiring from the road, he released \"Nobody Told Me,\" an album that was described as being recorded shortly before a \"health scare.\" Guests on this final effort included Todd Rundgren, Little Steven Van Zandt of the E Street Band, Alex Lifeson from Rush and Joe Bonamassa.\n\nHis final studio album was 2022's \"The Sun Is Shining Down,\" which included such boldface-name guests as Mike Campbell, Marcus King and Buddy Miller. Wrote Thom Jurek in a review for Allmusiccom, \"Hopefully, life goes according to plan and Mayall gets to deliver many more recordings before he's done, because 'The Sun Is Shining Down' sounds hungry and vital. Mayall delivers these rough-and-ready blues like a champ.\" This final effort was nominated for the 2023 Grammys in the category of best traditional blues album.\n\nThe blues masters who preceded Mayall often gave praise for his keeping the genre going. \"John Mayall, he was the master of it,\" said B.B. King, saying that if it weren't for him and other British musicians of his prime era putting their own spin on the blues, \"a lot of us Black musicians in America would still be catchin' the hell that we caught long before.\"\n\nWhen Mayall was named as an inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April, his social media accounts said that he was was pleased to be going into the hall alongside Alexis Korner, \"who, back in 1963, suggested that a living could be made playing the blues in London.\"\n\nMayall is survived by his six children -- Gaz, Jason, Red, Ben, Zak and Samson -- along with seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. His death announcement also mentioned the support of his previous wives, Pamela and Maggie, and a devoted secretary, Jane.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\nAwards Season Calendar (2024-2025): Key Dates and Timeline for Oscars, Emmys, Golden Globes, Grammys, SAG and More\n\nHere's Where To Buy Retro Arcade1Up Cabinets To Re-Live Your Childhood Online\n\nSign up for Variety's Newsletter.

His family confirmed his death on Tuesday, saying that Mayall \"passed away peacefully in his California home\" on Monday.\n\nMayall, a revered singer and multi-instrumentalist often hailed as \"the godfather of British blues,\" was known for his open-door approach, which allowed many of the genre's greats to develop their craft alongside him.The statement, posted on his Facebook page, did not specify a cause of death but acknowledged that \"health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors.\"\n\nJohn Mayall's profound influence on the rock and blues scenes was evident through his work with the Bluesbreakers, a collective that helped launch the careers of several prominent musicians. The band featured future stars such as Eric Clapton, Peter Green (later of Fleetwood Mac), and Mick Taylor (who went on to join the Rolling Stones).\n\nBorn in northern England, Mayall relocated to London in 1963 at the age of 30, abandoning a career as a graphic designer to immerse himself in blues music -- a genre rooted in Black American culture. His decision came at a time when blues was becoming a significant force in the British music scene.\n\nThe release of the Bluesbreakers' debut album in 1966, \"Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton,\" was a milestone. The album blended soulful rock with raw, guitar-driven American blues, featuring covers of songs by Robert Johnson, Otis Rush, and Ray Charles. This record was pivotal in catapulting Clapton to fame and introducing a more authentic and personal style of blues to British audiences.\n\nMayall relocated to California in 1968 and continued to tour extensively, including a significant U.S. tour in 1972. His prolific recording career included seminal albums such as \"Crusade,\" \"A Hard Road,\" and \"Blues From Laurel Canyon\" in the 1960s, with numerous releases following into the 1970s and his most recent album, \"The Sun Is Shining Down,\" in 2022.\n\n'\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

In the 1960s, he formed the band John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, which had over 70 members throughout its inception including Carolyn Wonderland, John McVie, Peter Green, Eric Clapton, Mick Fleetwood, Harvey Mandell and more.\n\n\"We, the Mayall family, cannot thank his fans and long-list of bandmembers enough for the support and love we were blessed to experience secondhand over the last six decades,\" his family noted in their statement Tuesday.\n\nIn April, Mayall was announced as a 2024 inductee into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame for the musical influence award, along with other late blues heroes Alexis Korner and Big Mama Thornton.\n\nIn a 2014 interview with The Guardian, the singer and musician spoke of his love for blues, noting the genre is about \"raw honesty with which (it expresses) our experiences in life, something which all comes together in this music, in the words as well. Something that is connected to us, common to our experiences.\"\n\nHe later spoke about his love of touring in a 2019 interview with Rock & Blues Muse. \"The interaction with the audience is really the most exciting thing about it as well as the music that we create on stage. The fact that we share it with people and we get the reaction and the feel for how it all works out-that's always been a nice thing about live performance,\" he said.\n\nMayall is survived by his six children -- Gaz, Jason, Red, Ben, Zak and Samson -- in addition to seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock and Roll Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolyn_Wonderland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carolyn Wonderland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Green_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Green (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall_&_the_Bluesbreakers", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McVie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John McVie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mick Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eric Clapton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozzy_Osbourne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ozzy Osbourne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Korner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Korner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mama_Thornton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Mama Thornton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muse_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muse (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Women_in_Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Women in Music", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/24/USAT/74523796007-gty-450158134.JPG?auto=webp&crop=2999,1687,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757937", "eventUri": "eng-9757937", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The world of rock music has been in mourning following the devastating news of the iconic figure's passing with tributes pouring in from his peers. However, few of those grieving had the same close relationship with Mayall as Clapton.\n\nAfter leaving The Yardbirds, Clapton joined John Mayall and The Bluesbreakers in 1965, which was a vital opportunity for him to advance as a musician. Although he was already established on the London scene, Mayall took Clapton under his wing and sharpened up the tools in his arsenal that allowed him to become a household name later in his career.\n\nAlthough he was only in The Bluesbreakers for a year, which includes two separate stints as he briefly quit the band, it enhanced his skillset and his reputation. If it wasn't for their brief partnership, Clapton's career could have never materialised, and in his heartfelt eulogy to Mayall, the guitarist recognised this fact.\n\nClapton began his poignant video message by saying: \"About my friend John, who I learned passed last night or sometime yesterday, I want to say thank you chiefly, for rescuing me from oblivion and God knows what. When I was a young man, around the age of 18, 19, when I decided that I was going to quit music, he found me and took me into his home and asked me to join his band.\"\n\nThe Cream founder then explained how Mayall allowed him to stay at his family home during this turbulent time, and expressed his gratitude for letting him explore his record collection. \"I learned all that I really have to draw on today in terms of technique and desire to play the kind of music I love to play. I did all my research in his home, in his record collection, for the Chicago blues that he was such an expert on,\" he emotionally said.\n\nClapton also referred to his time in The Bluesbreakers as a \"fantastic experience\", adding, \"He taught me that it was OK just to play the music you wanted to play without dressing it up or making anybody else like it -- whether it mattered, whether they like it or not, to listen to myself, to my in or out motivations.\"\n\nThe guitarist then referred to Mayall as \"my mentor and a surrogate father\" who \"taught me all I really know and gave me the courage and enthusiasm to express myself without fear or without limit.\" However, Clapton also shared his regret about their relationship, stating, \"And all I gave him in return was how much fun it was to drink and womanise when he was already a family man. And I wish to make amends for that. I did that while he was alive, and I've obviously since learned that that is not the best way to carry on.\"\n\nClapton concluded: \"I shall miss him. I shall miss him, but I hope to see him on the other side. So thank you John. I love you, and I'll see you soon -- but not yet. Not yet, as they say, in the Gladiator movie. God bless you. Thank you.\"\n\nOther notable figures to pay tribute to Mayall include The Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, who shared on X: \"So sad to hear of John Mayall's passing. He was a great pioneer of British blues and had a wonderful eye for talented young musicians, including Mick Taylor - who he recommended to me after Brian Jones died - ushering in a new era for the Stones.\"", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_taysom@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Joe Taysom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall_&_the_Bluesbreakers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Clapton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yardbirds", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Yardbirds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitarist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guitarist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cream (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mick Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Jagger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mick Jagger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Rolling Stones"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/static/uploads/1/2024/07/John-Mayall-Eric-Clapton-Split-Far-Out-Magazine.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757937", "eventUri": "eng-9757937", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 109, "textEnd": 118}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The 20-year-old guitarist found comfort in the arms of John Mayall, who welcomed him into his band, the Bluesbreakers. Within weeks their relatively purist approach to the blues, while not producing hit singles, had put them among the hottest attractions on the UK's club circuit.\n\nIn Mayall, the young blues-hungry audiences knew they were in the presence of a slightly older figure whose knowledge and understanding of the idiom gave him an immense authority. In Clapton they had an idol who was one of their own.\n\nIn those days, it was instructive to see Mayall and his musicians on two occasions either side of Clapton's arrival: the first time on a club tour accompanying the veteran American guitarist T-Bone Walker, playing the role of devoted and self-effacing disciples; the second time, suddenly bathed in the glow of cult worship.\n\nMayall, who has died aged 90, was one of the key progenitors of the British blues movement, a reliable and generous guide to a new generation whose members were devoted to learning the music that had emerged from the juke joints of the Mississippi Delta and the clubs of Chicago's South Side.\n\nHe had come from Manchester to London in 1963 with a record collection that included Muddy Waters, Elmore James, Robert Johnson, Sonny Boy Williamson and many other more obscure bluesmen and women. He and Alexis Korner, a man of similar vintage and tastes, encouraged their acolytes to share and absorb the music they loved, eventually adopting it - in an audacious but ultimately fruitful act of cultural appropriation - as their own language.\n\nOut of Korner's Blues Incorporated and Mayall's Bluesbreakers flowed a stream of prodigies who were soon ready to head off in their own directions. When Clapton left Mayall after a year - and one hugely influential album, Blues Breakers - to form Cream, he was replaced by the 19-year-old Peter Green. When Green left a year later, taking the group's drummer, Mick Fleetwood, and bassist, John McVie, with him to form the first version of Fleetwood Mac, his place was taken by the 17-year-old Mick Taylor. Two years later Taylor would accept an offer from the Rolling Stones.\n\nWhile they were with Mayall, they became the young gods of the club scene: a new generation of note-bending guitar heroes, beautiful long-haired boys whose skills had been attained through long hours of bedroom practice and were now delivered to audiences mesmerised by their virtuosity and the intensity of their demeanour. Thousands of miles and a universe in social conditions away from the land where the blues was born, young adherents in London, Manchester or Newcastle, musicians and fans alike, were adopting a cause, a mission.\n\nAgain like Korner, Mayall was not a figure these new audiences could see as one of their own. Although he had the long hair and clothes of a proto-hippie, there was something benignly professorial about his presence as he accompanied the soaring solos of Clapton, Green or Taylor.\n\nHe wasn't content to churn out Delta blues covers - Mayall originals would fill entire albums, such as 1968's Bare Wires which reached the UK Top 3. But as a blues singer, seated at his keyboards, he had nothing of the visual appeal of younger men then following the same path, including Mick Jagger, Rod Stewart, the Animals' Eric Burdon or the Yardbirds' Keith Relf, who were encumbered by nothing more than a harmonica. Delivering Otis Rush's All Your Love or Elmore James's Dust My Blues in a high, sandpapered voice, he was convincing but hardly as charismatic as the younger generation.\n\nThat never seemed to bother him. He was happy to pursue his own route within the spreading roadmap of the blues, whether adding horns, dispensing with a drummer or making solo records. That chapter of his life, and of the history of the blues in Britain, ended in 1969 when he moved to Los Angeles. By then, he had earned the gratitude of anyone who played in a blues band in the 1960s or watched as a local phenomenon mushroomed into the rock explosion of the next decade and beyond.\n\nFrom his new base in southern California, he continued to recruit interesting musicians for tours, festivals and recording sessions. From Canned Heat, one of the American blues bands following in his footsteps, he took the bassist Larry Taylor and the guitarist Harvey Mandel for a lineup that also featured the violinist Don \"Sugarcane\" Harris. Moving towards jazz, he played with the trumpeter Blue Mitchell and the saxophonists Red Holloway, Ernie Watts and Clifford Solomon. The guitarists Sonny Landreth and Walter Trout were other collaborators at an early stage of their careers.\n\nMayall also switched back and forth between keyboards and guitar while developing his own songwriting in areas that moved away from the blues towards adjacent idioms, including folk, funk and cajun music. His discography eventually encompassed more than 70 albums, including live reunions of musicians from some of his early bands, and in 1993 his album Wake Up Call, featuring Mavis Staples and Buddy Guy, was nominated for a Grammy award.\n\nHis last album, The Sun Is Shining Down, was released in 2022. That year he also gave his final performance with his band at San Juan Capistrano in California. His enduring love of the blues had turned out not to be the investigation of a dead end but the key to a lifelong interest in exploring the music's infinite possibilities.", "source": {"uri":

He was 90.\n\nThe death was confirmed in a statement on Mr. Mayall's official Facebook page. The statement did not give a cause or specify where he died, saying only that he died \"in his California home.\"\n\nThough he played piano, organ, guitar and harmonica and sang lead vocals in his own bands with a high, reedy tenor, Mr. Mayall earned his reputation as \"the godfather of British blues\" not for his own playing or singing but for recruiting and polishing the talents of one gifted young lead guitarist after another.\n\nIn his most fertile period, between 1965 and 1969, those budding stars included Eric Clapton, who left to form the band Cream and eventually became a hugely successful solo artist; Peter Green, who left to found Fleetwood Mac; and Mick Taylor, who was snatched from the Mayall band by the Rolling Stones.\n\nA more complete list of the alumni of Mr. Mayall's band of that era, known as the Bluesbreakers, reads like a Who's Who of British pop royalty. The drummer Mick Fleetwood and the bassist John McVie were also founding members of Fleetwood Mac. The bassist Jack Bruce joined Mr. Clapton in Cream. The bassist Andy Fraser was an original member of Free. Aynsley Dunbar would go on to play drums for Frank Zappa, Journey and Jefferson Starship.\n\nIn his book \"Clapton: The Autobiography\" (2007), Mr. Clapton described playing in the Bluesbreakers under Mr. Mayall's tutelage as a demanding but rewarding kind of musical finishing school. After leaving the Yardbirds and joining the Mayall band in April 1965, \"grateful that someone saw my worth,\" he wrote, he moved into \"a tiny little cupboard room at the top of John's house\" so that he could better soak up all the lessons he wanted Mr. Mayall to teach him.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "larry_rohter@nytimes.com", "name": "Larry Rohter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "British blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lead guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eric Clapton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandleader", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bandleader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Green_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Green (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mick Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cream_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cream (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bassist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleetwood_Mac", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fleetwood Mac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tenor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harmonica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Organ (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_vocalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lead vocalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aynsley_Dunbar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aynsley Dunbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yardbirds", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Yardbirds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall_&_the_Bluesbreakers", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McVie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John McVie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Bruce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Bruce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mick Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Starship", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Starship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Fraser", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Fraser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Zappa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Zappa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Rolling Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drummer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_kit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drum kit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Lessons_and_Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Lessons and Instruction", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/25/multimedia/23mayall-qfhj-print1/23mayall-qfhj-videoSixteenByNine3000-v2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757937", "eventUri": "eng-9757937", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

When he was 14, he enrolled at Manchester's Junior School of Art, where he studied the piano. Later, he honed his guitar skills and picked up the harmonica.\n\nAfter serving three years as an office clerk with the British Army's Royal Engineers, Mr. Mayall embarked on a career as a graphic designer. However, he decided to quit his job to pursue his passion for music, moving to London at the age of 30 to found the Bluesbreakers, a blues rock band best known for its hit \"Room To Move\" from the group's 1969 live album \"The Turning Point.\"\n\nOver the years, the band featured an array of now-renowned artists, including Eric Clapton, Fleetwood Mac's Mick Fleetwood, John McVie and Peter Green, and guitarist Mick Taylor, who later played for the Rolling Stones, among many others.\n\n\"If you go into blues history, you find bands formed around the bandleaders, trying to realise the sound they wanted. They put the band together to enact what they had in mind. The main man chose the musicians to create a specific sound -- I had certain ideas and I needed to go out and find the right people to realise them,\" he said.\n\n\"I was a bandleader in that traditional role, as well as a frontman. I used my ears to pick out what I thought would work, and I suppose that in the long term the careers of the people involved show that I managed to pick out some pretty special people.\"\n\nAfter relocating to Los Angeles in 1969, Mr. Mayall released numerous albums, including \"USA Union\" (1970), \"Back to the Roots\" (1971), and \"Jazz Blues Fusion\" (1972). Recent albums include 2017's \"Talk About That\" and 2019's \"Nobody Told Me.\"\n\nMr. Mayall-who was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005 -- was named among the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame's 2024 inductees.\n\nUpon hearing news of Mr. Mayall's passing, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame took to Instagram to express its condolences.\n\n\"With a rugged individuality and distinctive voice and style, he made visionary recordings that expanded the reach of the blues without ever watering them down,\" the foundation added. \"@johnmayallofficial had a massive impact on rock & roll, inspiring countless musicians and fans with a lifetime's worth of unforgettable and influential music.\"\n\nMr. Mayall is survived by six children, six grandchildren, three great-grandchildren, and a sister, Caroline. Per his family's statement, the musician was also \"surrounded with love by his previous wives, Pamela and Maggie, his devoted secretary, Jane, and his close friends.\"\n\n\"We, the Mayall family, cannot thank his fans and long-list of bandmembers enough for the support and love we were blessed to experience secondhand over the last six decades.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com",

I did all my research in his home, in his record collection.\"\n\nClapton released one LP with Mayall's outfit -- 1966's Blues Breakers With Eric Clapton -- before departing to form Cream; Clapton was ultimately replaced in the Bluesbreakers by Peter Green, who would later found Fleetwood Mac along with Mayall vets McVie and Mick Fleetwood.\n\nOther one-time Bluesbreakers in Mayall's influential group included Jack Bruce, Free's Andy Fraser, Canned Heat's Harvey Mandel, Jesse Ed Davis, and Mick Taylor, who would later join the Rolling Stones on Mayall's endorsement; Mick Jagger acknowledged as much in his own tribute to Mayall Wednesday.\n\n\"So sad to hear of John Mayall's passing,\" Jagger wrote. \"He was a great pioneer of British blues and had a wonderful eye for talented young musicians, including Mick Taylor - who he recommended to me after Brian Jones died - ushering in a new era for the Stones.\"\n\nClapton, who called Mayall his \"mentor,\" added, \"I played with his band for a couple of years, with Hughie [Flint, drummer] and John [McVie, bassist], and it was a fantastic experience. He taught me that it was okay to just play the music you wanted to play without dressing it up or making anybody else like it. To listen to myself.\"\n\n\"He taught me all I really know, and gave me the courage and enthusiasm to express myself without fear, without limit.

He continued to innovate throughout his career, fusing blues and jazz, as well as collaborate, performing with renowned artists such as Blue Mitchell, Red Holloway, Harvey Mandel and Coco Montoya.\n\nOn June 21, 1990, Montoya and Mayall appeared on Letterman, joining The World's Most Dangerous Band led by Paul Shaffer for a scorching performance of \"All My Life,\" originally written by Jimmie Lee Robinson. John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers with Paul Butterfield released the song in 1967. Mayall also included the song on his 1990 album, A Sense of Place.\n\nAdditionally, John chatted with David Letterman after the performance. Mayall talked about some of his famous collaborators and testified to his road warrior ways, \"120 shows a year,\" he noted. As the band had to truck up to New Haven after the Letterman taping, he hilariously pointed out that the Bluebreakers rhythm seciton -- bassist Daniel \"Freebo\" Friedberg and drummer Joe Yuele -- were sitting in the audience, which got a rise out of Dave.", "source": {"uri": "jambase.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "JamBase"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Letterman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Letterman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Montoya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coco Montoya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Green_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Green (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall_&_the_Bluesbreakers", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Night_with_David_Letterman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Late Night with David Letterman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Clapton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harmonica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_instrument", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keyboard instrument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Mandel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Mandel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blue Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Holloway", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red Holloway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aynsley_Dunbar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aynsley Dunbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McVie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John McVie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Bruce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Bruce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mick Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mick Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freebo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freebo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Butterfield", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Butterfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Shaffer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Shaffer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drummer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drummer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bass guitar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Women_in_Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Women in Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Technostress", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Technostress", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands_and_Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Bands and Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.jambase.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/john-mayall-obituary-1480x832.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757937", "eventUri": "eng-9757937", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1990-06-21", "textStart": 196, "textEnd": 209, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

I started singing some blues songs when I was about 14. But I grew up listening to all kinds of music.\n\n\"I was trained in musical theatre, in classical. I loved the popular music of my time, which was the sixties. I loved Big Mama Thornton, Paul Butterfield Blues Band and some old traditional blues material, along with folk music too.\n\n\"I played acoustic guitar and sang in coffee houses. This was in the early seventies where I grew up near Chicago. But I must tell you that blues was not the only genre of music that I loved or participated in. I love all music.\n\n\"Blues has a universal appeal to it that is easily recognised by an audience. So, as a performer, blues is a great vehicle to communicate with your audience. Blues music is relatable.\n\n\"All music is about expressing the human condition. The highs, the lows, the good, the bad, the meaning, the joy, the pain of life!\n\n\"I don't limit myself. I am always taking risks. That is my philosophy about music and about life.\"\n\nMaggie was John's second wife.\n\nHis first wife was named Pamela, but there is very little information about her available in the public domain.\n\nJohn and Maggie got married in 1982.\n\nIn the statement released following John's passing, both of his wives were mentioned.\n\nIt reads: \"Health issues that forced John to end his epic touring career have finally led to peace for one of this world's greatest road warriors.\n\n\"John Mayall gave us 90 years of tireless efforts to educate, inspire and entertain...\n\n\"John is survived by his 6 children, Gaz, Jason, Red, Ben, Zak and Samson, 7 grandchildren and 4 great-grandchildren.\n\n\"He is also surrounded with love by his previous wives, Pamela and Maggie, his devoted secretary, Jane, and his close friends.\n\n\"We, the Mayall family, cannot thank his fans and long-list of band members enough for the support and love we were blessed to experience secondhand over the last six decades.\"\n\nJohn and Maggie divorced after 30 years of marriage.\n\nSince the early eighties, Maggie has taken part in the management of her husband's career.\n\nShe continued to manage John even after the couple divorced.", "source": {"uri": "thescottishsun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Scottish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jimmy_grant@thescottishsun.co.uk", "name":

Classic rock 'n' roll, in particular, has a limited vocabulary, so any new adjustments to the rule book were and are often snaffled up quickly by an onslaught of inspired peers. However, as the leader of The Bluesbreakers, John Mayall launched music forward with a giant leap. His vision was to make the rock musician as prominent as their jazz counterparts.\n\n\"I always make it a point to pick songs on which players really shine,\" he once said. While that might not sound all that revolutionary now, back when the band first emerged in 1963, there might have been rock luminaries like Little Richard being hailed for their brilliance, but rarely were those supporting the star given a share of the spotlight. However, Mayall selflessly figured that ensuring his band were a liberated group of virtuosos was the natural next step to elevating his Mose Allison-inspired songwriting.\n\nWith that in mind, he ended up assorting some of the finest musicians in history. Eric Clapton, John McVie, Mick Taylor, Jack Bruce, Mick Fleetwood, Hughie Flint, Peter Green and more all found themselves in the Bluesbreakers line-up -- all of which now reside as some of the finest musicians in rock 'n' roll history. Mayall taught them an important lesson, too: while he was keen for the song to support their playing, the inverse of that was paramount. \"I write songs about real things,\" he said, \"The subject dictates the mood and it goes from there, really.\"\n\nWell, the mood at the time wasn't quite as happy-clappy as some of the commercial music was making out. Mayall and his band revolutionised this. By letting each player off the leash, serving great honest songs to their fullest potential, things got earthier, heavier, and more downright hard. Future musicians like Joe Perry would feel freed and inspired by this movement, and for the Aerosmith guitarist, one song personifies their sound: 'Steppin' Out'.\n\nEven the title signifies the band's intent, and according to Perry, they nailed it like no other. \"I don't think I've ever heard such intense playing and such a great solo with so much attitude on it,\" he told Guitar World. \"And the tone was revolutionary. Everybody else played with that country twang up 'tiI then. The Beatles had some juice when it came to distortion, but Clapton was finally able to break through those early studio engineers' fear of overloading.\"\n\nThis vibrancy and heaviness was brand-new. The success of the song set rock off on a new path, surely even inspiring The Beatles to attempt things like 'Helter Skelter'. \"He defined the sound that guitarists spend the rest of their lives trying to get,\" Perry added. \"There's so much expression in his phrasing and the harmonics. That song still gives me goosebumps.\"", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_taylor@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Tom Taylor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mayall_&_the_Bluesbreakers", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Richard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Little Richard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classic rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughie_Flint", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hughie Flint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Green_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Green (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McVie", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John McVie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Bruce", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Bruce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mick Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Perry_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Perry (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mick Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuoso", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtuoso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eric Clapton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rock and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helter_Skelter_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helter Skelter (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_World", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guitar World"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosmith", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerosmith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harmonic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distortion_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Distortion (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Beatles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitarist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guitarist"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Punk", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/static/uploads/1/2024/07/John-Mayall-1970-Guitarist-Blues-Musician-2007-Far-Out-Magazine.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757937", "eventUri": "eng-9757937", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

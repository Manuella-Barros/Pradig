Trump\u2019s campaign recently entered the next phase of the running mate search by requesting documents from several prospective contenders, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who has grown to be a staunch ally of the former president since running against him in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. \u201cRubio is a familiar face who has become one of the strongest voices in the Senate for the America First agenda, is excellent on TV, and can blast Biden effectively for his failed policies,\u201d one top GOP strategist told Fox News Digital. \u201cTrump is doing very well with Latino voters and the addition of Rubio would only strengthen that, which could spell the end for Biden,\u201d they said, adding that \u201cRubio would be a solid, safe pick, with a lot of upside.\u201d GOP strategist Matt Wolking, who served as deputy communications director for Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign, described Rubio as \u201can effective, disciplined communicator who rarely makes mistakes.\u201d He noted that Rubio was the only person under consideration who speaks another language, and that his ability to speak Spanish would help the Trump campaign reach Hispanic voters in many states where it could boost their competitiveness, including Nevada, New Mexico, Arizona, Virginia, New York, and Florida. \u201cWhile demonstrating his ability to win a slightly higher percentage of White voters in 2022 than Trump did in Florida in 2020, he also appeals to the suburban and independent voters that will be key to Trump\u2019s success, and is the only contender from a true battleground state,\u201d Wolking said. \u201cTrump would balance out his ticket by picking Rubio for VP, which cannot be said for some of the other options. These reasons are why many Democrats fear the selection of Rubio the most,\u201d he said, citing a May Vanity Fair article specifically noting some of those worries. Wolking added that Rubio\u2019s experience as a leader on the Senate Intelligence Committee would be \u201cvaluable\u201d for Trump to \u201creign in rogue agencies.\u201d A source close to Trump\u2019s campaign echoed what the other two said of Rubio\u2019s Latino heritage boosting the campaign\u2019s ability to connect with Hispanic voters, but also pointed to what they said were a few downsides to Rubio\u2019s potential selection. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019s a 100% Trump guy. That\u2019s the one thing I would say, that he has not always been enthusiastic about Trump. I think that\u2019s the one area I would find could be a little troubling to the Trump faithful. That might be an issue,\u201d the source said. They were noting Rubio\u2019s past criticism of Trump, including when he called him \u201creckless and dangerous\u201d while running against him in 2016, and when he said the former president was responsible \u201cfor some of what happened\u201d during the Jan. 6 protests at the U.S. Capitol. \u201cThe other thing is the question of whether Rubio is the right person to carry the Republican colors in 2028 and beyond,\u201d the source said. \u201cI think he\u2019s a good man. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I think he\u2019s been a great senator, and been very effective. I think he would be a more than adequate vice president, but it just gives me pause to think about him as a potential candidate, and whether he\u2019s a Trump-faithful follower.\u201d Wolking, however, said none of the downsides to Rubio\u2019s selection were \u201cparticularly big ones,\u201d but noted he tends \u201cto be more hawkish than Trump when it comes to foreign policy.\u201d He also mentioned concerns over the Constitution\u2019s 12th Amendment, which prohibits electors voting for a president and vice president if they are inhabitants of the same state. Rubio and Trump are both residents of Florida. \u201cThat would likely prove to be more a speedbump than a real obstacle to putting him on the ticket,\u201d Wolking said. A source familiar with Rubio pointed Fox to the senator\u2019s positive performance in states like Virginia and Minnesota during his 2016 primary campaign, suggesting his selection could boost Trump in states now being viewed as potential targets for Republicans. The source also pointed to Rubio\u2019s legislative track-record, his debate performances during his two subsequent Senate re-elections since running for president, his ability to communicate, as well as his ability to \u201cfire up a crowd\u201d as all things that would make him a good addition to the Republican ticket. A number of other big names have also been floated to join Trump on the Republican ticket, including House GOP Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Ohio Sen. JD Vance and South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott. Trump has suggested he will likely wait until July\u2019s Republican National Convention in Milwaukee to name his pick.", "summary": "\"Rubio is a familiar face who has become one of the strongest voices in the Senate for the America First agenda, is excellent on TV, and can blast Biden effectively for his failed policies,\" one top GOP strategist told Fox News Digital.\u00a0", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/09/us-news/this-possible-trump-vp-pick-could-spell-the-end-for-biden/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/newspress-collage-og7536vsa-1717939271368.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1717924889&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ecv9Exyn-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:16:59", "author": "Fox News", "authors": ["Fox News"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.185}

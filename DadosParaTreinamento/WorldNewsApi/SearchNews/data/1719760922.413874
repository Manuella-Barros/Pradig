COVID is rising in California. How to protect yourself from subvariantsUCLA and UC Davis workers strike over treatment at pro-Palestinian protestsArtists priced out of Los Angeles head to this creative hub in the high desert And here's today's e-newspaper The national COVID-19 emergency ended just over a year ago. Gov. Gavin Newsom terminated California\u2019s emergency orders at the end of February 2023. But coronavirus is still out there \u2014 now in more variants and subvariants. The newest ones causing concern are officially known as KP.2, KP.3 and KP.1.1 but have been given the nickname FLiRT (an acronym for the amino acid changes that led to the strains\u2019 mutations). The latest data show that those subvariants are the dominant COVID family in the U.S., jumping from about 20% of infections a month ago to more than 50%. State health officials say summer could bring an uptick in cases following a low-transmission spring. \u201cCOVID-19 concentrations in wastewater have suggested increases in several regions across California since early May,\u201d the state Department of Public Health said in a statement last week. \u201cTest positivity for COVID-19 has been slowly increasing since May.\u201d Health officials won\u2019t be surprised to see increased COVID cases this summer, just as we\u2019ve experienced in previous summers. We travel more, congregate on weekends and holidays and tend to gather inside to escape the heat. So how worried should we be? The Times\u2019 Rong-Gong Lin II provided some context in his reporting this week: However, because the FLiRT subvariants are more easily transmitted, doctors advise that people at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infections take precautions. Those include: Staying up to date on COVID vaccinationsAvoiding sick people, some of whom might not know if they have COVID or a coldMasking up in crowded settings Taking Paxlovid (which for many should be easier to get) if infected The strongest risk factor for severe COVID-19 continues to be age, according to the CDC. People with certain underlying medical conditions \u2014 including asthma, cancer, diabetes and serious heart conditions \u2014 are also at heightened risk. \u201cCalifornia recently achieved a significant COVID milestone \u2014 zero deaths on a single calendar day, April 2, a feat not achieved since the first days of the pandemic,\u201d Rong-Gong noted. That week, he wrote, Los Angeles County also experienced a new record low for deaths \u2014 an average of 0.14 a day. Fewer people are being hospitalized and dying from COVID-19, but health officials say the virus remains deadlier than the flu. And one doctor Rong-Gong spoke to said evidence is mounting that getting COVID more times increases the risks of developing long COVID. Since the start of the pandemic, more than 107,000 Californians have died of COVID-19. Pro-Palestinian campus unrest: Kaffiyehs and pickets.

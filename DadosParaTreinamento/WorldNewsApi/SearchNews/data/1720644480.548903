{"id": 231244952, "title": "Letters: Saskatoon city council candidates must address two key issues", "text": "It is the right of the voting citizens to know and hear what these current candidates\u2019 commitment is to the city and our residents. We would like to hear all candidates state where their thoughts are on the two biggest issues that will be discussed this election year. One issue is maintaining the current service to meet the needs of the city and not the wants of some. Please do not get on that proverbial wagon of: \u201cWe will lower taxes.\u201d The second issues is the downtown arena and convention centre discussion. This issue has and still appears to be a personal agenda of some current members of council and the downtown business owners. Candidates for council must address and fix and maintain the needs before the wants. The wants as stated by many of the voters currently are not needs. Doug Wilson, Saskatoon Gun in legislature reveals double standard Suppose the person entering the legislature in combat clothing and carrying a rifle was not Jeremy Harrison. Would that person not be charged with a criminal firearms offence, such as careless transportation? Why, then, do we have a double standard for Mr. Harrison?", "summary": "Readers offer their opinions on the key issues in the upcoming Saskatoon city council election and bringing a gun into the Saskatchewan legislature building.", "url": "https://thestarphoenix.com/opinion/letters/letters-saskatoon-city-council-candidates-must-address-two-key-issues", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/thestarphoenix/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/0511-potholes-ldr004.jpg", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ManPlB6D-SZnIQkEn.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:05:21", "author": "Phil Tank,Reader Letters,Saskatoon StarPhoenix", "authors": ["Phil Tank", "Reader Letters", "Saskatoon StarPhoenix"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.17}

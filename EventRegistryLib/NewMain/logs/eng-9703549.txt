P\u00e9rez homered on the next pitch, a changeup.\n\nKelly entered hitting .300 with two doubles, a triple, four home runs and 15 RBIs in his previous 24 games.\n\n\"He's swung the bat very well,\" Detroit manager A.J. Hinch said. \"When I DH'ed him the other day and he homered in the five-hole, he told me hits better in the middle of the order. He was tongue-in-cheek, but maybe I might take him seriously.\"\n\nMontero (1-2) a 23-year-old right-hander, allowed two runs, six hits and a walk over 6 1/3 innings in his third major league appearance and second start. He was recalled from Triple-A Toledo before the game.\n\n\"It felt very good,\" Montero said through interpreter Carlos Guill\u00e9n. \"Everything that I did is part of the process. I always believed today is part of the process and in the end, it's going to show some results. But the most important part of it is, I was able to help this team to get a win and get the back of my teammates.\"\n\nFesta (1-1), making his second major league start and first in Target Field, gave up seven runs and nine hits in five innings. He allowed four runs over 5 2/3 innings at Arizona in his debut on June 27 and has a 10.80 ERA.\n\n\"I felt great,\" said Festa, considered the team's top pitching prospect. \"The results, the box score doesn't show that, but I feel like I was confident out there. The nerves are fine. Like I said, just a frustrating result.\n\nBrooks Lee, the No. 13 overall prospect according to MLB Pipeline, was 2 for 4 with an RBI for Minnesota in his major league debut. Lee singled off Montero in the fourth for his first hit and drove in Byron Buxton in the seventh with an RBI single. The Twins selected his contract from Triple-A St. Paul and put third baseman Royce Lewis on the 10-day injured list with a right adductor strain.\n\n\"I felt pretty calm,\" Lee said of his first at-bat. \"It's actually uncharacteristic of me to take pitches. It was cool. But I got it out of the way. I came up and was like, 'If I get a fastball, I'm going to do some damage and sure enough I did.'\"\n\nChristian V\u00e1zquez hit a solo homer for the Twins, who have homered in a team-record 21 straight games. The streak is the second longest in the major leagues behind Baltimore's 22 from June 1-23.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nTigers: Montero was recalled from Triple-A Toledo and RHP Casey Mize was put on the 15-day IL with a left hamstring strain. ... Hinch said SS Javier B\u00e1ez (lumbar spine inflammation) was feeling good after starting a rehab assignment with Triple-A Toledo on Tuesday. B\u00e1ez was the designated hitter and went 1 for 2 with a walk. He played shortstop for six innings Wednesday and went 0 for 3 with two strikeouts and was to have a planned day off on Thursday.\n\nTwins: The team doesn't think Lewis' injury is as severe as the torn quadriceps that caused him to miss 58 games this season. He will be re-evaluated after the All-Star break. ... RHP Brock Stewart (right shoulder tendinitis) was transferred to the 60-day IL.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nFormer Twin Kenta Maeda (2-4, 5.76 ERA) is scheduled to start Wednesday for Detroit in a game that was pushed up an hour to 12:10 p.m. CDT due to rain in the forecast.

Below we will continue our MLB odds series with a Tigers-Twins prediction and pick. We will also let you know how to watch the game.\n\nLast Start: at Los Angeles Angels: Loss, 5.2 innings, 7 hits, 5 runs, 1 walk, 7 strikeouts\n\n2024 Road Splits: 9 starts, 2.81 ERA, 0.90 WHIP, 51.1 innings pitched, 64K/7BB, .206 oBA\n\nDavid Festa (1-0) with a 9.00 ERA, 1.60 WHIP, 5 innings, 7 hits, 5 runs, 1 walk, 2 strikeouts\n\nHis last start was at the Arizona Diamondbacks, and it was his only start of the season.\n\nThe Twins have their best pitcher on the mound. Flaherty is having an unbelievable season. He has significantly improved his walk rate, and his strikeout rate is in the 95th percentile in the MLB. Along with that, Flaherty gets plenty of hitters to chase and whiff at his pitches. Flaherty should be able to continue that in this game. If he can continue to be dominant in this one, the Tigers will win this game easily.\n\nThe Tigers have to get to Festa the way the Diamondbacks did. In that game Festa missed just a bit too much over the plate. He is a three-pitch mix guy, so the Tigers do not have to be ready for a big arsenal. If he misses over the plate with any of those three pitches, the Tigers have to capitalize. If they can do that, they will be able to win this game.\n\nWhy The Twins Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nAs mentioned, Festa missed over the plate just a bit too much against the Diamondbacks. However, the Diamondbacks are a much better offensive team than the Tigers. Detroit has the fifth-worst batting average, sixth-worst slugging percentage, the 11th-most strikeouts, and sixth-fewest walks. This is a great chance for Festa to get his first win. If he can shut down the Tigers, he will be able to match Flaherty and give the Twins a chance to win the game.\n\nThe Twins are a pretty good offensive team. The Twins have the 11th-best batting average, fifth-best slugging percentage, eighth-best average exit velocity, and fifth-most home runs in the MLB. They have the ability to do some damage if the opposing pitcher is not careful. Flaherty is a very good pitcher, and he will not make many mistakes. However, if he does, expect the Twins to take advantage and have a good offensive day.\n\nFinal Tigers-Twins Prediction & Pick\n\nI am going to go off the pitching matchup for this game. The Twins are a better offensive team than the Tigers, but the Tigers have their stud on the mound. Along with that, Flaherty has already pitched twice against the Twins, and the Tigers have won both games. I am expecting there to be a third time in this game. I am going to take the Tigers to win this game straight up.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_zunkel@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Cameron Zunkel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeouts_per_nine_innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeouts per nine innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_velocity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exit velocity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tigers-vs.-Twins-prediction-odds-pick-7_2_2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703549", "eventUri": "eng-9703549", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

It was quick. I didn't get to see them for long.\"\n\nThe situation is different at home in Minneapolis, where the Twins are hosting the Detroit Tigers. Festa spent the first several months of the season at nearby Triple-A St. Paul.\n\n\"I'm still living in the same apartment, so my life off the field hasn't changed too much, other than I come to Minneapolis rather than St. Paul every day,\" Festa said. \"That's a huge relief. Moving from somewhere else would be a pain. There's a lot going on as it is.\"\n\nThe Twins will look for two straight wins against the Tigers after rallying for a 5-3 victory in the series opener Tuesday. Manuel Margot and Carlos Correa each homered in the victory, and Royce Lewis ripped a two-run double before he left the game because of left groin tightness.\n\nMinnesota described Lewis' status as day-to-day, but Lewis did not sound confident afterward. He has dealt with a variety of injuries in his first few seasons as a big leaguer.\n\n\"This is out of my control. I have no idea,\" Lewis said. \"But probably not very optimistic, to be honest with you. I'm praying, but it's usually always horrible news. So we'll see.\"\n\nDetroit also is dealing with an injury that is forcing manager A.J. Hinch to reorganize his pitching rotation. Veteran right-hander Jack Flaherty initially was scheduled to start Wednesday but will skip at least one turn as he sees a back specialist in Los Angeles.\n\nIn Flaherty's spot, right-hander Keider Montero will make his second career start. Montero is 0-2 with a 9.35 ERA in two games (one start) this season.\n\nHinch said Flaherty is expected to rejoin the rotation next week against Cleveland.\n\n\"The shot that he needed (to ease his back pain), sometimes they take, sometimes they don't,\" Hinch said. \"He still was feeling a little bit off, and so another injection was warranted. We were in Los Angeles, the doctor's right there, so we're going to give him a couple of days to do that.\"\n\nFor the Twins, Festa enters Wednesday's game with a 1-0 record and a 9.00 ERA. He gave up five runs on seven hits in five innings during his debut against the Diamondbacks.\n\nBefore his promotion, he was 3-2 with a 3.77 ERA in 14 starts with St. Paul.\n\nA pair of young Tigers hitters will look to stay hot after homering in the series opener. Justyn-Henry Malloy went 2-for-4 with a homer, his fourth of the season, and Ryan Kreidler finished 1-for-3 with a two-run shot that marked his first homer of the season.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "thenewstribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@thenewstribune.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paul,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saint Paul, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint Paul, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Montero_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Montero (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Correa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Correa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Margot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Margot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royce_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royce Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Hinch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.

The offense exploded for three triples and four home runs.\n\nPOWER SURGE: How Tigers' Riley Greene developed his power with new trainer Ben De La Cruz\n\nMontero, who turns 24 on Saturday, put a runner on base in six of his seven innings, but he worked out of trouble time and time again to earn the first win of his career. He will stay in the starting rotation as the replacement for injured Casey Mize.\n\nThe Tigers (39-47) pulled away from the Twins in the third inning, when Kelly hit an elevated fastball from rookie right-hander David Festa for a grand slam to left field. He hit the grand slam after Gio Urshela's single, Colt Keith's single and Riley Greene's single.\n\nKelly's big swing put the Tigers ahead, 4-0.\n\nIt was the first grand slam of Kelly's career, spanning 514 games.\n\nOn the next pitch, Wenceel P\u00e9rez extended the Tigers' lead to 5-0 with a solo home run -- his first homer since April 30 -- to center field off Festa's middle-up changeup.\n\nFesta, making the second start of his MLB career, allowed seven runs on nine hits and zero walks with six strikeouts, throwing 81 pitches. Three of the nine hits went for home runs.\n\nAs the Tigers scored more than two runs, the rookie Montero -- called up from Triple-A Toledo before Wednesday's game -- worked his way through the Twins' lineup like an established veteran.\n\nHe had traffic on the bases in six of his seven innings from six hits, one walk and two hit-by-pitches, but he stayed calm.\n\nIn the first inning, Montero responded to Carlos Correa's two-out double by striking out Carlos Santana swinging with a slider below the strike zone. He retired three batters in a row after Jose Miranda's leadoff walk in the second inning.\n\nChristian V\u00e1zquez put the Twins on the scoreboard with a solo home run off Montero's middle-middle fastball to open the third inning, making it 5-1. Ex-Tiger Willi Castro tried to keep the momentum going with an ensuing single, but Montero took care of the next three batters to strand the runner.\n\nIn the fourth, Montero worked around the first hit of Brooks Lee's MLB career -- a two-out single into center field -- by getting V\u00e1zquez to fly out to center field. He also avoided trouble after a leadoff hit-by-pitch in the fifth, thanks to a double play.\n\nMontero sent down all three batters in the sixth inning.\n\nThe Twins didn't score again until the seventh inning, when Buxton drove a two-strike fastball to left-center and Lee flared a first-pitch slider into center for an RBI single, making it 7-2.\n\nMontero then retired V\u00e1zquez for the first out in the seventh, ending his outing at 80 pitches. He generated eight whiffs on 36 swings -- a 22.2% whiff rate -- with five sliders, two curveballs and one changeup. He had four strikeouts.\n\nRiley Greene looks for a cycle\n\nThe Tigers scored their next two runs in the fifth inning, taking a 7-2 lead.\n\nGreene, who finished 3-for-4 with two RBIs, demolished a down-and-in slider from Festa with a 111.8 mph exit velocity for a 427-foot two-run home run to right field.\n\nThe 23-year-old has 16 home runs in 85 games in 2024, his third MLB season, which matches his combined homer total across 192 games in 2022 and 2023.\n\nGreene finished a double shy of the cycle, with a triple in the first inning, single in the third inning and home run in the fifth inning. He grounded out in the seventh inning.\n\nMatt Vierling pushed the Tigers' lead to 9-2 with a two-run home run in the ninth inning against left-handed reliever Kody Funderburk. It was his career-high 11th homer in 76 games. He had 10 homers in 134 games last season.", "source": {"uri": "freep.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Detroit Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riley_Greene", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riley Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Montero_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Montero (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carson Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Handedness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Target Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider_(pitch)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slider (pitch)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_V\u00e1zquez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Javier V\u00e1zquez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_V\u00e1zquez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian V\u00e1zquez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ervin_Santana", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ervin Santana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mart\u00edn_P\u00e9rez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mart\u00edn P\u00e9rez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike zone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/04/PDTF/74298370007-2160511573.jpg?auto=webp&crop=4469,2514,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703549", "eventUri": "eng-9703549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-30", "textStart": 1368, "textEnd": 1376}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

But Greene, with an elite sprint speed of 29.8 feet per second, beat his throw.\n\nTwo pitches later, catcher Carson Kelly launched his first career grand slam, blasting a 95-mph fastball from Twins right-handed starter David Festa.\n\nWenceel Perez followed, hitting the next pitch from Festa over the high wall in right field and the Tigers were off and running.\n\nGreene's homer followed the first career triple by rookie Colt Keith in the fifth inning.\n\nGreene, who was not a finalist in the fan voting, has two chances of being selected to represent the Tigers in Texas: Get voted in by the players and coaches. Those ballots are in and the All-Star reserves will be announced Friday.\n\nOr, he could be an injury replacement.\n\nHitting .260 with an .851 OPS, and leading the team in hits, walks, doubles, triples, homers and RBIs, hard to deny him.\n\nMatt Vierling capped the scoring with a two-run homer to left field off lefty reliever Kody Funderburk. It was his career-best 11th homer and it marked just the third run the Tigers have scored off an opposing reliever in 23 innings.\n\nThe offensive outburst gave rookie right-hander Keider Montero a comfortable cushion in his third big-league outing. And he seized the moment allowing two runs in 6.1 innings to collect his first Major League win.\n\nMontero, who will take the rotation spot of Casey Mize (hamstring) for at least the next couple of turns, established an effective knuckle-curve early (2,965 average rpm), especially to the four left-handed hitters in the Twins lineup.\n\nBut his slider, his signature pitch, did most of the heavy lifting off his 95.5-mph four-seamer. Montero got six whiffs on 11 swings on the slider, plus six called strikes.\n\nHe ended up allowing six hits and a walk with four strikeouts. The loudest hit was a leadoff home run in the third inning by Christian Vasquez. Vasquez clubbed a 3-2 fastball that Montero threw at 94 mph - his slowest fastball of the game.\n\nHe also yielded the first big-league hit for Twins prospect Brooks Lee, who got a pair of singles and knocked in a run against Montero. Lee, who got a couple of hits off Montero in a Triple-A game two weeks ago, was called up to replace Royce Lewis, who was put on the injured list with an adductor strain.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riley_Greene", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riley Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Target Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Handedness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Montero_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Montero (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carson Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infield_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infield hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider_(pitch)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slider (pitch)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Vierling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Vierling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Mize", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casey Mize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royce_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royce Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/04/PDTN/74298356007-20240702-tigerstwins-03.JPG?auto=webp&crop=6771,3811,x4,y522&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703549", "eventUri": "eng-9703549", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Starter David Festa's second game, well ... that was a different story.\n\nLee, called up before Wednesday night's game, collected his first two major league career hits and drove in a run. But Festa was knocked around for seven runs in the Twins' 9-2 loss to the Detroit Tigers in the middle game of the series at Target Field.\n\nFesta, who debuted last week in Arizona, had a start that mirrored in first in many ways. Only in this one, he didn't have the same run support that earned him his first career win last time out.\n\nAfter two scoreless innings, Festa ran into trouble in the third, allowing six hits -- and five runs -- before he was able to escape the frame. He had a similar inning that spiraled in his last start, giving up four runs in the fourth inning last Thursday.\n\nThe big blow in the inning was a Carson Kelly grand slam, sinking the Twins (48-38) into a hole from which they could never recover. The very next batter, Wenceel P\u00e9rez, went back-to-back with him.\n\nFesta would pitch five innings in his start, giving up two more runs in his final inning of work as Colt Keith and Riley Greene began the frame with a triple and home run respectively.\n\nThe starter has now given up 12 runs in his first 10 innings of work in the major leagues since being added to the rotation in place of Chris Paddack, who is out with shoulder fatigue.\n\nWhile his rough outing was enough to send the Twins to a blowout loss, they did see plenty to like from Lee, who got word of his call up earlier in the day on Wednesday while preparing for a game with the Triple-A Saints.\n\nThough he started his night by looking at strike three, Lee's second and third at-bats each ended with him standing on first base.\n\nLee lined a pitch past diving shortstop Zach McKinstry in the fourth inning, bringing much of the Target Field crowd to its feet for an ovation. As he stood at first, a big smile on his face, the rookie raised his hand to the crowd in acknowledgement.\n\nIn his next at-bat, he singled, bringing home a run. He finished the day 2 for 4.\n\nThe Twins' only other run came in the third inning when Christian V\u00e1zquez hit a solo home run, his third of the year.

Festa threw first-pitch strikes to 17 of the 24 hitters he faced, and regularly reached 96 mph with his fastball.\n\nSuddenly, however, he drove his game into the ditch in the third inning, again allowing six hits, five of them in a row, including Tiger catcher Carson Kelly's first career grand slam.\n\nBefore he could catch his breath, Festa left his next pitch, a changeup, in the middle of the plate, and Wendell P\u00e9rez bashed it into the planters above the wall in right-center.\n\nTwo innings later, Festa gave up a triple off the right-field wall to Colt Keith, and Riley Greene drove him in with a blast over the seats and onto the right-field plaza.\n\nFesta has pitched 10 innings in his two starts for the Twins, and in seven of them, he has allowed a combined two hits and one run. The other three? 14 hits and 11 runs, ballooning his ERA to 10.80. And this time, there was no 13 runs of support to rescue him, as there were in Arizona last week.\n\nThat's because Tigers righthander Keider Montero, a rookie whom the St. Paul Saints have beaten twice this season with seven runs in just 6 2/3 innings, had the night -- also in his second career start -- that Festa had hoped for. Montero wasn't as efficient, allowing a baserunner in all but one of the seven innings he pitched in, but he repeatedly pitched out of trouble.\n\nOnly Christian V\u00e1zquez, who led off the third inning with his third home run, a fly ball into the bullpens, could drive a run home until Lee connected in the seventh.\n\nLee received several long ovations from the announced crowd of 25,053, the first as he strode to the plate in the second inning. But Lee didn't swing the bat, taking three strikes among the five pitches he looked at.\n\nHe didn't make that mistake two innings later, picking out a high fastball on a 1-1 count and driving it up the middle and over the infield, to rousing applause. And in the seventh, after Buxton doubled to the bullpens in left-center, Lee cracked a first-pitch slider into center to drive in his first run.\n\nWith that, Lee matched the 2-for-3 performance he produced against Montero just 12 days earlier, in the Saints' 4-2 win over Toledo.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It will also be available to watch via MLB.tv, MLB.com and in the MLB app.\n\n\"It's a nice honor for any young player to be given, and he'll enjoy it,\" manager Rocco Baldelli said. \"They all do. All the guys have fun. ... It kind of boosts you in some ways. You could call it almost like a good ego boost in some ways.\"\n\nLee, the No. 8 overall pick in the 2022 draft, has been productive at Triple-A since returning from a back issue suffered late in spring training.\n\nIn 19 games entering Tuesday, he was hitting .333 with a .617 OPS. He had six home runs and five doubles among his 27 hits. While he's currently blocked at the major league level in the infield, he could force the issue sooner rather than later.\n\n\"He has been playing some really good baseball. Everything we've heard is right where we would want it to be, and he's out there proving himself,\" Baldelli said. \"That's really what this is all about for him right now. Getting out there, showing us what he can do, showing himself what he can do and turning himself into the best player he can be. He's doing all that.\"\n\nThere was a noticeable difference in the Twins' clubhouse on Tuesday upon entry.\n\nA new lighting system had been installed while the Twins were on their 10-day road trip, aimed at helping players adjust their eyes and bodies to help prepare for games.\n\nThe lights were so bright that right fielder Max Kepler was donning a pair of sunglasses inside before the game.\n\n\"One thing we talked about late in spring training, early in the season was the fact that we play a lot of day games. How do we get ready for these day games? How do we help ourselves prepare better?\" Baldelli said. \"We've done a lot of things. So just one of them is trying to brighten yourself up a little bit so you don't feel like when you walk into the clubhouse here, you're walking into a windowless casino or something like that.\"\n\nReliever Brock Stewart has progressed into throwing live batting practice, with one session on Tuesday and another set up for Friday. The Twins will see how he responds before determining his next steps, which could then be a rehab assignment.\n\nStewart has not pitched in a game since May 1, dealing with right shoulder tendinitis. His return -- he currently has a 0.68 earned-run average across 13 games -- would be a big boost for the Twins' bullpen.\n\nFellow reliever Justin Topa (knee) has also been progressing, and he is scheduled to throw two bullpens this week. Topa has not pitched in a major league game this season, experiencing more knee soreness after going out on a rehab assignment in late April/early May.\n\nTop pitching prospect David Festa will make his Target Field debut on Wednesday night. Festa gave up five runs in five innings in his debut last week in Arizona. ...

I think he's going to continue to get better and better.\"\n\nTHE ROSTER MOVE: Tigers' Casey Mize on injured list with hamstring strain, Keider Montero called up\n\nIn three games, Montero has a 6.60 ERA with five walks and 15 strikeouts across 15 innings for the Tigers. His fastball averages 95.5 mph, but his curveball and slider are above-average secondary weapons with elite upside, both better than his changeup. He also had a 5.03 ERA with 30 walks and 54 strikeouts across 48\u2153 innings in 13 games with Triple-A Toledo.\n\nMontero allowed four runs in 4\u2153 innings May 29 and five runs in 4\u2153 innings June 26 before posting 6\u2153 innings of two-run ball Wednesday against the Twins as an official member of the rotation. He credited better breaking balls for his success.\n\n\"This time, he looks settled in,\" manager A.J. Hinch said. \"He knows his role. He knows he's here and getting a couple starts before anything else can happen. It's nice to see him take a deep breath, and that comes from a couple of outings.\"\n\nThe latest game led to a ritualistic celebration in the visitor's clubhouse with his teammates.\n\nAll eyes will be on Montero for his next start when he clashes with the American League Central-leading Cleveland Guardians at Comerica Park, especially after a successful performance against the Twins to kickstart a big opportunity.\n\n\"It's going to be a completely different opponent,\" Hinch said. \"They're going to load the lineup with lefties. He's going to have a different attack plan. The maturity of a starting pitcher, and why it's so difficult, the maturity that's needed is the different attack plan literally five days apart, so maybe more breaking balls, maybe more changeups.\"\n\nKerry Carpenter returns to Detroit\n\nOutfielder Kerry Carpenter (lumbar spine stress fracture) traveled with the Tigers to Minneapolis for Tuesday's series opener against the Twins, but at some point between Tuesday night and Wednesday afternoon, he left the team.\n\nRILEY RAKES: How Tigers' Riley Greene developed his power with new trainer Ben De La Cruz\n\nCarpenter returned to Detroit.\n\nThe 26-year-old won't finish the 10-game road trip with the Tigers because he suffered a setback -- described as \"some increased discomfort\" by the Tigers -- in his recovery after a week of baseball activities, forcing him to be shut down.\n\n\"He's handled it fine,\" Hinch said. \"I think his frustration is like all of ours, that he wants it to be better faster, and it's just a slow-healing injury, and until he's pain free, we can't advance him to the next step. He's trying to do his best to respond, but when he still feels symptoms, we have to address them.\"\n\nJavier B\u00e1ez, a Mud Hen\n\nShortstop Javier B\u00e1ez (lumbar spine inflammation) has played two games for Triple-A Toledo during his rehab assignment. The 31-year-old went 1-for-2 with one walk as the designated hitter in Tuesday's game, then 0-for-3 with two strikeouts as the shortstop in Wednesday's game.\n\n\"I texted back and forth with Javy,\" Hinch said. \"He was happy with how he felt. I joked with him that he walked in his first at-bat, that's a great start. It was nice to see him on the field and hear him happy. It's a good step in the right direction.\"\n\nB\u00e1ez won't be in Thursday's lineup with the Mud Hens.\n\nIt's a scheduled off day for him.\n\nAfter that, B\u00e1ez will play shortstop Friday for the Mud Hens. He is expected to play Saturday, as well.\n\nB\u00e1ez could return to the Tigers for Monday's series opener against the Cleveland Guardians at Comerica Park. Either way, he is all but guaranteed to return before the All-Star break.", "source": {"uri": "freep.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Detroit Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Montero_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Montero (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toledo,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toledo, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toledo, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_V\u00e1zquez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian V\u00e1zquez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Guill\u00e9n", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Guill\u00e9n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Hinch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A.

He will stay in the starting rotation as the replacement for injured Casey Mize.\n\nThe Tigers (39-47) pulled away from the Twins in the third inning, when Kelly hit an elevated fastball from rookie right-hander David Festa for a grand slam to left field. He hit the grand slam after Gio Urshela's single, Colt Keith's single and Riley Greene's single.\n\nKelly's big swing put the Tigers ahead, 4-0.\n\nIt was the first grand slam of Kelly's career, spanning 514 games.\n\nOn the next pitch, Wenceel P\u00e9rez extended the Tigers' lead to 5-0 with a solo home run -- his first homer since April 30 -- to center field off Festa's middle-up changeup.\n\nFesta, making the second start of his MLB career, allowed seven runs on nine hits and zero walks with six strikeouts, throwing 81 pitches. Three of the nine hits went for home runs.\n\n[ MUST LISTEN: Make \"Days of Roar\" your go-to Detroit Tigers podcast, available anywhere you listen to podcasts (Apple, Spotify) ]\n\nAs the Tigers scored more than two runs, the rookie Montero -- called up from Triple-A Toledo before Wednesday's game -- worked his way through the Twins' lineup like an established veteran.\n\nHe had traffic on the bases in six of his seven innings from six hits, one walk and two hit-by-pitches, but he stayed calm.\n\nIn the first inning, Montero responded to Carlos Correa's two-out double by striking out Carlos Santana swinging with a slider below the strike zone. He retired three batters in a row after Jose Miranda's leadoff walk in the second inning.\n\nChristian V\u00e1zquez put the Twins on the scoreboard with a solo home run off Montero's middle-middle fastball to open the third inning, making it 5-1. Ex-Tiger Willi Castro tried to keep the momentum going with an ensuing single, but Montero took care of the next three batters to strand the runner.\n\nIn the fourth, Montero worked around the first hit of Brooks Lee's MLB career -- a two-out single into center field -- by getting V\u00e1zquez to fly out to center field. He also avoided trouble after a leadoff hit-by-pitch in the fifth, thanks to a double play.\n\nMontero sent down all three batters in the sixth inning.\n\nThe Twins didn't score again until the seventh inning, when Buxton drove a two-strike fastball to left-center and Lee flared a first-pitch slider into center for an RBI single, making it 7-2.\n\nMontero then retired V\u00e1zquez for the first out in the seventh, ending his outing at 80 pitches. He generated eight whiffs on 36 swings -- a 22.2% whiff rate -- with five sliders, two curveballs and one changeup. He had four strikeouts.\n\nThe Tigers scored their next two runs in the fifth inning, taking a 7-2 lead.\n\nGreene, who finished 3-for-4 with two RBIs, demolished a down-and-in slider from Festa with a 111.8 mph exit velocity for a 427-foot two-run home run to right field.\n\nThe 23-year-old has 16 home runs in 85 games in 2024, his third MLB season, which matches his combined homer total across 192 games in 2022 and 2023.\n\nGreene finished a double shy of the cycle, with a triple in the first inning, single in the third inning and home run in the fifth inning. He grounded out in the seventh inning.\n\nMatt Vierling pushed the Tigers' lead to 9-2 with a two-run home run in the ninth inning against left-handed reliever Kody Funderburk.

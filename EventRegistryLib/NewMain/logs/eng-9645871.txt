His dream week is about to get better still", "body": "PINEHURST, N.C. -- Colin Prater first warmed to biology as a freshman at Palmer High School in Colorado Springs, Colo. His teacher, Mr. Lewis -- Geoffrey to Mr. Lewis' friends and family -- had a knack for making the material both interesting and fun.\n\nThree years later, as a senior, Colin enrolled in another of Mr. Lewis' classes, AP Biology, a more demanding course that asks students to master core scientific principles, theories and processes. The curriculum was \"really hard,\" Prater, now 29, told me Tuesday behind Pinehurst No. 2's 18th green. \"I was the only student to get an A. I took a lot of pride in that.\"\n\nPrater had just wrapped a practice round at the 124th U.S. Open. We were talking bio because, well, Prater is the lone high school biology teacher in the field this week and, it's likely safe to say, the first high school biology teacher, period, to play in a U.S. Open.\n\nPrater's unlikely path to Pinehurst came by way of the Open's vast and democratic qualification system, which this year whittled 9,522 hopefuls down to just 73 qualifiers. (For those of you doing the math at home, that's a daunting .007% acceptance rate.) Prater punched his ticket earlier this month at the Bend. Ore., final qualifier, where he shot 68-73 to earn one of the two coveted spots available to the 44-player field.\n\nHow Prater, who teaches at Cheyenne Mountain High, in Colorado Springs, keeps his game U.S. Open-ready between grading homework and overseeing lab experiments -- not to mention coaching the school's golf team -- is a matter of clinical efficiency, especially during the school year, he said. Now that school's out for summer, Prater has more time to work on his game but said he still tries to keep his focus on his family. While he and his wife Madi's 20-month-year-old daughter, Blake, is napping, Prater might slip out for an hour of practice. \"My philosophy is keep the fundamentals sharp,\" he said. \"I spend a ton of time chipping and putting.\"\n\nThose skills will be essential this week on Pinehurst's mind-bending inverted-saucer greens, which are about as easy to hold as a granite countertop. Ask Prater, who played in the 2019 U.S. Amateur at Pinehurst Nos. 2 and 4 but failed to advance to match play. \"It ate my lunch,\" Prater said of No. 2. \"I remember going home and saying, 'That is the most difficult golf course I have played in my entire life.'\"\n\nPrater will tell you he's a better, mentally stronger player today than he was five years ago, and the expert guidance he has been receiving this week should embolden him only more so. On Tuesday, Prater played with his fellow Coloradan and defending U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark. (\"He has so much self-belief,\" Prater said when asked what he most admires about Clark. \"He believes he's the best player in the world.\") After the round, Prater's caddie, Cole Anderson, the Cheyenne Mountain assistant golf coach, trekked back out to the course to soak up some knowledge from Jordan Spieth's veteran looper, Michael Greller.\n\nOn Wednesday more tutelage is in store. Prater is slated to play with the undisputed best player in the world, Scottie Scheffler, which is guaranteed to be a masterclass in ball-striking, game management and so much else golfing goodness. How Scheffler's name landed on the tee sheet next to Prater's is still a bit of mystery, but Prater thinks it might have something to do with Anderson meeting Scheffler's caddie, Ted Scott, earlier in the week.\n\n\"I'm trying to cherish every moment,\" Prater said of his Open experience, which will include his parents, grandparents and even some of the golfers from his high school team cheering him on from the rope line. \"I feel like my game is in a really good spot, and I hit the ball really solid today. It was very encouraging.\"\n\nHe has every right to feel bullish.\n\nThis may be Prater's first U.S. Open but since his days as a junior golfer -- when his grandfather would take him to the famed Colorado Springs resort The Broadmoor to watch PGA Championship winner Dow Finsterwald smooth balls on the range -- to his standout years as a Colorado Springs high school golfer to his Div. II First-Team All-American days at the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs, Prater has remained a constant force on the Colorado amateur golf scene. In 2020, he became just the second player in nearly 40 years to win the Colorado Golf Association's Amateur and Match Play in the same year. \"I want to be the best amateur player ever from the state of Colorado,\" he said.\n\nPrater long had visions of leaving his mark on the pro game but, as he puts it, \"the puzzle pieces didn't fit.\" He loved living in Colorado Springs and that other bug that had bitten him all those years ago -- biology! -- was still tugging at him. So, Prater decided to shelve his Tour dreams, stay home and dedicate himself to teaching.\n\nOn occasion, Prater said, he'll mix his two passions, bringing golf or other sports references into the classroom. \"But at the same time,\" he added, \"I want to give kids the opportunity to make their own connections. I think that's the most important part: fostering their passions, their interests and giving them the freedom to do that.\"", "source": {"uri": "golf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf"},

II First-Team All-American at the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs.\n\nAnd Prater's become a master at juggling different areas of his life, as a teacher coach and new father he still managed to become the Colorado Golf Association player of the year.\n\n\"I joked last year when I won player of the year that I'm aging like a fine wine,\" Prater told his local CBS station. \"I'm a dad now, a husband and that just gives me great clarity that golf really doesn't matter.\"\n\nPrater decided against trying to make it as a pro to follow his other passion of teaching biology, but he's happy to be swapping his lab coat for his bag of clubs at Pinehurst this week.\n\nAnd after getting a few helpful hints and tips from the best in the world - if he's as good at learning lessons as he is teaching them then he will also enjoy his time in the US Open once it gets underway on Thursday.\n\nPrater has been drawn alongside Americans Charles Reiter and Carson Schaake for the first two rounds of the US Open.", "source": {"uri": "golfmonthly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf Monthly Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_higham@golfmonthly.com", "name": "Paul Higham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prater", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prater"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prater"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne_Mountain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cheyenne Mountain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Scott_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Scott (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Springs, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado Springs, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Garc\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Garc\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_Magazine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf Magazine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_Colorado_Springs", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Colorado Colorado Springs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Amateur_Championship_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Amateur Championship (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carson, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carson, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Education", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pqnm5wjYy547EiveCwDyVM-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9645871", "eventUri": "eng-9645871", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

(AP) - Colin Prater feels a little like Kevin Costner\u00b4s character in \"Tin Cup\" this week - a relative unknown who suddenly finds himself thrust onto one of golf\u00b4s biggest stages at the U.S. Open.\n\nIt\u00b4s a movie Prater is quite familiar with, which is why he and his caddie staked out a spot at the far right end of the practice range - just in case things went completely awry.\n\n\"It was funny we were joking before we got out here, like, we\u00b4re not going to the left side of the range just because we didn\u00b4t want that dreaded S-word to kick in,\" Prater said with a laugh, referring to Costner\u00b4s character who developed a case of the shanks before his round. \"We didn\u00b4t want that moment of, 'turn your hat around, put your things in the other pocket.\u00b4\"\n\nYou can\u00b4t blame Prater for being a little nervous.\n\nAfter all, his full-time job is as a biology teacher and golf coach at Cheyenne Mountain High School in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He got a spot at Pinehurst by finishing second at a 36-hole qualifier in Bend, Oregon. He's one of 73 qualifiers to emerge from 9,522 entrants.\n\nThe 29-year-old teacher is considered one of the top amateur players in Colorado, but he's never been to a U.S. Open let alone played in one.\n\nColin Prater hits his tee shot on the 10th hole during a practice round for the U.S. Open golf tournament Wednesday, June 12, 2024, in Pinehurst, N.C. (AP Photo/Frank Franklin II)\n\nSo the experience, he said, has been surreal.\n\nHe played a practice round Monday with Sahith Theegala and Will Zalatoris. On Tuesday he was paired with defending U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark. And on Wednesday, he played nine holes with 2015 champion Jordan Spieth and Sam Burns.\n\nAfter he walked off the practice green Wednesday, he introduced himself to Rory McIlroy - and came away with the best advice he's received all week.\n\n\"Rory said, 'Listen, this golf course is amazing, but you have to be patient and hit the middle of the green,\u00b4\" Prater said. \"It really resonated with me because at the end of the day, it\u00b4s all just golf. If I can execute the shots that I\u00b4ve hit more than a thousand times, I can do this.\"\n\nPrater has plenty of experience, although not at this level.\n\nHe was a former Division II first-team All-American at the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs and, in 2020, won both the Colorado Golf Association\u00b4s Amateur and Match Play. He played last month at the U.S. Amateur Four-Ball Championship.\n\nHe's played Pinehurst once before at the 2019 U.S. Amateur, although he failed to advance to match play.\n\nThere was a time he considered pursuing a career as a professional player, but his love of teaching kids and the idea of being a husband and father took precedence. He and his wife Madi are set to welcome their second child next month.\n\nHe considers golf a hobby.\n\n\"I have an awesome life,\" Prater said. \"I love being a teacher; I love being a coach. I love to see that lightbulb moment in a kids\u00b4 eyes when biology starts to make sense, and they fall in love with it. And I love to see a beginner golfer pick up the game and fall in love with and want to work to get better. But most of all, I love being a father.\"\n\nSo he has no immediate plans to try to join the PGA Tour even if things go extraordinarily well at Pinehurst.\n\nIn his mind, this week as already been a \"win,\" getting to play three practice rounds at one of the world's most famous courses while walking around inside the ropes with the best players in the world.\n\nEntering Thursday's opening round he has one goal: he wants to make the cut.\n\n\"I would love to play golf for four days,\" Prater said. \"I think that's attainable, I think that's achievable.

That's an incredibly impressive feat in its own right, but especially for a high school biology teacher like Prater.\n\nPrater is a biology teacher at Cheyenne Mountain High - where he also coaches the school's golf team - in Colorado Springs which tells you that he's a master of time management. He has a 20-month-old daughter at home as well, but somehow kept his game in good enough shape to play his way into the year's third major championship.\n\n\"My philosophy is keep the fundamentals sharp,\" he told GOLF. \"I spend a ton of time chipping and putting.\"\n\nPlayers will have to showcase all sorts of shots around the greens of Pinehurst No. 2 this week if they're hoping to find any form of success.\n\nPrater and his caddie, Cole Anderson, are wisely picking the brains of the best players in the world heading into Thursday's opening round. On Tuesday, Prater teed it up with fellow Coloradan and defending U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark. After that memorable round, Anderson went back out on the course to pick up some notes from Jordan Spieth's caddie, Michael Greller.\n\nREAD: Grandstand Seats At U.S. Open Reportedly Collapsing On Fans Due To Construction Mishap\n\nPlaying alongside Clark and soaking up some knowledge from one of the best caddies in the business is special, but things are set to get even better for Prater on Wednesday as he's set to play a practice round with the No. 1 player in the world, Scottie Scheffler.\n\nHow the practice round came to be seems to be a bit of a mystery. It may have been Scheffler continuing his streak of being the nicest person in all of professional sports, but Prater thinks his caddie may have locked in the tee time when he met Ted Scott, Scheffler's caddie, early on in the week.\n\nNo matter how Prater plays, it's already been a memorable week for the high school biology teacher from Colorado.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_harris@outkick.com", "name": "Mark Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prater", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prater"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prater"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amateur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne,_Wyoming", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cheyenne, Wyoming"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cheyenne, Wyoming"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Springs, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado Springs, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ted Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Education", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Education", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/06/bio-teacher.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9645871", "eventUri": "eng-9645871", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

But even if they did, it's a safe bet that no one at Cheyenne Mountain High School would have a summer adventure that will top the week their biology teacher played in the U.S. Open.\n\nColin Prater spends his school days teaching bio and his afternoons helping to coach golf for the Cheyenne Mountain Hawks in Colorado Springs (Colo.). But the 29-year-old has never really let go of his own dream of playing golf, and this spring -- after a grueling slog through the U.S. Open's qualification system -- he earned his way into the field at Pinehurst with a magnificent 68-73 at the final 36-hole qualifier in Bend, Ore.\n\nThis year, 9,522 players attempted to qualify for the U.S. Open, and only 44 managed to play their way into an invitation.\n\n\"It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It was a dream of mine from when I was a little kid,\" Prater said Wednesday afternoon after finishing a nine-hole practice round. \"Originally, it was, I'd love playing on the PGA Tour. Now, as my priorities have kind of shifted, it was, man, I would really love to play in a PGA Tour event one day. Never thought it was going to be of this magnitude, right?\"\n\n\"That's what's unique about the U.S. Open,\" said Jordan Spieth, who practiced alongside Prater on Wednesday. \"It's the only tournament, really, in the world where you see stuff similar to that every single year.\"\n\nPrater was a talented amateur. He was a four-time Division II All-American at University of Colorado Colorado Springs and won the Colorado amateur in 2016 and 2020. He was skilled enough that he had plans to go the entire Q-School/mini-tour route. But that's a serious grind, particularly for a young family, and Prater realized his destiny lay in a different direction.\n\n\"I just kind of realized that it wasn't all about me any more, that there were other people and my decisions affected others,\" he said. \"And so my wife and I, we just came to the conclusion together that we wanted to stay in Colorado Springs, and I really love teaching and coaching.\"\n\n\"He's the most patient, nice, amazing coach,\" says Cole Anderson, Prater's caddie this week and his fellow assistant golf coach every other week. \"He spends so much time with the kids. He'll do whatever they ask. And he goes above and beyond in pretty much everything he does in life.\"\n\nEvery golf obsessive navigates the dueling priorities of golf and a full-time job, but when you're as good as Prater, there's a little more on the line with the golf game than just a few beers with friends. Prater credits his \"amazing support system\" of wife, parents and in-laws, but notes that \"it's a balance, for sure.\"\n\n\"You definitely have to have priorities,\" says Prater, who also -- as if his life isn't busy enough -- has a 1 \u00bd-year-old daughter and another on the way. \"Golf doesn't get put on the front burner. It gets put on the back burner, for sure. There's way more important things than playing golf.\"\n\nAt the moment, school isn't in session, so he's not even sure his students from last year even know what he's up to. But he's already heard from many of his former students, those in college and graduating into the real world, and that means as much to him as any media accolades.\n\n\"I try to teach a lot of life skills in my classroom,\" he said. \"Like, obviously, it's science-based, and I want them to learn about the cells, and I want them to know the different functions of the organelles, and I want them to know that things can evolve over time. But it's also just teaching them those basic life skills that I think are important for them to be successful in whatever they decide to pursue later on.\"\n\nAs you'd expect from a high school teacher, Prater has enjoyed meeting kids along the ropes at Pinehurst all week. He answers their questions, jokes with them -- at one point, he prods one young Auburn fan with a \"Roll Tide!\" -- and signs everything they put in front of him.\n\n\"The kids are so excited to see us, right? That's what's so cool,\" he said. \"I figured coming into the week no one would want my autograph. So that's been really neat and powerful. It just makes you feel good on the inside, because the kids are so excited to see you.\"\n\nHe concedes that the moment can get overwhelming. \"I've just got to a little better job of just realizing it's just golf,\" he said. \"It's Pinehurst. It's the U.S. Open. Soak all that in and love every moment of that. But it's just like a Friday afternoon round at the local muni in Colorado Springs, where I just need to go out and execute the golf in every shot to the best of my ability.\"\n\n\"His strengths are putting and short game, which is really what this course demands,\" Anderson says. \"He's really good at keeping it in play and hitting it straight. He's not as long as most of these guys out here. But I feel like if you can chip and putt really well, then you'll have success here.\"\n\nBut along the way, he's stopped to size up his fellow competitors. \"I've been starstruck so many times,\" Prater says. \"But crazily enough, like, it's just like the guys back home. Like, they're regular guys. They just love golf, and they're really, really good at it. But super down-to-earth and really welcome. They've welcomed me a lot.\"\n\nPrater played with Will Zalatoris on Monday and Wyndham Clark on Tuesday, and got the chance to introduce himself to Scottie Scheffler. He's trying not to fanboy too hard, but there's one definite goal he still has in mind.\n\n\"I still want to somehow, some way to shake Tiger's hand,\" Prater said. \"That would be so cool, because he was my idol growing up as a kid.\"\n\nThe week will go quickly. Prater has, at most, four days left in his U.S. Open dream. He knows that, and he's embracing every bit of the moment. \"I'm just trying to soak in the environment, the atmosphere, all the fans,\" he said. \"Playing with some of the pros and the studs on tour. But I'm super lucky. I'm super grateful. When I get back home, I'll be changing diapers.\"\n\nIf that sounds like a comedown, it's most definitely not. Prater is keeping even this once-in-a-lifetime week in perspective. \"Golf is a hobby, right? It's not my end-all, be-all. It's not what defines me,\" he said. \"I love being a dad. I love being a husband. I love being a coach. I love being a teacher. And so that's what defines me these days, and I'm totally OK with that.\"\n\nFor Thursday and Friday, at least, he'll embrace another role: U.S. Open golfer. Prater tees off at 8:57 a.m. Thursday, and no matter what he shoots, he'll make memories to last a lifetime.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_busbee@aol.com", "name": "Jay Busbee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prater", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prater"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prater"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amateur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Springs, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado Springs, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne_Mountain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cheyenne Mountain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne_Mountain_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cheyenne Mountain High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Colorado_Colorado_Springs", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Colorado Colorado Springs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualifying_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualifying school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Zalatoris", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Zalatoris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburn_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auburn University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_(person)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fan (person)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community_and_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community and Clubs", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/na2T3kkFgUWllDmH7BhE4Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_yahoo_sports_800/fb01a91bf212ee3bf541cafcc05174f5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9645871", "eventUri": "eng-9645871", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

He succeeds Branson's Peter Herschend, who was first appointed in 1991.\n\nPrater served six years on the Springfield school board, including a stint as president. He was also a member of the Springfield City Council.\n\n\"Last night we heard Peter Herschend talk about some goals that we should hit for the future -- very optimistic, very idealist goals -- and at the end he said 'But people say how do we pay for it?' And I think my approach is, how can we afford not to pay for it?\" Prater said after the swearing-in, referencing a Monday event.\n\n\"Kids are our future for this state, for this country, and anything that I and we as a board and you as a department can do to make it better, I am here to support.\"\n\nMore: 'True champion of Missouri' Peter Herschend exits state school board after 33 years\n\nShields also swore in Tawni Hunt Ferrarini, of St. Charles, to fill the seat of Donald Claycomb, of Linn.\n\n\"We are very excited to have both of you join this board and I think you will find it a great and very enriching experience,\" Shields said. \"And we know you'll bring a lot to both positions.\"\n\nPrater, an eye surgeon, has a bachelor's degree from Southern Methodist University and a medical degree from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. He completed a residency in ophthalmology at Barnes-Jewish Hospital.\n\nThe Springfield native and Glendale High School graduate served six years on the Springfield school board. He was elected president during that time.\n\nHe practices at the Springfield-based Mattax-Neu-Prater Eye Center.\n\nPrater has served in leadership roles with the Foundation for Springfield Public Schools, the Community Foundation of the Ozarks, and the Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce, among others. He is part of Drury University's Board of Trustees and serves as vice president of Care to Learn.\n\nHe also helped establish the SPS Hall of Fame, which inducts exemplary district graduates each year that can serve as an example for current and future students.\n\nGov. Mike Parson appointed Prater and Ferrarini in April but withdrew the appointments when it became clear the state Senate was not going to be able to conduct confirmation hearings before the end of a packed 2024 legislative session. Reappointed last week, they will go before the senate for approval in early 2025.\n\nAt the start of state board meeting, members provide updates about recent school visits or activities they are part of to support public education.\n\nPrater focused his initial comments on Care to Learn.\n\n\"One of the organizations that I've worked with in Springfield for years is Care to Learn. It's a not-for-profit and it was started by Doug Pitt. The motto is simple: Health, hunger, hygiene. We're in 42 school districts around the state now,\" he said. \"The model is to provide the school nurses or counselors or whatever with the ability to get a child glasses or a clean pair of jeans or food for the weekend.\"\n\nMore: 'Face of public education' in MO: Margie Vandeven reflects on time as top K-12 official\n\nIn April, the nonprofit hosted Margie Vandeven, the outgoing Commissioner of Education; Karla Eslinger, the new Commissioner of Education; and four board members, including Herschend and Mary Schrag, of West Plains, as well as other state education leaders.\n\n\"It's a great relationship with DESE. I know the state board has been very supportive,\" Prater said. \"I'll step into the role as president of that (Care to Learn) board in a couple of weeks so you'll be able to hold my feet to the fire

For instance, past major champions Adam Scott and Sergio Garcia both came through qualifying this year to become alternates and eventually make it into the field.\n\nMeanwhile, Colin Prater, while obviously being a sensational golfer, is not a professional golfer. Instead, he teaches high school biology in Colorado Springs, Colorado while also serving as the team's golf coach. Somehow he balances his job plus his role as a husband and the father of a toddler to be good enough to belong on the course with the best players in the world.\n\nWhen I say the best players in the world, that's exactly what I mean. On Wednesday, Pater was supposed to tee it up in a practice round with the best player in the world, Scottie Scheffler.\n\nWhile that seems to have fallen through, he is playing with three-time major champion, Jordan Spieth.\n\nThat's quite the thrill for Prater, who played his college golf at Colorado Mesa.\n\nHe will tee off in round 1 on Thursday at 8:57 AM ET with Carson Schaake and Charlie Reiter.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "garrett_carr@brobible.com", "name": "Garrett Carr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Handicap (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_golfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional golfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Garc\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Garc\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Scott_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Scott (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Mesa_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Mesa Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Reiter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Reiter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Springs, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado Springs, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carson, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carson, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Colin-Prater1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9645871", "eventUri": "eng-9645871", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

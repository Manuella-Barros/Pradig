{"id": 225028660, "title": "Telehealth company Ro launches GLP-1 supply tracker to help patients navigate shortages", "text": "Anyone, including doctors, can submit an update to Ro's tracker by filling out a report about availability or a shortage of a GLP-1 at a specific pharmacy in their area. Users have the option to automatically report that information to the FDA. Ro will update the tracker based on its own supply data, which is generated when the company's patients log that they have successfully picked up their medication at a pharmacy. Ro will also update the tracker with the latest information from the FDA, according to the company. In order to ensure that a medication is really in shortage, Reitano said the tracker factors in a combination of the speed, location and number of submissions. One report over a period of two months might not influence the tracker, for instance. Reitano said Ro has been building the GLP-1 tracker for about two months. The company hasn't been collaborating with the FDA directly, but providing the agency more real-time data can help it keep its shortage list as up to date as possible, he said. This, in turn, means doctors will be able to make more informed choices about the best medication to prescribe to patients, Reitano said \"If that list is outdated to reality, then you're going to write a prescription assuming that the patient is able to get access to it,\" Reitano said. \"They're not or they might be able to start but not continue, and that causes disruptions in their treatment.\" Individuals can sign up to receive automated email alerts about when a specific GLP-1 drug becomes available at a nearby pharmacy. The tracker also alerts patients about changes to the supply of a GLP-1 on the FDA's drug shortage database. The alerts include instructions to request that a pharmacy transfer their prescription to another location with supply in stock. Any patient can also message Ro's care team to transfer their prescriptions on their behalf.", "summary": "The tracker could be a valuable tool for Americans scrambling to find GLP-1s, such as Novo Nordisk's weight loss injection Wegovy and diabetes drug Ozempic.", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/29/ro-launches-glp-1-supply-tracker-to-help-patients-navigate-shortages.html", "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107420910-1716923065951-GLP-1_Supply_Tracker_1.png?v=1716923274", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:00:01", "author": "Ashley Capoot", "authors": ["Ashley Capoot"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.474}

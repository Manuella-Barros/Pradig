{"id": 243256276, "title": "Debate and Supreme Court Rulings Bring a Dark Day for Democrats", "text": "Democrats confronted a nightmare scenario on Friday as they surveyed the wreckage of major political, policy and legal disasters piled atop one another with elections for control of the White House and Congress less than five months away. Even as they reeled from President Biden\u2019s poor performance on Thursday night in a make-or-break debate with former President Donald J. Trump, Democrats were slammed anew on Friday by the Supreme Court. In one far-reaching ruling, the court undercut the government\u2019s longstanding power to regulate health care, public safety and the environment \u2014 a core tenet of Democratic orthodoxy. In another, the justices handed down a decision that could make it more difficult to prosecute those who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and potentially Mr. Trump himself, for their roles in the violent insurrection. It was a day that encapsulated the party\u2019s worst fears about the coming elections and the rightward tilt of the Supreme Court. And it drove home how Republicans and Mr. Trump are within reach of victory in November \u2014 putting them in position to achieve a host of policy objectives vehemently opposed by Democrats \u2014 even with a presumptive nominee who is a convicted felon and a party that has been in deep disarray and shown little ability to govern.", "summary": "The combination of President Biden\u2019s debate performance and adverse Supreme Court rulings left Democrats reeling and in despair with elections not far off.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/us/politics/democrats-biden-debate-supreme-court.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/06/28/multimedia/28dc-assess-dems-01-lhbm/28dc-assess-dems-01-lhbm-facebookJumbo.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:12:25", "author": "Carl Hulse", "authors": ["Carl Hulse"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.276}

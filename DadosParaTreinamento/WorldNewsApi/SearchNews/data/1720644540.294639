The singer, who recently opened up about having a miscarriage on the set of US drama Pennyworth, appeared on the BBC series on Saturday (8 June), where she was promoting her forthcoming record The Glorification of Sadness. One internet troll complained about the singer\u2019s inclusion on the show, writing on X/Twitter: \u201cPeople who are just mind numbingly annoying t***s always use ADHD for the reason why they are mind numbingly annoying twats.\u201d In a post that has since been praised by her fans, Faith replied: \u201cI have actually got ADHD you t**t.\u201d Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a disorder that affects people\u2019s behaviour. Sufferers can experience restlessness, difficulties concentrating, and increased impulsivity. While most cases of the condition are diagnosed in children under the age of 12, some are later in life. According to the charity ADHD UK, around 2.6 million people in the UK have the disorder, but only 600,000 are formally diagnosed. Faith appeared on Saturday Kitchen alongside host Matt Tebutt as well as chefs Julie Lin and Tom Kitchen. The singer and actor is being applauded for her comment, with the singer\u2019s fan rallying around her on social media. \u201cI used to really like you, now I bloody love you,\u201d one fan wrote, with another stating: \u201cYou tell him, Paloma!!\u201d Earlier this week, Faith said she believes fathers should not be \u201cover-complimented or applauded for simply being a parent\u201d. The singer, who shares two daughters with her ex-partner of 10 years, Leyman Lahcine, said she does not like the phrase \u201cco-parent\u201d as it \u201cimplies it is 50/50 and I don\u2019t believe it is\u201d. In October, Faith gave her first in-depth interview after splitting with Lahcine, revealing she was \u201cbroken\u201d but also \u201cso whole\u201d. She told The Independent: \u201cIn some ways, the breakup has left me broken but in other ways, I\u2019m so whole. I am financially stable. I own my own house. I have children. If I ever meet a man, I\u2019m not going to need anything from him other than us just enriching one another\u2019s lives.\u201d", "summary": "<p>You tell him, Paloma!\u2019 one fan chimed in </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/paloma-faith-saturday-kitchen-adhd-b2559138.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/08/13/newFile.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/gj2LJs3J-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:23:15", "author": "Jacob Stolworthy", "authors": ["Jacob Stolworthy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.197}

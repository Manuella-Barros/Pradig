Hugh Grosvenor, 33, and Olivia Henson, 31, shared official portraits after tying the knot on June 7 in a high-society wedding that felt like a modern-day version of Bridgerton thanks to the historic church and many royal connections. As well as the stunning images \u2014 which included two black and white photographs of the couple during their nuptials, a colour shot of the Duchess' beautiful wedding gown and a further black and white image of her arriving on the day \u2014 the newlyweds shared their gratitude to those involved in their wedding, in a statement on Saturday, June 8. \"We are deeply grateful to everyone who supported us yesterday and want to extend a special thank you to those in Chester who helped make our day so memorable,\" the Duke and Duchess of Westminster said, adding, \"We have been incredibly touched by everyone\u2019s amazing support and warm wishes.\" The couple exchanged vows at Chester Cathedral in northern England, where Prince William served as an usher (and made a low-key arrival in a sprinter van, ensuring the focus stayed on the bride and groom). Before he got hitched, the 7th Duke of Westminster was considered to be one of Britain's most eligible bachelors due to his family's fortune and links to the British royal family that trace back generations. The groom is a godson of King Charles, while his mother, Natalia, is a childhood friend of the late Princess Diana and a godmother to Prince William, 41. The Duke is also a godfather to two young members of the next generation of royals: Prince George, 10, and Prince Archie, 5. Prince William's eldest son did not attend his godfather's wedding (which fell on a school day), and Prince Harry did not travel across the pond for the event. PEOPLE confirmed ahead of the wedding that the Duke of Sussex, 39, was invited to the celebration. However, there was an acknowledgment on both sides that it would be difficult for him to attend. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have lived in California since stepping back from their royal roles in the U.K. in 2020 and no longer use their former Frogmore Cottage home as a base during U.K. stays. A source describes the conversation between Hugh and Harry as an \"understanding between the two friends.\" The Duke of Sussex sends \"his love and support and admiration for the couple\" for their wedding day, the source tells PEOPLE. Hugh and Olivia announced their engagement in April 2023 and wed at Chester Cathedral, choosing the Gothic church as their wedding venue for its beauty and long association with the groom's family. Princess Eugenie was among the 400 guests in attendance, and Prince William helped show people to their seats for the service as an usher. The Duke of Westminster looked dapper in a morning suit for the nuptials while the bride wore a romantic long-sleeved ivory gown by British designer Emma Victoria Payne with the Fabrege Mytle Leaf Tiara. The headpiece was made for Grosvenor brides to wear on their wedding days and has been in the family since 1906. Hugh's older sister Lady Tamara also wore the sparkling accessory for her wedding in 2004. The Grosvenors are one of the wealthiest families in the U.K., with a net worth estimated at $12.8 billion, according to The Sunday Times' Rich List 2024. Hugh inherited the Duke of Westminster title at age 25 when his father died in 2016. A few weeks before the wedding, he was reported to be the richest person in the U.K. under age 40 and the 14th wealthiest overall. Can't get enough of PEOPLE's Royals coverage?

The Duke of Westminster proposed to Olivia at Eaton Hall, his family's ancestral seat on the outskirts of Chester, and the couple gave back to his hometown before their big day. The pair visited Chester Cathedral one month before their wedding to highlight some of the causes involved with the charitable Westminster Foundation, which the Duke chairs, and paid for the city's summer display of 100,000 flowers as part of their wedding festivities. There was a brief disruption when protestors affiliated with the group Just Stop Oil attempted to distract from the newlywed Duke and Duchess of Westminster's exit from church with a cloud of smoke in a situation quickly quelled by police. The local council shut down some roads near the cathedral on June 7 as onlookers gathered to catch a glimpse of the event. The well-wishers cheered as the couple shared a kiss on their way out of church following the ceremony.", "summary": "Hugh Grosvenor and Olivia Henson shared new photos from their big day along with a statement where they thanked those involved", "url": "https://people.com/duke-of-westminster-hugh-grosvenor-bride-olivia-henson-wedding-portraits-real-life-bridgerton-8658901", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/QFjdCiwJ0deYT6M5ZIwK6kdi_5o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/olivia-henson-hugh-grosvenor-wedding-duke-of-westminster-060724-7-22a92852027f4c9a8319462b30045358.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:42:31", "author": "Janine Henni", "authors": ["Janine Henni"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.869}

A new image has just been released of Axel's new police partner, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Detective Bobby Abbott, who coincidentally is the ex-boyfriend of Axel's estranged daughter, Jane.\n\nThe image of Gordon-Levitt's Bobby Abbott was shared by Empire, who also sat down with the actor to discuss his involvement in the highly-anticipated, and long-awaited, sequel. \"This character is a bit strait-laced - I am an actual Beverly Hills cop, whereas Axel Foley is a cop from Detroit who finds himself in Beverly Hills - but he's not a simple straight man,\" teased Gordon-Levitt. \"I also get my licks in.

Although Axel has made multiple trips to Beverly Hills since the first film, such as in the sequels Beverly Hills Cop II (1987) and III (1994), producer Jerry Bruckheimer revealed that Murphy's beloved character will still be out of his element in the upcoming sequel.\n\n\"Detroit is a much different city than Los Angeles and especially Beverly Hills,\" Bruckheimer shared. \"He still has the same kind of wonderment at the things you see walking down Rodeo Drive.\" Axel F director Mark Molloy added, \"As we were scouting going from Detroit to Beverly Hills, the cultural contrast that made Axel a fish out of water in the eighties still is so vivid. They might just be the two most opposite places in America.\"\n\nRelated 'That Was It for Me': Beverly Hills Cop Star Reveals Why He Didn't Watch the Sequels Breaking Bad star Jonathan Banks shares why he didn't watch the Beverly Hills Cop sequels after his appearance in the first film.\n\nWho Is Back for Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F?\n\nBefore moving forward as a Netflix exclusive, Beverly Hills Cop 4 had been stuck in development hell since the mid-'90s.

Godon-Levitt plays Bobby Abbott in the upcoming movie, Axel's partner. Murphy's three most recent movies haven't been received well, meaning Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F could break this streak.\n\nJoseph Gordon-Levitt's Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F character is shown off in a new image from the film. After first playing the character back in 1984, Eddie Murphy returns as detective Axel Foley in the fourth installment in the Beverly Hills Cop franchise. The upcoming Netflix film, which is directed by Mark Molley, features a host of both returning and new characters, including the introduction of Gordon-Levitt as Bobby Abbott, Foley's partner.\n\nAs the Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F release date approaches, Empire Magazine shares a new image from the film, providing the best look yet at Gordon-Levitt's newcomer. Check out the image below:\n\nGordon-Levitt teases in the accompanying interview that Abbott is the serious one between him and Axel, and the above image certainly reinforces that. Check out Gordon-Levitt's comment about the character below:\n\n\"This character is a bit strait-laced - I am an actual Beverly Hills cop, whereas Axel Foley is a cop from Detroit who finds himself in Beverly Hills - but he's not a simple straight man. I also get my licks in. I wouldn't be living up to this crazy opportunity if I wasn't going to have a few myself. We got to do some really fun stuff.\"\n\nRelated Why It Took Eddie Murphy Almost 30 Years To Make Beverly Hills Cop 4\n\nEddie Murphy is finally returning as Axel Foley in Beverly Hills Cop 4, but the sequel spent decades in development hell with very good reason.\n\nWill Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F End An Unfortunate Eddie Murphy Trend?\n\nClose\n\nFrom what's been revealed thus far, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F has many of the same ingredients as the beloved original movie. Not only does the upcoming film seemingly feature a strong blend of R-rated action and comedy, but key original Beverly Hills Cop cast members like Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and Taggart (John Ashton) are also returning. The movie, then, could end Murphy's recent streak of poorly-reviewed films.\n\nEddie Murphy Movie\n\nRotten Tomatoes Critics' Score\n\nRotten Tomatoes Audience Score\n\nCandy Cane Lane (2023)\n\n46%\n\n45%\n\nYou People (2023)\n\n40%\n\n34%\n\nComing 2 America (2021)\n\n49%\n\n38%\n\nAs seen in the chart above, Murphy's three most recent movies have not been particularly well-received. Candy Cane Lane, You People, and Coming 2 America were all straight-to-streaming releases, and none fared well with either critics or audiences. While Murphy may still be regarded as one of the signature comedic talents of a generation, his recent movies just haven't been that good.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nAlthough Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F features some crucial ingredients for success, there's still a question mark above the film due to the trajectory of the Beverly Hills franchise. While the first movie was well-received, the reception to the second was somewhat more mixed. The third film is generally regarded as a major disappointment. It remains to be seen whether Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F will be a hit, but Gordon-Levitt's new character is evidently an exciting addition to the formula.\n\nSource: Empire Magazine\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel F R ActionComedy\n\nBeverly Hills Cop: Axel Foley is the fourth film in the popular comedy franchise starring Eddie Murphy.

As a kid of 11 or 12, he would lie on the floor of his uncle's lounge room watching Beverly Hills Cop on videotape. \"It just blew me away,\" Molloy tells Entertainment Weekly.\n\nDecades later, Molloy's feature directorial debut is the fourth installment in the franchise, Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F. Premiering on Netflix on July 3, the sequel reunites Eddie Murphy with original cast members Judge Reinhold (Lt. William \"Billy\" Rosewood), John Ashton (Sgt. John Taggart), Paul Reiser (Det. Jeffrey Friedman), and Bronson Pinchot (the scene-stealing Serge).\n\nThere's also some new blood with the addition of Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Axel's partner, Det. Bobby Abbot, and Taylour Paige as Axel's estranged daughter, Jane Saunders, who also happens to be Abbot's ex-girlfriend. Oh, and a fresh-faced newcomer by the name of Kevin Bacon makes his franchise debut as Beverly Hills PD Capt. Grant.\n\nWhen Jane, a criminal defense attorney working in the Hills, receives a death threat, Papa Axel blows into town and teams up with her, Abbot, Rosewood, and Taggert to uncover a conspiracy.\n\nDirecting the legendary Eddie Murphy in arguably his most iconic role had its fair share of surreal moments for Molloy, but none more than the scene near the end of the movie (as seen in the image below) with Murphy, Ashton, and Reinhold sitting in a car and \"talking s---.\"\n\n\"I always had that image of those three guys on a stakeout in the car together, it was just imprinted in my brain,\" Molloy says. \"And then I remember sitting with the three of them in that car, and I actually happened to look around at the crew filming it. I just saw on everyone's faces, like, Oh man, this is exactly where we want to be right now.\"\n\nAs for what brings those three characters back together on stakeout, Molloy doesn't want to give too much away, but he will say, \"Axel's definitely been up to his usual shenanigans. And as always, Rosewood and Taggart have got a close eye on him.\" EW has an exclusive glimpse into that scene with the script page, below.\n\nSome 40 years after the first Beverly Hills Cop, these characters are older but not necessarily wiser. Still, there's plenty of love (and tension) between them. But what really drew Molloy to the film, besides nostalgia, was the film's emotional undercurrent.\n\n\"There was a different side to Axel Foley that I've never seen before,\" he says. \"And I'm really excited for the audiences to see that, too.\"\n\nAs a fan of the franchise, Molloy felt a responsibility to do Axel F justice -- not only to give fans what they expect from a Beverly Hills Cop movie but also to surprise them. He really wanted to nail the tone of the film while embracing the past to make a classic 1980s action comedy for 2024.\n\nWant more movie news?

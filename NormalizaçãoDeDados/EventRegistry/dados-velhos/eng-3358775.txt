While shooting in London on Aug. 13, Tom - who plays Ethan Hunt in the long-running franchise - attempted to jump from one building to another. In a video of the stunt (which you can see here) Tom takes a running leap off some construction scaffolding, only to crash into the side of an opposite building. While he makes the jump, the impact looks like it hurt and he was seen limping afterwards.\n\nOuch! Hopefully, he didn't suffer any major injuries. He seemed to be okay afterward, as the stunt crew helped him back over the gap. Thankfully, he was attached to a pulley system. Had he missed the leap, he would have been caught instead of falling to his death. HollywoodLife.com's sister site, Variety reached out to Tom's people for a comment on the extent of the injuries, but they didn't immediately reply.\n\nTom might need to cut back on his gung-ho attitude after this. He's gained a recent reputation for going to great lengths to execute his own stunts. For example, in his reboot of The Mummy, Tom did 64 takes of a plane crash sequence in zero gravity. Plus, for Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, Tom clung to a side of an airplane as it took off. \"I knew I wanted to have an airplane sequence,\" Tom told Yahoo! UK in 2015. \"I've been thinking about it for a long time. As a kid I remember flying on an airplane and thinking: 'what would it be like out on the wing or on the side of the airplane?\"\n\nDirector Christopher McQuarrie, was thinking of a way to top what the franchise had done in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol. \" I suggested to Tom 'what if you were on the outside of [an Airbus] thing when it took off'. I meant it as sort of a half joke, but he said back to me: 'yeah I could do that!'\" Hopefully, Christopher - who's back for M:I 6 - is extra careful when coming up with Tom's next stunt. Judging by the way he was limping, Mr. Cruise might need an ice pack for the next couple of days.", "time": "17:27:00"}

Der Hollywood Reporter berichtete am Sonntag von dem missgl\u00fcckten Stunt, der sich nur Stunden zuvor am Set in London zugetragen haben soll. Bald darauf wurde auf YouTube ein Video ver\u00f6ffentlicht.\n\nEs zeigt Cruise, wie er einen Sprung von einem Geb\u00e4ude zu einem anderen macht und dabei sein Ziel verfehlt. Ob er sich Knochen brach oder eine innere Verletzung davontrug, war zun\u00e4chst nicht bekannt.\n\nCruise, der w\u00e4hrend des Sprungs angeseilt war, zieht sich in dem Video selbst an der zun\u00e4chst verfehlten Mauer hoch, hat aber danach beim Gehen erhebliche Schwierigkeiten und wird schlie\u00dflich von Mitgliedern seines Teams versorgt. Sein Agent reagierte nach Angaben des Branchenblattes vorerst nicht auf Anfragen.\n\nDer 55-j\u00e4hrige Cruise hat in der Vergangenheit h\u00e4ufig die Stunts der von ihm gespielten Actionhelden selbst ausgef\u00fchrt, beispielsweise bei Spr\u00fcngen, als Flugzeugpilot, auf dem Motorrad oder am Steuerrad bei gef\u00e4hrlichen Stra\u00dfenrennen. Die sechste Folge der \"Mission Impossible\"-Reihe wird wieder von Regisseur Christopher McQuarrie gedreht. Neben Cruise spielen Henry Cavill, Rebecca Ferguson, Angela Bassett and Alec Baldwin mit. Der Film soll Ende Juli 2018 zu sehen sein.

Elected from the Hajipur Lok Sabha seat, Chirag Paswan secured a resounding victory with 6.14 lakh votes, defeating his closest RJD rival by over 1.7 lakh votes. The Lok Sabha election marked a critical milestone in his political journey, signalling his emergence as a key leader in Bihar and on the national stage.Chirag Paswan's decision to contest from Hajipur was deeply symbolic, as this seat was represented eight times by his late father, Ram Vilas Paswan, Bihar\u2019s tallest Dalit leader. Moreover, the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) under Chirag Paswan's leadership put up a stellar show, winning all five Lok Sabha seats it contested in Bihar. Who gets which ministry in Modi 3.0?

Following Ram Vilas Paswan\u2019s death in 2020, a familial and political rift emerged between Chirag and his uncle Pashupati Paras.Despite these challenges, Chirag led his party in the 2020 Bihar Assembly polls, opting to contest independently of the NDA. His strategy to field candidates in JD(U) constituencies significantly impacted the Nitish Kumar-led party\u2019s performance, reducing their seat count from over 70 in 2015 to just 43 in 2020. This bold move established Chirag as a formidable Dalit leader in Bihar.THE BIG LJP SPLITIn 2021, the deepening feud between Chirag and his uncle split the LJP into rival factions. Paras took five of the six LJP MPs with him, leaving his nephew\u2019s faction with just one and no MLAs.The BJP initially sided with Paras, appointing him as a Union minister. Chirag was left in the lurch as he was not only out of the NDA, but the party symbol also went to his estranged uncle's faction.However, Chirag remained steadfast in his loyalty to Narendra Modi.He also embarked on an extensive public outreach campaign, the \"Ashirwad Yatra,\" which garnered massive support across Bihar. POLITICAL RESURGENCERecognising Chirag's growing influence, the BJP welcomed him back into the NDA fold in 2023.In the seat-sharing talks for the Lok Sabha polls, Chirag's faction secured all five Bihar Lok Sabha seats, including Hajipur, sidelining Paras. Chirag gave up his Jamui seat and contested from Hajipur, a prestige battle that he won with flying colours. This victory solidified Chirag's claim as the true heir to his father's political legacy.With his induction into the Modi 3.0 cabinet, Chirag Paswan is poised to expand his influence beyond Bihar, stepping onto the national stage.Published By: Ashutosh AcharyaPublished On: Jun 9, 2024Must Watch", "summary": "<a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/chirag-paswan-takes-oath-modi-cabinet-ljp-bihar-lok-sabha-elections-2550997-2024-06-09\"> <img align=\"left\" hspace=\"2\" height=\"180\" width=\"305\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/in-an-exclusive-chat-with-india-today-tv--paswan-described-himself-as-narendra-modis-hanuman-and-061244135-16x9.png?VersionId=mbyLDmzgUnC59bNIALsBHhlhivSLzxEs\"> </a> The rise of Chirag Paswan: From failed actor to minister in Modi 3.0 Cabinet", "url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/chirag-paswan-takes-oath-modi-cabinet-ljp-bihar-lok-sabha-elections-2550997-2024-06-09", "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/in-an-exclusive-chat-with-india-today-tv--paswan-described-himself-as-narendra-modis-hanuman-and-061244135-16x9.png?VersionId=mbyLDmzgUnC59bNIALsBHhlhivSLzxEs?size=1280:720", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:59:55", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.485}

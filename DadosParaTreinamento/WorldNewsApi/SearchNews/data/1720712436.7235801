The news comes after on-field umpires Rod Tucker and Richard Illingworth inspected the pitch at 7:45pm IST. In the run-up to the scheduled toss time at 7:30pm IST, slight rain made its way in New York, as predicted by weather forecasts, before relenting and allowing players from both teams to do their respective warm-ups. India have a 6-1 head-to-head record against Pakistan in Men\u2019s T20 World Cup meetings. The last five T20 World Cup games between the two teams have been won by the chasing side. India won their opening match against Ireland by eight wickets at New York earlier this week, but Pakistan lost their first game of the competition in a super over defeat to co-hosts USA at Dallas.

On Sunday, May 5, 2024, a Virginia judge signed off on a prosecutor's request to withdraw charges against five more people in connection with the 2023 death of Otieno, a young man who was pinned to the floor for about 11 minutes while being admitted to a state psychiatric hospital.\n\nA Virginia judge has signed off on a prosecutor's request to withdraw charges against five more people in connection with the 2023 death of Irvo Otieno, a young man who was pinned to the floor for about 11 minutes while being admitted to a state psychiatric hospital.\n\nJudge Joseph Teefy of Dinwiddie Circuit Court on Sunday approved the prosecutor's motion to nolle prosequi -- or effectively drop for now -- the case against five sheriff's deputies, according to court records. The prosecutor could still seek to renew the charges, attorneys involved with the matter said.\n\nThe move means prosecutions are now actively pending for just three of the 10 Henrico County deputies and Central State Hospital workers initially charged with second-degree murder in Otieno's death, which was captured on video that sparked outrage and calls for mental health and law enforcement reforms.\n\nOtieno, a 28-year-old Black man, had been taken into custody in suburban Richmond amid a mental health crisis. He was initially transported to a private hospital but later jailed after law enforcement officials said he became combative. Later, he was transferred to the state mental health hospital south of Richmond, where he died in March 2023 of what a medical examiner found was \"positional and mechanical asphyxia with restraints.\"\n\nHospital video captured a scrum of deputies and hospital workers restraining Otieno while he was in handcuffs and leg shackles.\n\nOtieno's mother and her attorneys, who spoke at a news conference Monday, said they disagreed strongly with the prosecutor's action. But they also said the prosecutor had assured them the decision had been made for strategic reasons and that she planned to renew pursuit of the charges.\n\nCaroline Ouko, Otieno's mother, called the move a \"radical, reckless decision with great ramifications.\"\n\n\"We demand justice and nothing less,\" she said, renewing her long-running call for the U.S. Department of Justice to get involved in the case.\n\nThe prosecutor, Dinwiddie County Commonwealth's Attorney Amanda Mann, did not respond to questions from The Associated Press. She said in a news release that her motions to nolle prosequi the charges speak for themselves and she would have no further comment.\n\nIn those motions, Mann wrote that her predecessor, an interim commonwealth's attorney, had scheduled the order of the defendants' trials. The timing of the trials is strategically important, Mann wrote in each individual's motion, adding that she did not \"find the order to be sound and competent prosecutorial decision making.\"\n\nRuss Stone, a defense attorney for one of the five deputies, Dwayne Bramble, said Mann could elect to pursue the charges again. But he said such a development would be \"extremely rare.\"\n\n\"It's been our position all along that it was prosecutorial overreach\" by the first commonwealth's attorney on the case, who \"charged innocent people without an adequate basis,\" Stone said.\n\n\"And we appreciate the fact that the current commonwealth's attorney has corrected that,\" he said.\n\nDefense attorneys for the other individuals -- Jermaine Branch, Randy Boyer, Bradley Disse and Tabitha Levere -- did not respond to phone messages seeking comment.\n\nThe prosecutor who initially handled the case -- and has since left the job -- dropped criminal charges against two hospital employees last June.\n\nThe two deputies and one hospital worker with active cases have jury trials scheduled for October and December, according to online court records.\n\nIn a separate civil case, Otieno's family reached an $8.5 million settlement with the state, county and sheriff's department whose deputies helped restrain him.\n\nOtieno's family, its legal team and other advocates have raised concerns that Otieno's race played a role in the way he was treated. The group of individuals who have faced charges in connection with his death was multiracial, according to court records.\n\nNationally known civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is part of the family's legal team, has drawn comparisons between Otieno's death and the killing of George Floyd, whose family he also represented.\n\nAt Monday's news conference, he said the case against the individuals who had been charged was not complicated, given that their interactions with Otieno were captured on camera. They should be \"zealously\" prosecuted, he said.\n\n\"The troubling issue for many of us in the Black community is ... we are quick to be prosecuted when we are accused of a crime.

But he said such a development would be \"extremely rare.\"\n\n\"It's been our position all along that it was prosecutorial overreach\" by the first commonwealth's attorney on the case, who \"charged innocent people without an adequate basis,\" Stone said.\n\n\"And we appreciate the fact that the current commonwealth's attorney has corrected that,\" he said.\n\nDefense attorneys for the other individuals -- Jermaine Branch, Randy Boyer, Bradley Disse and Tabitha Levere -- did not respond to phone messages seeking comment.\n\nThe prosecutor who initially handled the case -- and has since left the job -- dropped criminal charges against two hospital employees last June.\n\nThe two deputies and one hospital worker with active cases have jury trials scheduled for October and December, according to online court records.\n\nIn a separate civil case, Otieno's family reached an $8.5 million settlement with the state, county and sheriff's department whose deputies helped restrain him.\n\nOtieno's family, its legal team and other advocates have raised concerns that Otieno's race played a role in the way he was treated. The group of individuals who have faced charges in connection with his death was multiracial, according to court records.\n\nNationally known civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who is part of the family's legal team, has drawn comparisons between Otieno's death and the killing of George Floyd, whose family he also represented.\n\nAt Monday's news conference, he said the case against the individuals who had been charged was not complicated, given that their interactions with Otieno were captured on camera. They should be \"zealously\" prosecuted, he said.\n\n\"The troubling issue for many of us in the Black community is ... we are quick to be prosecuted when we are accused of a crime. However, when we're the victims of crime by the authorities, there seems to be delay, delay, delay,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle

A medical examiner ruled his death homicide by asphyxiation.\n\nIn March, on the one-year anniversary of her son's death, Ouko said her pain has not dulled and that she visits her son's gravestone daily. It is marked by two flags: one from Kenya and another from the United States.\n\nOn that day, Ouko expressed her wish that Mann mete out justice in all of the cases she inherited when she won the job.\n\n\"All I'm asking is she'll do the right thing and aggressively prosecute the eight murder indictments of Irvo Otieno,\" Ouko said. \"Because anything less would be an affront. Not just to me and my family, but to the African American community as a whole.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Celebration of life for Irvo Otieno\n\nLuca Powell (804) 649-6103\n\nlpowell@timesdispatch.com\n\n@luca_a_powell on Twitter\n\nLuca Powell\n\nMetro Reporter\n\nAuthor twitter Author email Follow Luca Powell Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

The prosecutor could still seek to renew the charges, attorneys involved with the matter said.\n\nThe move means prosecutions are now actively pending for just three of the 10 Henrico County deputies and Central State Hospital workers initially charged with second-degree murder in Otieno's death, which was captured on video that sparked outrage and calls for mental health and law enforcement reforms.\n\nOtieno, a 28-year-old Black man, had been taken into custody in suburban Richmond amid a mental health crisis. He was initially transported to a private hospital but later jailed after law enforcement officials said he became combative. Later, he was transferred to the state mental health hospital south of Richmond, where he died in March 2023 of what a medical examiner found was \"positional and mechanical asphyxia with restraints.\"\n\nHospital video captured a scrum of deputies and hospital workers restraining Otieno while he was in handcuffs and leg shackles.\n\nOtieno's mother and her attorneys, who spoke at a news conference Monday, said they disagreed strongly with the prosecutor's action. But they also said the prosecutor had assured them the decision had been made for strategic reasons and that she planned to renew pursuit of the charges.\n\nFILE - Caroline Ouko, mother of Irvo Otieno, holds a portrait of her son with attorney Ben Crump, left; her older son, Leon Ochieng; and attorney Mark Krudys, at the Dinwiddie Courthouse in Dinwiddie, Va., March 16, 2023. On Sunday, May 5, 2024, a Virginia judge signed off on a prosecutor's request to withdraw charges against five more people in connection with the 2023 death of Otieno, a young man who was pinned to the floor for about 11 minutes while being admitted to a state psychiatric hospital. (Daniel Sangjib Min/Richmond Times-Dispatch via AP, File)\n\nCaroline Ouko, Otieno\u00b4s mother, called the move a \"radical, reckless decision with great ramifications.\"\n\n\"We demand justice and nothing less,\" she said, renewing her long-running call for the U.S. Department of Justice to get involved in the case.\n\nThe prosecutor, Dinwiddie County Commonwealth's Attorney Amanda Mann, did not respond to questions from The Associated Press. She said in a news release that her motions to nolle prosequi the charges speak for themselves and she would have no further comment.\n\nIn those motions, Mann wrote that her predecessor, an interim commonwealth's attorney, had scheduled the order of the defendants' trials. The timing of the trials is of strategic importance, Mann wrote in each individual's motion, adding that she did not \"find the order to be sound and competent prosecutorial decision making.\"\n\nRuss Stone, a defense attorney for one of the five deputies, Dwayne Bramble, said Mann could elect to pursue the charges again. But he said such a development would be \"extremely rare.\"\n\n\"It's been our position all along that it was prosecutorial overreach\" by the first commonwealth's attorney on the case, who \"charged innocent people without an adequate basis,\" Stone said.\n\n\"And we appreciate the fact that the current commonwealth's attorney has corrected that,\" he said.\n\nDefense attorneys for the other individuals - Jermaine Branch, Randy Boyer, Bradley Disse and Tabitha Levere - did not respond to phone messages seeking comment.\n\nThe prosecutor who initially handled the case - and has since left the job - dropped criminal charges against two hospital employees last June.\n\nThe two deputies and one hospital worker with active cases have jury trials scheduled for October and December, according to online court records.\n\nIn a separate civil case, Otieno's family reached an $8.5 million settlement with the state, county and sheriff's department whose deputies helped restrain him.\n\nFILE - Caroline Ouko, mother of Irvo Otieno, holds a portrait of her son at the Dinwiddie Courthouse in Dinwiddie, Va., March 16, 2023.

The prosecutor could still seek to renew the charges, attorneys involved with the matter said.\n\nThe move means prosecutions are now actively pending for just three of the 10 Henrico County deputies and Central State Hospital workers initially charged with second-degree murder in Otieno's death, which was captured on video that sparked outrage and calls for mental health and law enforcement reforms.\n\nOtieno, a 28-year-old Black man, had been taken into custody in suburban Richmond amid a mental health crisis. He was initially transported to a private hospital but later jailed after law enforcement officials said he became combative. Later, he was transferred to the state mental health hospital south of Richmond, where he died in March 2023 of what a medical examiner found was \"positional and mechanical asphyxia with restraints.\"\n\nHospital video captured a scrum of deputies and hospital workers restraining Otieno while he was in handcuffs and leg shackles.\n\nOtieno's mother and her attorneys, who spoke at a news conference Monday, said they disagreed strongly with the prosecutor's action. But they also said the prosecutor had assured them the decision had been made for strategic reasons and that she planned to renew pursuit of the charges.\n\nCaroline Ouko, Otieno's mother, called the move a \"radical, reckless decision with great ramifications.\"\n\n\"We demand justice and nothing less,\" she said, renewing her long-running call for the U.S. Department of Justice to get involved in the case.\n\nThe prosecutor, Dinwiddie County Commonwealth's Attorney Amanda Mann, did not respond to questions from The Associated Press. She said in a news release that her motions to nolle prosequi the charges speak for themselves and she would have no further comment.\n\nIn those motions, Mann wrote that her predecessor, an interim commonwealth's attorney, had scheduled the order of the defendants' trials. The timing of the trials is of strategic importance, Mann wrote in each individual's motion, adding that she did not \"find the order to be sound and competent prosecutorial decision making.\"\n\nRuss Stone, a defense attorney for one of the five deputies, Dwayne Bramble, said Mann could elect to pursue the charges again. But he said such a development would be \"extremely rare.\"\n\n\"It's been our position all along that it was prosecutorial overreach\" by the first commonwealth's attorney on the case, who \"charged innocent people without an adequate basis,\" Stone said.\n\n\"And we appreciate the fact that the current commonwealth's attorney has corrected that,\" he said.\n\nDefense attorneys for the other individuals -- Jermaine Branch, Randy Boyer, Bradley Disse and Tabitha Levere -- did not respond to phone messages seeking comment.\n\nThe prosecutor who initially handled the case -- and has since left the job -- dropped criminal charges against two hospital employees last June.\n\nThe two deputies and one hospital worker with active cases have jury trials scheduled for October and December, according to online court records.\n\nIn a separate civil case, Otieno's family reached an $8.5 million settlement with the state, county and sheriff's department whose deputies helped restrain him.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Charges now remain against just two deputies and one hospital employee.\n\nMann said in a statement Monday that her office had filed motions on Friday to dismiss the charges against deputies Randy Joseph Boyer, Dwayne Alan Bramble, Jermaine Lavar Branch, Bradley Thomas Disse and Tabitha Renee Levere.\n\nThey were to be tried separately this year. In her motion, Mann wrote that the order of their trials was of \"strategic importance\" and that the dates set by her predecessor were not \"sound and competent prosecutorial decision making.\"\n\n\"The motions speak for themselves; therefore, this Office has no further information to provide in the cases,\" Mann said.\n\nMann could still seek to renew the charges, Mark Krudys, an attorney for Otieno's family, said.\n\nOtieno's mother, Caroline Ouko, said Monday that she and her lawyers had met with Mann and objected to her motion to withdraw the charges.\n\n\"We did not endorse her plan,\" Ouko said Monday at a news conference with Krudys. Another attorney, Benjamin Crump, appeared virtually.\n\nOuko called the dropped charges \"a radical, reckless decision with great ramifications for justice for Irvo Otieno.\" She called on the Justice Department to intervene.\n\n\"We hope that the Dinwiddie commonwealth attorney can do her job. And if she is not willing to prosecute, the DOJ, where are you? Where are you? The Department of Justice, where are you?\" Ouko said, her voice breaking. \"It is time. It is time for you to bring your boots to Richmond and stand for Irvo. And get justice for my son.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Justice Department did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nOtieno was arrested on March 3, 2023, after Henrico County police officers responded to a possible burglary call, the police department said. Officers placed him under an emergency custody order, which under state law is used in cases of mental illness, and took him to a hospital for further evaluation, a police statement said. At the hospital, police said, Otieno \"became physically assaultive towards officers.\"\n\nHe was then taken to the Henrico County Jail and charged with three counts of assault on a law enforcement officer and one count each of disorderly conduct in a hospital and vandalism.\n\nOn March 6, 2023, he was taken to a state psychiatric hospital, Central State, in Dinwiddie County, where he died after being pressed to the floor for about 11 minutes by a group of Henrico County sheriff's deputies and hospital employees.\n\nSurveillance video from the hospital, which was released without audio, showed sheriff's deputies entering a room, dragging Otieno and forcing him to the floor, where they restrained him until his death, which was ruled a homicide by asphyxiation.\n\nOtieno's family has said he had a long history of mental health problems.\n\nCharges are still pending against two sheriff's deputies, Brandon Edward Rodgers and Kaiyell Dajour Sanders, and Wavie Lavon Jones, a Central State Hospital employee, according to Mann's office. Their attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAttorneys for four of the deputies who had charges dropped on Monday -- Boyer, Branch, Disse and Levere -- did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An attorney for the fifth, Bramble, said they were pleased with the decision.\n\n\"We're pleased that this prosecutor was willing to make a decision that was based on the law and the evidence rather than other factors,\" Russ Stone said.\n\nOuko said she believed all of those originally charged shared equal culpability.\n\n\"He was restrained, they had him,\" said Crump, who also represents the families of Tyre Nichols and George Floyd. \"He wasn't going anywhere. He was in the mental health hospital, for God's sake. Why the need to put all this weight on top of him to the point of him suffocating to death?\"\n\nIn September, Otieno's family reached an $8.5 million settlement with the state and the county and sheriff whose deputies were involved in restraining him. The settlement agreement said they had not admitted any liability and denied that their actions caused Otieno's death.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"},

(Daniel Sangjib Min/Richmond Times-Dispatch via AP, File)ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nA Virginia judge has signed off on a prosecutor's request to withdraw charges against five more people in connection with the 2023 death of Irvo Otieno, a young man who was pinned to the floor for about 11 minutes while being admitted to a state psychiatric hospital.\n\nJudge Joseph Teefy of Dinwiddie Circuit Court on Sunday approved the prosecutor's motion to nolle prosequi -- or effectively drop for now -- the case against five sheriff's deputies, according to court records. The prosecutor could still seek to renew the charges, attorneys involved with the matter said.\n\nThe move means prosecutions are now actively pending for just three of the 10 Henrico County deputies and Central State Hospital workers initially charged with second-degree murder in Otieno's death, which was captured on video that sparked outrage and calls for mental health and law enforcement reforms.\n\nOtieno, a 28-year-old Black man, had been taken into custody in suburban Richmond amid a mental health crisis. He was initially transported to a private hospital but later jailed after law enforcement officials said he became combative. Later, he was transferred to the state mental health hospital south of Richmond, where he died in March 2023 of what a medical examiner found was \"positional and mechanical asphyxia with restraints.\"\n\nHospital video captured a scrum of deputies and hospital workers restraining Otieno while he was in handcuffs and leg shackles.\n\nOtieno's mother and her attorneys, who spoke at a news conference Monday, said they disagreed strongly with the prosecutor's action. But they also said the prosecutor had assured them the decision had been made for strategic reasons and that she planned to renew pursuit of the charges.\n\nCaroline Ouko, Otieno's mother, called the move a \"radical, reckless decision with great ramifications.\"\n\n\"We demand justice and nothing less,\" she said, renewing her long-running call for the U.S. Department of Justice to get involved in the case.\n\nThe prosecutor, Dinwiddie County Commonwealth's Attorney Amanda Mann, did not respond to questions from The Associated Press. She said in a news release that her motions to nolle prosequi the charges speak for themselves and she would have no further comment.\n\nIn those motions, Mann wrote that her predecessor, an interim commonwealth's attorney, had scheduled the order of the defendants' trials. The timing of the trials is of strategic importance, Mann wrote in each individual's motion, adding that she did not \"find the order to be sound and competent prosecutorial decision making.\"\n\nRuss Stone, a defense attorney for one of the five deputies, Dwayne Bramble, said Mann could elect to pursue the charges again. But he said such a development would be \"extremely rare.\"\n\n\"It's been our position all along that it was prosecutorial overreach\" by the first commonwealth's attorney on the case, who \"charged innocent people without an adequate basis,\" Stone said.\n\n\"And we appreciate the fact that the current commonwealth's attorney has corrected that,\" he said.\n\nDefense attorneys for the other individuals -- Jermaine Branch, Randy Boyer, Bradley Disse and Tabitha Levere -- did not respond to phone messages seeking comment.\n\nThe prosecutor who initially handled the case -- and has since left the job -- dropped criminal charges against two hospital employees last June.\n\nThe two deputies and one hospital worker with active cases have jury trials scheduled for October and December, according to online court records.\n\nIn a separate civil case, Otieno's family reached an $8.5 million settlement with the state, county and sheriff's department whose deputies helped restrain him.",

But if Mann's motion is granted, only Henrico County Sheriff's Deputies Brandon Edwards Rodgers and Kaiyell Dajour Sanders would remain facing the murder charges in the immediate interim.\n\nCivil rights attorney Ben Crump, who represents Otieno's family, has scheduled a press conference for Monday to address the update on the case.\n\nWhat happened to Irvo Otieno?\n\nOn March 6, 2023, 28-year-old Irvo Otieno died after he was pinned down by several officers and healthcare staff at a mental health hospital in Virginia.\n\nDuring the March 6 incident, Otieno was being transferred from a Henrico County jail to Central State Hospital, a Dinwiddie official said. According to family members, Otieno had a long-running history of mental health struggles.\n\nInitially, he was taken to a Richmond area hospital for psychiatric treatment March 3, but allegedly, he became violent and combative at the facility.\n\nOtieno was criminally charged and transferred to jail where he was denied access to crucial medication for his condition, family members said.\n\nHis death was ruled a homicide by asphyxiation.\n\nVideo released of the incident shows several officers forcing Otieno to lie face down flat on the floor. At times, his body can barely be seen in the video due to the number of officers pinning him down to the ground with their weight.\n\nOfficials from the Dinwiddie County Commonwealth office also released a 911 phone call that offered more details into the harrowing incident. According to CNN, in the audio, a caller repeatedly asked for medical assistance after Otieno stopped breathing. They claimed he was \"very aggressive\" and combative prior to losing oxygen.\n\nSeven deputies and three hospital employees were indicted by a grand jury on second-degree murder charges, although charges against the hospital employees were dropped several months later.\n\nIn September of last year, Otieno's family agreed to an $8.5 million settlement with the state of Virginia, Henrico County, and the sheriff whose deputies were involved in his death.\n\nAt the time, Crump said the family was\"pleased that they were able to find a resolution outside of court in a manner that honors Irvo's life.\"\n\nAccording to the settlement agreement, although the state, county and the sheriff agreed to collectively pay the $8.5 million to Otieno's family, they did not admit any liability in the death.\n\nThe Associated Press found that the terms of the agreement included a payment of about $5 million to Otieno's mother and siblings and another $3 million to cover funeral and burial expenses as well as attorneys' fees.\n\nThis is America.\n\nJustice For Alvin Motley: Suspected White Supremacist Found Guilty Of Murdering Black Man Over Loud Music\n\n'For Our Children:' Trailer For

The prosecutor could still seek to renew the charges, attorneys involved with the matter said.\n\nThe move means prosecutions are now actively pending for just three of the 10 Henrico County deputies and Central State Hospital workers initially charged with second-degree murder in Otieno's death, which was captured on video that sparked outrage and calls for mental health and law enforcement reforms.\n\nOtieno, a 28-year-old Black man, had been taken into custody in suburban Richmond amid a mental health crisis. He was initially transported to a private hospital but later jailed after law enforcement officials said he became combative. Later, he was transferred to the state mental health hospital south of Richmond, where he died in March 2023 of what a medical examiner found was \"positional and mechanical asphyxia with restraints.\"\n\nHospital video captured a scrum of deputies and hospital workers restraining Otieno while he was in handcuffs and leg shackles.\n\nOtieno's mother and her attorneys, who spoke at a news conference Monday, said they disagreed strongly with the prosecutor's action. But they also said the prosecutor had assured them the decision had been made for strategic reasons and that she planned to renew pursuit of the charges.\n\nCaroline Ouko, Otieno's mother, called the move a \"radical, reckless decision with great ramifications.\"\n\n\"We demand justice and nothing less,\" she said, renewing her long-running call for the U.S. Department of Justice to get involved in the case.\n\nThe prosecutor, Dinwiddie County Commonwealth's Attorney Amanda Mann, did not respond to questions from The Associated Press. She said in a news release that her motions to nolle prosequi the charges speak for themselves and she would have no further comment.\n\nIn those motions, Mann wrote that her predecessor, an interim commonwealth's attorney, had scheduled the order of the defendants' trials. The timing of the trials is of strategic importance, Mann wrote in each individual's motion, adding that she did not \"find the order to be sound and competent prosecutorial decision making.\"\n\nRuss Stone, a defense attorney for one of the five deputies, Dwayne Bramble, said Mann could elect to pursue the charges again. But he said such a development would be \"extremely rare.\"\n\n\"It's been our position all along that it was prosecutorial overreach\" by the first commonwealth's attorney on the case, who \"charged innocent people without an adequate basis,\" Stone said.\n\n\"And we appreciate the fact that the current commonwealth's attorney has corrected that,\" he said.\n\nDefense attorneys for the other individuals -- Jermaine Branch, Randy Boyer, Bradley Disse and Tabitha Levere -- did not respond to phone messages seeking comment.\n\nThe prosecutor who initially handled the case -- and has since left the job -- dropped criminal charges against two hospital employees last June.\n\nThe two deputies and one hospital worker with active cases have jury trials scheduled for October and December, according to online court records.\n\nIn a separate civil case, Otieno's family reached an $8.5 million settlement with the state, county and sheriff's department whose deputies helped restrain him.",

Mann filed the motions on Thursday.\n\nIn her motions, Mann wrote that her office did not find the order of the trials to be \"sound and competent prosecutorial decision making.\" Mann inherited the Otieno case from Jonathan Bourlier, whom she narrowly defeated in November to the elected position of Dinwiddie commonwealth's attorney.\n\nOn Monday morning, the motions were granted.\n\nCrime Dinwiddie prosecutor moves to drop charges against five more defendants in Irvo Otieno case Luca Powell\n\nOtieno's death on March 6, 2023, drew national attention. Otieno died at Central State Hospital in Dinwiddie while being restrained by seven Henrico County sheriff's deputies, as well as three hospital workers.\n\nA total of 10 defendants were initially charged. Three remain.\n\nA lawyer for the family, Mark Krudys, said he and Ouko met with Mann before she moved to drop the cases. The family opposed the move and questioned the necessity of temporarily dismissing any charges.\n\nKrudys said he was left with the impression that the five dropped cases would be brought back. In their meeting, Krudys said Mann wanted the \"strategically strongest cases\" to go to trial first.\n\n\"We stated vehemently that we disagreed with it,\" Krudys said at Monday's conference. \"This is not a case that requires a lot of strategy.\"\n\nMann did not return a request for comment on Monday afternoon. Court records show she initially intended to move the cases around without dismissals, but that move was blocked by Dinwiddie Circuit Court Judge Joseph M. Teefey.\n\n\"These cases are not going to go away,\" Krudys said. \"We are going to continue to be on Ms. Mann's doorstep -- not telling her what to do -- but asking her, as a victim's family, for justice to be done.\"\n\nOuko called the move to dismiss the charges a \"radical, reckless decision with great ramifications for justice.\"\n\n\"Dismissing for now means those charges could only be brought back if the state so chooses. That means it can be left to discretion. Discretion can be discriminatory,\" said Ouko, who previously said \"systemic racism\" swallowed her son.\n\nTurning to the cameras, she exhorted federal attorneys to bring federal charges to the defendants.\n\n\"DOJ, where are you?\" Ouko asked. \"Kindly step in and stand for Irvo Otieno. And turn every stone upside down to find the truth. Because what happened to my son is unimaginable.\"\n\nTrials were slated to begin in June. Those trials will now be canceled. The first trial -- that of Central State Hospital employee Wavie Jones -- will begin on Sept. 30.\n\nAmong the defendants whose charges were dropped was Dwayne Bramble, a Henrico sheriff's deputy. Bramble's attorney, G. Russell Stone, said he thinks it's unlikely Bramble will be reindicted.\n\n\"I don't believe that that will happen,\" Stone said. \"I have watched that video over and over. Mr. Bramble never should have been charged.\"\n\nLocal News Family and friends remembers Irvo Otieno on anniversary of his death Luca Powell , Thad Green\n\nStone would not comment on whether Mann had told him whether she intended to reindict Bramble. Reindicting the deputies will require Mann's office presenting evidence to a Dinwiddie grand jury. If the five defendants are reindicted, their trial dates will likely come in 2025.\n\nThe family was joined by national civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who spoke at Otieno's funeral last year.\n\n\"We in the Black community, we always see it like this: We're quick to be prosecuted when we are accused of a crime. However, when we are the victims of crime by the authorities, there seems to be delay, delay, delay,\" Crump said.\n\nHe said the strength of the evidence should make for an \"open-and-shut case.\"\n\nEvidence in the trial will almost certainly include video made public after Otieno's death. One video shows him appearing to be beaten by a deputy in his jail cell. Another video of CCTV footage from Central State Hospital shows the 12-minute segment in which he asphyxiated while restrained.\n\n\"What more do we need?\" Crump said. \"That video is clear. It's crystal clear.\"\n\nHenrico police initially detained Otieno, who struggled with mental illness, on March 3, three days before his death. Police brought him to Parham Doctors' Hospital's crisis unit, where staff tried to sedate him with medication.\n\nAn external report commissioned by the federal agency that regulates hospitals found that he never saw a psychiatrist during a six-hour stay, nor was his mother allowed in from the hospital's waiting room.\n\nHenrico police arrested him on charges of assaulting an officer while in his hospital bed. Deputies continued to struggle with him at the Henrico jail facility nearby and ultimately sought his transfer to Central State -- a maximum-security psychiatric facility.\n\nIn an intake room at the hospital, Otieno, a former basketball and football player who weighed about 270 pounds, was pinned under the weight of seven deputies and three hospital employees.\n\nState & Regional Politics Virginia lawmakers find common ground on mental health reforms Dave Ress Mugshots: 8 charged in death of Irvo Otieno Kaiyell Sanders Randy Boyer Tabitha Levere Bradley Disse Dwayne Bramble Jermaine Branch Brandon Rogers Wavie Jones\n\nLuca Powell (804) 649-6103\n\nlpowell@timesdispatch.com\n\n@luca_a_powell on Twitter\n\nLuca Powell\n\nMetro Reporter\n\nAuthor twitter Author email Follow Luca Powell Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

(AP) -- A large group of sheriff's deputies and employees of a Virginia mental hospital pinned patient Irvo Otieno to the ground until he was motionless and limp, then began unsuccessful resuscitation efforts, newly obtained surveillance video shows.\n\nThe footage, which has no audio, shows various members of the group struggling with a handcuffed and shackled Otieno over the course of about 20 minutes after he's led into a room at Central State Hospital, where he was going to be admitted March 6. For most of that duration, Otieno is on the floor being restrained by a fluctuating group that at one point appeared to reach 10 people pressing down on various parts of his body.\n\nThe death of the 28-year-old Black man has led to second-degree murder charges against seven deputies and three hospital workers and an outcry from his family, who has said he was brutally mistreated, both at the state hospital and while in law enforcement custody for several days earlier. Attorneys for many of the defendants have said they will vigorously fight the charges.\n\nRelatives of Otieno were shown video from the hospital last week by a prosecutor, Dinwiddie Commonwealth's Attorney Ann Cabell Baskervill, who had said that she planned to publicly release it Tuesday.\n\nBut attorneys for at least two of the defendants sought to block the video's release, arguing that it could hinder a fair trial. The Associated Press and other news outlets obtained it and other footage through a link included in a public court filing made by Baskervill.\n\nAccording to timestamps included in the footage, an SUV carrying Otieno arrived at the hospital just before 4 p.m. March 6. By 4:19 p.m., a different camera shows him being brought into a room with tables and chairs. He is hauled toward a seat before eventually slumping to the floor.\n\nAn increasing number of workers put their hands on him, holding him down as he appears to start to move on the floor. Otieno's body is difficult to see at times, obscured by someone on top of him or someone standing.\n\n\"He certainly did not deserve to be smothered to death, which is what happened,\" Baskervill said in court Tuesday. The workers were holding him down, \"from his braids down to his toes,\" she said.\n\nBy the 4:39 p.m. timestamp, someone is taking his pulse and he appears unresponsive. Soon after, as Otieno's body lies still, someone appears to administer two injections. By 4:42 p.m., CPR appears to be underway. Life-saving efforts continue for over a half-hour until the workers step back from Otieno's body, which is draped with a sheet.\n\nFinal autopsy findings have not yet been released, though Baskervill has said multiple times that he died of asphyxiation. Defense attorneys have raised the possibility that the injections contributed to his death, though she disputed that Tuesday, saying he was already dead when the shots were administered.\n\nThe prosecutor initially charged the 10 defendants through a process known as a criminal information. On Tuesday, a grand jury in Dinwiddie County signed off on second-degree murder charges for all 10.\n\nAlso Tuesday, a judge granted bond for two of the deputies and one hospital employee after hearing arguments from Baskervill and their defense attorneys.\n\nCaleb Kershner, an attorney for Deputy Randy Boyer, said in court that Otieno had been \"somewhat combative\" at the jail and hospital. He said Boyer did not realize Otieno was in any danger as he was being restrained because Boyer was working near his legs.\n\n\"Clearly, there was a significant need to restrain this man given the mental health issues that were going on,\" Kershner said.\n\nJeff Everhart, an attorney for Deputy Brandon Rodgers, said his client had been trying to help by moving Otieno to his side. But Baskervill said the video shows Otieno was moved on his side only when someone from the hospital came in and told him to roll him over.", "source": {"uri": "sfltimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South Florida Times: Miami , Broward, Palm Beach, Breaking News & Weather at SFLTimes.com - Home"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erick_Otieno", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erick Otieno"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Legislator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinwiddie_County,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dinwiddie County, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dinwiddie County, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_State_Hospital_(Virginia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central State Hospital (Virginia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatric hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handcuffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Handcuffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardiopulmonary resuscitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SUV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_a_fair_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right to a fair trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asphyxia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/AudioVisual", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/AudioVisual", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Education and Training", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near_Death_Experiences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Near Death Experiences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "http://www.sfltimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/6.43.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542103", "eventUri": "eng-9542103", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-06", "textStart": 508, "textEnd": 515, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

(CN) -- The mother of Irvo Otieno, a Black man smothered at a Virginia hospital, spoke out Monday about her displeasure with the dismissal of charges for now against five of the eight suspects.\n\n\"We demand justice,\" Otieno's mother Caroline Ouko said. \"And nothing less.\"\n\nA judge Sunday granted Commonwealth Attorney Amanda Mann's nolle prosequi motion to dismiss second-degree murder charges against five of the seven deputies involved. Trials will commence for former Henrico sheriff's deputies Brandon Rodgers and Kaiyell Sanders, as well as former Central State Hospital employee Wavie Jones.\n\nMann is the third prosecutor on the case after being elected last November. The original Dinwiddie County chief prosecutor, Ann Cabell Baskervill, resigned in the summer of 2023 to pursue a master's degree in Paris. Baskervill received criticism for her decision to charge all 10 people involved with second-degree murder.\n\nAfter receiving a mental health call, the Henrico County police placed Otieno under emergency custody on March 3, 2023. Police denied access to Ouko when they took her son to a hospital in Henrico. After a struggle at the hospital, police took Otieno to jail.\n\nThe Henrico County Sheriff's Office took Otieno to Central State Hospital around 4 p.m. on March 6, and state police were called to investigate his death just hours later around 7:30 p.m.\n\nThe 28-year-old Black man's death caused a national outcry and calls for mental health and police reform after a video circulated of police and hospital staff forcefully dragging Otieno into a room, restraining him with handcuffs and leg irons and pinning him to the ground for over 11 minutes. A Virginia medical examiner determined homicide caused by positional and mechanical asphyxia with restraints as the cause of Otieno's death.\n\nAttorney Mark Krudys of the Kurdys Law Firm and prominent civil rights attorney Ben Crump secured an $8.5 million civil settlement this past September. Any justice for the criminal charges rests with Mann, the prosecutor.\n\nWith less than a month until the first of eight separate second-degree murder trials were slated to begin, Mann unsuccessfully tried to restructure the order of the trials according to what cases she found most compelling. After Dinwiddie Circuit Judge Joseph Teefey denied the motion, Mann moved to dismiss the charges. The nolle prosequi motion allows her to bring the charges back later.\n\nCrump, Krudys, and Ouko told reporters that Mann's motion was a mistake. They claimed the video evidence was more than enough to convict all involved.\n\n\"The only thing that makes it a complicated case is that the police killed a Black man,\" Crump said via a video stream. \"These charges are ready to go be prosecuted. Don't deny Miss Caroline justice that she deserves.\"\n\nCrump condemned the slow-moving process that is now further delayed. Crump has represented the families of other Black men killed by police, including Michael Brown, Keenan Anderson, George Floyd and Trayvon Martin.\n\n\"We are quick to be prosecuted when we are accused of a crime,\" Crump said of Black people. \"However, when we are the victims of crimes by the authorities, there seems to be delay, delay, delay.\"\n\nThe trio pleaded with the U.S. Department of Justice to intervene in the case.\n\n\"The Department of Justice, where are you,\" an emotional Ouko asked. \"It is time for you to bring your boots to Richmond and stand for Irvo.\"\n\nOuko made it clear she wouldn't hold her breath for Mann to refile charges against the five dismissed defendants. It will now be up to the state's discretion.\n\n\"Discretion can be discriminatory,\" Ouko said. \"What happened to my son is unimaginable.\"\n\nFollowing Otieno's death, Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin signed a bill titled \"Irvo's Law\" that gives families and caregivers access to their loved ones in crisis while they're receiving a mental health evaluation in an emergency room.\n\n\"Imagine that was your child who had mental health issues,\" Crump said. \"Ask yourself, do those officers deserve to be held to the full extent of the law? If you make the conclusion that if that was your child, it would be warranted, then why is it any different when it's a Black mother's child?\"", "source": {"uri": "courthousenews.com", "dataType":

They are allowed to bring them back but in the vast majority of situations when that occurs that does not happen.\"\n\n\"We are very pleased with a nolle prosequi,\" Stone said. \"The fact of the matter is, I think the people of Dinwiddie should consider themselves lucky that they have a prosecutor who is willing to do what the law requires, as opposed to just what is politically expedient.\"\n\nThe case has already been through three prosecutors.\n\n\"Remember this case first started with a different prosecutor, there was somebody else who dropped the charges against these people,\" Stone continued. \"I've been through the evidence over and over and over again and on behalf of Dwayne Bramble. I can certainly say that, I would defy anybody to show me where he did anything wrong. All he did was what he was trained to do. He's got a difficult job and difficult circumstances, but he followed his training.\"\n\nThe news comes about a month before Bramble's jury trial is scheduled to begin on June 3.\n\n\"For the charges that the Commonwealth has against him, they would have to prove that he had malice, that he was intentionally trying to harm somebody and there's just no evidence of that. Not one shred of evidence of that,\" Stone said. \"And he never should have been charged. I would say that's probably true of the other individuals who had their charges dropped, but that's for their lawyers to talk about. But I know Dwayne Bramble should've never been charged and I appreciate Amanda Mann for righting that wrong today with what she did.\"\n\n\"I would say yes, you know, you are usually just dealing with one person,\" Stone said. \"So you know the personality you're dealing with. You know what you need to show them to try to convince them to take a certain position or if they won't you know what you're up against.\"\n\nStone speaks about why the process for this trial has taken so long.\n\n\"In this case we've literally had three different prosecutors to deal with,\" Stone explained. \"That is one of the reasons why its probably taken so long to get here. and its one reason why it took Ms. Mann five months to reach this. She just got this case handed to her in January, she had a lot to catch up on. But she did and she's now made the decision that the cases she wants to go forward on are the ones that are left. And she does not want to go forward on Mr. Bramble's case and four of the others. I respect the fact that she put that much thought into it.\"\n\n\"I suspect that it will be,\" replied Stone. \"Legally speaking, a nolle prosequi means that the Commonwealth is allowed to bring the charge back if they choose to, but that's extremely rare. And again in my view, there's just is no evidence to charge him with. So I don't think the charge will ever come back.\"", "source": {"uri": "wric.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "8News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "deanna_allbrittin@wric.com", "name": "Deanna Allbrittin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "kendal_mcauley@wric.com", "name": "Kendal McAuley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth of Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinwiddie_County,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dinwiddie County, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dinwiddie County, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_State_Hospital_(Virginia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central State Hospital (Virginia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolle_prosequi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nolle prosequi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legislator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrico_County,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henrico County, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Henrico County, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury trial"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.wric.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/74/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-05-142731.png?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542103", "eventUri": "eng-9542103", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 696, "textEnd": 701}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 2308, "textEnd": 2314}], "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

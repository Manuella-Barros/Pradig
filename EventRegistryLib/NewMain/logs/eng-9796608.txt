Democratic chair excited after Harris picks Walz as running mateEmerson College pollster reacts after Harris' taps Tim Walz as running mateWho is Tim Walz? Things to know about Kamala Harris' choice for vice president\n\nLANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will spend their first full day as running mates on Wednesday rallying Democrats across the Midwest, a politically divided region that is crucial to their effort to win the White House in less than three months.\n\nThe trip, which begins in Wisconsin before shifting to Michigan, is aimed at shoring up support among the younger, diverse, labor-friendly voters who were instrumental in helping President Joe Biden win the 2020 election. But that coalition showed signs of fraying over the summer, particularly in Michigan, which has emerged as a focal point of Democratic divisions over Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nWith Biden now out of the race and Harris officially the Democratic nominee, leaders of the Arab American community and key unions say they are encouraged by the choice. Walz's addition to the ticket has soothed some tensions, signaling to some community leaders that Harris heard concerns about another leading contender for the vice presidential slot, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, who they felt had gone too far in his support for Israel.\n\n\"The party is recognizing that there's a coalition they have to rebuild,\" said Abdullah Hammoud, the mayor of Dearborn, Michigan. \"Picking Walz is another sign of good faith.\"\n\nWisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat seeking a third term, appeared with Harris at a campaign stop there last month in suburban Milwaukee, and said in a fundraising email Tuesday morning that she was \"thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket.\"\n\nDonald Trump had put a similar emphasis on appealing to voters in Midwestern states with his choice of Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his vice presidential pick. Vance will again bracket the Harris-Walz ticket with appearances in the same states on Wednesday. He is starting his day in Michigan before heading to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, the same city where the Democratic candidates will appear hours later before going to Michigan.\n\nIn Michigan, leaders say Democratic enthusiasm has surged since Harris announced her candidacy.\n\nThat could be pivotal in Detroit, which is nearly 80% Black, where leaders for months had warned administration officials that voter apathy could cost them in a city that's typically a stronghold for their party. Rev. Wendell Anthony, president of the NAACP Detroit branch, said the excitement in the city now is \"mind-blowing.\" He likened it to Barack Obama's first run for president in 2008, when voters waited in long lines to help elect the nation's first Black president.\n\nBut some Democratic leaders in Michigan had grown concerned that choosing the wrong running mate could slow that momentum and fracture a coalition that has only recently started to unify.\n\nArab American leaders, who hold an outsized influence in Michigan due to a large presence in metro Detroit, had been vocal in their opposition to Shapiro due to his past comments regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nArab American leaders specifically pointed to a comment he made earlier this year regarding protests on university campuses, which they felt unfairly compared the actions of student protesters to those of white supremacists. Shapiro, who is Jewish, has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while remaining a staunch supporter of Israel.\n\n\"It's certainly not antisemitic to critique somebody's position on Israeli policy,\" Hammoud said. \"That's just called stewardship and accountability.\"\n\nIn addition to expressing those concerns publicly, leaders had also made their feelings known privately to the White House and Harris' team.\n\nOsama Siblani, the publisher of the Dearborn-based Arab American News and a prominent leader in Michigan's large Muslim community, was among those who met with White House adviser Tom Perez in Michigan last week. Although Perez was in the state on official business, he has maintained contact with some Dearborn leaders since he and other top officials traveled there with Biden in an effort to mend ties with the community.\n\nSiblani said he met with Perez for over an hour on July 29 and told him that if Harris chose Shapiro, it would \"shut down\" future conversations. He also conveyed this message to Democratic lawmakers in Congress, including Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell.\n\nPushback from Arab Americans and union leaders was \"not the only reason why she did not pick Shapiro, but it is one of the major reasons,\" said Siblani.\n\n\"Not picking Shapiro is a very good step. It cracks the door open a little more for us,\" said Siblani, who along with Hammoud emphasized that any meaningful conversations must include policy discussions.\n\nMichigan state Sen. Jeremy Moss, who is Jewish, was excited by the prospect of having Shapiro as a vice presidential candidate but was \"disturbed\" by the criticism he received, believing that many of the vetted candidates had similar views on Israel. He said he didn't believe the criticism played a role in Harris' decision and that \"she's choosing somebody based on this long game of who she can work with for four to eight years.\"\n\nStill, Moss said he is glad the Harris-Walz ticket is not divisive and that the feeling of unity among Democrats is \"palpable on the ground.\"\n\nThe nation's largest auto workers' union, the United Auto Workers, also watched the vice presidential choice carefully.\n\nThey moved to endorse Harris quickly after she stepped in to replace Biden, and UAW President Shawn Fain said publicly that she had a right to choose her own running mate. But he also said the union, which has 370,000 members and a huge presence in Michigan and other Midwestern states, didn't favor Shapiro, who had previously joined with Pennsylvania Republicans in calling for an expansion of voucher programs that allow public tax dollars to flow to private schools.\n\nFain had singled out Walz -- in addition to other candidates -- for praise in an interview with The Associated Press on Aug. 2, saying the Minnesota governor was a \"brilliant guy, sharp guy.\" In a statement Tuesday, Fain said Walz will make a \"great vice president\" and that he has \"stood with the working class every step of the way.\"\n\nDingell, a Democrat with deep connections in Dearborn who has brokered some of the conversations between Biden administration officials and leaders of core constituencies in Michigan, echoed those sentiments Tuesday. She said the choice of Walz would only ramp up excitement at Wednesday's rally in Detroit.\n\n\"We got somebody from the Midwest, from the heartland, that really understands our issues,\" said Dingell. \"And he will be a partner to her. She won't have to look over her shoulder every two minutes. He will be a total, true partner.\"\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

I think it was transparently a major factor. And I think they made a political decision that is sad, and I think they'll regret it.\"\n\nShapiro had faced attacks by progressives over his stance on the war in Gaza and noticeably had higher unfavorable ratings among Gen Z voters in a new NPR/PBS News/Marist Poll out this week. His ratings were 25% unfavorable compared to Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Walz, who had 10% and 13% unfavorable ratings, respectively.\n\nBut while Shapiro has been pro-Israel during its war with Hamas, he has also criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, at one point calling him \"one of the worst leaders of all time.\"\n\nKAMALA HARRIS PICKS TIM WALZ: DID SHE DECIDE JOSH SHAPIRO WAS TOO JEWISH TO BE VP?\n\nRep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., pointed out the \"hypocrisy\" of anti-Israel protesters on Tuesday who demonstrated against the Biden administration's policy on Israel, but who would vote for Harris as long as she didn't pick Shapiro.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The Anti-Israel activists who have been falsely accusing the Biden-Harris sdministration of funding \"genocide\" are suddenly fine with Vice President Harris, as long as she declines to choose Governor Shapiro as a running mate,\" Torres posted on X.\n\n\"Never mind that the pro-Israel views of Governor Shapiro are indistinguishable from those of VP Harris.

Josh Shapiro is Kamala Harris' VP - Russia News Now", "body": "Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker posted on her social media accounts during the weekend, appearing to suggest that Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party have already picked Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro as her running mate, prompting confusion all across America.\n\n\"Proud to be back with so many leaders from across our region supporting @KamalaHarris for President and @JoshShapiroP for VP!\" her handle @PeopleforParker posted on X. The post also included a video with footage of recent press conferences that ended with the message: \"Josh Shapiro for Vice President.\"\n\nHowever, a source close to Parker who spoke anonymously claimed that the post was simply an endorsement and a show of support for Shapiro.\n\n\"This is not an announcement of anything. This is just the mayor showing her support for a longtime friend who we know is one of the people being considered,\" the source said.\n\nThe attached footage in the tweet included local union leaders and elected officials lauding the governor.\n\n\"I can't think of a better partner [for Harris] than our governor, Josh Shapiro,\" Parker said in the video.\n\nAccording to Bucks County Commissioner Diane Ellis-Marseglia, who also appeared in the video, she was surprised to see the video posted on Friday. She thought it was fun and agreed with the message promoting Shapiro as vice president. Ellis-Marseglia was involved in a separate pro-Harris ad arranged by the Parker campaign and said the group taped pro-Shapiro content afterward, but she didn't realize it would be used.\n\n\"We did it as an after-take as kind of a joke,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, journalist Ernest Owens claimed he had heard from sources that the post was due to be scheduled for Monday, Aug. 5, but was accidentally published early. Harris is expected to announce her pick for vice presidential running mate by Tuesday, Aug. 6, after conducting weekend interviews with contenders at her Washington home, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. (Related: Kamala Harris expected to introduce running mate at her first rally in Philadelphia on Aug. 6.)\n\nThe shortlist of potential candidates included six men: four governors, a senator and a cabinet secretary in the White House. Shapiro is considered one of the favorites and has been reportedly vetted by her campaign. He reportedly canceled planned fundraisers in the Hamptons this weekend.\n\n\"The governor's trip was planned several weeks ago and included several fundraisers for his own campaign committee,\" spokesperson Manuel Bonder said. \"His schedule has changed and he is no longer traveling to the Hamptons this weekend.\"\n\nAn article on Politico recently disclosed that Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) is warning Harris against picking Shapiro to be her running mate because the latter is too focused on his \"personal ambitions.\" Fetterman cited three sources that were familiar with the matter, the news outlet reported.\n\nAccording to the report, Fetterman and Shapiro came into conflict during their service together on Pennsylvania's Board of Pardons regarding second chances and the commutation process for convicts.\n\nFetterman is said to have \"full-on, enthusiastic support for Kamala Harris.\" That source described Fetterman's advisers as giving his \"unvarnished assessment\" of Shapiro \"that is not about policy differences or other public baggage.\" The governor's staff, meanwhile, claimed that Shapiro's history on criminal justice reform is clear.\n\n\"The governor evaluates every pardon case individually and on its merits and during his time as attorney general, he approved more pardons and commutations than all of his predecessors over the last 25 years, combined,\" Shapiro spokesperson Will Simons said. \"He is proud of his record of delivering meaningful criminal justice reform while making Pennsylvania communities safer.\"\n\nAnother issue that is being thrown at Shapiro is his past stance on Israel and Palestine. In the 1993 essay that he wrote for the Campus Times, the student newspaper of the University of Rochester, from which he graduated in 1995, he wrote that \"Palestinians will not coexist peacefully because they do not have the capabilities to establish their homeland and make it successful even with the aid of Israel and the United States.\"\n\nShapiro has been pressured to defend his article.\n\n\"Since he wrote this piece as a 20-year-old student, Gov. Shapiro has built close, meaningful, informative relationships with many Muslim-American, Arab-American, Palestinian Christian and Jewish community leaders all across Pennsylvania,\" another Shapiro spokesman Manuel Bonder told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"The Governor greatly values their perspectives and the experiences he has learned from over the years - and as a result, as with many issues, his views on the Middle East have evolved into the position he holds today.\"\n\nCheck out KamalaHarris.news for more stories related to incumbent vice president.\n\nWatch the video below that talks about

Tim Walz as the party's presidential ticket, after she previously pushed for Gov. Josh Shapiro to be Harris' running mate.\n\nParker spoke at a Philadelphia rally Tuesday evening ahead of Harris and Walz's first joint campaign appearance, and referenced that she was asked about Shapiro on her way into the event. In response, she recalled a childhood memory of her grandmother telling her not to discuss about internal family strife.\n\n\"We must take a page out of my grandmother's book, that we remember that our Democratic nominee has spoken,\" Parker said. \"That's it. Period, end of story.\"\n\nParker posted a campaign video Friday that seemed to imply Shapiro got the pick -- and sources said it was one of several contributing factors that led to Shapiro getting passed over for the vice presidential nomination. Shapiro had been widely seen as a frontrunner for the position.\n\nBut Parker said Democrats now need to move on and trust Harris' choice so that Trump can't \"divide and conquer.\"\n\n\"The only North Star that should be in all of our hearts, minds and spirits and that is making sure that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are the next president and vice president of the United States of America,\" Parker added.\n\nIn an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper after she took the rally stage, Parker said she expects the governor will rally behind the ticket despite being passed over.\n\n\"I've worked with him for many, many years, he's a consummate professional,\" Parker told Tapper. \"We know, he knows, all of us are going to come together to ensure that we defeat Donald Trump.\"\n\nThe mayor said that while she was \"unapologetic\" in her support of Shapiro, she predicted Democrats would unite behind Walz.\n\nAnd Parker took an opportunity to take a jab at former President Donald Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who campaigned in South Philadelphia on Tuesday. She said she looked forward to watching Walz debate him.\n\n\"JD Vance ain't got a chance against Governor Walz,\" Parker said.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anna_orso@inquirer.com", "name": "Anna Orso", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "gillian_mcgoldrick@inquirer.com", "name": "Gillian McGoldrick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Tapper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Tapper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.inquirer.com/resizer/961SlviaVG2IBejd8ZstVMUxSCk=/760x507/smart/filters:format(webp)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/pmn/LVYVJYLHVRCUTCFVB6ED7FCUCI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796608", "eventUri": "eng-9796608", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Tim Walz will spend their first full day as running mates in Wisconsin and Michigan\n\nLANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will spend their first full day as running mates on Wednesday rallying Democrats across the Midwest, a politically divided region that is crucial to their effort to win the White House in less than three months.\n\nThe trip, which begins in Wisconsin before shifting to Michigan, is aimed at shoring up support among the younger, diverse, labor-friendly voters who were instrumental in helping President Joe Biden win the 2020 election. But that coalition showed signs of fraying over the summer, particularly in Michigan, which has emerged as a focal point of Democratic divisions over Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nWith Biden now out of the race and Harris officially the Democratic nominee, leaders of the Arab American community and key unions say they are encouraged by the choice. Walz's addition to the ticket has soothed some tensions, signaling to some community leaders that Harris heard concerns about another leading contender for the vice presidential slot, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, who they felt had gone too far in his support for Israel.\n\n\"The party is recognizing that there's a coalition they have to rebuild,\" said Abdullah Hammoud, the mayor of Dearborn, Michigan. \"Picking Walz is another sign of good faith.\"\n\nWisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat seeking a third term, appeared with Harris at a campaign stop there last month in suburban Milwaukee, and said in a fundraising email Tuesday morning that she was \"thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket.\"\n\nDonald Trump had put a similar emphasis on appealing to voters in Midwestern states with his choice of Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his vice presidential pick. Vance will again bracket the Harris-Walz ticket with appearances in the same states on Wednesday. He is starting his day in Michigan before heading to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, the same city where the Democratic candidates will appear hours later before going to Michigan.\n\nIn Michigan, leaders say Democratic enthusiasm has surged since Harris announced her candidacy.\n\nThat could be pivotal in Detroit, which is nearly 80% Black, where leaders for months had warned administration officials that voter apathy could cost them in a city that's typically a stronghold for their party. Rev. Wendell Anthony, president of the NAACP Detroit branch, said the excitement in the city now is \"mind-blowing.\" He likened it to Barack Obama's first run for president in 2008, when voters waited in long lines to help elect the nation's first Black president.\n\nBut some Democratic leaders in Michigan had grown concerned that choosing the wrong running mate could slow that momentum and fracture a coalition that has only recently started to unify.\n\nArab American leaders, who hold an outsized influence in Michigan due to a large presence in metro Detroit, had been vocal in their opposition to Shapiro due to his past comments regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nArab American leaders specifically pointed to a comment he made earlier this year regarding protests on university campuses, which they felt unfairly compared the actions of student protesters to those of white supremacists. Shapiro, who is Jewish, has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while remaining a staunch supporter of Israel.\n\n\"It's certainly not antisemitic to critique somebody's position on Israeli policy,\" Hammoud said. \"That's just called stewardship and accountability.\"\n\nIn addition to expressing those concerns publicly, leaders had also made their feelings known privately to the White House and Harris' team.\n\nOsama Siblani, the publisher of the Dearborn-based Arab American News and a prominent leader in Michigan's large Muslim community, was among those who met with White House adviser Tom Perez in Michigan last week. Although Perez was in the state on official business, he has maintained contact with some Dearborn leaders since he and other top officials traveled there with Biden in an effort to mend ties with the community.\n\nSiblani said he met with Perez for over an hour on July 29 and told him that if Harris chose Shapiro, it would \"shut down\" future conversations. He also conveyed this message to Democratic lawmakers in Congress, including Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell.\n\nPushback from Arab Americans and union leaders was \"not the only reason why she did not pick Shapiro, but it is one of the major reasons,\" said Siblani.\n\n\"Not picking Shapiro is a very good step. It cracks the door open a little more for us,\" said Siblani, who along with Hammoud emphasized that any meaningful conversations must include policy discussions.\n\nMichigan state Sen. Jeremy Moss, who is Jewish, was excited by the prospect of having Shapiro as a vice presidential candidate but was \"disturbed\" by the criticism he received, believing that many of the vetted candidates had similar views on Israel. He said he didn't believe the criticism played a role in Harris' decision and that \"she's choosing somebody based on this long game of who she can work with for four to eight years.\"\n\nStill, Moss said he is glad the Harris-Walz ticket is not divisive and that the feeling of unity among Democrats is \"palpable on the ground.\"\n\nThe nation's largest auto workers' union, the United Auto Workers, also watched the vice presidential choice carefully.\n\nThey moved to endorse Harris quickly after she stepped in to replace Biden, and UAW President Shawn Fain said publicly that she had a right to choose her own running mate. But he also said the union, which has 370,000 members and a huge presence in Michigan and other Midwestern states, didn't favor Shapiro, who had previously joined with Pennsylvania Republicans in calling for an expansion of voucher programs that allow public tax dollars to flow to private schools.\n\nFain had singled out Walz -- in addition to other candidates -- for praise in an interview with The Associated Press on Aug. 2, saying the Minnesota governor was a \"brilliant guy, sharp guy.\" In a statement Tuesday, Fain said Walz will make a \"great vice president\" and that he has \"stood with the working class every step of the way.\"\n\nDingell, a Democrat with deep connections in Dearborn who has brokered some of the conversations between Biden administration officials and leaders of core constituencies in Michigan, echoed those sentiments Tuesday. She said the choice of Walz would only ramp up excitement at Wednesday's rally in Detroit.\n\n\"We got somebody from the Midwest, from the heartland, that really understands our issues,\" said Dingell. \"And he will be a partner to her. She won't have to look over her shoulder every two minutes. He will be a total, true partner.\"\n\nAssociated Press writers Tom Krisher in Detroit and Isabella Volmert in Lansing, Michigan contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "kimt.com", "dataType":

Josh Shapiro passionately put his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at a Philadelphia rally.\n\nPHILADELPHIA -- When Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro bounded onto the stage Tuesday evening, he was energetic, charismatic and clearly at home.\n\nIt was a glimpse of what might have been. Before the harsh reality of politics set in.\n\nShapiro swallowed whatever disappointment he may have felt in losing out on the chance to become Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate and made himself the rousing hype man for the Democratic presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, whom Harris had asked just hours earlier to join her on the ticket.\n\n\"I love you, Philly - and you know what else I love? I love being your governor!\" Shapiro said to deafening cheers from inside Temple University's Liacouras Center, where Harris and Walz were making their first joint campaign appearance.\n\nFor days, it had appeared that Shapiro would end up as Harris' vice-presidential running mate. He had interviewed for the job, and the choice came down to him and Walz. Harris's decision to go with Walz stunned many given Shapiro's credentials: He's a popular governor of a battleground state that could determine the winner of the election.\n\nBut Shapiro also carried considerable baggage that would have made him a risky choice. Shapiro, who is Jewish, has infuriated the Democratic Party's progressives as well as Arab Americans and Muslims over his support for Israel in its ongoing war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAnd while his positions aren't that different from the other names on Harris's shortlist, it was Shapiro who frequently faced the toughest scrutiny.\n\nShapiro, 51, has been one of the most steadfast Democratic supporters of Israel, arguing that it has a right to defend itself from Hamas. He has been critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling him \"one of the worst leaders of all time.\" But he has also refrained from calling for an immediate cease-fire, which put him at odds with many of the party's left-wing voters.\n\nHow much Shapiro's stance on Israel - and the possibility that could have splintered the party - weighed on Harris's decision to pick Walz wasn't immediately clear. Had Harris chosen him, Shapiro would have been the second practicing Jew to run for vice president, behind the late Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, who ran alongside Al Gore in 2000. But voters have never elected a Jewish president or vice president in the nation's nearly 250-year history.From the rally stage, Shapiro showed no signs of hard feelings. He heaped praise on Walz, calling him \"a dear friend\" and \"a great patriot\" and urging the crowd \"to give him a whole lot of love.\"\n\nHe doubled down on defending his Jewish faith -- and even appeared to be firing back at detractors who had dubbed him \"Genocide Josh.\"\n\nShapiro's faith has been central to his personal life and political career from an early age, when he began a letter-writing campaign to raise awareness about Soviet Jews barred from leaving their country, to the final days of Harris's search for a running mate.\n\nShapiro grew up in Upper Dublin in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.\n\nAs a child, Shapiro, with the help of his mother, Judi, started a letter-writing program to raise awareness about \"refuseniks,\" Soviet Jews who were refused permission to emigrate from the Soviet Union, usually to Israel, in the late 1960s through the 1970s.\n\n\"These were Soviet Jewish children and families who were refused the ability to leave the Soviet Union, to practice their faith and to live free lives,\" he said during an interview with the USA Today Network when running for governor in 2021. \"And my mom served on those issues, and she got me inspired to work on those issues as well,\"\n\nShapiro's pen-pal in that program, a boy named Avi, traveled to America to attend Shapiro's bar mitzvah at the Beth Shalom synagogue near Upper Dublin. Avi's family were granted asylum in Israel soon after.\n\nGrowing up, Shapiro attended the Forman Hebrew Day School and then the Akiba Hebrew Academy, now the Jack M. Barrack Hebrew Academy.\n\nDuring his 2022 gubernatorial bid, Shapiro didn't shy away from his faith -- and neither did his opponent, state Sen. Doug Mastriano, a self-described Christian nationalist from Franklin County.\n\nIn his first campaign TV ad, Shapiro said no matter where he starts his day, \"I make it home Friday night for Sabbath dinner,\" which he celebrates with his wife and four children every week, \"because family and faith ground me.\"\n\nMastriano, speaking to supporters, said Shapiro harbored \"disdain for people like us,\" because he \"grew up in a privileged neighborhood, attended one of the most privileged schools in the nation as a young man... sending his four kids to the same privileged, exclusive, elite school.\"\n\nShapiro, however, turned Mastriano's extremist views against him, criticizing him for his ties to other Christian nationalists, including Andrew Torba, founder of the conservative social media platform Gab.\n\nMore: Why Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz over Josh Shapiro as her running mate\n\nIsrael's war with Hamas\n\nSince the attack on Israel by Hamas and other Palestinian militants in Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023, Shapiro has several times rankled progressives and Arab-American and Muslim populations angered over Israeli forces' killing of nearly 40,000 Palestinian civilians.\n\nShapiro has supported Israel's right to defend itself from Hamas. But he also has refrained from calling for a cease-fire, made references to the Ku Klux Klan in discussing pro-Palestinian protestors, and raised questions about his support for free-speech rights in calling for the firing for University of Pennsylvania President Elizabeth Magill over anti-Israel campus protests.\n\nSome Shapiro defenders have said that the popular governor's position on Israel differs little from other Democratic lawmakers and that criticism of him is antisemitic.\n\nOver the weekend, for example, he was forced to defend an essay he wrote for his college newspaper in which he suggested that Palestinians were \"too battle-minded\" to achieve a two-state solution in the Middle East. Shapiro said his views have evolved in the three decades since he penned the article, but critics called his remarks racist and anti-Palestinian.\n\nAmy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, said she finds the conversation about Shapiro to be \"concerning\" and said he has \"positions on Israel that largely align with the vast majority of other potential VP candidates.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of important and constructive debate and criticism that should happen around his policies or anyone else's policies\" when it comes to Israel or campus protests, she said. But \"if it's only the Jewish candidate that is being singled out with terms like 'Genocide Josh,' then that is deeply problematic.\"\n\nMore: New poll shows Josh Shapiro and Mark Kelly have higher favorability than Tim Walz\n\nOther factors also may have kept Shapiro off the presidential ticket.\n\n\"There may have been an experience factor,\" said Robert Speel, professor of political science at Penn State's Behrend campus in Erie, Pa. \"Waltz not only has served as governor for six years, but he also served in Congress for many years before that. He also was an officer in the Army National Guard and served for a couple of decades. Tim Walz certainly has an impressive resume, which may have given him a boost over Shapiro.\"\n\nLike Harris, Shapiro is a former state attorney general, but he has served as governor for less than two years, has no experience on the federal level and lacks military bona fides.\n\n\"There were some negative attributes to a potential Shapiro choice,\" Speel said. \"One was his past support for school vouchers, which is not particularly popular with liberals. Second, the way he reacted last fall when there were protesters at university campuses in Philadelphia incensed over what was happening in the Middle East. There were many Democrats, particularly young Democrats, who were not happy with Shapiro kind of joining in with Republicans to attack student protestors. That may have played a role as well.\"\n\nShapiro, who many consider a moderate Democrat, would have added an ideological balance to the ticket while also helping Harris nab a critical battleground state.\n\nShapiro's candidacy, however, faced opposition on multiple fronts.\n\nMore: Josh Shapiro's vice presidential prospects spark debate over Israel policy, antisemitism\n\nSex scandal\n\nAlso, haunting Shapiro were questions about what he knew and when he knew it about sexual harassment claims involving a former cabinet member.\n\nLast fall, Shapiro's office quietly settled for $295,000 a claim that a longtime ally had made numerous sexual advances toward a subordinate, as well as lewd comments about the subordinate, other female staffers and a female state senator, as The (Philadelphia) Inquirer has reported. The employee had only been on the job for two months when Mike Vereb, Shapiro's secretary of legislative affairs, allegedly began making the comments.\n\nDays after the woman told Vereb that his conduct was becoming the subject of office gossip, she was called into a meeting with the human resources department for the governor's office. Vereb later mentioned to her that the meeting was about performance issues with her job.\n\nThe woman resigned in March after that meeting and a separate meeting with Shapiro staffers in which she addressed her concerns. She provided a statement to the state Office of Equal Opportunity that month, and in June filed a complaint with the state Human Relations Commission. The settlement, which included a non-disclosure agreement that prohibits all parties from commenting on the matter, was paid in September. Vereb resigned weeks later.\n\nShapiro has been peppered with questions about why Vereb was allowed to remain in his job for months after the allegations were lodged against him.\n\n'It's kind of bittersweet'\n\nAt the campaign rally in Philadelphia, Marc Seide, a 34-year-old web designer from Philadelphia, said he believes Walz \"balances out\" the ticket and that Shapiro's opposition from progressives might have posed too many challenges.\n\n\"The is my first campaign event of the year, and I'm excited. I'm really excited to see how this goes,\" Seide said. \"To go from (Joe) Biden to Harris and to see that energy out here in the crowd - it's tremendous.\"\n\nRobin Reid, 63, of Philadelphia, said she had been rooting for Shapiro to become Harris' running mate \"because he's from Pennsylvania, and he's just relatable.\n\n\"I've never heard of Tim Walz,\" Reid said.\n\n\"But at the same time,\" she added, \"we were afraid of losing Josh Shapiro, so it's kind of bittersweet.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "History of the Jews in the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gab_(social_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gab (social network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arab Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_M._Barrack_Hebrew_Academy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack M.

Tim Walz as her running mate disappointed fans of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who was one of Harris' finalists for the job and seen as someone who could help Democrats win a key swing state and make history by electing the first Jewish vice president.\n\nWith his history of winning three statewide elections in Pennsylvania, Shapiro was seen as someone with particular appeal to moderate voters. His state's 19 votes in the Electoral College have long been critical for candidates trying to reach the necessary 270 to win.\n\nBut the same things about Shapiro that appealed to moderates angered some on the left in his party: his support for a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure as well as particularly his support for Israel's war in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack.\n\nSome Democrats lamented what they said was a missed opportunity by bypassing Shapiro. Republicans, meanwhile, tried to paint Harris' choice as a snub to Jewish voters, a traditionally Democratic constituency that former President Donald Trump has tried to court in this year's race.\n\n\"Not only is he exceptionally smart and capable, but, in my opinion, he brought the math to the path of 270,\" said Ryan Bizzarro, 38-year-old Democratic state lawmaker from Erie, Pennsylvania, said of Shapiro.\n\nShapiro spoke at a rally in Philadelphia Tuesday night before the new Democratic ticket took the stage, with the Pennsylvania governor receiving big applause from thousands of attendees.\n\n\"I love you Philly. You know what else I love, I love being your governor,\" Shapiro said.\n\nHe added, \"I am going to continue pouring my heart and soul into continuing to serve you every single day as your governor.\"\n\nShapiro also praised Walz as a great man with strong midwestern values, calling him a friend he said he couldn't wait for Pennsylvanians to get to know.\n\nWalz returned the compliment when he took the stage later with Harris in Philadelphia.\n\n\"My God, what a treasure you have in Josh Shapiro,\" he said. \"Holy hell, can this guy bring the fire.\"\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, who advocated fiercely but unsuccessfully for Shapiro, also spoke at the event and said Democrats should not let Republicans and detractors divide them over the pick.\n\n\"Our Democratic nominee has spoken and that's it.

Gov. Josh Shapiro won't be Kamala Harris' running mate, but his national profile has been boosted", "body": "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Even though he won't be running for vice president this year, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro's time on the nationally debated \"short list\" of possible running mates for the likely Democratic presidential nominee has only helped him, some Democratic observers say.\n\n\"I can see him running in four years, for president,\" said Tameko Patterson, chairperson of the Monroe County Democratic Committee. \"He is well-liked.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who officially earned the Democratic nomination late Monday, went in another direction with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz after weeks in which Shapiro was thought to be one of the favorites.\n\nIn a statement posted to X on Tuesday, Shapiro said, \"As I've said repeatedly over the past several weeks, the running mate decision was a deeply personal decision for the Vice President -- and it was also a deeply personal decision for me. Pennsylvania elected me to a four-year term as their Governor, and my work here is far from finished -- there is a lot more stuff I want to get done for the good people of this Commonwealth.\"\n\nThe 18-month governor of an important swing state did not publicly ask to be considered. But his public statements basically shouted \"read between the lines\" on the vice-presidential concept.\n\nFor instance, on July 23, Shapiro deflected any notion he was a serious contender for the Democratic vice presidential slot, but at the same time attacked former president and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump full-bore. Shapiro said that during his time as Pennsylvania attorney general, \"I spent more time with my team in court trying to protect people's rights, because Donald Trump was trying to rip them away.\"\n\nAnd on Friday, he attacked Trump again and called Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, a \"phony baloney.\"\n\nShapiro's up-and-comer national image is directly tied to the state image he has cultivated along his path from Montgomery County commissioner to attorney general to governor.\n\nLori McFarland, Lehigh County Democratic Committee chairperson, said Shapiro is a strong orator, level-headed, and has shown via his governance with a split Legislature that he can work with both parties.\n\nThe fact he was not picked by Harris, McFarland said, is in some ways a relief for Pennsylvanians. In the Lehigh Valley in eastern Pennsylvania, she said, lots of people talk about Shapiro's energy. As much as many wanted to see Shapiro get picked by Harris, McFarland said, \"We want to keep him.\"\n\nOne political measuring stick for Pennsylvania governors is the perception of how well they did in creating and approving a state budget, including how timely the process was.\n\nOn timing, Shapiro's first year of 2023 was bumpy. The fiscal year was more than a month old when he signed the main spending bill, and some pieces were left incomplete as late as December. This year was a major improvement, with the signing happening only 11 days into the fiscal year.\n\n\"Walz represents the safest choice of running mates for Vice President Harris in many ways,\" said Lew Irwin, a political science professor at Duquesne University. \"Among the three reported finalists for the bottom of the ticket, Tim Walz would seem to make it the easiest to maintain the Democratic Party unity that we have seen since President Biden stepped down as the nominee.\"\n\nIrwin said Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly were \"likely to bring some challenges to the ticket with respect to labor unions.\"\n\n\"And for some reason Josh Shapiro had attracted the strongest and most negative reaction from the pro-Gaza left in the party,\" he added. \"Shapiro's handling of the Vereb allegations also might cause some problems within the party. Ultimately, it's likely that these factors outweighed Shapiro's obvious strength in terms of likely electoral vote impact.\"\n\n\"Certainly, there was a backlash among progressives against Shapiro, and they let that be known; there was no backlash against Walz,\" said Christopher Borick, a political science professor and pollster at Muhlenberg College. \"Walz is a comfortable fit for her. A lot of his past policies please progressives but his style has appeal to more of the center. That's what his biggest attribute is.\"\n\nOthers have different takes on Shapiro's brief time leading Pennsylvania. Rep. Seth Grove, R-York and the top Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, said the two budgets signed by Shapiro have wiped out what was an $8 billion budget surplus and raised the specter of unsustainable spending.\n\nHe referred to it as \"D.C. spending\" but with the difference that leaders of Pennsylvania \"can't print money.\"\n\nThe message was similar from Republicans in the Senate.\n\n\"Kamala Harris is the top of the ticket and no matter who she chose for vice president, they would adopt her platform,\" said Republican state senate president pro tempore Kim Ward.\n\n\"Although Shapiro was not selected as the vice-presidential nominee, he will still be responsible as the governor of an important swing state for endorsing an agenda on behalf of the democrats that includes illegal immigrants entering our country, the increase flow of fentanyl across our border, more crime on our streets, banning of our natural resources, and escalating inflation including increased energy and grocery prices. A Harris/Walz ticket is more California than Pennsylvania, and no guarantee for a Pennsylvania win this November.\"\n\nDavid McCormick, the Republican former hedge fund CEO running for U.S. Senate, said in a statement that the \"Harris-Walz is the most liberal presidential ticket in history. A vote for Border Czar Harris, Walz, and weak Bob Casey is a vote for another four years of open borders, sky high inflation, destroying energy jobs in the commonwealth, defunding the police, and stripping Americans of their private health insurance. Pennsylvanians deserve strong leadership in Washington, and that's why Republicans are going to win big this November.\"\n\n\"I know that Governor Tim Walz is an exceptionally strong addition to the ticket who will help Kamala move our country forward,\" said Shapiro in his statement.\n\n\"Lori and I consider Tim and Gwen to be good friends of ours and we are excited for them and for the country to get to know the great people we know them to be. Over the next 90 days, I look forward to traveling all across the Commonwealth to unite Pennsylvanians behind Kamala Harris' campaign to defeat Donald Trump, become the 47th President of the United States, and build a better future for our country.\"\n\n(c)2024 the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\n\nVisit the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at www.post-gazette.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency,

Josh Shapiro is not getting in the way of supporting Tim Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate pick.\n\nAt a rally introducing the new ticket in Philadelphia on Tuesday, attendees sounded receptive to Walz, the Minnesota governor who competed with Shapiro to be Harris's vice president.\n\nSeveral mentioned his military background - Walz served in the National Guard for 24 years - while his affable manner won over attendees just starting to learn about him.\n\n\"I was like, who is this guy?\" Gail Hannah, 66, said of her first reaction to Walz, before noting his ability to put the audience at ease.\n\n\"I'm impressed with his credentials. I think he can relate to the average American, and I love that he has a sense of humor,\" said Hannah, a South Philadelphia native and retired behavioral health professional.\n\nPaired with the interest was a note of disappointment. Shapiro had been viewed as the favorite in the veepstakes due, in part, to Pennsylvania's importance as a presidential battleground.\n\nBut Harris went instead with a candidate whose reputation as a progressive governor had won him the support of organized labor and other heavyweights on the Left.\n\n\"I definitely get it,\" said Danielle Bullock, a 54-year-old healthcare professional who pointed to Walz's work making insulin more affordable.\n\n\"I mean, of course, as a Pennsylvanian, I would love to see Josh Shapiro, because I think he's innovative, he's bright,\" added Bullock, who lives in the Mount Airy neighborhood of Philadelphia.\n\n\"He can do wonders for this country. But this is Walz's time, and Josh has a lot of years that he'll be here.\"\n\nThe silver lining of Harris's choice is Pennsylvania gets to keep Shapiro for the remainder of his term, an outcome Margie Herbert, a special ed teacher who lives in the Philadelphia suburbs, called \"bittersweet.\"\n\n\"The selfish part of me didn't want to lose him to the vice presidency,\" she said.\n\nBut Harris got a taste of the enthusiasm Shapiro would have brought to her ticket at Tuesday's rally. Shapiro introduced Walz and Harris in a crowd-revving speech that drew the loudest applause lines of the night.\n\n\"There's no matching Shapiro,\" said Hannah, who also attended his inauguration in 2023. Unprompted, she speculated he could be a future president.\n\n\"Shapiro has it. He has that enthusiasm,\" she added.\n\nShapiro came with perceived downsides, among them his Jewish heritage. He, like other running mate choices, is supportive of Israel, but he had been singled out as \"Genocide Josh\" over the war in Gaza.\n\nOne Philadelphia resident named Israel as the sole reason he did not want Shapiro to be Harris's running mate.\n\nConcerns that Shapiro would outshine Harris were also front-of-mind. Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA), a rival of Shapiro's, reportedly relayed concerns to her team that Shapiro is too personally ambitious.\n\nThe choice of Walz surprised many political watchers. He became the favorite in the final hours of a vetting process that also homed in a third short list candidate, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ).\n\n\"I was caught off guard this morning, like everyone else,\" said Crystall McDowell, 61, who expected Kelly to be chosen.\n\nMcDowell, a retiree who lives in the Philadelphia suburbs, acknowledged that she knew little of Walz before the announcement, though she appreciated that he brings \"balance\" to the ticket and resonated with his speech.\n\n\"I think, yes, Trump is weird,\" she said with a chuckle. Walz is credited with originating Harris's attack line that the GOP's policies are odd.\n\nUltimately, Harris is betting that Walz's rural upbringing and folksy persona will be enough to help in the \"blue wall\" states former President Donald Trump won in 2016, including Pennsylvania.\n\nOne attendee described him as \"straight-laced\" and another as your \"average dad.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nMeanwhile, Shapiro has pledged to help Harris campaign in the Keystone State, with he and Walz praising one another from the stage on Tuesday in a show of unity.\n\n\"What a treasure you have in Josh Shapiro,\" Walz told the crowd. \"He can bring the fire.\"", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"},

Tim Walz -- not Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro -- who will be on the Democratic ticket this fall. The two stood together for the first time at Tuesday evening's rally at Temple University, with an introduction from Shapiro.\n\nMeanwhile, the local Democratic politicians and labor leaders who had loudly backed Shapiro for vice president expressed a mix of disappointment and enthusiasm that their homegrown governor would not be the nominee -- but still say they're \"fired up\" to elect Harris.\n\nRead on for a rundown on the veepstakes' close and other news from around Philly.\n\n-- Julie Zeglen (morningnewsletter@inquirer.com)\n\nP.S.

Our politics team will send you weekly analysis, fact checks, and data dives starting this Friday.\n\nIf someone forwarded you this email, sign up for free here.\n\nHarris has made her choice, and Walz, not Shapiro, will be her running mate. The decision ends weeks of speculation that the Pennsylvania governor and Abington son could be the VP pick.\n\nWho is Tim Walz? The 60-year-old, second-term Democratic governor is a former congressman and teacher who served in the Army National Guard for 24 years. He has made a political name for himself by enacting progressive policies in Minnesota, such as backing abortion protections and affordable housing, and espousing a down-to-earth brand. He's also a Springsteen fan and helped make \"weird\" happen.\n\nWhy did Shapiro lose the veepstakes? Insiders believe Harris ultimately passed over Shapiro for two reasons. One, she worried the ambitious and well-liked exec could outshine her. And they said Shapiro's moderate views on flashpoint issues could turn off progressives -- even as they could have attracted some Republican voters.\n\nWhat did Harris say in Philly? \"I am so, so invested in our friendship in doing this together, because together with Josh Shapiro, we will win Pennsylvania,\" Harris told a raucous crowd Tuesday evening at Temple's Liacouras Center.\n\nWhat about Sen. JD Vance's rally? The Republican VP nominee was also in Philly Tuesday, holding a campaign event in South Philly's 2300 Arena just hours before Harris spoke. There, he claimed Harris had bowed to \"the most radical elements of her party\" in selecting Walz over Shapiro, and that her decision was influenced by antisemitism.\n\nWill Walz and Vance debate? Vance said he will, though the candidates likely won't commit before Walz officially becomes the VP nominee at the Democratic National Convention in two weeks.\n\nWhat happens now? Both campaigns will turn their attention to the Midwest, as Harris and Vance head to Wisconsin for another round of dueling rallies.\n\nFor a moment, he was the Montco kid-turned-VP contender. Now, he's back to being known as the governor of Pennsylvania.\n\n\ud83d\udd35 Shapiro racked up scores of endorsements from local politicians and labor unions, including Mayor Cherelle L. Parker and Philadelphia Building Trades leaders, in the weeks leading up to Harris' VP announcement.\n\n\ud83d\udd35 Those leaders' reactions to Harris' choice Tuesday ranged from deflated disappointment to resolute support for the Democratic ticket. Even some of those who wanted a hometown nominee say they still see the Walz pick as a win, citing his support for unions and his relatability.\n\n\ud83d\udd35 \"He's like a fishing hole, hunting, cabin guy,\" the head of the Philadelphia AFL-CIO told The Inquirer. \"Honestly, other than Josh Shapiro, I don't know that there's a more Pennsylvania sort of person.\"\n\nHere's what Philly-area Democrats said about Shapiro, Walz, and the Harris campaign moving forward.\n\nThis isn't the last we'll see of Shapiro this election cycle. At the Philly rally, he vowed to spend the next few months \"working my tail off to make sure we make Kamala Harris and Tim Walz the next leaders of the United States of America.\"\n\nThe 1961 Phillies' 23-game losing streak has stood for more than 60 years as a major-league record. It's finally being challenged this week by which team?\n\nThe beloved radio DJ known for spinning oldies on 98.1 WOGL.\n\nHOG CRABBER\n\nEmail us if you know the answer. We'll select a reader at random to shout out here. Cheers to Aprile Morgan, who solved Tuesday's anagram: Stephanie Hsu. The Everything Everywhere All at Once actor is set to costar in a feature film with West Philadelphia native Quinta Brunson, who will also produce it.\n\nAll this rain is good for the plants, right? I hope you get to spot some green on this gray Wednesday.

The pair held their first rally together in Philadelphia later that evening.\n\nWalz, who has been Minnesota's governor since 2019 and previously served in the House of Representatives, used his address in Philadelphia to mock Senator JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate. He said he was willing to debate the Ohio Republican \"if he's willing to get off the coach and show up.\"\n\nOther candidates who were reportedly under consideration to be Harris's running mate include Shapiro, whose state has 19 Electoral College votes, along with Arizona Senator Mark Kelly and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nThomas Gift, director of the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, told Newsweek that Harris choosing Walz as her VP would make Pennsylvania a tougher race than if she had picked Shapiro.\n\n\"Pennsylvania isn't out of reach for Harris, but there's no doubt it just became a lot more challenging to win. Governor Shapiro likely would have energized a large swath of Pennsylvanians, both in red and blue counties, and given Harris an edge in securing its critical 19 electoral votes,\" Gift said.\n\n\"If Harris fails to reach 270 electoral votes in November, and PA turns from blue to red, there will be lots of second-guessing her choice.\"\n\nProfessor Christopher Devine, who teaches politics at the University of Dayton, previously told Newsweek that Walz was a solid pick due to his political experience.\n\n\"His selection should reassure voters about Kamala Harris' judgment as a potential president. After all, she could have made the more politically expedient choice by picking Shapiro, simply to win his home state and perhaps help win the election,\" Devine, the author of Do Running Mates Matter?: The Influence of Vice Presidential Candidates in Presidential Elections, said.\n\n\"But he is a first-term governor who has never served in federal office and lacks foreign policy experience. Walz is a two-term governor who served for more than a decade in Congress. He is ready to be vice president, or even president, on Day One, in a way that Shapiro and other VP finalists simply weren't.\"\n\nProfessor Cary Coglianese, an expert in political science at the University of Pennsylvania's Carey Law School, said Harris was \"not putting all her chips on the table in Pennsylvania\" by not picking Shapiro as her running mate, though he fully expects the governor to \"be doing all he can to deliver Pennsylvania to the Harris-Walz campaign.\"\n\nOverall, Conglianese argued that Walz was a \"safe, smart choice.\"\n\n\"He brings military experience and a rural Midwestern vibe to the ticket. But he is also a very effective spokesperson for progressive values and will help motivate turnout from the Democratic base. For these reasons, Walz is the choice most likely to add appeal both to progressives as well as independents, which is a rare combination,\" Conglianese said.\n\nNewsweek reached out to representatives of Vice President Kamala Harris, Governor Tim Walz and Governor Josh Shapiro for comment via email on Wednesday outside of regular office hours.\n\nSpeaking to The Philadelphia Inquirer earlier this month, Bill Bretz, the Republican Party chair for Pennsylvania's Westmoreland County, said Shapiro was the most dangerous potential Harris running mate for the GOP in his state.\n\nReferring to the governor, he said: \"Of the people she could possibly pick, he would be the one that makes it the most challenging because that's a name that people are familiar with.\"",

(AP) - Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will spend their first full day as running mates on Wednesday rallying Democrats across the Midwest, a politically divided region that is crucial to their effort to win the White House in less than three months.\n\nThe trip, which begins in Wisconsin before shifting to Michigan, is aimed at shoring up support among the younger, diverse, labor-friendly voters who were instrumental in helping President Joe Biden win the 2020 election. But that coalition showed signs of fraying over the summer, particularly in Michigan, which has emerged as a focal point of Democratic divisions over Biden\u00b4s handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nWith Biden now out of the race and Harris officially the Democratic nominee, leaders of the Arab American community and key unions say they are encouraged by the choice. Walz\u00b4s addition to the ticket has soothed some tensions, signaling to some community leaders that Harris heard concerns about another leading contender for the vice presidential slot, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, who they felt had gone too far in his support for Israel.\n\n\"The party is recognizing that there\u00b4s a coalition they have to rebuild,\" said Abdullah Hammoud, the mayor of Dearborn, Michigan. \"Picking Walz is another sign of good faith.\"\n\nWisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat seeking a third term, appeared with Harris at a campaign stop there last month in suburban Milwaukee, and said in a fundraising email Tuesday morning that she was \"thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket.\"\n\nDonald Trump had put a similar emphasis on appealing to voters in Midwestern states with his choice of Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his vice presidential pick. Vance will again bracket the Harris-Walz ticket with appearances in the same states on Wednesday. He is starting his day in Michigan before heading to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, the same city where the Democratic candidates will appear hours later before going to Michigan.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz speak at a campaign rally in Philadelphia, Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2024. (AP Photo/Joe Lamberti)\n\nIn Michigan, leaders say Democratic enthusiasm has surged since Harris announced her candidacy.\n\nThat could be pivotal in Detroit, which is nearly 80% Black, where leaders for months had warned administration officials that voter apathy could cost them in a city that's typically a stronghold for their party. Rev. Wendell Anthony, president of the NAACP Detroit branch, said the excitement in the city now is \"mind-blowing.\" He likened it to Barack Obama's first run for president in 2008, when voters waited in long lines to help elect the nation's first Black president.\n\nBut some Democratic leaders in Michigan had grown concerned that choosing the wrong running mate could slow that momentum and fracture a coalition that has only recently started to unify.\n\nArab American leaders, who hold an outsized influence in Michigan due to a large presence in metro Detroit, had been vocal in their opposition to Shapiro due to his past comments regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nArab American leaders specifically pointed to a comment he made earlier this year regarding protests on university campuses, which they felt unfairly compared the actions of student protesters to those of white supremacists. Shapiro, who is Jewish, has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while remaining a staunch supporter of Israel.\n\n\"It\u00b4s certainly not antisemitic to critique somebody\u00b4s position on Israeli policy,\" Hammoud said. \"That\u00b4s just called stewardship and accountability.\"\n\nIn addition to expressing those concerns publicly, leaders had also made their feelings known privately to the White House and Harris\u00b4 team.\n\nOsama Siblani, the publisher of the Dearborn-based Arab American News and a prominent leader in Michigan\u00b4s large Muslim community, was among those who met with White House adviser Tom Perez in Michigan last week. Although Perez was in the state on official business, he has maintained contact with some Dearborn leaders since he and other top officials traveled there with Biden in an effort to mend ties with the community.\n\nSiblani said he met with Perez for over an hour on July 29 and told him that if Harris chose Shapiro, it would \"shut down\" future conversations. He also conveyed this message to Democratic lawmakers in Congress, including Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell.\n\nPushback from Arab Americans and union leaders was \"not the only reason why she did not pick Shapiro, but it is one of the major reasons,\" said Siblani.\n\n\"Not picking Shapiro is a very good step. It cracks the door open a little more for us,\" said Siblani, who along with Hammoud emphasized that any meaningful conversations must include policy discussions.\n\nMichigan state Sen. Jeremy Moss, who is Jewish, was excited by the prospect of having Shapiro as a vice presidential candidate but was \"disturbed\" by the criticism he received, believing that many of the vetted candidates had similar views on Israel. He said he didn't believe the criticism played a role in Harris' decision and that \"she\u00b4s choosing somebody based on this long game of who she can work with for four to eight years.\"\n\nStill, Moss said he is glad the Harris-Walz ticket is not divisive and that the feeling of unity among Democrats is \"palpable on the ground.\"\n\nThe nation's largest auto workers' union, the United Auto Workers, also watched the vice presidential choice carefully.\n\nThey moved to endorse Harris quickly after she stepped in to replace Biden, and UAW President Shawn Fain said publicly that she had a right to choose her own running mate. But he also said the union, which has 370,000 members and a huge presence in Michigan and other Midwestern states, didn't favor Shapiro, who had previously joined with Pennsylvania Republicans in calling for an expansion of voucher programs that allow public tax dollars to flow to private schools.\n\nFain had singled out Walz - in addition to other candidates - for praise in an interview with The Associated Press on Aug. 2, saying the Minnesota governor was a \"brilliant guy, sharp guy.\" In a statement Tuesday, Fain said Walz will make a \"great vice president\" and that he has \"stood with the working class every step of the way.\"\n\nDingell, a Democrat with deep connections in Dearborn who has brokered some of the conversations between Biden administration officials and leaders of core constituencies in Michigan, echoed those sentiments Tuesday. She said the choice of Walz would only ramp up excitement at Wednesday's rally in Detroit.\n\n\"We got somebody from the Midwest, from the heartland, that really understands our issues,\" said Dingell. \"And he will be a partner to her. She won\u00b4t have to look over her shoulder every two minutes. He will be a total, true partner.\"\n\nAssociated Press writers Tom Krisher in Detroit and Isabella Volmert in Lansing, Michigan contributed to this report.\n\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov.

Republicans want to send a 'thank you' card to Kamala Harris after she passes on Josh Shapiro", "body": "By Julia Terruso and Gillian McGoldrick, The Philadelphia Inquirer The Tribune Content Agency\n\nPHILADELPHIA - In Vice President Kamala Harris' search for a running mate, Gov. Josh Shapiro's connection to Pennsylvania was perhaps his strongest selling point.\n\nThe state is widely viewed as a must-win for Democrats this year. Shapiro has won by big margins in several of his last statewide races and he's liked by some Republican and independent voters.\n\nWhile there's little evidence to show that historically the home state of a vice presidential candidate helps carry the state, Shapiro's popularity here was seen as an asset.\n\nHarris' pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, though, has a personal story that could have unique appeal in the Midwest and in rural parts of Pennsylvania where President Joe Biden won back just enough Democrats to help him carry the state.\n\n\"People keep saying that Pennsylvania is the Midwest but Montgomery County isn't the Midwest,\" one statewide Democratic strategist said. \"So if you're trying to keep the working-class Americans attracted to Joe Biden, Tim Walz does that more than Josh Shapiro.\"\n\nBy missing out on the ticket, Shapiro may also have more time to campaign for Harris in his home state, without the added job of jetting around the country.\n\n\"Of course the Governor of Pennsylvania is better known and liked in Pennsylvania than the Governor of Minnesota,\" Democratic strategist J.J. Balaban said. \"But Pennsylvania isn't the only swing state, and there are many reasons that Walz could be an asset to the Democratic ticket here. He's a veteran and a teacher who represented a mostly rural swing district ... knowing how to connect in rural areas and small towns is a real asset in Pennsylvania.\"\n\nWhat Pennsylvania Republicans are saying\n\nRepublican officials across Pennsylvania, once worried about Shapiro becoming the VP pick citing his across-the-aisle appeal, spent Tuesday celebrating Harris' running mate choice.\n\n\"Thank you, Kamala,\" said Pat Poprik, the Bucks County GOP chair, where Republicans now outnumber Democrats in one of the state's most purple counties. \"I want to send her a 'Thank You' card.\"\n\nBy choosing Walz, Harris made Poprik's job of electing Republicans much easier because \"she picked someone so liberal,\" she said.\n\n\"Voters in Pennsylvania will see that their governor got passed over for someone not in step\" with their moderate views, Poprik added.\n\nSamuel Chen, a Republican consultant, said it would have been difficult for Democrats to pick a worse candidate than former President Donald Trump's chosen running mate, U.S. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, who doubles down on Trump's populist ideas. But Walz doesn't bring much to the table, either, to help balance the ticket. This is in contrast with Shapiro, he said, who would have helped Democrats appeal to more disaffected and unaffiliated voters that campaigns need to win in swing states.\n\n\"In the Trump campaign this morning, they're breathing a sigh of relief,\" Chen added.\n\nPennsylvania last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 2016. Meanwhile, it's been more than 50 years since deep-blue Minnesota voted for one, Chen added. Even in 1984, when 49 states voted for Ronald Reagan, Minnesota still voted blue (albeit for Minnesota native Walter Mondale).\n\n\"If you're trying to expand the party to reach those swing voters, those unaffiliated voters, you're not doing it by going further to your left,\" Chen said. \"This is an unforced error by the Harris campaign.\"\n\nTypically, presidential candidates will try to balance the ticket; they'll choose a person with a specific strength to fill in where the candidate has a perceived weakness, said Berwood Yost, the director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll. For example, Trump chose former Vice President Mike Pence to help him reach conservative Evangelical voters, or former President Barack Obama chose President Joe Biden to be his running mate to fill his lack of experience.\n\nIf Harris chose Shapiro, she may have had more leeway to change her views on top issues for swing voters in battleground states like fracking, Yost added. Harris has recently changed her view on fracking, previously opposing it.\n\n\"It's easier to come in and say to Pennsylvania, 'I do support fracking, here's how (Shapiro) helped me change my perspective,'\" Yost said.\n\nBut Shapiro will remain a top surrogate for Harris, said Brendan McPhillips, a senior adviser to the Harris campaign.\n\n\"The governor didn't go anywhere. He's still gonna be actively campaigning in support of the ticket,\" McPhillips added. \"He put out a supportive statement just a little while ago, and I feel very confident that as Pa. voters get to know who Gov. Walz is, there's just a lot to love about him.\"\n\nSome Republicans were offended by how Shapiro was treated by the progressive wing of the Democratic Party as they pushed for Walz.\n\n\"It is regrettable that, in a state known for moderation and common decency, the governor's worst enemies turned out to be members of his own party,\" said Pennsylvania Treasurer Stacy Garrity, who is up for reelection this year.\n\nDemocrats, for their part, quickly began trying to fight off some of the GOP criticisms of Walz as being \"too liberal\" by letting him be himself: a veteran, former schoolteacher and coach, and Midwestern dad, said McPhillips.\n\n_____", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Josh Shapiro was a crowd pleaser at the Kamala Harris campaign event at the Liacouras Center. (Emma Lee/WHYY)\n\nHours after Kamala Harris announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, the Harris-Walz ticket made their inaugural campaign stop at Temple University's Liacourus Center in Philadelphia.\n\nBut, before Harris introduced Walz, the first runner up in the \"Veepstakes,\" Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, took to the podium to thunderous applause.\n\nHe told the Philly crowd \"I love being your governor,\" allaying any concerns that he was disappointed about narrowly missing his chance at the second highest office in the country.\n\n\"Y'all fill my heart and I love you so much,\" he said. \"And I want you to know every single day I go to work for you, I put my shoulder to the wheel and I focus on three simple letters in our alphabet, GSD, and I focus on getting s*** done for all of you.\"\n\nShapiro pointed out that he and Harris, both previous attorneys general, have been friends for two decades, adding \"she is courtroom tough.\"\n\n\"She has a big heart, and she is battle tested and ready to go, whether in a courtroom, whether fighting as attorney general, whether remembering the people who have oftentimes been left behind when she was sitting in the halls of power in the center,\" he said. \"Kamala Harris has always understood that you have to be every day for the people.\"\n\nShapiro then turned to pounce on former President Donald Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance. But, even before he could finish, the crowd started chanting \"He's a weirdo,\" Walz's characterization of Vance.\n\n\"I love you, Philly,\" Shapiro exclaimed. \"The fact you are chanting he's a weirdo means you heard of my good friend and our next vice president, Tim Walz.\"\n\nShapiro then praised the person who was ultimately chosen to join Harris on the ticket.\n\n\"Tim Walz is a great man,\" he said. \"Tim Walz is an outstanding governor. Tim Walz is a teacher. Tim Walz is a guardsman. Tim Walz is a great patriot. And I'll tell you what else - Tim Walz is a dear friend and I want you to know, Lori and I feel blessed to have Tim and Gwen in our lives,\" he said, including the first ladies of Pennsylvania and Minnesota.\n\nWalz returned the adulation saying Shapiro \"can bring the fire.\"\n\n\"I know you know this, but my God, what a treasure you have in Josh Shapiro. This is a visionary leader also, I have to tell you, everybody in America knows when you need a bridge fix, call that guy,\" he added, referencing the I-95 bridge collapse last June, which the Shapiro administration had repaired in 12 days.\n\nShapiro reminded his constituents that America's freedom was birthed in the city 248 years ago.\n\n\"The task of defending our fundamental freedoms, it now falls to all of you to freedom loving Americans all across this great country, and to the good people of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania who will decide this next election and understand our unique responsibility,\" he said.\n\nAnd \"while we'll see Kamala Harris and Tim Walz's names on the ballot that this election isn't just about their names on this ballot, this election is about all of you.\"\n\nThe governor took the opportunity and talked about his faith, something that became part of the public discourse in the run up to Harris' consideration of her potential running mate.\n\n\"I don't want to preach,\" he said, to which the audience chanted \"Preach! Preach: Preach.\"\n\n\"I want to just say this, I lean on my family and I lean on my faith, which calls me to serve, and I am proud of my faith now,\" he said. \"My faith teaches me that no one, no one is required to complete the task, but neither are we free to refrain from it. That means that each of us has a responsibility to get off the sidelines, to get in the game, and to do our part.\"\n\nHarris' supporters filled the 10,000-seat stadium, with another roughly 2,000 standing. Campaign officials said that another 2,000 people were in an adjoining building watching via live TV. In addition to Shapiro, Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, National Democratic Committee Chair Jaime Harrison, and Pennsylvania Senators John Fetterman and Bob Casey also addressed supporters.", "source": {"uri": "witf.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WITF"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liacouras_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liacouras Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temple University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Philadelphia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Philadelphia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaime Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Casey_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob Casey Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.witf.io/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/shapiro-harris-rally-2024-08-06-4-1619x1080.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796608", "eventUri": "eng-9796608", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Josh Shapiro bounded onto the stage Tuesday evening, he was energetic, charismatic and clearly at home.\n\nIt was a glimpse of what might have been. Before the harsh reality of politics set in.\n\nShapiro swallowed whatever disappointment he may have felt in losing out on the chance to become Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate and made himself the rousing hype man for the Democratic presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, whom Harris had asked just hours earlier to join her on the ticket.\n\n\"I love you, Philly - and you know what else I love? I love being your governor!\" Shapiro said to deafening cheers from inside Temple University's Liacouras Center, where Harris and Walz were making their first joint campaign appearance.\n\nFor days, it had appeared that Shapiro would end up as Harris' vice-presidential running mate. He had interviewed for the job, and the choice came down to him and Walz. Harris's decision to go with Walz stunned many given Shapiro's credentials: He's a popular governor of a battleground state that could determine the winner of the election.\n\nBut Shapiro also carried considerable baggage that would have made him a risky choice. Shapiro, who is Jewish, has infuriated the Democratic Party's progressives as well as Arab Americans and Muslims over his support for Israel in its ongoing war in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAnd while his positions aren't that different from the other names on Harris's shortlist, it was Shapiro who frequently faced the toughest scrutiny.\n\nShapiro, 51, has been one of the most steadfast Democratic supporters of Israel, arguing that it has a right to defend itself from Hamas. He has been critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling him \"one of the worst leaders of all time.\" But he has also refrained from calling for an immediate cease-fire, which put him at odds with many of the party's left-wing voters.\n\nHow much Shapiro's stance on Israel - and the possibility that could have splintered the party - weighed on Harris's decision to pick Walz wasn't immediately clear. Had Harris chosen him, Shapiro would have been the second practicing Jew to run for vice president, behind the late Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, who ran alongside Al Gore in 2000. But voters have never elected a Jewish president or vice president in the nation's nearly 250-year history.From the rally stage, Shapiro showed no signs of hard feelings. He heaped praise on Walz, calling him \"a dear friend\" and \"a great patriot\" and urging the crowd \"to give him a whole lot of love.\"\n\nHe doubled down on defending his Jewish faith -- and even appeared to be firing back at detractors who had dubbed him \"Genocide Josh.\"\n\n\"I lean on my family, and I lean on my faith, which calls me to serve,\" Shapiro said. \"And I am proud of my faith.\"\n\nShapiro's faith has been central to his personal life and political career from an early age, when he began a letter-writing campaign to raise awareness about Soviet Jews barred from leaving their country, to the final days of Harris's search for a running mate.\n\nShapiro grew up in Upper Dublin in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.\n\nAs a child, Shapiro, with the help of his mother, Judi, started a letter-writing program to raise awareness about \"refuseniks,\" Soviet Jews who were refused permission to emigrate from the Soviet Union, usually to Israel, in the late 1960s through the 1970s.\n\n\"These were Soviet Jewish children and families who were refused the ability to leave the Soviet Union, to practice their faith and to live free lives,\" he said during an interview with the USA Today Network when running for governor in 2021. \"And my mom served on those issues, and she got me inspired to work on those issues as well,\"\n\nShapiro's pen-pal in that program, a boy named Avi, traveled to America to attend Shapiro's bar mitzvah at the Beth Shalom synagogue near Upper Dublin. Avi's family were granted asylum in Israel soon after.\n\nGrowing up, Shapiro attended the Forman Hebrew Day School and then the Akiba Hebrew Academy, now the Jack M. Barrack Hebrew Academy.\n\nDuring his 2022 gubernatorial bid, Shapiro didn't shy away from his faith -- and neither did his opponent, state Sen. Doug Mastriano, a self-described Christian nationalist from Franklin County.\n\nIn his first campaign TV ad, Shapiro said no matter where he starts his day, \"I make it home Friday night for Sabbath dinner,\" which he celebrates with his wife and four children every week, \"because family and faith ground me.\"\n\nMastriano, speaking to supporters, said Shapiro harbored \"disdain for people like us,\" because he \"grew up in a privileged neighborhood, attended one of the most privileged schools in the nation as a young man... sending his four kids to the same privileged, exclusive, elite school.\"\n\nShapiro, however, turned Mastriano's extremist views against him, criticizing him for his ties to other Christian nationalists, including Andrew Torba, founder of the conservative social media platform Gab.\n\nMore: Why Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz over Josh Shapiro as her running mate\n\nSince the attack on Israel by Hamas and other Palestinian militants in Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023, Shapiro has several times rankled progressives and Arab-American and Muslim populations angered over Israeli forces' killing of nearly 40,000 Palestinian civilians.\n\nShapiro has supported Israel's right to defend itself from Hamas. But he also has refrained from calling for a cease-fire, made references to the Ku Klux Klan in discussing pro-Palestinian protestors, and raised questions about his support for free-speech rights in calling for the firing for University of Pennsylvania President Elizabeth Magill over anti-Israel campus protests.\n\nSome Shapiro defenders have said that the popular governor's position on Israel differs little from other Democratic lawmakers and that criticism of him is antisemitic.\n\nOver the weekend, for example, he was forced to defend an essay he wrote for his college newspaper in which he suggested that Palestinians were \"too battle-minded\" to achieve a two-state solution in the Middle East. Shapiro said his views have evolved in the three decades since he penned the article, but critics called his remarks racist and anti-Palestinian.\n\nAmy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, said she finds the conversation about Shapiro to be \"concerning\" and said he has \"positions on Israel that largely align with the vast majority of other potential VP candidates.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of important and constructive debate and criticism that should happen around his policies or anyone else's policies\" when it comes to Israel or campus protests, she said. But \"if it's only the Jewish candidate that is being singled out with terms like 'Genocide Josh,' then that is deeply problematic.\"\n\nMore: New poll shows Josh Shapiro and Mark Kelly have higher favorability than Tim Walz\n\nOther factors also may have kept Shapiro off the presidential ticket.\n\n\"There may have been an experience factor,\" said Robert Speel, professor of political science at Penn State's Behrend campus in Erie, Pa. \"Waltz not only has served as governor for six years, but he also served in Congress for many years before that. He also was an officer in the Army National Guard and served for a couple of decades. Tim Walz certainly has an impressive resume, which may have given him a boost over Shapiro.\"\n\nLike Harris, Shapiro is a former state attorney general, but he has served as governor for less than two years, has no experience on the federal level and lacks military bona fides.\n\n\"There were some negative attributes to a potential Shapiro choice,\" Speel said. \"One was his past support for school vouchers, which is not particularly popular with liberals. Second, the way he reacted last fall when there were protesters at university campuses in Philadelphia incensed over what was happening in the Middle East. There were many Democrats, particularly young Democrats, who were not happy with Shapiro kind of joining in with Republicans to attack student protestors. That may have played a role as well.\"\n\nShapiro, who many consider a moderate Democrat, would have added an ideological balance to the ticket while also helping Harris nab a critical battleground state.\n\nShapiro's candidacy, however, faced opposition on multiple fronts.\n\nMore: Josh Shapiro's vice presidential prospects spark debate over Israel policy, antisemitism\n\nAlso, haunting Shapiro were questions about what he knew and when he knew it about sexual harassment claims involving a former cabinet member.\n\nLast fall, Shapiro's office quietly settled for $295,000 a claim that a longtime ally had made numerous sexual advances toward a subordinate, as well as lewd comments about the subordinate, other female staffers and a female state senator, as The (Philadelphia) Inquirer has reported. The employee had only been on the job for two months when Mike Vereb, Shapiro's secretary of legislative affairs, allegedly began making the comments.\n\nDays after the woman told Vereb that his conduct was becoming the subject of office gossip, she was called into a meeting with the human resources department for the governor's office. Vereb later mentioned to her that the meeting was about performance issues with her job.\n\nThe woman resigned in March after that meeting and a separate meeting with Shapiro staffers in which she addressed her concerns. She provided a statement to the state Office of Equal Opportunity that month, and in June filed a complaint with the state Human Relations Commission. The settlement, which included a non-disclosure agreement that prohibits all parties from commenting on the matter, was paid in September. Vereb resigned weeks later.\n\nShapiro has been peppered with questions about why Vereb was allowed to remain in his job for months after the allegations were lodged against him.\n\nAt the campaign rally in Philadelphia, Marc Seide, a 34-year-old web designer from Philadelphia, said he believes Walz \"balances out\" the ticket and that Shapiro's opposition from progressives might have posed too many challenges.\n\n\"The is my first campaign event of the year, and I'm excited. I'm really excited to see how this goes,\" Seide said. \"To go from (Joe) Biden to Harris and to see that energy out here in the crowd - it's tremendous.\"\n\nRobin Reid, 63, of Philadelphia, said she had been rooting for Shapiro to become Harris' running mate \"because he's from Pennsylvania, and he's just relatable.\n\n\"I've never heard of Tim Walz,\" Reid said.\n\n\"But at the same time,\" she added, \"we were afraid of losing Josh Shapiro, so it's kind of bittersweet.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_the_Soviet_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "History of the Jews in the Soviet Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arab Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gab_(social_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gab (social network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_M._Barrack_Hebrew_Academy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack M.

Tim Walz as her vice presidential nominee.\n\nThe quotation - \"It is not your duty to finish the work, but neither are you at liberty to neglect it,\" - is generally taken as a reassurance to those facing monumental or seemingly unreachable goals. It has become a mainstay of Jewish activist circles across the political spectrum. Advertisement\n\nShapiro's statement came after a two-week period when he was thought to be one of the frontrunners in Harris' veepstakes. By Monday, he and Walz were reportedly the final two contenders. The distinction between them had been framed as a choice between one swing-state governor - Shapiro - with a reputation for centrism and bipartisanship, and another - Walz - with a folksy demeanor and cachet with the party's progressive wing.\n\nRumors that Shapiro was the leading candidate ignited a campaign by progressives to sink his bid, focused on his support for Israel, his criticism of pro-Palestinian college student protesters, and his positions that buck Democratic norms. Several of Shapiro's Jewish allies, noting that Walz also has a pro-Israel record, suggested that the anti-Shapiro effort was antisemitic. No parallel anti-Walz campaign emerged in the public eye.\n\nShapiro congratulates Walz\n\nShapiro, who attended Jewish day school and remains involved in his Philadelphia-area Jewish community, didn't address those allegations in his statement. He said he had gone through Harris' vetting process and \"was grateful to have the opportunity to speak with the Vice President directly about her vision for the role and the campaign ahead.\"\n\nHe added, \"As I've said repeatedly over the past several weeks, the running mate decision was a deeply personal decision for the Vice President and it was also a deeply personal decision for me.\"\n\nHe congratulated Walz and his wife, whom he referred to as \"Tim and Gwen\" and whom he called \"good friends of ours.\" He wrote that Harris \"has my enthusiastic support,\" and he pledged to campaign for her in Pennsylvania, seen by many analysts as a must-win state. He said he would appear at a rally with Harris later on Tuesday in Philadelphia, where she will publicly appear with Walz as her running mate.

John Fetterman, who clashed with Shapiro over the years.\n\nThe two faced off during their time together on Pennsylvania's Board of Pardons, when Fetterman allegedly observed Shapiro putting his political aspirations ahead of doing what the former felt was morally right.\n\nShortly after Harris announced Walz as her VP choice on Tuesday, Shapiro praised the Minnesota governor as an \"exceptionally strong\" pick.\n\n\"Over the next 90 days, I look forward to traveling all across the Commonwealth to unite Pennsylvanians behind Kamala Harris' campaign to defeat Donald Trump, become

Josh Shapiro due to his religion. The progressive base would have launched a jihad if the rising Democratic star was selected, but there are other reasons -- all of them ridiculous. In short, Harris pulled a Hillary Clinton, picking someone who would never outshine her. It's an absurd notion: a state representative from 'nowhereville' could outshine Harris, who is queen of being unremarkable. Say what you will about Hillary Clinton, but she had a presidential resume. She was a trainwreck on policy, and like the former first lady and two-time presidential loser, Harris decided to rip a page from her failed 2016 playbook and picked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (via NY Post):\n\nPolitical consultant Hank Sheinkopf told The Post that Shapiro was too hot to pick as Harris' running mate because of his pro-Israel record, and that Waltz was a safer choice.\n\n\"The ticket would have been too pro-Israel. Harris doesn't need a battle over Israel-Gaza,\" said Sheinkopf, who worked on Bill Clinton's re-election campaign.\n\nBut another Democratic operative who spoke with The Post dismissed the notion of anti-Israel sentiment playing a role.\n\n\"I think if the flak he'd taken regarding Israel had been a stronger consideration, he wouldn't have made it this far at all,\" the operative said of Shapiro.\n\n\"My honest sense is that Harris had a concern that Shapiro would overshadow her and be the spotlight of the ticket here,\" the operative said, confirming earlier reports of the younger Democrat's ability to upstage some of his party's national leaders.\n\n\"What this pick came down to was, more or less, vibes,\" the operative added, describing Walz's as a \"Midwestern do-no-harm vibe.\"\n\nShapiro was passed over three days after a puzzling video already describing him as Harris' No. 2 leaked online from the X account of Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker.\n\nSen. John Fetterman (D-PA) also reached out to Harris' camp and shared his concerns about Shapiro, not having anything to do with this faith -- Fetterman is one of the most vocal pro-Israel lawmakers on the Hill -- but his personal ambitions (via Politico):\n\nPennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman is concerned about the possibility that Vice President Kamala Harris might choose his state's governor, Josh Shapiro, as her running mate, and his advisers have privately relayed those worries to Harris' team, according to three people familiar with the conversations.\n\nFetterman's advisers suggested to Harris' team that the senator believes that Shapiro is excessively focused on his own personal ambitions. His reservations about Shapiro reflect a long-running rivalry between the two ambitious Democrats, who have risen on parallel tracks in a politically crucial state.\n\nFor Fetterman's representatives to reveal his concerns to the party's new standard-bearer's team underscores the intense scrutiny being applied to possible running mates -- and the high stakes of a decision that has the potential to shape the Democratic Party for years to come.\n\nThe leaked video posted by Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, where it was heavily insinuated that Shapiro would be the VP pick, confirmed the warnings offered by Fetterman to Harris' people. Yet, Shapiro's folks claim they knew nothing about the hype video. Yet, Politico added that Shapiro's interview didn't go well either:\n\nWhy not Shapiro? By contrast, Pennsylvania Gov. JOSH SHAPIRO's team felt that his own interview with Harris did not go as well as it could have. There was \"not a great feeling\" coming out of it, according to a person in touch with Shapiro's advisers. A person familiar with the selection process told our colleagues that, after their meeting on Sunday, Shapiro called Harris' team and made clear that he was \"struggling with the decision to leave his current job as governor, in order to seek the vice presidency.\"\n\nThat applies to many rising Democrats living in governor's mansions. They're already looking at 2028, viewing this cycle as lost since Biden dropped out and the chaos that's followed. Harris is no gold standard either and eminently beatable. She's not scary, but the loud noise pumped in, thanks to the liberal media, has buoyed her candidacy to insane heights. It's an inflated stock that's about to crash. No one wants to get sinched when that happens.\n\nUPDATE: There's one last-minute leak: Harris' camp felt Shapiro couldn't deliver Pennsylvania.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news",

The way the Trump team saw it, Mr Shapiro could have done something running mates almost never do: enhance Harris' prospects of winning a crucial battleground state, one that Trump's own super political action committee considers pivotal to blocking Democrats' path to 270 electoral votes.\n\nMr Shapiro is viewed favourably by 61 per cent of Pennsylvania voters, according to a recent Fox News poll; only a handful of elected officials have achieved comparable numbers in the recent tribal and polarized era of American politics.\n\nTrump's advisers thought that Mr Shapiro's image as a centrist could also have helped Ms Harris with independent voters who are wary of her liberal record, offering balance to the new Democratic ticket.\n\nTrump aides had compiled stacks of opposition research on Mr Shapiro. They were ready to highlight his support of Israel - part of a plan to inflame the anti-Israel left and increase the chances of pro-Palestinian protests disrupting the Democratic National Convention in Chicago later in August.\n\nBut in recent days, that private view began to shift. Public reports indicated that Ms Harris and her advisers were cooling on Mr Shapiro amid a progressive campaign against him and a flurry of negative news stories about his time in office.\n\nThe Trump team came to see Gov Tim Walz of Minnesota as the safer choice for Ms Harris if she did not want to risk angering the left, something she had avoided in her short-lived presidential campaign in 2019.\n\nAnd as the push against Mr Shapiro gathered momentum - with Sen. John Fetterman, a fellow Democrat, criticising the governor and others in the party criticising how Mr Shapiro had handled a sexual harassment allegation against a top aide - Trump's top advisers zeroed in on Mr Walz and accelerated their research into his background.\n\nStill, the Trump team's week-ago assumptions remained in evidence Aug 6 at an event in Philadelphia held by Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. Flyers describing Mr Shapiro as a \"fraud\" and a \"corrupt lying con man\" were on hand before an aide hastily gathered them.\n\nOne challenge for the Trump team is that Mr Walz's speaking style; his background as a high school football coach, deer hunter and former National Guard member, and his Midwestern demeanour could appeal to rural voters and make him much harder for Trump to caricature as elitist or out of touch.\n\nThe Harris campaign plans to highlight all of those aspects of Mr Walz's background, as well as his experience going to college on the GI Bill and his work on agricultural issues.\n\n\"America is desperately in need of someone relatable,\" said Mr John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster whose firm has worked with the Biden and Harris campaigns. \"And this guy can go into small-town and rural America and speak their language. We have literally never had that. And he is such a good messenger. Never really sounds political or vitriolic. Just sounds reasonable.\"\n\nBut their plan for Mr Walz is to emphasise his left-wing governing record - which made him a favourite of the Democratic Party's most progressive members, as well as Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. - to strengthen their framing of Harris as \"dangerously liberal\".", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political action committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fetterman_(reporter)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Fetterman (reporter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_polarization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political polarization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_voter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent voter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opposition research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Modern liberalism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centrism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Bill", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "G.I.

Walz let Minnesota burn. Kamala Harris supported decriminalizing illegal immigration and abolishing ICE -- Walz supported making Minnesota a sanctuary state,\" he said.\n\nEarlier this week, a decades-old article resurfaced in which Shapiro wrote of being an Israeli army volunteer and disparaged the Palestinian people. The Philadelphia Inquirer uncovered the essay that he wrote for the Campus Times, the student newspaper of the University of Rochester, from which Shapiro graduated in 1995. In the article, Shapiro stressed his view that \"Palestinians will not peacefully coexist,\" because \"they do not have the capabilities to establish their own homelands and make it successful even with the aid of Israel and the United States.\"\n\nHARRIS' TOP VP OPTIONS ALL HAVE DRAWBACKS THAT COULD TAKE THEM OUT OF CONTENTION\n\nStrategists are speculating that Harris may have been primed to pick Shapiro up until the resurfaced op-ed, which could have distanced some of the party's more progressive base who believe an Israeli ceasefire will put an end to Palestinian casualties.\n\n\"That's 100% of the reason she was willing to sacrifice essentially locking up Pennsylvania for her campaign, dramatically helping them hold the Senate seat in Pennsylvania, and there are three congressional swing seats in Pennsylvania that Shapiro all won overwhelmingly in 2022,\" a House Republican strategist told Fox News Digital in an interview.\n\n\"All of that would have been taken off the map for Republicans. But because he was pro-Israel, it was effectively disqualifying for her, and she caved to the far left, pro-Hamas wing of the Democratic Party,\" the strategist said.\n\nWalz will now join Harris on a multi-state campaign tour in key battleground states over the next few days, as Harris attempts to rebrand herself as a moderate candidate and distance herself from her past progressive positions.\n\nTRUMP CAMP SAYS HARRIS-WALZ 'DANGEROUSLY LIBERAL' TICKET IS 'EVERY AMERICAN'S NIGHTMARE'\n\nNate Benefield, senior vice president at the Commonwealth Foundation, told Fox News Digital, \"This move really seems like it was more focused on solidifying the progressive base of the Democratic Party.\"\n\n\"I don't know that the VP choice really makes a dramatic difference nationwide, but, a couple of points in Pennsylvania, may be the margin,\" Benefield said. \"I think this does indicate that their decision was less about the swing states but energizing the progressive base.\"\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.\n\nMeanwhile, when it comes to Harris attempting to appear more moderate with the launch of Republicans for Harris this week, Benefield said, \"There's a long track record there of these progressive ideas that really don't appeal to voters in in Pennsylvania and Michigan, Wisconsin and other swing states.\"\n\nWalz, 60, is a former U.S. Army National Guard member and a former teacher who has raised his profile in recent weeks as an effective advocate for Harris. He grew up in a small town in Nebraska, and was also a football coach and union member at a high school in Minnesota before getting into politics. Recently, he attacked former President Trump and his running mate JD Vance as \"weird,\" a viral insult the Harris campaign has embraced.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA former member of Congress from a Republican-leaning district, Walz has proven appeal with rural, white voters, though he has also championed progressive policies as governor, such as free school meals and expanded paid worker leave.

I think he can relate to the average American, and I love that he has a sense of humor,\" said Hannah, a South Philadelphia native and retired behavioral health professional.\n\nPaired with the interest was a note of disappointment. Shapiro had been viewed as the favorite in the veepstakes due, in part, to Pennsylvania's importance as a presidential battleground.\n\nBut Harris went instead with a candidate whose reputation as a progressive governor had won him the support of organized labor and other heavyweights on the Left.\n\n\"I definitely get it,\" said Danielle Bullock, a 54-year-old healthcare professional who pointed to Walz's work making insulin more affordable.\n\n\"I mean, of course, as a Pennsylvanian, I would love to see Josh Shapiro, because I think he's innovative, he's bright,\" added Bullock, who lives in the Mount Airy neighborhood of Philadelphia.\n\n\"He can do wonders for this country. But this is Walz's time, and Josh has a lot of years that he'll be here.\"\n\nThe silver lining of Harris's choice is Pennsylvania gets to keep Shapiro for the remainder of his term, an outcome Margie Herbert, a special ed teacher who lives in the Philadelphia suburbs, called \"bittersweet.\"\n\n\"The selfish part of me didn't want to lose him to the vice presidency,\" she said.\n\nBut Harris got a taste of the enthusiasm Shapiro would have brought to her ticket at Tuesday's rally. Shapiro introduced Walz and Harris in a crowd-revving speech that drew the loudest applause lines of the night.\n\n\"There's no matching Shapiro,\" said Hannah, who also attended his inauguration in 2023. Unprompted, she speculated he could be a future president.\n\n\"Shapiro has it. He has that enthusiasm,\" she added.\n\nShapiro came with perceived downsides, among them his Jewish heritage. He, like other running mate choices, is supportive of Israel, but he had been singled out as \"Genocide Josh\" over the war in Gaza.\n\nOne Philadelphia resident named Israel as the sole reason he did not want Shapiro to be Harris's running mate.\n\nConcerns that Shapiro would outshine Harris were also front-of-mind. Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA), a rival of Shapiro's, reportedly relayed concerns to her team that Shapiro is too personally ambitious.\n\nThe choice of Walz surprised many political watchers. He became the favorite in the final hours of a vetting process that also homed in a third short list candidate, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ).\n\n\"I was caught off guard this morning, like everyone else,\" said Crystall McDowell, 61, who expected Kelly to be chosen.\n\nMcDowell, a retiree who lives in the Philadelphia suburbs, acknowledged that she knew little of Walz before the announcement, though she appreciated that he brings \"balance\" to the ticket and resonated with his speech.\n\n\"I think, yes, Trump is weird,\" she said with a chuckle. Walz is credited with originating Harris's attack line that the GOP's policies are odd.\n\nUltimately, Harris is betting that Walz's rural upbringing and folksy persona will be enough to help in the \"blue wall\" states former President Donald Trump won in 2016, including Pennsylvania.\n\nOne attendee described him as \"straight-laced\" and another as your \"average dad.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nMeanwhile, Shapiro has pledged to help Harris campaign in the Keystone State, with he and Walz praising one another from the stage on Tuesday in a show of unity.\n\n\"What a treasure you have in Josh Shapiro,\" Walz told the crowd. \"He can bring the fire.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington

Tim Walz rather than Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro to be her running mate. It may well be that Shapiro rubbed Harris the wrong way in their interviews when she was auditioning potential candidates. The same factors that led Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) to advise her against picking Shapiro might have influenced her. Shapiro does not have a reputation as a team player. His steady rise through Pennsylvania politics has been fueled by genuine talent as well as the sort of naked self-interested ambition that would have to be put on hold if he were to be the No. 2 in a campaign and an administration.\n\nBut there's little doubt that the decision to bypass a popular governor who could have played a decisive role in winning a key battleground state that Harris must have if she is to beat former President Donald Trump in November wasn't made solely because of Shapiro's healthy ego. As we all know, that is a quality that hardly marks him as an outlier among politicians. Instead, it was his identity as a Jew and an unabashed supporter of Israel that sparked an ultimately successful campaign among Democrats to spike the Shapiro boomlet.\n\nHis positions on Israel and the war on Hamas are not, in fact, very different from those of the other men Harris was considering, including Walz and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. They, too, support Israel's right to exist and condemned the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks on Israel, as well as expressed concern about the pro-Hamas demonstrations that have become the hallmark of a surge in American antisemitism during the last 10 months. And like them, Shapiro supports proposals for a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict that is hopelessly out of touch with what Palestinians want; all are critics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nChoosing Dearborn over Pennsylvania\n\nBut only the possibility of Shapiro being a heartbeat away from the presidency caused leftist magazines like The New Republic and Slate to denounce him for being \"egregiously bad on Palestine.\" As reports in The New York Times and other publications also made clear, his willingness to stand up on the issue in recent months was seen in a different light than that of other pro-Israel Democrats. The fact that he had rightly compared the pro-Hamas antisemites to members of the Ku Klux Klan, while Harris had voiced understanding and sympathy for them, was seen as disqualifying.\n\nIndeed, it got so bad that when an op-ed Shapiro wrote for his college newspaper in 1993 popped up, in which he voiced skepticism about the Oslo Accords and doubted whether the Palestinians would ever choose peace, he was forced to back away it. Of course, everything he wrote at that time was subsequently proven correct. But when confronted with it, Shapiro acted as if it was a youthful indiscretion. \"Something I wrote when I was 20, is that what you're talking about? I was 20.\"\n\nThis is an election in which leading Democrats believe they are going to need a united party with their left-wing activist base fully on board with the national ticket. That's why President Joe Biden sent officials to bend their knees to Dearborn, Mich., earlier this year to the pro-Hamas mayor of the city known as America's \"jihad capital.\" Shapiro being an affiliated synagogue member who attended Jewish day school and sends his own children to them, as well as has a record of support for Israel dating back to his youth, made him unacceptable to that crucial wing of the party.\n\nThat put Harris in something of a dilemma.\n\nIf winning the election and \"saving democracy\" from alleged threats by former President Donald Trump and the Republicans were primary goals, then Shapiro was her best bet. Naming him gave her the best chance of tipping Pennsylvania, where Trump has led for most of the year, back into the Democratic column. And his centrist approach would have expanded the Democratic coalition, giving it a better chance to win over independent voters who have also favored Trump this year.\n\nIndeed, his gracious and respectful attitude to the victims of the attempted assassination of Trump in Butler, Pa., last month struck a chord with both Republicans and Democrats at a time when most politicians seem determined to drive us farther apart.\n\nSending a message\n\nIt also would have also shored up Jewish support, both in terms of votes and campaign contributions. It's not clear whether that would have won Harris any more Electoral College votes. But in a year when there are some signs that even the most partisan Jewish Democrats have been shocked by the way left-wing antisemites have been allowed to run amuck on college campuses and in the streets of U.S. cities spouting hate for Jews and Israel since Oct. 7, it would have sent a message to Jews that they still have a home in a Democratic Party, even though many in its left-wing base think that they are intersectional villains who are guilty of \"white\" privilege.\n\nMore than that, it would have given Harris a \"Sister Souljah moment\" like the one that Bill Clinton seized in 1992 when he criticized a black artist for saying there was nothing wrong with blacks killing whites, and in doing so, demonstrated both his centrist bona fides and a willingness to take on extremists within his own party.\n\nBut Democrats don't believe in Sister Souljah moments anymore. Harris, who supported a fund that bailed out Black Lives Matter rioters in 2000, had no appetite for confronting the antisemitic, anti-Israel wing of her party. While there are still far more votes to be won in the pro-Israel center of American politics than on the pro-Hamas left, choosing the person that leftists have now dubbed \"Genocide Josh\" would have guaranteed dissension inside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago and riots outside of it.\n\nWalz is no leftist, but he was definitely the most left-leaning of all the potential vice-presidential nominees that were finalists for the Democrats. That's why members of the far-left congressional \"Squad\" and Socialist Democrats like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) celebrated Harris's choice. Though Democrats are rebranding him as being no different from Shapiro in most respects, he's clearly the favorite of \"progressives.\" He's a supporter of the antisemitic Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), imposed draconian COVID-19 lockdowns on his state and dithered for three days before finally agreeing to the anguished pleas of Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey to send in the National Guard to stop Black Lives Matter rioters from burning down the city.\n\nWalz is a capable politician, and there are some Democrats who think his experience as a Midwestern high school football coach is exactly the kind of r\u00e9sum\u00e9 line that Harris needs to balance her reputation as a San Francisco liberal. It's also true that most Republicans breathed a sigh of relief when they heard of her decision. Putting Shapiro on the Democratic ticket might not have guaranteed them victory, but it would have made the task for Trump and the GOP in battleground states a lot harder. That would have also been the case if Harris had picked Kelly, a former astronaut and U.S. Navy combat pilot with centrist appeal.\n\nHad Harris chosen Shapiro, it would have signaled that she was determined to steer the Democrats back into the political center on not just Israel but other issues like school choice, though Shapiro's stand on that topic is also anathema to the Teachers Unions that hold so much sway among Democrats.\n\nA lot has changed since 2000\n\nAbove all, the rejection of Shapiro after he was bashed by so many on the left serves as a reminder of how much the Democratic Party has changed in the last 24 years.\n\nAt this moment, August 2000 seems like a very long time ago. When then Vice President Al Gore chose Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman to be his running mate, the decision was hailed as a brilliant political move by the Democratic Party's nominee. It both solidified the hold of moderates on the Democratic Party and marked the first time a Jew was named to a national ticket. Like Shapiro is now, Lieberman's views were liberal on most issues. But he was also a well-respected centrist Democrat as well as an observant Jew, whose piety and plain-speaking manner was admired by people of all faiths.\n\nAs is true of almost all vice-presidential nominees, neither Lieberman nor his Republican counterpart Dick Cheney played a decisive role in determining the outcome of an election that was razor-close and decided in favor of George W. Bush by a mere 553 votes in Florida. Lieberman's nomination was a milestone in American history that seemed to prove that Jews were accepted virtually everywhere in the United States and could aspire to the nation's highest offices without being subjected to antisemitic invective.\n\nThe attacks on Shapiro illustrate that this is no longer the case.\n\nThat is not to say that Shapiro has no future in national politics. Should Harris lose this year, he will immediately be classified as among the likely Democratic presidential contenders in 2028. Perhaps political fashions will shift in the next four years in a way that will ease his path. For now, though, it's hard to imagine the Democrats picking someone who is considered a centrist and well as seen as a throwback to an earlier era where pro-Israel Democrats were the rule and Israel-haters were the exception in the party.", "source": {"uri": "jns.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish News Syndicate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_s_tobin@jns.org", "name": "Jonathan S.

Tim Walz rather than Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro to be her running mate. It may well be that Shapiro rubbed Harris the wrong way in their interviews when she was auditioning potential candidates. The same factors that led Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) to advise her against picking Shapiro might have influenced her. Shapiro does not have a reputation as a team player. His steady rise through Pennsylvania politics has been fueled by genuine talent as well as the sort of naked self-interested ambition that would have to be put on hold if he were to be the No. 2 in a campaign and an administration.\n\nBut there's little doubt that the decision to bypass a popular governor who could have played a decisive role in winning a key battleground state that Harris must have if she is to beat former President Donald Trump in November wasn't made solely because of Shapiro's healthy ego. As we all know, that is a quality that hardly marks him as an outlier among politicians. Instead, it was his identity as a Jew and an unabashed supporter of Israel that sparked an ultimately successful campaign among Democrats to spike the Shapiro boomlet.\n\nHis positions on Israel and the war on Hamas are not, in fact, very different from those of the other men Harris was considering, including Walz and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. They, too, support Israel's right to exist and condemned the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks on Israel, as well as expressed concern about the pro-Hamas demonstrations that have become the hallmark of a surge in American antisemitism during the last 10 months. And like them, Shapiro supports proposals for a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict that is hopelessly out of touch with what Palestinians want; all are critics of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nChoosing Dearborn over Pennsylvania\n\nBut only the possibility of Shapiro being a heartbeat away from the presidency caused leftist magazines like The New Republic and Slate to denounce him for being \"egregiously bad on Palestine.\" As reports in The New York Times and other publications also made clear, his willingness to stand up on the issue in recent months was seen in a different light than that of other pro-Israel Democrats. The fact that he had rightly compared the pro-Hamas antisemites to members of the Ku Klux Klan, while Harris had voiced understanding and sympathy for them, was seen as disqualifying.\n\nIndeed, it got so bad that when an op-ed Shapiro wrote for his college newspaper in 1993 popped up, in which he voiced skepticism about the Oslo Accords and doubted whether the Palestinians would ever choose peace, he was forced to back away it. Of course, everything he wrote at that time was subsequently proven correct. But when confronted with it, Shapiro acted as if it was a youthful indiscretion. \"Something I wrote when I was 20, is that what you're talking about? I was 20.\"\n\nThis is an election in which leading Democrats believe they are going to need a united party with their left-wing activist base fully on board with the national ticket. That's why President Joe Biden sent officials to bend their knees to Dearborn, Mich., earlier this year to the pro-Hamas mayor of the city known as America's \"jihad capital.\" Shapiro being an affiliated synagogue member who attended Jewish day school and sends his own children to them, as well as has a record of support for Israel dating back to his youth, made him unacceptable to that crucial wing of the party.\n\nThat put Harris in something of a dilemma.\n\nIf winning the election and \"saving democracy\" from alleged threats by former President Donald Trump and the Republicans were primary goals, then Shapiro was her best bet. Naming him gave her the best chance of tipping Pennsylvania, where Trump has led for most of the year, back into the Democratic column. And his centrist approach would have expanded the Democratic coalition, giving it a better chance to win over independent voters who have also favored Trump this year.\n\nIndeed, his gracious and respectful attitude to the victims of the attempted assassination of Trump in Butler, Pa., last month struck a chord with both Republicans and Democrats at a time when most politicians seem determined to drive us farther apart.\n\nIt also would have also shored up Jewish support, both in terms of votes and campaign contributions. It's not clear whether that would have won Harris any more Electoral College votes. But in a year when there are some signs that even the most partisan Jewish Democrats have been shocked by the way left-wing antisemites have been allowed to run amuck on college campuses and in the streets of U.S. cities spouting hate for Jews and Israel since Oct. 7, it would have sent a message to Jews that they still have a home in a Democratic Party, even though many in its left-wing base think that they are intersectional villains who are guilty of \"white\" privilege.\n\nMore than that, it would have given Harris a \"Sister Souljah moment\" like the one that Bill Clinton seized in 1992 when he criticized a black artist for saying there was nothing wrong with blacks killing whites, and in doing so, demonstrated both his centrist bona fides and a willingness to take on extremists within his own party.\n\nBut Democrats don't believe in Sister Souljah moments anymore. Harris, who supported a fund that bailed out Black Lives Matter rioters in 2000, had no appetite for confronting the antisemitic, anti-Israel wing of her party. While there are still far more votes to be won in the pro-Israel center of American politics than on the pro-Hamas left, choosing the person that leftists have now dubbed \"Genocide Josh\" would have guaranteed dissension inside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago and riots outside of it.\n\nWalz is no leftist, but he was definitely the most left-leaning of all the potential vice-presidential nominees that were finalists for the Democrats. That's why members of the far-left congressional \"Squad\" and Socialist Democrats like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) celebrated Harris's choice. Though Democrats are rebranding him as being no different from Shapiro in most respects, he's clearly the favorite of \"progressives.\" He's a supporter of the antisemitic Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), imposed draconian COVID-19 lockdowns on his state and dithered for three days before finally agreeing to the anguished pleas of Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey to send in the National Guard to stop Black Lives Matter rioters from burning down the city.\n\nWalz is a capable politician, and there are some Democrats who think his experience as a Midwestern high school football coach is exactly the kind of r\u00e9sum\u00e9 line that Harris needs to balance her reputation as a San Francisco liberal. It's also true that most Republicans breathed a sigh of relief when they heard of her decision. Putting Shapiro on the Democratic ticket might not have guaranteed them victory, but it would have made the task for Trump and the GOP in battleground states a lot harder. That would have also been the case if Harris had picked Kelly, a former astronaut and U.S. Navy combat pilot with centrist appeal.\n\nHad Harris chosen Shapiro, it would have signaled that she was determined to steer the Democrats back into the political center on not just Israel but other issues like school choice, though Shapiro's stand on that topic is also anathema to the Teachers Unions that\n\nA lot has changed since 2000\n\nAbove all, the rejection of Shapiro after he was bashed by so many on the left serves as a reminder of how much the Democratic Party has changed in the last 24 years.\n\nAt this moment, August 2000 seems like a very long time ago. When then Vice President Al Gore choose Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman to be his running mate, the decision was hailed as a brilliant political move by the Democratic Party's nominee. It both solidified the hold of moderates on the Democratic Party and marked the first time a Jew was named to a national ticket. Like Shapiro is now, Lieberman's views were liberal on most issues. But he was also a well-respected centrist Democrat as well as an observant Jew, whose piety and plain-speaking manner was admired by people of all faiths.\n\nAs is true of almost all vice-presidential nominees, neither Lieberman nor his Republican counterpart Dick Cheney played a decisive role in determining the outcome of an election that was razor-close and decided in favor of George W. Bush by a mere 553 votes in Florida. Lieberman's nomination was a milestone in American history that seemed to prove that Jews were accepted virtually everywhere in the United States and could aspire to the nation's highest offices without being subjected to antisemitic invective.\n\nThe attacks on Shapiro illustrate that this is no longer the case.\n\nThat is not to say that Shapiro has no future in national politics. Should Harris lose this year, he will immediately be classified as among the likely Democratic presidential contenders in 2028. Perhaps political fashions will shift in the next four years in a way that will ease his path. For now, though, it's hard to imagine the Democrats picking someone who is considered a centrist and well as seen as a throwback to an earlier era where pro-Israel Democrats were the rule and Israel-haters were the exception in the party.\n\nJonathan S.

Tim Walz as her running mate because it indicates \"the left\" would dominate if they win the election.\n\nWalz, who has a far-left record on immigration issues and transgender policy, edged out Harris' rumored top choice, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. Penn, on \"The Story With Martha MacCallum,\" said choosing Walz over Shapiro \"sends a message\" that Harris is catering to the Democratic base.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"I'm disappointed in the choice. I had really suggested that Josh Shapiro would be the best choice for a multitude of reasons, but mostly that, ideologically Josh Shapiro really put down a marker that the left wasn't going to control this next administration and it was a reach out to centrists,\" Penn said. \"So I think Walz sends a message, Bernie Sanders' choice, all in with the base. These are two campaigns that could have chosen the [Marco] Rubios or the Josh Shapiro, but instead chose to go double down on their bases and that's the way they're going to run these campaigns.\"\n\nNBC's Chuck Todd said on Tuesday that he believes \"progressive backlash\" to Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly as running mates influenced Harris to pick Walz. For instance, Democratic anti-Israel activists criticized Shapiro for his pro-Israel views.\n\n\"No one actually knows who he is. He has zero national name recognition, so he's going to be ... whatever the media says he's going to be ... I don't know if we're ever going to know what this ticket really stands for,\" Penn added of Walz. \"What we do know is that she had a choice. I think she could have put the election away with the choice of Shapiro and what we do know is she's doubled down on the liberal base.\"\n\n\"I don't think people really follow the views of the vice presidents that carefully. I think they look at overall images and what message does this selection send,\" he said. \"And as I said, look, I think both candidates decided to double down on their bases here and not move to the center. That, of course, that disappoints me.\"\n\nTrump chose Republican Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance as his running mate in July. Pollster Frank Luntz also described the former president's selection as doubling down on his base.\n\n\"He chose to double down. And J.D. Vance comes from the background that Trump's focusing on, so he's credible. And he's got the language because this is how he grew up,\" Luntz said. \"To me, the most important segment of the population, the one that makes or breaks, are these paycheck-to-paycheck voters, people who have jobs, they've been working, they may not be college graduates and they're struggling. And it represents one-fourth of the American electorate. Normally, they vote Democrat over Republican by about two to one. Trump brought it to three to two, even closer. That segment, if they break for Harris, she's the next president. If Trump can keep them, he's the next president.\"\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Kamala Harris has selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her VP running mate.\n\nAll six of the leading candidates had strengths and weaknesses that have been endlessly discussed. Whoever Harris selected, some of her supporters were bound to be disappointed. I believe that nothing is more important in U.S. politics at this moment than defeating both Trump and Trumpism. And so I have been prepared to write in support of whoever was the nominee. All the same, I honestly think that Walz is the best choice, and I am both relieved and heartened that it is he that Harris has chosen.\n\nWalz is a Minnesota progressive (think Walter Mondale with a touch of Paul Wellstone) who can help carry Minnesota and Wisconsin (states in his media market) and Michigan, and he is the kind of plain-spoken, no-bullshit guy that will play well throughout the \"heartland\" -- and will be able to call bullshit, figuratively and literally, on J.D. Vance and his \"hillbilly elegies.\"\n\nWhile Josh Shapiro, like Harris, has had a \"typical\" career trajectory from law school to politics, Walz served for 24 years in the Army National Guard and is the highest-ranking enlisted soldier to ever serve in the U.S. Congress -- where he served for 12 years as a major supporter of veteran's affairs. He is a former high school teacher and football coach who received his college degree -- a B.S. -- from Chadron State College in Nebraska (where, you ask? Exactly the point). He is a hunter and gun owner. In other words, he is the farthest thing from a \"coastal liberal\" that it is possible to be.\n\nWalz is very strong on social and economic issues, which is why he has been the favored choice of Bernie Sanders and other progressives. He has been described as a \"Minnesota social democrat,\" and this is accurate. But so too was Walter Monday and Hubert Humphrey before him -- neither a Bernie Sanders-type. Walz might well be the person in this race whose profile is closest to -- Joe Biden. And he promises to do for Harris's campaign what Biden did for Barack Obama's in 2008.\n\nWalz is very strong on social and economic issues, which is why he has been the favored choice of Bernie Sanders and other progressives.\n\nShapiro is a very successful Democratic governor who promised to carry Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes (it is worth noting that Minnesota and Wisconsin each have 10 electoral votes, and Michigan another 15). He is a more \"centrist\" politician than Walz, and he was supported by many donor-types because of his more neoliberal views on economics (especially school choice), and also by many pro-Zionist groups because of his positions on the Israel/Gaza war and on campus protest. And he is probably more closely associated with the Biden administration's feckless handling of the Middle East crisis than any other candidate. But these policy positions also threatened to alienate many of the base democratic constituencies -- young people, Arab-Americans, many of the BLM-linked civil rights groups -- whose mobilization will be crucial in November. (And the notion that progressive opposition to Shapiro because of his positions on the Gaza war and campus protest is antisemitic is bullshit, though it draws on tropes that right-wing Zionists have been deploying ever since October 7.).\n\nShapiro's profile as a Democratic rising star is indeed rather close to Harris's -- and indeed in the end it might have been his ambition and his strong personality that caused Harris to look elsewhere for a partner. The notion that Harris is a \"leftist\" who needs to be balanced by Shapiro's centrism is risible, and it is worth reminding those making this claim that when she campaigned for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2019-2020, she was very much in the middle of a race whose two most dynamic candidates, for some time, were Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. At that time, she was being attacked from the left for not being radical enough (I published a piece on this back in February 2019 entitled \"Kamala Harris Is Not a Red-Baiter, She's Just Not a Socialist, Like Most Americans.\") The Trump campaign will lie about her \"leftism.\" But the proper antidote to such lies is simply the effective promulgation of the truth.\n\nIn short, Walz \"balances\" Harris on the ticket better than Shapiro ever could.\n\nAnd if Shapiro and Fetterman-who hate each other, another interesting dynamic that might have played a role in Harris's choice of Walz-are the Pennsylvania power-houses they each claim to be, then they should be able to deliver their state to the Democrats anyway (I assume that at some point the support of \"Scranton Joe\" might also play a role).\n\nHarris has made a fantastic choice, even if it will disappoint some of the neocons who have realigned with the Democratic Party.\n\nIn yesterday's The Bulwark, Bill Kristol -- full disclosure, a friend with whom I have collaborated -- argued strenuously that Shapiro is the only strong VP candidate, and that Harris's failure to name him would be the \"first unforced error of her campaign,\" potentially stalling her momentum and also making her look weak \"after the campaign against him from the left.\" Kristol was not wrong to note Shapiro's strengths. But, as I indicate above, these strengths are exaggerated, and come with serious weaknesses; indeed Kristol admits that \"Harris could still win without Shapiro.\"\n\nHarris has made a fantastic choice, even if it will disappoint some of the neocons who have realigned with the Democratic Party.\n\nKristol exaggerates the extent to which there has been a \"campaign against\" Shapiro as opposed to an honest debate about who would be best. For as he himself notes, most Harris supporters have said that they would support whoever Harris picks. The differences between the VP candidates were not great, and all were and are firmly in the general orbit of Harris -- who is of course the person who matters most.\n\nThe Democratic Party is a big tent party that has become even bigger since Trump forced many former Republicans out of the GOP. \"Never Trump\" Republicans are now an important part of the \"common front\" against the MAGA movement, as the Harris campaign has clearly acknowledged with its launching of \"Republicans for Harris.\" And centrist Democrats -- of which there are a great many -- are a core constituency of the party. But the progressive wing of the Democratic party is equally central; it has been pivotal for the Biden administration's economic agenda and for its legislative success; and the successful mobilization of its supporters is essential to a Harris victory in November. Harris has demonstrated her savvy, and her leadership skills, by refusing to play against her own party's left, and by choosing a running mate -- Walz -- who is, in all honesty, capable of appealing to the party's diverse constituencies, while being as mainstream and middle America as they come.\n\nBut the main reason why Harris's choice of Walz is the right choice is much simpler: because it was Harris's choice to make, and she has made it.\n\nIn a matter of weeks, she has gone from being the running mate of a depressed and failing Biden campaign to being the dynamic leader of her own presidential campaign.

Tim Walz (D-MN) as her running mate, rather than Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA). While speaking to Hugh Hewitt earlier that same day, Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), the running mate for former and potentially future President Donald Trump, offered how he believes it relates to antisemitism.\n\nAs Hewitt mentioned at the end of interview, if the pick wasn't going to be Shapiro, \"I will be stunned.\" For days, it indeed looked like it was pretty much confirmed that Shapiro would be the pick.\n\nSpeaking about Walz, Hewitt offered that he \"makes Tim Kaine seem like Justin Timberlake, he's the most boring man in America, if it's not Josh Shapiro, and that's because he'll be Jewish and because he's a supporter of Israel.\" Hewitt then asked Vance, \"what does that tell you about the Democratic Party if it's not Josh Shapiro?\"\n\nVance was quick to note that he agreed with Hewitt. \"I think that they will have not picked Shapiro, frankly, out of the antisemitism in their own caucus, in their own party. I think it's disgraceful that Democrats have gotten to this point where it's even an open conversation. And it is an open conversation, Hugh.\"\n\nIn the days leading up to Harris' announcement, the far-left base of the Democratic Party made their opposition to Shapiro very clear. The governor even looked to be toning down his support for Israel as Tuesday loomed closer.\n\n\"I mean, even if it is Josh Shapiro, the guy has in some ways had to run away from a lot of his biography over the last few months because the far left doesn't like the fact that he is a Jewish-American,\" Vance pointed out. All that \"run[ning] away from\" looks to have been for nothing, then.\n\n\"Regardless of who the nominee is, Hugh, we're ready to take them on,\" Vance also assured Hewitt.\n\nAs the Republican nominee for vice president reminded, Harris has radical, extreme policies worth highlighting and calling out. This tactic from the Trump-Vance campaign is particularly critical, given that Harris has refused to give press conferences and the liberal mainstream media looks to be covering up for her.\n\n\"And it's Kamala Harris' policies that matter the most. She is the person who's worsened the inflation crisis. She is the person who's made groceries less affordable. Kamala Harris has made our country less safe, and Kamala Harris has opened the American Southern border. No running mate is going to allow her to run away from a really bad record for the American people. Do we want to give her a promotion, Hugh? I think the American people are going to say absolutely not. We should kick her out of office,\" Vance pointed out.\n\nNot only does it look like Walz won't be the running mate who will \"allow her to run away from a really bad record for the American people,\" but Harris has picked a running mate who is just as far-left as she is.\n\nOthers had similar takes, especially after Walz was indeed announced as the pick. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) also echoed those concerns. It wasn't just Republicans, though. CNN's Van Jones, as Matt highlighted earlier on Wednesday, also spoke out against Democrats bypassing a Jewish running mate.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_downs@townhall.com", "name": "Rebecca Downs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Hewitt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Hewitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Kaine", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Kaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Van Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mainstream media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Modern liberalism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern United States"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/214/40f8a93f-341d-4103-b00e-eb40da2ca085.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796608", "eventUri": "eng-9796608", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Tim Walz will spend their first full day as running mates Wednesday mobilizing Democrats in the Midwest, a politically divided region crucial to their attempt to capture the White House in less than three months.\n\nThe trip, which will start in Wisconsin before moving to Michigan, is aimed at cementing support among the younger, diverse, working-class voters who played a key role in helping President Joe Biden win the 2020 election. But that coalition showed signs of crumbling over the summer, particularly in Michigan, which has emerged as a flashpoint for Democratic division on Biden's handling of the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\nNow that Biden is out of the race and Harris is officially the Democratic nominee, leaders of the Arab-American community and key labor unions say they are encouraged by the choice. The addition of Walz to the ticket has put minds at ease some tensionsmaking it clear to some community leaders that Harris had heard concerns about another leading vice presidential candidate, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who they said had gone too far in his support for Israel.\n\n\"The party recognizes that there is a coalition that they need to rebuild,\" said Abdullah Hammoud, the mayor of Dearborn, Michigan. \"Electing Waltz is another sign of goodwill.\"\n\nWisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat seeking a third term, appeared with Harris at a campaign rally in suburban Milwaukee last month and said in a fundraising email Tuesday morning that she was \"thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the list.\"\n\nDonald Trump, in his choice for presidential election, placed a similar emphasis on appealing to voters in the Midwestern states. Senator JD Vance of Ohio as his vice presidential candidate. Vance will again headline the Harris-Walz ticket on Wednesday with appearances in the same states. He will begin his day in Michigan before heading to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, the same city where the Democratic candidates will appear hours later before heading to Michigan.\n\nIn Michigan, leaders say enthusiasm among Democrats has increased since Harris announced her candidacy.\n\nThat could be crucial in Detroit, which is nearly 80% black, where leaders warned for months State officials say voter apathy could cost them dearly in a city that has traditionally been a stronghold for their party. The Rev. Wendell Anthony, president of the Detroit chapter of the NAACP, said the excitement in the city now is \"astonishing.\" He compared it to Barack Obama's first presidential race in 2008, when voters lined up in long lines to help elect the nation's first black president.\n\nBut some Democratic leaders in Michigan worried that choosing the wrong running mate could slow momentum and fracture a coalition that was only recently formed. started to unite.\n\nArab American leaders who have a excessive influence in Michigan, because of their large presence in metro Detroit, had spoken out loudly and clearly against Shapiro for his previous comments about the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\n\nArab American leaders specifically pointed to a comment he made earlier this year about protests on college campuses, which they said unfairly compared the actions of student protesters to those of white supremacists. Shapiro, who is Jewish, has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while remaining a staunch supporter of Israel.\n\n\"It is certainly not anti-Semitic to criticize someone's position on Israeli policy,\" Hammoud said. \"That is simply called stewardship and accountability.\"\n\nIn addition to publicly expressing their concerns, the leaders also privately made their feelings known to the White House and Harris' team.\n\nOsama Siblani, publisher of the Dearborn-based Arab American News and a prominent leader in Michigan's large Muslim community, was among those who met with White House adviser Tom Perez in Michigan last week. Although Perez was in the state on official business, he has been in touch with some Dearborn leaders since he and other top officials traveled together with Biden to rebuild ties with the community.\n\nSiblani said he spoke with Perez for more than an hour on July 29 and told him that if Harris chose Shapiro, it would \"stop\" future talks. He also conveyed that message to Democratic lawmakers in Congress, including Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell.\n\nThe opposition from Arab Americans and labor leaders was \"not the only reason she didn't pick Shapiro, but it is one of the most important reasons,\" Siblani said.\n\n\"Not electing Shapiro is a very good step. It opens the door a little bit wider for us,\" said Siblani, who along with Hammoud stressed that any meaningful conversation must also include policy discussions.\n\nMichigan State Senator Jeremy Moss, who is Jewish, was excited about the prospect of Shapiro as a vice presidential nominee but was \"troubled\" by the criticism he received, as he believed many of the candidates vetted had similar views on Israel. He said he did not believe the criticism played a role in Harris' decision and that \"she's choosing someone based on this long-term perspective of who she can work with for four to eight years.\"\n\nStill, Moss said he's glad the Harris-Walz ticket isn't divisive and that the sense of unity among Democrats is \"felt on the ground.\"\n\nThe nation's largest auto workers union, the United Auto Workers, also closely followed the vice presidential election.\n\nShe moved to endorse Harris soon after replacing Biden, and UAW President Shawn Fain said publicly that she had the right to choose her own running mate. But he also said the union, which has 370,000 members and a huge presence in Michigan and other Midwestern states, did not support Shapiro, who had previously joined Republicans in Pennsylvania to call for an expansion of voucher programs that allow government taxpayer money to flow to private schools.\n\nFain had singled out Walz -- among other candidates -- in an Aug. 2 interview with The Associated Press, saying the Minnesota governor was a \"brilliant, sharp guy.\" In a statement Tuesday, Fain said Walz would be a \"great vice president\" and that he \"has supported working people every step of the way.\"\n\nDingell, a Democrat with deep connections in Dearborn who has brokered a series of talks between Biden administration officials and leaders of core Michigan constituencies, echoed those sentiments Tuesday. She said picking Walz would only heighten the excitement at Wednesday's rally in Detroit.\n\n\"We have someone from the Midwest, from the heartland, who really understands our issues,\" Dingell said. \"And he'll be a partner to her. She won't have to look over her shoulder every two minutes. He'll be a total, real partner.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Tom Krisher in Detroit and Isabella Volmert in Lansing, Michigan contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri":

He is starting his day in Michigan before heading to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, the same city where the Democratic candidates will appear hours later before going to Michigan.\n\nIn Michigan, leaders say Democratic enthusiasm has surged since Ms Harris announced her candidacy.\n\nThat could be pivotal in Detroit, which is nearly 80% black, where leaders for months had warned administration officials that voter apathy could cost them in a city that is typically a stronghold for their party.\n\nRev Wendell Anthony, president of the NAACP Detroit branch, said the excitement in the city now is \"mind-blowing\".\n\nHe likened it to Barack Obama's first run for president in 2008, when voters waited in long queues to help elect the nation's first black president.\n\nThe nation's largest auto workers' union, the United Auto Workers, also watched the vice presidential choice carefully.\n\nThey moved to endorse Ms Harris quickly after she stepped in to replace Biden, and UAW President Shawn Fain said publicly that she had a right to choose her own running mate. But he also said the union, which has 370,000 members and a huge presence in Michigan and other Midwestern states, didn't favour Mr Shapiro, who had previously joined with Pennsylvania Republicans in calling for an expansion of voucher programmes that allow public tax dollars to flow to private schools.\n\nMr Fain had singled out Mr Walz - in addition to other candidates - for praise in an interview on August 2, saying the Minnesota governor was a \"brilliant guy, sharp guy\".\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Fain said Walz will make a \"great vice president\" and that he has \"stood with the working class every step of the way\".", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris",

Josh Shapiro as her running mate.\n\nOn Tuesday, Harris announced that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will join her on the Democrat presidential ticket. Ironically, the pick thrilled Republicans. Walz is both radical and unknown, which means the Trump campaign can use him to highlight Harris' extremism. For instance, he was governor while Minneapolis burned in 2020 during the George Floyd riots and delayed bringing in the National Guard. He required Minnesota public schools to put tampons in boys' bathrooms. His first executive order as governor created a DEI council.\n\nEven his military service includes a major scandal. Despite being the top-ranked enlisted soldier in his battalion, he quit when his unit was ordered to mobilize to Iraq. He lost rank over it. On top of that, Minnesota is a solid blue state.\n\nOn Monday, Reuters reported that the final two candidates were Walz and Shapiro. On paper, Shapiro would have been a stronger pick. He's cultivated a more moderate reputation, although he's plenty radical too. Pennsylvania is a must-win state, and Shapiro enjoys strong approval ratings.\n\nLast week, it looked as if Shapiro was the favorite. But then the Hamas wing of the Democrat Party made it clear they opposed picking an observant Jew.\n\nLeftists launched a \"No genocide Josh\" campaign. \"Anti-Israel activists don't want him on the Democratic ticket,\" The Atlantic reported last week. \"He's Jewish,\" CNN's John King noted last month, \"There could be some risk in putting him on the ticket.\"\n\nCNN commentator Van Jones, a liberal who once worked in the Obama White House, laid out the reasons Harris didn't pick Shapiro. One was the \"antisemitism that's gotten marbled into this party,\" he said.\n\nBut aside from Jones, few Democrats are willing to call out the antisemites in their party. Worse, Democrats' electoral hopes hinge on turning out Hamas supporters in Michigan. Tragically, supporting Israel and opposing antisemitism is fast becoming a partisan issue.\n\nWhat happened in Virginia City over the weekend makes this contrast even starker. A viral video appeared to show a white man making racist comments to an African American man. Assuming the video is accurate, the white guy said vile things, including a comment about a hanging tree. He was widely and rightly condemned, by Republicans and Democrats.\n\nWhile he doesn't have time to ensure his office responds to records requests, Democrat Attorney General Ford spends quite a bit of time on X. He wrote, \"We can have no tolerance for this type of racist behavior in Nevada. Or anywhere.\"\n\nIf only. At UNLV, openly screaming for the murder of Jews gets you a meeting with President Keith Whitfield. Disrupting an Israeli physics professor leads to UNLV police escorting the professor off campus. Ford and other Democrats were much less interested in condemning those incidents, even though they happened on public property and involved many more people.\n\nAnd the country just saw the left smear Harris' potential VP pick because he was Jewish.\n\nDemocrats love to babble on about diversity and inclusion. But the disparity in reaction here shows there's a form of hate most Democrats are afraid to hate.", "source": {"uri": "reviewjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Review-Journal"},

(AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will spend their first full day as running mates on Wednesday rallying Democrats across the Midwest, a politically divided region that is crucial to their effort to win the White House in less than three months.\n\nThe trip, which begins in Wisconsin before shifting to Michigan, is aimed at shoring up support among the younger, diverse, labor-friendly voters who were instrumental in helping President Joe Biden win the 2020 election. But that coalition showed signs of fraying over the summer, particularly in Michigan, which has emerged as a focal point of Democratic divisions over Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nWith Biden now out of the race and Harris officially the Democratic nominee, leaders of the Arab American community and key unions say they are encouraged by the choice. Walz's addition to the ticket has soothed some tensions, signaling to some community leaders that Harris heard concerns about another leading contender for the vice presidential slot, Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, who they felt had gone too far in his support for Israel.\n\n\"The party is recognizing that there's a coalition they have to rebuild,\" said Abdullah Hammoud, the mayor of Dearborn, Michigan. \"Picking Walz is another sign of good faith.\"\n\nWisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat seeking a third term, appeared with Harris at a campaign stop there last month in suburban Milwaukee, and said in a fundraising email Tuesday morning that she was \"thrilled to see a fellow Midwesterner at the top of the ticket.\"\n\nDonald Trump had put a similar emphasis on appealing to voters in Midwestern states with his choice of Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his vice presidential pick. Vance will again bracket the Harris-Walz ticket with appearances in the same states on Wednesday. He is starting his day in Michigan before heading to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, the same city where the Democratic candidates will appear hours later before going to Michigan.\n\nIn Michigan, leaders say Democratic enthusiasm has surged since Harris announced her candidacy.\n\nThat could be pivotal in Detroit, which is nearly 80% Black, where leaders for months had warned administration officials that voter apathy could cost them in a city that's typically a stronghold for their party. Rev. Wendell Anthony, president of the NAACP Detroit branch, said the excitement in the city now is \"mind-blowing.\" He likened it to Barack Obama's first run for president in 2008, when voters waited in long lines to help elect the nation's first Black president.\n\nBut some Democratic leaders in Michigan had grown concerned that choosing the wrong running mate could slow that momentum and fracture a coalition that has only recently started to unify.\n\nArab American leaders, who hold an outsized influence in Michigan due to a large presence in metro Detroit, had been vocal in their opposition to Shapiro due to his past comments regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nArab American leaders specifically pointed to a comment he made earlier this year regarding protests on university campuses, which they felt unfairly compared the actions of student protesters to those of white supremacists. Shapiro, who is Jewish, has criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while remaining a staunch supporter of Israel.\n\n\"It's certainly not antisemitic to critique somebody's position on Israeli policy,\" Hammoud said. \"That's just called stewardship and accountability.\"\n\nIn addition to expressing those concerns publicly, leaders had also made their feelings known privately to the White House and Harris' team.\n\nOsama Siblani, the publisher of the Dearborn-based Arab American News and a prominent leader in Michigan's large Muslim community, was among those who met with White House adviser Tom Perez in Michigan last week. Although Perez was in the state on official business, he has maintained contact with some Dearborn leaders since he and other top officials traveled there with Biden in an effort to mend ties with the community.\n\nSiblani said he met with Perez for over an hour on July 29 and told him that if Harris chose Shapiro, it would \"shut down\" future conversations. He also conveyed this message to Democratic lawmakers in Congress, including Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell.\n\nPushback from Arab Americans and union leaders was \"not the only reason why she did not pick Shapiro, but it is one of the major reasons,\" said Siblani.\n\n\"Not picking Shapiro is a very good step. It cracks the door open a little more for us,\" said Siblani, who along with Hammoud emphasized that any meaningful conversations must include policy discussions.\n\nMichigan state Sen. Jeremy Moss, who is Jewish, was excited by the prospect of having Shapiro as a vice presidential candidate but was \"disturbed\" by the criticism he received, believing that many of the vetted candidates had similar views on Israel. He said he didn't believe the criticism played a role in Harris' decision and that \"she's choosing somebody based on this long game of who she can work with for four to eight years.\"\n\nStill, Moss said he is glad the Harris-Walz ticket is not divisive and that the feeling of unity among Democrats is \"palpable on the ground.\"\n\nThe nation's largest auto workers' union, the United Auto Workers, also watched the vice presidential choice carefully.\n\nThey moved to endorse Harris quickly after she stepped in to replace Biden, and UAW President Shawn Fain said publicly that she had a right to choose her own running mate. But he also said the union, which has 370,000 members and a huge presence in Michigan and other Midwestern states, didn't favor Shapiro, who had previously joined with Pennsylvania Republicans in calling for an expansion of voucher programs that allow public tax dollars to flow to private schools.\n\nFain had singled out Walz -- in addition to other candidates -- for praise in an interview with The Associated Press on Aug. 2, saying the Minnesota governor was a \"brilliant guy, sharp guy.\" In a statement Tuesday, Fain said Walz will make a \"great vice president\" and that he has \"stood with the working class every step of the way.\"\n\nDingell, a Democrat with deep connections in Dearborn who has brokered some of the conversations between Biden administration officials and leaders of core constituencies in Michigan, echoed those sentiments Tuesday. She said the choice of Walz would only ramp up excitement at Wednesday's rally in Detroit.\n\n\"We got somebody from the Midwest, from the heartland, that really understands our issues,\" said Dingell. \"And he will be a partner to her. She won't have to look over her shoulder every two minutes. He will be a total, true partner.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Tom Krisher in Detroit and Isabella Volmert in Lansing, Michigan contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

What now for Pennsylvania?", "body": "Governor Josh Shapiro speaks with press along with Vice President Kamala Harris during their visit to Little Thai Market at Reading Terminal Market in Philadelphia on July 13, 2024.\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro will not be the vice president of the United States. At least, he won't be on the ticket this year.\n\nThe Democratic nominee and current VP Kamala Harris unveiled her running mate pick after two weeks of speculation. The honor went to Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota -- not exactly a household name in the Keystone State.\n\nShapiro's name started as almost a what-if. He was mentioned more than a little by pundits during speculation about a potential replacement for President Joe Biden after the disastrous June debate. He quickly moved to the short list of potential partners for Harris. Over the weekend, he was named as one of three people being vetted for the most important job interview in the country.\n\nThe interest was no surprise. Pennsylvania is the most important swing state in a country that pivots on electoral votes. The Keystone State has picked the winner in all but seven presidential elections since 1900. That's 77% of the time.\n\nOhio has a more consistent history of siding with the winner. It voted against Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944, John F. Kennedy in 1960 and Biden in 2020. But Ohio has become less swingy and more of a highly predictable lean.\n\nThat's why former president and GOP nominee Donald Trump's pick of Sen. J.D. Vance does little to shore up his candidacy. Vance is from a state that is already highly likely to vote for Trump. Ohio has Republican super majorities in its Senate and House and has had only two Democratic governors since 1975. Vance reflects Trump. He doesn't change minds.\n\nWith Shapiro, Harris had an opportunity to move her chess pieces in a way that might recruit. He is more popular in Pennsylvania than his predecessor, Tom Wolf. He was liked as attorney general before winning the 2022 governor's race. He deals with his opponents rather than goading them to sue him. He worked alongside Trump impeachment lawyer Bruce Castor when the two were Montgomery County commissioners.\n\nCould all that make him more valuable to the Democrats in Pennsylvania than on the campaign trail? Is that why Harris went to the Land of 10,000 Lakes for her sidekick?\n\nShapiro may have good numbers in Pennsylvania, but he's also complicated. He's a deal-maker, but some of those deals -- namely the school voucher issue with the 2023 budget -- have rankled his own party. There is the question of support of Israel at a challenging time given the war in Gaza. There's U.S. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Braddock, reported as feeling Shapiro is too \"ambitious.\"", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_Terminal_Market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reading Terminal Market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Josh Shapiro was a deliberate choice by Vice President Kamala Harris to overlook the moderate vote, a former presidential adviser told \"On Balance with Leland Vittert.\"\n\nMark Penn, an adviser to Bill Clinton's 1996 campaign and current president of The Stagwell Group, believes Shapiro was an ideal candidate who was overlooked to avoid angering far-left, pro-Palestinian Democrats.\n\nOn Tuesday, Harris announced her pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, before rallying with him in Philadelphia. Walz has previously shared his belief in a \"lasting two-state solution\" and providing Palestinian aid, starkly different than Shapiro's own opinions.\n\nAs the United States moves more troops to the Middle East and tensions rise among Israeli and Iranian leaders amid the Israel-Hamas war, Penn thinks America's Jewish population would have felt safer under a Harris-Shapiro ticket.\n\n\"I think they would have felt more reassured if Shapiro, the logical choice, had been picked to be vice president,\" Penn said, calling Walz's nomination a \"puzzling\" decision.\n\nBut the Democratic ticket isn't the only pairing he finds problems with. The Trump-Vance campaign, he said, is another example of politicians choosing like-minded partners rather than expanding the vote with more moderate-leaning running mates.\n\n\"Both Trump's campaign and Harris' campaign now doubled down on the base in their vice presidential picks and did not go for the center,\" he told NewsNation. \"Yeah, it's perplexing.\"\n\nThough Penn referred to Minnesota Gov.

With 95% of the vote counted, St. Louis County prosecutor Wesley Bell took 51% of the vote, a clear five points ahead of Bush. Most notably, it was the matter of Israel that ostensibly sunk her campaign, which could signify an issue for the Harris/Walz ticket this November.\n\nIn late June, fellow Squad member Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) suffered an ousting at the hands of pro-Israel Democrat George Latimer. It was Bowman's stance on the events of October 7 and his subsequent obfuscation on blame and responsibility that caused a grand coalition of his party to back the challenger. And the same appears to be true for Ms. Bush.\n\n\"Israel's collective punishment against Palestinians for Hamas' actions is a war crime,\" she stated just days after the deadly attack. It was these words and her subsequent stance that brought the ire of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) lobbying group and its funding arm, the United Democracy Project. The outfit piled an estimated $8.5 million into the race - although the conflict was not the sole focal point of the anti-Bush campaign.\n\nSo, the Democratic Party hierarchy, funding groups, policy committees, and, of course, a significant swath of voters all appear divided over the correct political posture regarding the war in Israel: a lesson that could be crucial in light of Vice President Kamala Harris' recent choice of running mate.\n\nPicking Minnesota Governor Tim Walz to join her 2024 ticket raised eyebrows among the chattering classes in the media - and notably - cheers from the Trump Campaign team. It was not entirely the Walz decision that caused consternation but rather why Harris would not opt for Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. As Liberty Nation News' Senior Political Analyst Tim Donner astutely observed:\n\n\"Evidently fearful that Shapiro being Jewish, pro-Israel, pro-fracking, and pro-school choice would cost her too much support among her progressive faithful, Vice President Harris doubled down on her far-left image by selecting a progressive who has supported many of the radical policies Harris championed in 2020 but has since renounced.\"\n\nAs Harris and Walz took to the stage in Philadelphia, PA, Governor Shapiro offered his support for the ticket, but not without a veiled swipe. \"I am proud of my faith . . . I lean on my family, and I lean on my faith, which calls me to serve,\" he said. Reading between the lines, it seems that Mr. Shapiro feels it was his Jewish faith that kept him from the coveted position. It is worth noting that Democrat-aligned activist groups worked to keep him from earning the nod in a vitriolic campaign that dubbed him \"Genocide Josh\" for his support of Israel.\n\nIt appears that the Harris campaign has been working out the electoral sums: Will having a Jewish man at the top of the ticket alienate the millions of Muslim and Arab Americans who normally vote Democrat? And further, will dropping Shapiro out of contention cost her the margin needed in the must-win swing state?\n\nDuring President Biden's primary campaign, a demographic warning shot was fired across his re-election bow. In Michigan, an effort backed by fellow Squad member Rashida Tlaib sought to give Biden pause in his support for Israel as a US ally by mustering an \"uncommitted\" movement that ultimately saw more than 13% - over one hundred thousand - Michiganders withhold their endorsement. A similar \"write-in\" effort took place in Pennsylvania, which accrued over 60,000 ballots.\n\nBiden won Pennsylvania in 2020 by just 80,000 votes and Michigan by a little over 150,000. To say that these uncommitted protest voters could make a difference in 2024 is a huge understatement. And this applies equally so now that Kamala Harris is top of the ticket.\n\nThe far-left Squad radicals are in a weaker position today than they were last year, with their numbers cut by at least 40% going into the next Congress. The ousting of Bowman and Bush for their stances on Israel and the Palestinian cause could prove to be the early symptoms of a Democratic Party disease that weakens the Harris campaign, and it is a malaise that may have been supercharged by her decision to choose Minnesota's Walz over Pennsylvania's Shapiro.", "source": {"uri": "libertynation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liberty Nation"},

Tim Walz (D) as her running mate.\n\nJohnson -- who is criss-crossing the country campaigning with House candidates this month -- offered remarks on Walz and Harris, and discussed his quest to expand the GOP's majority and retain the gavel next year.\n\nHe also commented on former President Trump's performance at the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) convention, detailed his thoughts on the upcoming government funding deadline and spoke about how he spends his rare off-time with family.\n\nThe conversation has been edited for clarity.\n\nQ: Does Walz as the VP pick make it easier or harder for Republicans to run against the Democratic ticket?\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (R-La.): \"It makes it easier for us. He is a far-left candidate and choice. I frankly thought that she might try to choose a moderate, but obviously she has proven once again who she is. We refer to Kamala Harris as a San Francisco radical because she is. When she was in the Senate, infamously she had the most liberal voting record of anybody, even more than Bernie Sanders.\n\nAnd that's who she is. That's who her positions are, she has radical positions that do not line up with the American people, and I think the choice of Walz, I think just further verifies that. I mean, he's on record in support of socialism and sanctuary cities and he wants to give driver's licenses to illegal aliens. I mean, you know, these positions are not going to rest well with the American people. So our challenges in the election cycle is to make those positions known and not let them obscure, try to obscure their record, which they're already attempting to do.\n\nAnd the more that Kamala talks the better off we are. I think they recognize that so they're trying to keep her hidden and keep her on a teleprompter and very scripted. And we have a window of time to ensure that the American people are fully informed about who they really are.\"\n\nQ: Do you know Walz at all? You overlapped for two years in the House.\n\nJohnson: \"We've met but I don't know him well. That was a busy two years for us. Look, it's not personal. I've made it very clear, and you probably heard me say this on the hill before we left for the district work period, that this is a campaign about policies and not personalities, and you have to look at the policy positions.\n\nWe're in a very dangerous time, probably as dangerous as at least the World War II era, if not more. The economy is in dire straits, the border is wide open, we have instability everywhere. And everyone needs to evaluate these two tickets and what their policies would mean for their own families.\n\nAnd I think if you look at it objectively, clearly the Republican platform and positions and plans is much better than the alternative.\"\n\nQ: Early GOP commentary on the Walz selection is that this is a sigh of relief, suggesting folks were nervous about [Pennsylvania Gov.] Josh Shapiro being chosen. Do you agree this is a sigh of relief, and if so, why?\n\nJohnson: \"Clearly Shapiro would have been a smarter choice for her, but I didn't expect that she would do it because she has proven, once again, to be true to her principles and her priorities, and they're not aligned with the American people.\n\nAnd I think the choice of Walz is a clear sign of that. They have no intention of moderating. They would double down on the failed policies of the Biden-Harris administration. Harris, by nature, is far more progressive and radical than Joe Biden is, and now she'll have a willing accomplice. I think that has a clear danger for the American people.\"\n\nQ: Some folks said [Pennsylvania Gov.] Josh Shapiro would be a smart pick for VP in the lead-up to Harris's decision, citing his high approval rating in Pennsylvania. But there was some pushback to his candidacy from the left because of his position on Israel. Shapiro's Democratic supporters have argued that he faced that criticism because he is Jewish, noting that his stance on the war in Gaza is similar to other VP contenders. Do you see Harris not picking Shapiro as at all being fueled by his Judaism?\n\nJohnson: \"I think that clearly was a major factor, is that she was reluctant to put a vice presidential nominee on a ticket with Jewish heritage because they're having a split in the Democratic Party. They have a pro-Palestinian, in some cases pro-Hamas wing of the Democratic Party. I mean, think of this and the implications of it, I think, are profound.\n\nThe very first decision that Kamala Harris made after she was coronated the new prospective nominee of the party was to boycott the Netanyahu address to Congress. And that was stunning to me. I mean, she was supposed to be sitting next to me at the rostrum behind the prime minister and she chose to go deliver a speech to a sorority instead. I mean, to me, I could not believe that she made that decision because it showed once again how they have appeased, the Biden-Harris administration has appeased Iran and the enemies of Israel, and questions and challenged Israel, who's our critical ally, and they've done so because they have a division in their party and they don't know what to do about it.\n\nAnd so I, sadly for Josh Shapiro, because of his heritage I think he was, I think that is the reason he was overlooked.\"\n\nQ: Are there antisemitism undertones there?\n\nJohnson: \"I'm not gonna call it that because I don't -- I just know that that was a major factor. I think it was transparently a major factor. And I think they made a political decision that is sad and I think they'll regret it.\"\n\nQ: Will House Republicans fare better in November with Harris at the top of the ticket, and Walz now in the No. 2 spot?\n\nJohnson: \"I like the match-up now. I'm pleased, for our purposes, that she chose Walz because they can't hide from their record and I don't think it's gonna resonate with the people. We were on trajectory, prior to all of the developments of the last few weeks, to have a decisive victory in both the House and the Senate for the Republican Party. I believe that we still are on that trajectory.\n\nThe latest polling I think The Hill and Decision Desk this morning has Trump still leading over Kamala in five of eight swing states, so we're still on the right trajectory. And the more that our candidates and our incumbents are out there talking with the people this month about the answers that we have for all these great challenges facing the country, the contrast, the stark contrast between the two parties and the platforms, and these policies and what they mean, I think we're in very good position to have a really great election. I'm very bullish about November.\"\n\nQ: You're embarking on a 20-state swing this month. How's that going? We're in Manhattan right now -- is New York the centerpiece of your effort to keep and expand the House majority?\n\nJohnson: \"New York is critical to our majority, as is California and some of the other swing states. We have extraordinary incumbents in these districts and they're running fantastic re-election campaigns. That has been very rewarding to see. They're outworking their opponents and in many cases they're raising more money. And this has been encouraging because they have the right message and they have the right tone and they know their communities, they know their districts, they're presenting a very compelling case for why they need to be re-elected.\n\nAnd consequently, I believe all of our incumbents will be re-elected, and I also believe we'll be able to flip some of these seats. One of them here in New York is Allison Esposito, and that's the Ryan seat. She's got a great chance of winning that. She was Lee Zeldin's running mate, when he ran for governor, as lieutenant governor, and she's a former NYPD police officer with a great personal story.\n\nSo you have candidates like that that are of high quality, they have the right message, the right tone, I think this can be a great year for us. And I've been traveling nonstop. So far, I think we've done campaign events in I think it's 147 cities so far, 32 states. There'll be 20 additional states in August, and eight of them we're visiting for the first time.\n\nSo I'm trying to be everywhere because that's a Speaker's role at a time like this. And we're spending a lot of time in swing districts and blue states, and what we find there is that we have a, almost a demographic shift I think that's happening in the electorate, where we have a record number of Hispanic and Latino voters and Black and African American voters and the Jewish community is very energized right now.\n\nAll these people moving into the Republican camp because they're looking for answers to all the challenges they're facing. And we will provide that, and we have a record to show it, and I think that's going to give us a very strong election cycle.\"\n\nQ: Do you have a prediction of how many seats you'll pick up in November?\n\nJohnson: \"I don't want to handicap it. I do think that we will have a dramatic improvement in our numbers. I mean, I had a one-vote margin, so. I think we'll have a sizable majority.\n\nI do not expect, nor does anyone, I don't think, who's paying attention, a 35- or 40-seat majority. It's not possible anymore because the number of swing districts has been reduced dramatically due to gerrymandering and redistricting. But I think we can have an exponential increase in our majority and I think that'll be very helpful.\n\nI expect that we'll have a Republican majority in the Senate, and I expect to have Donald Trump back in the White House. So if we have unified government, what we're also planning in the midst of all this is a very aggressive first 100 days agenda for the Congress.\n\nAnd as I've told my colleagues and I've said to President Trump multiple times, we could have the most consequential presidency and Congress of the modern era if we win all this because we have to fix everything. The Biden Harris administration has made a mess of every area of public policy.\"\n\nQ: There are less than three months to go until Election Day. What's one piece of friendly advice you have for Trump in the final sprint to the election?\n\nJohnson: \"I've had conversations with him, even in recent days, about the campaign and our message, and I believe that he understands and agrees with my assessment that this is a contest between policies and not personalities. And the more that we highlight Kamala Harris's actual record -- not the rhetoric, but the record -- I think that serves us well and will serve the country.\"\n\nQ: You mentioned policies and not personalities -- what did you make of Trump comments about Vice President Harris at the [National Association of Black Journalists] conference?\n\nJohnson: \"I didn't see the whole interview. I saw some of the highlights. I think that all of us need to be very disciplined about keeping this to the record. The interesting thing about this presidential cycle is unlike any since I think the late 1800s, is that you have two people who have actually served.\n\nYou had a Trump administration, and we have had a Biden-Harris administration. So it behooves us, because those records are so starkly contrast to highlight the records, and there's not a single American who can objectively answer that they're doing better right now under the Harris team than they were under the Trump administration.\n\nWe had the greatest economy in the history of the world. Every single demographic was doing better. We had no hot wars around the globe, we had liberty, opportunity, security for everyone.\n\nAnd then the Biden-Harris team came in and did the opposite of what Trump did, and these are the effects. So the more we talk about that, the better off we are.\"\n\nQ: What's your relationship like with Vice President Harris? When was the last time you spoke with her? And if the Democratic ticket wins, will you be able to work well with her? On what issues do you see common ground?\n\nJohnson: \"I give great effort to work with anyone. I don't think that'll be the eventuality, but I don't know her well. The most time we spend together is standing at the rostrum at State of the Unions and joint addresses. I've visited with her there. Politics to me is not personal and our Democratic, political opponents are not enemies.\n\nI don't see them that way. And it's not personal. My problem with Kamala Harris is her political positions and philosophy, and I think it's dangerous for the country. And so I think we have an obligation to ensure that she's not in the White House.\"\n\nQ: You've said you want to be the leader of House Republicans next year and you're hoping that's in the capacity as Speaker. But you still have some detractors in the GOP conference. How much of a cushion do you think you need to remain Speaker next year?\n\nJohnson: \"I don't know. I think the group will be much more unified going into next year if we have a successful November, I'm working really hard to make sure that that happens. And what we're planning right now is we're designing a very aggressive playbook for the legislative agenda in the new Congress.\n\nAnd I believe that continuity will be very important in terms of leadership because the playbook, having been designed, it now has to be executed. I think everyone understands, all members of the conference understand, the stakes are so very high, and we have a huge responsibility on our hands, and I don't think there's going to be a big appetite for a lot of internal drama. So I think all those factors weigh in favor of maintaining stability in the leadership. And so I expect that's what's going to happen.\n\nI don't know what that comes down to for vote tally. But I was the first Republican Speaker, I think in several decades, to have been elected Speaker unanimously by my party. But governing is hard. We've been in a very difficult period, we had some very difficult things to do, as I told the team, we pulled ourselves through a very difficult valley but it's much brighter on the other side.\n\nSo I'm an optimist, and I think we'll be able to pull everybody together and we'll have great unity going forward. And I believe we're going to win the White House, the Senate and the House, so I think there'll be a lot of energy and excitement behind that.\"\n\nQ: When Congress returns in September it will be roughly two months until the election. How do you plan to fund the government and avert a shutdown? Congress will need to pass a CR -- will it last until December or into next year?\n\nJohnson: \"I'm thinking about all those alternatives. We're having some very thoughtful discussion about the pros and cons of the various strategies on it, and that decision is not yet determined, but it will be very soon.\"\n\nQ: Will you commit to averting a shutdown in November?\n\nJohnson: \"I don't think it would behoove the country to have a shutdown in September so we hope to avoid that. I think most people agree that that's the right thing.\"\n\nQ: There will obviously need to be a CR in September, right?\n\nJohnson: \"I don't think anything's obvious. We have funded 73 percent of the government so far in the approps process. The Senate hasn't moved anything, that's our challenge. The House has been doing our job. So we'll see how all that comes together. We go back in September, we'll have a very aggressive legislative agenda, one way or the other, and we'll see what's possible.\"\n\nQ: Final question. Former Speaker John Boehner loves golf and merlot. Former Speaker Paul Ryan likes fitness. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell is into horse racing. How do you unwind? What are your hobbies?\n\nJohnson: \"I don't have time for hobbies. I'm a Speaker that still has kids of the age where they're in sports and that kind of thing. My oldest daughter is about to complete law school, my second daughter is about to begin law school, my son has just begun at the Naval Academy, and then our fourth child is 13.\n\nAnd so any available time that I have had in the last several years has been devoted to ball games and kids activities and that's where I find my great joy. I haven't had time for any of my own hobbies in several years.\"\n\nQ: Are you the dad in the stands yelling if there's a bad call or a point is missing from the scoreboard?\n\nJohnson: \"I don't get too animated at ball games because everybody's looking at me these days. But we enjoy that. I just enjoy my family, time with my family, and I don't get enough of it these days. So if I had a spare Saturday I would never go to a golf course. So it would be with my kids. That's my priority. That's been what I'm about.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mychael_schnell@thehill.com", "name": "Mychael Schnell", "type":

Tim Walz -- who, I will freely admit, I had never heard of until like two weeks ago -- is Kamala Harris' choice for vice-president.\n\nAnd uh ... I kind of wish she went with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.\n\nI'll get to Walz in a minute, but let's start with what Harris and the Democrats lose by not picking Shapiro.\n\nFor starters (and most obviously) it makes it that much more difficult to win Pennsylvania. Have to think Shapiro would've delivered it. But honestly, I don't even think that's the most important reason why Shapiro would've been a better pick.\n\nI think it's because the Dems missed a chance to have a pair of former attorney generals on top of the ticket.\n\nAnd these aren't exactly a pair of wallflowers -- one of the loony left's biggest gripes against Harris was the fact she was too tough on crime and too soft on police as San Francisco's district attorney and later as California's attorney general.\n\nBut yes: Two people who have spent a career putting bad guys in jail and who are clearly police-friendly are on top of the ticket. The party would've loved this!\n\nAnd by \"the party\" I mean the Republicans. In a 2023 Gallup poll, 78% of Republicans say crime is a \"major\" problem in America, compared to just 51% of Democrats.\n\nYou'd think on-the-fence Republicans would've been over the moon with the Harris/Shapiro ticket. After all, they fight crime while their opponent, former President Donald Trump, gets convicted of them (hey-yo!).\n\nOf course, I'm not exactly holding my breath for my fellow Republicans (yes, I am a registered Republican, always have been) to all of a sudden realize this. But it wouldn't have made it any less true.\n\nAnd I would expect -- even without Shapiro -- this fact to get played up as we get closer to Election Day.\n\nThe roadmap to victory is painfully obvious for both sides. Win Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. These three states have voted in lockstep in the last five presidential elections, four times for Democrats (Trump in 2016 in the outlier).\n\nWin those states, win the election. (Yes, there's another path for Harris, the Sun Belt strategy, but the \"Blue Wall\" is the clearest and most obvious path.)\n\nAnd in those three states, it's abundantly clear -- at least to me -- who is going to decide the election: Non-evangelical working class white people who nominally think of themselves as Republicans but probably voted for Biden in 2020.\n\nThat's it. That's the whole shooting match.\n\nAnd with a campaign with two former attorney generals on the ticket, they really could've hammered the anti-crime message home.\n\nInstead, Harris gets Walz, and is going after the same non-evangelical working class white person vote. But instead of using crime as the wedge, the hope (clearly) is using Walz's honest-to-goodness non-evangelical working class whiteness to connect with that voter. (He will probably use the term \"the whole shooting match.\")\n\nWalz -- an Army man, a retired Social Studies teacher, plain-spoken all-American type -- is an appealing character.

Tim Walz will be her vice presidential running mate. Some see him as the \"safer\" choice, but not perhaps the best pick or the most inspired. Harris is apparently adhering to the old political maxim that the most important thing about picking a VP running mate is to \"do no harm\" and seemingly, to her, Walz better fits this description than does Josh Shapiro. Harris, in not picking Shapiro, has apparently judged that him being governor of the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania is less important than him possibly being seen as controversial.\n\nWalz is undeniably a solid pick -- an unassuming, witty, and funny guy. All positive attributes in a vice president and in a running mate. Harris-Walz, sounds like a musical composition from Johann Strauss, and hopefully they will indeed make beautiful music together. There's little doubt that Democrats will quickly accept Walz's selection and rally around the duo. It surely feels now like these two will give the Democrats an excellent chance to defeat the Republican Trump-Vance ticket in November. Now, onto the election!\n\nKen Derow, Swarthmore\n\nAs a news junkie, Josh Shapiro fan, and born and raised Philadelphian, I lay awake throughout the night hoping that Shapiro would be Harris' pick for vice president. But when he wasn't, and when my disappointment had dissipated, I realized that he wasn't the right choice because he's not vice presidential material -- he's presidential material. You can't outshine the leader, no matter if it's business, politics, or a relationship. With a 61% approval rating in the state, Shapiro will continue as a rising star. For now, glad he's our governor.\n\nAnne Scardino, Philadelphia\n\nI am troubled by the particular scrutiny Gov. Josh Shapiro faced in the past week as a vice presidential possibility. After the Philly Palestine Coalition announced its boycott of \"Zionist\" businesses last fall, Shapiro supported Jewish-owned restaurants in Philadelphia because he was concerned about rising hate and polarization, not because he agreed with Israel's actions. As The Inquirer's Dec. 5 editorial stated well, Shapiro was \"right to call out protesters who harassed Goldie,\" a restaurant owned by Israeli-born Michael Solomonov. Shapiro immediately inserted himself in Center City and took a stance against hate.\n\nActivist Susan Abulhawa's lengthy letter to the editor distorts Shapiro's defense of Philadelphia's Jewish community in the wake of unprecedented boycotts that targeted a particular group of people based on ethnic origin. This situation eerily echoed the events of 1933 and Shapiro had the moral clarity to proclaim it while it was unpopular to do so in certain Democratic circles. I was proud of him for being a voice for many frightened Jews, like myself. In these contentious times, it is crucial to elect a politician with a gift for uniting people, whether it's Shapiro or another worthy candidate.\n\nSarena Snider, Philadelphia\n\nKudos to President Joe Biden for his diplomatic success in bringing American captives Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan home from Russia. They were real hostages, deserving of their freedom, unlike the convicted rioters serving time for the attempted coup at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, whom Donald Trump ludicrously refers to as hostages.\n\nVin Morabito, Scranton\n\nTwo great Sunday pieces in The Inquirer about the work of women in Philadelphia are inspiring and very telling: women are amazing! I knew this all along and I hope our country will recognize it, too. In her op-ed, Jasmine Schley, a lifelong resident and landlord in Philadelphia, describes her dedication to making the city better, block by block, and she is doing it. She is making a difference rehab by rehab, neighbor by neighbor. It is not always easy, but it is ultimately rewarding as she has created friendships through handling concerns and even throwing block parties, with neighbors ultimately becoming friends.\n\nIn the Philly & Region section, reporter Ellie Rushing describes the dedicated work of the \"Old Lady Gang,\" the women of Harrowgate Park who are determined to patrol the green space and keep it safe and clean for neighbors and their children. It is risky business, but as Sandy Wells, 70, said, \"We had no choice.\" Their work has performed a transformation of a very dangerous place to one of tranquillity, gatherings, relaxation, natural beauty, and just plain fun. Thank you for telling these stories and thank you to these wonderful women demonstrating the difference they can make in our world.\n\nSheila Withelder, Glen Mills\n\nIn case you forgot, let me remind you. A few weeks ago -- on a sweltering Saturday afternoon in South Philly -- a historic Philly baseball team put on a dominating show that included eight home runs and eighteen RBIs. That team was not the Philadelphia Phillies. Beginning in 2025, the Oakland Athletics will call West Sacramento home. In 2028, they will move yet again to Las Vegas. Still donning the iconic elephant logo on their sleeves, the Athletics' history began in Philadelphia.\n\nConnie Mack's baseball team -- who created a dynasty in the building with his name etched above the entrance -- would win five world championships in 1910, 1911, 1913, 1929, and 1930, accompanied by nine American League Pennants in 1902, 1905, 1910, 1911, 1913, 1914, 1929, 1930, and 1931. Amid all of the winning was the legendary 1929 Philadelphia Athletics Team.\n\nDubbed in 1996 by Sports Illustrated as \"the Greatest MLB Team that Time Forgot,\" the 104-64 Athletics won the AL Pennant by an astounding 18 games and beat the Cubs in the World Series 4-1. With legendary players like pitcher Lefty Grove and a combination of Jimmy Foxx and Al Simmons, who blasted 77 home runs 95 years ago in 1929.\n\nThe Athletics just missed becoming a dynasty for the second time when they lost the 1931 World Series. They would never again return to championship form in Philadelphia, impacted by both the Great Depression and a crumbling Connie Mack Stadium. Finally, they would be sold and moved to Kansas City in 1954. When the Athletics left Philadelphia the Phillies bought Connie Mack Stadium.\n\nMichael Thomas Leibrandt, Abington\n\nVision Zero has been a failure all over the country as well as Philadelphia. The greatest irony of the traffic safety program is that in many locations road diets and other reconfigurations have not improved safety for cyclists and pedestrians, as activists and politicians like the mayors of New York and Los Angeles claim. Pedestrian fatalities spiked in L.A. from an average of 84 per year for the 13 years between 2003 and 2015, to 135 in 2017 and 128 last year. The spike coincides with the launch of Vision Zero in 2016. Vision Zero puts everyone in jeopardy by delaying EMT and fire vehicles to the extent that people die from heart attacks and strokes and houses burn to the ground.\n\nPhiladelphia and many cities have spent millions of dollars on Vision Zero, rebuilding streets to calm traffic and reduce driving, lobbying for speed limit reductions, launching public awareness campaigns, and retraining police departments. Yet Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington, among others, have seen sharp increases in pedestrian and/or bicycle fatalities.\n\nFor safer streets, Philadelphia should consult traffic engineers. For decades, traffic engineers have followed a tried-and-true formula for reducing auto fatalities: improve roadway designs in ways that reduce the number and impact of accidents. Vision Zero has diverted cities from that formula in an overt anti-auto strategy. It is no surprise that Vision Zero isn't working.\n\nTom McCarey, Berwyn", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-Pa.), and Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.). Okay, it ain't exactly the '27 Yankees or the '85 Bears, but someone's gotta play second banana to Joe Biden's second banana (which, if my math is correct, means that Walz is now Biden's third banana).\n\nOut of this unholy trinity, Kelly scared Republicans the most because his resume is literally out of this world (since he's an astronaut and all). His inclusion on the ticket likely would've kept Arizona blue, and the backstory of his wife's tragic shooting and how he stayed by her side was appealing to mainstream voters. He was such a strong, obvious choice that we can only assume something grotesque and/or depraved was uncovered during the vetting process. (Dead hooker in the trunk? Affairs with interns? \"Booger Sugar\" with Hunter Biden? Or maybe -- gasp! -- using the wrong pronoun? Inquiring minds want to know!)\n\nAfter Kelly, Shapiro was next on the GOP's fear list. He's popular, a powerful speaker, and would've been enormously helpful in the must-win state of Pennsylvania. Still in his early 50s, Shapiro would've moderated the ticket and helped deflect criticisms of the Biden-Harris record on Israel. But alas, Josh Shapiro is also a Jew, and that makes him a political pariah to the Hamas fanboys in the Democratic Party. (Oy veh!) Yes, Shapiro might've helped retain Pennsylvania, but Harris couldn't risk the blowback from the blowhards.\n\nWalz was the man whom Republicans feared the least because he doesn't have a dynamic personality, he won't activate any key voting blocs (i.e. African American, Asian, Latino), and he would have the least amount of overall electoral influence. Additionally, his abysmal management during the Black Lives Matter riots is tailor-made for GOP attacks. George Floyd was murdered in Minneapolis, and Walz's state was ground zero for the BLM movement.\n\nRioters looted, torched, burglarized, and disrupted the Twin Cities with 1,500 properties damaged, 164 incidents of arson, and multiple deaths. Walz squandered his opportunity to lead, opting instead to spout liberal platitudes, playing his fiddle like he was starring in a Netflix biopic of Nero. Given his history, should protesters ever pounce on D.C., a Walz administration would shrug its shoulders and let the capital burn to ash.\n\nFrom an outsider's perspective, pairing an inept, far-left Minnesota governor with a farther-left San Francisco liberal isn't the best way to entice Middle America. It's an oddball combination. And if your litmus test is the electoral map, Walz was a calorie-free addition. Still, out of all the white guys in our entire country, Tim Walz was her man.\n\nBut why? To answer that question, you need to put yourself in Kamala's heels: Which of her (many) weaknesses was she hoping to buttress?\n\nThe demographic angle is just one part of it, but the fact that she completely sidestepped Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-Mich.), refusing to seriously consider her candidacy, is quite revealing. In her mind, with two women on the ticket, the \"specialness\" of Harris's ascension might lose its luster.\n\nCan't have that!\n\nAdditionally, the decision to snub Whitmer connects with her decision to bypass Kelly and Shapiro -- and the real reason why she picked Walz: Kelly, Shapiro, and Whitmer were already capable of generating media coverage on their own. Should Harris elevate one of them veep, their profiles would grow exponentially.\n\nAnd Kamala is deathly afraid of being overshadowed.\n\nWhen you step back and think about it, you understand why this is such a sensitive topic for her. She never really \"won\" the presidential nomination. She didn't roll up her sleeves and win the primaries. Nobody voted for her -- the party handed her the top of the ticket on a silver platter. Plus, she had no real accomplishments as VP (or as a senator, for that matter) that are worthy of the White House. She's the single greatest example of meritless advancement in American political history.\n\nThis wasn't a nomination -- this was a coronation. The coronation of Queen Kamala.\n\nSo she picked the best man possible to fulfill her specific goals: Someone who's white -- but not the wrong kind of white (i.e. Shapiro). Someone who's old enough (60) to be perceived as experienced, but not too old. And more importantly, not too young either, because a younger, exciting (or female) candidate would threaten Harris's spotlight.\n\nThe Minnesota governor checked all the boxes that she cared about.\n\nIf your goal is to keep the attention solely on you, Walz was the perfect pick. He's smackdab in the sweet spot of being just credible enough not to be a distraction but not compelling enough to dare steal her spotlight. He's sharp enough to attack Trump but not sharp enough to ever threaten Kamala.\n\nIt's a window to her self-perception and insecurities.\n\nRepublicans might be sighing in relief because Walz was the pick, but oddly enough, so is Harris.", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_pinsker@pjmedia.com", "name": "Scott Pinsker", "type":

A VP candidate's worth is determined wholly by their chance to help rather than hurt the ticket. Opposition to Shapiro from some unions and the progressive wing of the Democratic party, however myopic or unfair, may have made Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota a safer bet.\n\nI am not, to my knowledge, related to Shapiro, but it would not surprise me if we were. A sort of Semitic form of Smith or Jones, Shapiro is as Jewish as Slivovitz wine or a particularly bittersweet sense of humor.\n\nBecause most Shapiros come from the Ashkenazi communities, scholars tend to find the name's roots in the Eastern European Disaspora, specifically associating the word's origins with the city of Speyer, at one time the third largest Jewish community in Germany.\n\nOthers prefer to imagine the name does not derive from the Yiddish world, but from Hebrew, where the word \"sapir\" refers to sapphire. Or better yet, to ancient Hebrew, where the root comes from the word \"handsome.\"\n\nInsofar as I look almost exactly like Josh Shapiro, I tend to favor this interpretation. Having spent my adult life being mistaken for the late comic and television star Bob Saget, I enjoy being mistaken for the Governor of Pennsylvania. What's not to like?\n\nWhatever its history, the name Shapiro has long been a cultural identifier of American Jewishness. Shapiro is the name Billy Wilder gave the Jewish POW in Stalag 17, the name Norman Lear gave Archie Bunker's doctor in All in the Family. It is one of the many obviously Jewish surnames Alan Sherman used in his patter song Shake Hands With Your Uncle Max.\n\nIt is also the credible name for a character in a number of unacceptable ethnic jokes.\n\nWhich makes me proud. In the same way it makes me proud that the poet Karl Shapiro won the Pulitzer Prize in 1945, that Irving Shapiro was CEO of the DuPont Corporation from 1973 to 1981, that Andrew Shapiro was a terrific Fresno State punter, or that Jacob \"Gurrah\" Shapiro was an assassin for Murder Incorporated. It means that like Washington, Jefferson, Cabot, Lodge, Chavez, Obama, Angelou, and Cho, Shapiro is a solidly, proudly American name written into the complex, complicated history of the land that I love.\n\nLike most immigrants, my family's history in Europe is unknown and unknowable, lost in the chaos of poverty, pogroms and the Shoah. It is a cruelty for a people so rooted in their own lineage and history. The Bible is nothing if not a long list of names, of tribes and ancestors, where they come from, what they did, who they were. In coming to America, so much of our past was lost. We tend to cling to whatever shards of memory come our way.\n\nThough I have no idea if I am related to Shapiro, it doesn't matter. The fact that we share the most American of American-Jewish names, like the fact that we both look a little like Bob Saget, is reason enough for me to root for him.\n\nRemember the name.

He is also ideologically more attractive to moderate voters, an outstanding speaker, and while liberal he doesn't come off as one.\n\nIf you have any doubt that Shapiro has the chops to appeal to voters in the middle, watch his press conference in which he described his conversation with Corey Comperatore after the assassination attempt in Butler.\n\nI was very impressed at the time, and nothing has changed my mind. I wouldn't vote for him, of course, because he is still a liberal, but I thought he would be an excellent choice for Harris.\n\nSo did many others.\n\nLet's face it, Tim Walz is pretty much Bernie Sanders-lite but a bit more radical and hails from a state that is neither a must-win nor one that Kamala is in much danger of losing if she has a shot at the presidency at all. If she wins, she will win Minnesota. If she loses, she still will probably win Minnesota.\n\nWalz has so many vulnerabilities that attacking him on the trail will be complicated by choosing just which idiotic policies are the least popular, and which insane things he did will impact the vote more.\n\nHe was a terrible choice. Only a San Francisco liberal could think otherwise. He might not cost Harris the election, but nobody in his right mind thinks he will help outside of solidifying her base. And if she hasn't done that already, this won't help.\n\nSo Van Jones said the quiet part out loud: Shapiro was excluded because he is a Jew.\n\nYou know that. I know that. Everybody knows that. While Walz won't be necessary to solidify the base, Shapiro threatened tearing it apart. Even as a liberal, anti-Netanyahu Jew, Shapiro is just too Jewish to be presented to the Democrat antisemites.\n\nNot all Democrats are antisemites. Most of them are obviously not. And most Jews are Democrats, although if polling is any indication the Democrats are going to have trouble keeping a lot of them in the fold.\n\nBut the most rabid Democrats--the \"vote Blue no matter who\" radicals, won't vote Blue if he is a Jew.\n\nIt really is that simple, and Van Jones as an honest man said so. I have gotten blowback before for praising Jones, but I think he is as straight up a guy as you find in politics. I don't agree with him, but I think he tells it like he sees it.\n\nAnd he sees \"dark forces\" in the Democrat Party, and has the guts to say so.\n\nI don't praise him because I agree with him on this point. I do it because he told the truth. And it is an uncomfortable truth that the Democrat Party has to confront if it is going to be allowed near power.\n\nHate is a powerful force in politics, and it isn't a Left or Right issue, although in general, I think that the Left is in the grips of a hatefest and has been for a while. There are hateful Republicans, and we know who they are.\n\nRight now the Democrats have an antisemitism problem as large as the Trump Derangement problem, and it will persist longer unless it is stamped out.\n\nI can't call the Vice President's decision a canary in the coal mine because the canaries are already dying left and right. This is more like the first obvious sign of an impending explosion in the mine.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_strom@hotair.com", "name": "David Strom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Van Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coal mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2019/59/d5f9607e-b8f1-46e1-84ae-2a13161163b9.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796608", "eventUri": "eng-9796608", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

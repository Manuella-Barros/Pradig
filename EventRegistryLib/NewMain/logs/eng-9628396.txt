Yes, he makes tweaks here and there and knows what we can do.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Winfield_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antoine Winfield Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Safety (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkah_Fitzpatrick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minkah Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derwin_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derwin James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wilks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Wilks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMeco_Ryans", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DeMeco Ryans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ou2K3.7xkkMKRCvijZKOpA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/b6f7eb93299505d0df504a5784a463bd", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628396", "eventUri": "eng-9628396", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-19", "textStart": 67, "textEnd": 74}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-09", "textStart": 782, "textEnd": 789}], "sentiment": 0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

The San Francisco 49ers safety is diligently rehabbing the ACL injury that cut his 2023 season short, placing him on the injured reserve list in November. While he aims to return for the upcoming season's start, he plans to approach his recovery wisely.\n\n\"The goal is to ready by Week 1,\" Hufanga told reporters after today's practice. \"The goal is to be in training camp, not at the very beginning, but to ramp me up correctly, just so it's not throw you out there to the wolves and good luck. But trying to be smart with it. We've had plenty of conversations with the training staff, and putting me in the best possible situation to succeed for myself, and then try to help the team as well,\" Hufanga told reporters after today's practice.\n\nPatience is critical in recovering from such an injury. Hufanga is eager to join his teammates on the practice field but understands the importance of long-term goals and ensuring he is completely recovered.\n\n\"Well, as a competitor, I would love to say I want to be out there right now,\" Hufanga shared. \"As my knee goes, it's just a slow progression, so you have to hit the stages and check off the stages and check off the boxes before you move to the next one.\n\n\"But I do wish I was out there right now, and I can't wait to be back out there. I tell the guys that all the time. But being patient is a big part of this process, for sure.\"\n\nLast season, Hufanga had to watch as his teammates fought through the postseason and battled in the Super Bowl, ultimately falling short of their lofty aspirations. Was watching from the sidelines as his team went on a playoff run difficult?\n\n\"To me, I think it would be a bad spot for me, as a teammate, if I wasn't happy for everyone,\" Hufanga said of the 49ers' success last season. \"When we sat down at the beginning of the year, our goal was to go to the Super Bowl. Was it to win? Yes. Did we come up short? Yes, as well. But for me, it was a spot for me to learn and truly appreciate what it's like to give myself to the teammates as well, as a leader, learning, teaching, evolving.\n\n\"I wasn't there the whole time because I did have my surgery and I was away from the team. But when I came back, it was like, how can I be a bright light, a great resource of teaching guys and understanding different concepts?\n\n\"We came up short, and our goal is to come back this year with a chip on our shoulder and win the big one.\"\n\nHufanga will mentor rookie Malik Mustapha this season, one of the 49ers' three fourth-round draft picks. While the All-Pro veteran hasn't been able to share the practice field with his new teammate yet, he offered an early scouting report.\n\n\"Beefy,\" Hufanga said of the rookie. \"Man, that dude [will] just outlift everyone. He's like a mini Dre [Greenlaw], how they just walk around with this presence. But twitchy, athletic, smart, and a guy that's really just about his business and gets things done.\"\n\nHufanga also had the opportunity to watch another rookie last season. Ji'Ayir Brown filled in for Hufanga after the injury, starting five games down the stretch and two postseason contests, including the Super Bowl.\n\n\"For a guy to come in as a rookie, the light is never too bright for him,\" Hufanga commented. \"I think what he did in the Super Bowl and what he did leading up to that has just been amazing.\"\n\nWith his sights set on a full recovery, Hufanga aims to make a significant impact with the 49ers during their 2024 campaign and Super Bowl push.", "source": {"uri": "49erswebzone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "49ers Webzone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_bonilla@49erswebzone.com", "name": "David Bonilla", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talanoa_Hufanga", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Talanoa Hufanga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suka_Hufanga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suka Hufanga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_reserve_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured reserve list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji'Ayir_Brown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ji'Ayir Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn Bowling", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://static.49erswebzone.com/v/DMOi8V/content/media/article/371b89415f3b2ed3cc10d4570356bc0e.jpg?social=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628396", "eventUri": "eng-9628396", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

Well, almost.\n\nBrandon Aiyuk extended his offseason-long absence amid his holdout for a contract extension, thus exposing him to roughly $100,000 in fines for skipping this week's mandatory minicamp.\n\nWilliams missed Tuesday's action while attending one of his daughter's graduation ceremonies. His 35-year-old body looks ready for a 15th year in the NFL, and he stayed on the field Wednesday to watch the hour-long practice.\n\n\"It's awesome,\" left guard Aaron Banks said of anticipating a third season starting next to Williams. \"Trent is arguably the best to do it and gives me peace of mind that whatever combination we have together, he'll get his job done. His experience, the way he sees the game, I pick his brain to make myself a better player on the left side.\"\n\nJaylon Moore has filled in for Williams most of this offseason on the first-string unit, which has also been without starting center Jake Brendel (center); right guard Jon Feliciano has also been out in recent weeks.\n\nAlso watching practice rather than suiting up for it: running back Christian McCaffrey, tight end George Kittle, linebacker Fred Warner, and defensive backs Talanoa Hufanga, Ji'Ayir Brown, Charvarius Ward and Deommodore Lenoir.\n\nThe 49ers are four months removed from losing in the Super Bowl to the reigning champion Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nMinicamp served as a brief reunion for the 49ers' star players -- many of whose bodies are still recuperating from their fourth playoff run in five seasons. In seven weeks, they'll return for training camp and a shot at the 49ers' first Lombardi Trophy in 30 years.\n\nHUFANGA UPDATE\n\nHufanga is aiming to play in the 49ers' season opener, 10 months after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. \"Give or take anytime, but the goal is to be ready Week 1,\" said Hufanga, who doesn't anticipate being fully cleared when training camp opens. \"... They'll ramp me up correctly in training camp so they don't just throw me out to the wolves.\" The 49ers' season opener is Sept. 9 against the New York Jets.\n\nHufanga, aside from his knee recovery, has poured over film to better familiarize himself with Ji'Ayir Brown as the 49ers' projected starting tandem, though Hufanga insists he still must earn back his job that won him 2022 All-Pro honors. During Wednesday's session, Hufanga watched from deep in the defensive backfield alongside Brown and general manager John Lynch.\n\nAs much as Hufanga covets Lynch's advice as a Hall of Fame safety, Brown's presence was much appreciated. \"I want to know how Tig' (Brown) thinks and looks at stuff,\" Hufanga said. \"It's cool he came back there today to see how he looks at things.\"\n\nBANKS ON PURDY'S PROGRESS\n\nBanks says Brock Purdy is giving off \"a feel\" of a a more assertive role in the huddle and locker room.\n\n\"Brock came in with a certain confidence and swagger that you see in a leader,\" Banks said. \"I'm excited to see what Brock puts out this year. He's confident to take a leadership role. But his demeanor hasn't changed as far as his work ethic. It's been the same from Day 1 to now.\"\n\nAs for how Purdy's improved in offseason workouts, Banks had an apt response: \"Hard to say from my point of view. He's behind me.\"\n\nBanks is entering the final year of his rookie deal, and rather than opine for an extension or holdout for one, he said: \"When it's time to cross that bridge, we will. I'm working on controlling what I can control.\"\n\nSORENSEN TALKS TAKEAWAYS\n\nDefensive coordinator Nick Sorensen led \"ball\" meetings the past two seasons that emphasized takeaways, and now he's bequeathing that job to Brandon Staley, the former Chargers' coach who's now the assistant head coach and seemingly a roaming mentor to all on defense.\n\nThe 49ers defenders almost made a couple of interceptions Wednesday, and Sorensen said such near-takeaways are not ignored: \"I used to call it house rules, and for the offense, too. Growing up in my house, my pops said, if it touches your hands, you've got to catch it. We have the same mentality for our whole team.\"\n\nSorensen's first-string defense Wednesday missed a slew of potential and/or past starters: defensive linemen Bosa, Maliek Collins, Jordan Elliott and Drake Jackson, and, linebackers Warner and Dre Greenlaw.", "source": {"uri": "mercurynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Jose Mercury News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The San Francisco 49ers safety has been recovering from the ACL injury that shortened his 2023 season. He aims to be ready for Week 1 of the upcoming season after ramping up his workload during training camp.\n\nAlthough Hufanga is now considered a veteran in the defensive backs room, having already secured Pro Bowl and All-Pro honors in his short career, he doesn't believe he has reached his ceiling. Hufanga is in the unique position of learning from one of the best ever to play the position, Hall of Fame safety and 49ers general manager John Lynch.\n\nThe 49ers wrapped up their mandatory minicamp this week. During practices, Hufanga, still rehabbing, was seen in the back of the end zone observing the on-field work. Next to him was Lynch, and the two were engaged in conversation.\n\n\"For me, first and foremost, it's awesome, just because you have a Hall of Fame safety that's our general manager,\" Hufanga told reporters this week. \"Anytime you have a question, you just go to him. You've gotta learn from him. You've gotta be a sponge and absorb his knowledge.\"\n\nHufanga has ensured that some of the younger players at the position, like second-year safety Ji'Ayir Brown, know they have an incredible resource at their disposal.\n\n\"I think the cool thing is seeing Ji'Ayir come along with it, too, because now he's understanding who our GM really is,\" Hufanga commented. \"He understands ball. He's played at a high level.\"\n\nHufanga is eager to soak up any knowledge Lynch might offer. The safety knows his starting job isn't guaranteed and approaches each offseason with the mindset that he will have to fight for playing time. This mindset is especially crucial coming off a significant injury, so Hufanga is taking advantage of every opportunity to improve his game.\n\n\"It's not given. I have to earn it as well,\" Hufanga noted.\n\nWhen asked about the specifics of his discussions with Lynch, Hufanga responded, \"I'm learning because, as a GM, you have to know both sides. You have to know the offensive and the defensive call.\"\n\nSpeaking to the man who has helped shape the roster and knows what head coach Kyle Shanahan likes to throw at defenses has been a massive advantage for Hufanga.\n\n\"So we will talk about certain stuff, or we'll talk about personnel and different things, and how to attack certain coverages and stuff,\" Hufanga continued. \"So as much as I try to just absorb as much knowledge from him, it's really cool. I think a lot of time, I'll get into a rhythm last year where I'm playing the call versus what he would like to say, being myself and using my vision, being a very instinctual player and not having to rely on a call.\n\n\"So that was really cool to have John in my ear, teaching me that, and knowing what my strengths are and play to them. My goal is to go back out there, and compete, and do my best, and learn from John, and translate it to the field.\"", "source": {"uri": "49erswebzone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "49ers Webzone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_bonilla@49erswebzone.com", "name": "David Bonilla", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talanoa_Hufanga", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Talanoa Hufanga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suka_Hufanga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suka Hufanga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lynch_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Lynch (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji'Ayir_Brown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ji'Ayir Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "End zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Shanahan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Shanahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Emergency_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Emergency and Safety", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Colleges_and_Universities", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Colleges and Universities", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Organizations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://static.49erswebzone.com/v/DMOi8V/content/media/article/051ce967dbdb1ef069d70b4c1d4d741b.jpg?social=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628396", "eventUri": "eng-9628396", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

It's not given. I have to earn it.'", "body": "The San Francisco 49ers are expected to get Talanoa Hufanga back from his ACL injury. Hufanga acknowledged Wednesday that \"being patient is a big part of this process.\"\n\nThis was the first time we've heard from Hufanga since his injury last season against the Jacksonville Jaguars, and Talanoa shared everything from his recovery to his thoughts on Nick Sorensen, whomhe studies, and the safety room.\n\nHufanga isn't on the practice field yet, but he's finding other ways to prepare for this season: \"The amount of film I watch is probably second to none. I wasn't the most athletic person, so being one step ahead film-wise on the field, it's all a mental game to me.\n\nReally, just taking all these reps these guys are getting. Put myself in the position, what I'd do different, what I'd do to emulate other guys who make great plays to start camp. The plays that they make, how can I make those plays? How can I learn from their game? For me, it's just being a student of the game and evolving.\"\n\nHufanga said he doesn't just watch the players in the 49ers system. He said, \"There's no need to watch me if there's other guys doing higher level things across the board. I watch Antoine Winfield, Derwin James, Minkah Fitzpatrick. I watch all their attributes, and the goal is to learn how to put it into a player on your team.\"\n\nAs for the new defensive coordinator, it's not as if Sorensen is walking into a new situation: \"He's been in the meetings. It's not like he's a fresh face, new face. He knows what the system was. He's been in it with DeMeco [Ryans] as well. He really understands what we're trying to accomplish.\n\nI think the good thing is his energy, too. It's very DeMeco-style. They're two different coaches. But at the end of the day, it's the same system and philosophy, and the way they teach is a very competitive, energetic way. And that's something I appreciate about him, for sure.\"\n\nEnergy has been consistent when describing Sorensen from the players through OTAs. The defense feeds off their coordinator, and it sounds like that won't be an issue in 2024.\n\nHufanga leans on the 49ers general manager at times for questions. After all, he is a Hall of Fame safety. Hufanga said John Lynch was in the defensive backfield during Wednesday's practice, and the two were communicating with Ji'Ayir Brown. That is invaluable for both players. Hufanga called Brown's development \"amazing.\"\n\nWhat Talanoa said next speaks to the honesty the coaching staff has toward its players:\n\n\"My goal is to be a starter. A lot of people just automatically assume that this year, you're going to be a starter. My goal is to be a starter every year. It's a mindset. But you have to earn it. I'm in a position where I'm coming off injury, it's not given. I have to earn it.\"\n\nEarlier in the offseason, when the 49ers were entertaining the idea of adding a veteran safety, reports surfaced that Hufanga wasn't a lock to start. His quotes above confirm as much.\n\nHufanga tends to play heavier than your typical safety. He said he plays around 217-218 pounds, whereas most safeties are below 215. I'd be curious to know if he's looking to be lighter coming off an injury and whether he feels like that'll impact his health.", "source": {"uri": "ninersnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Niners Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_posey@ninersnation.com", "name": "Kyle Posey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suka_Hufanga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suka Hufanga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talanoa_Hufanga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talanoa Hufanga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Winfield_Sr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antoine Winfield Sr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkah_Fitzpatrick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minkah Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derwin_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derwin James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji'Ayir_Brown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ji'Ayir Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Safety (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lynch_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Lynch (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks_and_Watches", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks and Watches", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GjXea1fLKgj_Hr3kek_9JOkhze4=/0x0:6000x3000/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25480517/1964022627.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628396", "eventUri": "eng-9628396", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

Well, almost.\n\nBrandon Aiyuk extended his offseason-long absence amid his holdout for a contract extension, thus exposing him to roughly $100,000 in fines for skipping this week's mandatory minicamp.\n\nWilliams missed Tuesday's action while attending one of his daughter's graduation ceremonies. Wearing a black T-shirt and shorts, his 35-year-old body looks ready for a 15th year in the NFL, and he stayed on the field Wednesday to watch the hour-long practice.\n\n\"It's awesome,\" left guard Aaron Banks said of anticipating a third season starting next to Williams. \"Trent is arguably the best to do it and gives me peace of mind that whatever combination we have together, he'll get his job done. His experience, the way he sees the game, I pick his brain to make myself a better player on the left side.\"\n\nJaylon Moore has filled in for Williams most of this offseason on the first-string unit, which has also been without starting center Jake Brendel (center); right guard Jon Feliciano has also been out in recent weeks.\n\nAlso watching practice rather than suiting up for it: running back Christian McCaffrey, tight end George Kittle, linebacker Fred Warner, and defensive backs Talanoa Hufanga, Ji'Ayir Brown, Charvarius Ward and Deommodore Lenoir.\n\nThe 49ers are four months removed from losing in the Super Bowl to the reigning champion Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nMinicamp served as a brief reunion for the 49ers' star players -- many of whose bodies are still recuperating from their fourth playoff run in five seasons. In seven weeks, they'll return for training camp and a shot at the 49ers' first Lombardi Trophy in 30 years.\n\nHUFANGA UPDATE\n\nHufanga is aiming to play in the 49ers' season opener, 10 months after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. \"Give or take anytime, but the goal is to be ready Week 1,\" said Hufanga, who doesn't anticipate being fully cleared when training camp opens. \"... They'll ramp me up correctly in training camp so they don't just throw me out to the wolves.\" The 49ers' season opener is Sept. 9 against the New York Jets.\n\nHufanga, aside from his knee recovery, has poured over film to better familiarize himself with Ji'Ayir Brown as the 49ers' projected starting tandem, though Hufanga insists he still must earn back his job that won him 2022 All-Pro honors. During Wednesday's session, Hufanga watched from deep in the defensive backfield alongside Brown and general manager John Lynch.\n\nAs much as Hufanga covets Lynch's advice as a Hall of Fame safety, Brown's presence was much appreciated. \"I want to know how Tig' (Brown) thinks and looks at stuff,\" Hufanga said. \"It's cool he came back there today to see how he looks at things.\"\n\nBANKS ON PURDY'S PROGRESS\n\nBanks says Brock Purdy is giving off \"a feel\" of a a more assertive role in the huddle and locker room.\n\n\"Brock came in with a certain confidence and swagger that you see in a leader,\" Banks said. \"I'm excited to see what Brock puts out this year. He's confident to take a leadership role. But his demeanor hasn't changed as far as his work ethic. It's been the same from Day 1 to now.\"\n\nAs for how Purdy's improved in offseason workouts, Banks had an apt response: \"Hard to say from my point of view. He's behind me.\"\n\nBanks is entering the final year of his rookie deal, and rather than opine for an extension or holdout for one, he said: \"When it's time to cross that bridge, we will. I'm working on controlling what I can control.\"\n\nSORENSEN TALKS TAKEAWAYS\n\nDefensive coordinator Nick Sorensen led \"ball\" meetings the past two seasons that emphasized takeaways, and now he's bequeathing that job to Brandon Staley, the former Chargers' coach who's now the assistant head coach and seemingly a roaming mentor to all on defense.\n\nThe 49ers defenders almost made a couple of interceptions Wednesday, and Sorensen said such near-takeaways are not ignored: \"I used to call it house rules, and for the offense, too. Growing up in my house, my pops said, if it touches your hands, you've got to catch it. We have the same mentality for our whole team.\"\n\nSorensen's first-string defense Wednesday missed a slew of potential and/or past starters: defensive linemen Bosa, Maliek Collins, Jordan Elliott and Drake Jackson, and, linebackers Warner and Dre Greenlaw.\n\nPLAYER OF THE DAY\n\nLevi Lucas, a 12-year-old from Kentucky, was the 49ers' player of the day as part of a Make-A-Wish visit. Diagnosed with cancer when he was 8, Lucas is in remission. He played catch with Brock Purdy and was presented a 49ers jersey by George Kittle. Lucas' visit will be featured on ESPN later this year.", "source": {"uri": "santacruzsentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Cruz Sentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri":

I'm super excited, it's fun. The days that I get to go out there and watch the practices, it's been a blessing. You see how much football truly means to you when you're away from it.\n\nHe missed the final seven regular-season games and then had to watch the 49ers' heart-racing run to Super Bowl LVIII, where they fell to the Kansas City Chiefs in overtime.\n\nWhile Hufanga wishes he could have been suited up on the gridiron with his teammates down the stretch of the season and into the playoffs, he knew he could still impact the team from the sideline and ultimately was happy about his team's success.\n\n\"I think it would be a bad spot for me as a teammate if I wasn't happy for everyone,\" Hufanga said. \"When we sat down at the beginning of the year, our goal was to go to the Super Bowl. Was it to win? Yes. Did we come up short? Yes. But it was a spot for me to learn and truly appreciate what it's like to give myself to the team as well as a leader. Learning, teaching, evolving.\n\n\"I wasn't there for the whole time because I did have my surgery and I was away from the team, but when I came back it was like, 'How can I be a bright light, a great resource of teaching guys and understanding different concepts?' But we came up short and our goal is to come back this year with a chip on our shoulder and win the big one.\"\n\nBack in March, 49ers general manager John Lynch said Hufanga was rehabbing \"extremely well\" and \"beating the timeline\" during his recovery.\n\nMore than 10 weeks later, Hufanga provided more clarity on when he expects to return to action.\n\n\"Obviously, it's a give or take at any time, but the goal is to be ready by Week 1,\" he said. \"The goal is to be in training camp, not the very beginning, but to ramp me up correctly so it's not just a throw you out to the wolves and 'good luck.'\n\n\"But trying to be smart with it, we've had plenty of discussions with the training staff and putting me in the best possible situation to succeed for myself and then try to help the team as well.\"\n\nThere still is a long way to go for Hufanga, but he'll continue to flash his bright smile throughout the process until he's back in the Red and Gold in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suka_Hufanga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suka Hufanga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Super_Rugby_Pacific_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2023 Super Rugby Pacific season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talanoa_Hufanga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talanoa Hufanga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LVIII", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LVIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lynch_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Lynch (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/7a487e4cd87420624799d5d81a310f8b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628396", "eventUri": "eng-9628396", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

San Francisco opens the season on Sept. 9 against the New York Jets.\n\nHufanga is taking advantage of this time to spend even more hours than usual poring over film, studying his own teammates at practice and some of the top safeties around the league like Antoine Winfield Jr., Derwin James and Minkah Fitzpatrick to get any tips he can.\n\n\"You're taking all their great attributes and your goal is to put it into a player on your team,\" he said. \"So learning how to be more patient and keying your run-pass keys versus just like trying to play the call or playing the concept.\"\n\nHufanga was drafted in the fifth round by San Francisco in 2021 and played mostly on special teams at the start before working his way into the defense late in his rookie season.\n\nHufanga then became an All-Pro his second season and was playing at a high level again last year before getting hurt after amassing three interceptions and 52 tackles.\n\nThe defense regressed a bit after his injury, allowing 4.4 more points per game and 0.24 more yards per play after Hufanga went down.\n\nThe late-season issues on defense contributed to a change in coordinator with Nick Sorensen being promoted to replace Steve Wilks in the offseason.\n\nHufanga has said the transition has been seamless since Sorensen has been on staff two years working under both Wilks and former coordinator DeMeco Ryans.\n\n\"He's been in the meetings. So it's not like he's just a fresh new face,\" Hufanga said. \"He knows what the system was. He's been in it with DeMeco as well. So he really understands what we're trying to accomplish.

For about five minutes, the southwest corner of the 49ers' practice fields featured a boatload of All-Pro talent.\n\nAbout 30 minutes later, 49ers general manager John Lynch took his customary viewing position for the 11-on-11 portion of practice. The Hall of Fame safety prefers watching from center field, about 40 yards from the line of scrimmage. That angle allows Lynch to see plays develop from the vantage point he grew accustomed to during his 15-year NFL career.\n\nLynch typically watches practice alone, but he had company on Wednesday. Safeties Talanoa Hufanga and Ji'Ayir Brown, alongside cornerbacks Charvarius Ward and Deommodore Lenoir, all gathered around him.\n\nHufanga and Ward both spent OTAs and minicamp rehabbing from surgeries while Brown and Lenoir practiced earlier in the spring but did not take part in Wednesday's 11-on-11 work, which enabled the DB summit with Lynch.\n\n\"For me, it's awesome, because we have a Hall of Fame safety that's our general manager,\" Hufanga said. \"Anytime you have a question, you go to him. You learn from him. You're a sponge. You absorb knowledge. The coolest thing is seeing Ji'Ayir come along with it, too. Because now he's understanding who our GM really is. He understands ball. He's played at a high level.\"\n\nHufanga said Lynch, aside from sharing nuggets and tips after various plays, offers valuable big-picture perspective.\n\n\"Because as a GM, he needs to know the offensive and the defensive side of the ball, the concepts, where the scheme hits, missed plays,\" Hufanga said. \"So (the big picture) helps us our defense.\"\n\nHufanga, who tore his ACL last November, is aiming to return by the 49ers' Sept. 9 season opener against the New York Jets. He doesn't want to rush back to practice, so there's a chance Hufanga might still be finishing up his rehab during the first part of training camp next month. The safety is preaching patience and emphasizing that significant improvement is happening cerebrally -- even while he's not yet back on the field.\n\n\"The amount of film I watch is second to none,\" Hufanga said. \"That's one thing I pride myself on. I wasn't the most athletic person, so being one step ahead film-wise, it's a mental game for me.\"\n\nHufanga earned All-Pro honors in 2022, his first season as a full-time starter for the 49ers. He played in 10 games before being injured in 2023. That sample was large enough for Lynch to offer some constructive criticism Hufanga has taken to heart.\n\n\"A lot of times last year, I would get into a rhythm of playing the call instead of being myself -- what (Lynch) would say, playing my vision,\" Hufanga said. \"I want to be an instinctive player and not have to rely on a call. So that was really cool to have John in my ear, teaching me that. Knowing what my strengths are, play to them.\"\n\nHufanga's intensive film study has involved viewings of star safeties across the NFL -- and he hasn't limited himself to watching players who operate in defenses similar to the 49ers' system.\n\n\"I can watch guys doing higher-level stuff across the board,\" Hufanga said. \"I watch Antoine Winfield, Derwin James, Minkah Fitzpatrick. You're watching all their great attributes and your goal is to put it into a player on your team.\"\n\nEarlier this offseason, the 49ers seemed likely to add a veteran safety to their roster. They worked out Rayshawn Jenkins, who later signed with the Seattle Seahawks and recently divulged that the 49ers also offered him a contract. They also hosted Julian Blackmon, who re-signed with the Indianapolis Colts. At April's NFL owners' meetings, Lynch said that the 49ers had remained in touch with veteran safety Tashaun Gipson Sr., who'd been with the team over the past two seasons.\n\nIn the two months since, the 49ers drafted Wake Forest safety Malik Mustapha, but they've yet to make another move at the position. Some big names, including Justin Simmons and Jamal Adams, remain available at the position in what's been a relatively slow year for the safety market.\n\nBut there's a chance the 49ers are comfortable enough with Hufanga's recovery progress and the development of their youngsters to stand pat.\n\nHufanga was certainly complimentary of both teammates on Wednesday.\n\n\"He's beefy,\" Hufanga said of the 5-10, 206-pound Mustapha. \"That dude might be able to out-lift everyone. He's like a mini-Dre (Greenlaw), the way he walks around with his presence. Twitchy, athletic, smart and really just a guy who's about his business and gets things done.\"\n\nThen, Hufanga pivoted his attention to Brown. He's spent a chunk of time watching tape of himself and Brown on the field from 2023, brainstorming how they can enhance their cohesiveness once all is back to normal in 2024.\n\n\"With Ji'Ayir, the light is never too bright for him,\" Hufanga said. \"For me, it's being a student of the game, learning, evolving, trying to be the best part of this team.\"\n\n* Nick Sorensen has run a weekly 49ers' meeting dubbed \"The Ball\" -- which carries a focus on generating takeaways and avoiding giveaways -- over the past two seasons. But now that he's been promoted to defensive coordinator, Sorensen will relinquish that duty to assistant Brandon Staley, the former Los Angeles Chargers head coach who joined the 49ers staff earlier this offseason.\n\nThe 49ers led the NFL in turnover differential over the past two seasons, and Sorensen said he isn't de-emphasizing the importance of possessing the ball in his bigger role.\n\n\"I still stress the heck out of it every meeting,\" he said. \"I think it's something that permeates throughout the whole thing. That's the most important thing.\"\n\n* The prettiest play of practice came courtesy of 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy, who lofted a perfect 30-yard pass to Deebo Samuel Sr. that hit the receiver right in front of the sideline. Purdy was evading the pass rush as he threw, fading back and to his left. The throw beat cornerback Samuel Womack III.\n\nRookie 49ers receiver Ricky Pearsall was the first to congratulate Samuel for the big gain along the sideline.\n\n* Linebacker Fred Warner seems excited about second-year linebacker Dee Winters. Warner didn't hesitate when asked which of the team's young players at his position has impressed the most this offseason.\n\n\"I think Dee has probably had the best OTA,\" Warner said. \"He's really come along. I think last year as a rookie, he was really struggling to learn the plays, trying to get in shape. All those little things that you've got to learn as a professional. He's come in this year and just been on it. Making plays left and right. He came in great shape these OTAs. He's set himself up to have a great training camp.\"\n\nWinters is projected to compete with fellow second-year linebacker Jalen Graham and rookie Tatum Bethune, among others, for snaps come training camp.\n\n* On one play Wednesday, the 49ers' top two 2024 draftees squared off on a rep in the slot Tuesday. Pearsall, the team's first-round pick, matched up with second-round cornerback Renardo Green. A highly competitive rep followed, although Purdy threw the football elsewhere.\n\n\"I wish we could have one-on-ones, but with the CBA you can't,\" Sorensen said, referring to rules that limit the scope of springtime NFL practices. \"So you look for those opportunities.\"\n\nSorensen should get his wish the next time the 49ers take the field. It'll be late July. It'll be training camp. And one-on-ones -- some of the most anticipated reps of summer -- will finally be allowed.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

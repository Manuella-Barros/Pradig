(AP) -- Aaron Rodgers made a surprise start and looked to be in midseason form, going 6 for 8 for 37 yards and a TD pass -- plus one of his trademark quick snaps to draw a penalty -- on his lone drive for Green Bay, while Kirk Cousins and the rest of Washington's first-team offense sputtered in the Packers' 21-17 exhibition victory Saturday night.\n\nThe Redskins did not manage to collect a single first down until the final play of the opening quarter, during their fourth possession of the evening. Their initial three resulted in an embarrassing total of 13 yards. Cousins was 2 for 6 for 9 yards in that span, while running back Rob Kelley gained 4 yards on three carries behind a starting offensive line that provided little push.\n\nWashington's fourth possession stalled when Kelley was stopped for no gain on fourth-and-1 at Green Bay's 27. After the fifth, Cousins had steered Washington to only three first downs -- one via a defensive penalty -- while completing 8 of 15 passes for 67 yards against a Packers secondary missing two of its top three cornerbacks. Cousins, who will earn about $24 million this season under a franchise tag, and his first-teamers stayed in for the entire first half and finally got going on drive No. 6, against defensive reserves.\n\nCousins completed a 43-yard pass to tight end Vernon Davis and a fourth-and-goal 4-yard touchdown toss to Jamison Crowder with 13 seconds left in the half to make things look a little better than they actually were for coach Jay Gruden's offense. Gruden has returned to calling plays this season after offensive coordinator Sean McVay left to coach the St. Louis Rams.\n\nPlaying on his 29th birthday, Cousins ended up 14 for 23 for 144 yards and the score. Kelley ran nine times for 9 yards.\n\nThe expectation was that Rodgers would sit out the second preseason game, just as he did a year ago. But he led the Packers 75 yards on 15 plays, capped by a 3-yard TD toss to new tight end Martellus Bennett with 5\u00bd minutes left in the first quarter, beating linebacker Zach Brown.\n\nRodgers also completed passes to Jordy Nelson, Randall Cobb and Davante Adams on the drive. On the third play, Rodgers hiked the ball as Redskins defensive lineman Stacy McGee was still trotting to the sideline, catching the hosts with 12 men on the field. The game officials didn't catch it, but Packers coach Mike McCarthy challenged, and a penalty was called after a replay review.\n\n\"I thought Aaron was excellent,\" McCarthy said. \"I thought the whole drive ... (was) exactly what you're looking for. A good run-pass mix.\"\n\nROOKIE WATCH\n\nGreen Bay: RB Jamaal Williams, a fourth-round pick out of BYU, started and had seven carries for 12 yards. ... RB Aaron Jones , taken in the fifth round from UTEP, caught a 5-yard TD pass from backup QB Todd Hundley in the second quarter. ... QB Taysom Hill, an undrafted free agent from BYU, led a seven-play, 65-yard TD drive in the fourth quarter that included his fourth-down run for a first down and his 23-yard scoring scamper for the winning points. He's competing with Joe Callahan for the third QB spot.\n\nWashington: RB Samaje Perine, a fourth-rounder from Oklahoma, ran for 45 yards on eight carries. He also caught a 29-yard pass from backup QB Colt McCoy, part of a much stronger performance for Perine than a week ago, when he fumbled.\n\nINJURIES\n\nGreen Bay: DE Dean Lowry hurt his left knee in the second quarter.\n\nWashington: RT Morgan Moses left after the game's second play, but returned later in the opening quarter.\n\nSITTING OUT\n\nThe Packers were without RB Ty Montgomery (leg), CB Davon House (hamstring) and CB Damarious Randall (concussion protocol). The Redskins were missing TE Jordan Reed (toe), LB Junior Galette (hamstring), S Su'a Cravens (knee) and WR Maurice Harris (knee).\n\n-- -- --\n\nFor more AP NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and

(AP) - Aaron Rodgers made a surprise start and looked to be in midseason form, going 6 for 8 for 37 yards and a TD pass - plus one of his trademark quick snaps to draw a penalty - on his lone drive for Green Bay, while Kirk Cousins and the rest of Washington's first-team offense sputtered in the Packers' 21-17 exhibition victory Saturday night.\n\nThe Redskins did not manage to collect a single first down until the final play of the opening quarter, during their fourth possession of the evening. Their initial three resulted in an embarrassing total of 13 yards. Cousins was 2 for 6 for 9 yards in that span, while running back Rob Kelley gained 4 yards on three carries behind a starting offensive line that provided little push.\n\nWashington's fourth possession stalled when Kelley was stopped for no gain on fourth-and-1 at Green Bay's 27. After the fifth, Cousins had steered Washington to only three first downs - one via a defensive penalty - while completing 8 of 15 passes for 67 yards against a Packers secondary missing two of its top three cornerbacks. Cousins, who will earn about $24 million this season under a franchise tag, and his first-teamers stayed in for the entire first half and finally got going on drive No. 6, against defensive reserves.\n\nCousins completed a 43-yard pass to tight end Vernon Davis and a fourth-and-goal 4-yard touchdown toss to Jamison Crowder with 13 seconds left in the half to make things look a little better than they actually were for coach Jay Gruden's offense. Gruden has returned to calling plays this season after offensive coordinator Sean McVay left to coach the St. Louis Rams.\n\nPlaying on his 29th birthday, Cousins ended up 14 for 23 for 144 yards and the score. Kelley ran nine times for 9 yards.\n\nThe expectation was that Rodgers would sit out the second preseason game, just as he did a year ago. But he led the Packers 75 yards on 15 plays, capped by a 3-yard TD toss to new tight end Martellus Bennett with 5\u00bd minutes left in the first quarter, beating linebacker Zach Brown.\n\nRodgers also completed passes to Jordy Nelson, Randall Cobb and Davante Adams on the drive. On the third play, Rodgers hiked the ball as Redskins defensive lineman Stacy McGee was still trotting to the sideline, catching the hosts with 12 men on the field. The game officials didn't catch it, but Packers coach Mike McCarthy challenged, and a penalty was called after a replay review.\n\n\"I thought Aaron was excellent,\" McCarthy said. \"I thought the whole drive ... (was) exactly what you're looking for. A good run-pass mix.\"\n\nROOKIE WATCH\n\nGreen Bay: RB Jamaal Williams, a fourth-round pick out of BYU, started and had seven carries for 12 yards. ... RB Aaron Jones , taken in the fifth round from UTEP, caught a 5-yard TD pass from backup QB Todd Hundley in the second quarter. ... QB Taysom Hill, an undrafted free agent from BYU, led a seven-play, 65-yard TD drive in the fourth quarter that included his fourth-down run for a first down and his 23-yard scoring scamper for the winning points. He's competing with Joe Callahan for the third QB spot.\n\nWashington: RB Samaje Perine, a fourth-rounder from Oklahoma, ran for 45 yards on eight carries. He also caught a 29-yard pass from backup QB Colt McCoy, part of a much stronger performance for Perine than a week ago, when he fumbled.\n\nINJURIES\n\nGreen Bay: DE Dean Lowry hurt his left knee in the second quarter.\n\nWashington: RT Morgan Moses left after the game's second play, but returned later in the opening quarter.\n\nSITTING OUT\n\nThe Packers were without RB Ty Montgomery (leg), CB Davon House (hamstring) and CB Damarious Randall (concussion protocol). The Redskins were missing TE Jordan Reed (toe), LB Junior Galette (hamstring), S Su'a Cravens (knee) and WR Maurice Harris (knee).\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP) -- Aaron Rodgers made a surprise start and looked to be in midseason form, going 6 for 8 for 37 yards and a TD pass -- plus one of his trademark quick snaps to draw a penalty -- on his lone drive for Green Bay, while Kirk Cousins and the rest of Washington's first-team offense sputtered in the Packers' 21-17 exhibition victory Saturday night.\n\nThe Redskins did not manage to collect a single first down until the final play of the opening quarter, during their fourth possession of the evening. Their initial three resulted in an embarrassing total of 13 yards. Cousins was 2 for 6 for 9 yards in that span, while running back Rob Kelley gained 4 yards on three carries behind a starting offensive line that provided little push.\n\nWashington's fourth possession stalled when Kelley was stopped for no gain on fourth-and-1 at Green Bay's 27. After the fifth, Cousins had steered Washington to only three first downs -- one via a defensive penalty -- while completing 8 of 15 passes for 67 yards against a Packers secondary missing two of its top three cornerbacks. Cousins, who will earn about $24 million this season under a franchise tag, and his first-teamers stayed in for the entire first half and finally got going on drive No. 6, against defensive reserves.\n\nCousins completed a 43-yard pass to tight end Vernon Davis and a fourth-and-goal 4-yard touchdown toss to Jamison Crowder with 13 seconds left in the half to make things look a little better than they actually were for coach Jay Gruden's offense. Gruden has returned to calling plays this season after offensive coordinator Sean McVay left to coach the St. Louis Rams.\n\nSponsored Content: How is your agency managing and maximizing its data? Share your opinions in a Federal News Radio survey.\n\nPlaying on his 29th birthday, Cousins ended up 14 for 23 for 144 yards and the score. Kelley ran nine times for 9 yards.\n\nThe expectation was that Rodgers would sit out the second preseason game, just as he did a year ago. But he led the Packers 75 yards on 15 plays, capped by a 3-yard TD toss to new tight end Martellus Bennett with 5\u00bd minutes left in the first quarter, beating linebacker Zach Brown.\n\nRodgers also completed passes to Jordy Nelson, Randall Cobb and Davante Adams on the drive. On the third play, Rodgers hiked the ball as Redskins defensive lineman Stacy McGee was still trotting to the sideline, catching the hosts with 12 men on the field. The game officials didn't catch it, but Packers coach Mike McCarthy challenged, and a penalty was called after a replay review.\n\n\"I thought Aaron was excellent,\" McCarthy said. \"I thought the whole drive ... (was) exactly what you're looking for. A good run-pass mix.\"\n\nROOKIE WATCH\n\nGreen Bay: RB Jamaal Williams, a fourth-round pick out of BYU, started and had seven carries for 12 yards. ... RB Aaron Jones , taken in the fifth round from UTEP, caught a 5-yard TD pass from backup QB Todd Hundley in the second quarter. ... QB Taysom Hill, an undrafted free agent from BYU, led a seven-play, 65-yard TD drive in the fourth quarter that included his fourth-down run for a first down and his 23-yard scoring scamper for the winning points. He's competing with Joe Callahan for the third QB spot.\n\nGSA gives per diem travel rates another bump for 2018\n\nWashington: RB Samaje Perine, a fourth-rounder from Oklahoma, ran for 45 yards on eight carries. He also caught a 29-yard pass from backup QB Colt McCoy, part of a much stronger performance for Perine than a week ago, when he fumbled.\n\nINJURIES\n\nGreen Bay: DE Dean Lowry hurt his left knee in the second quarter.\n\nWashington: RT Morgan Moses left after the game's second play, but returned later in the opening quarter.\n\nSITTING OUT\n\nThe Packers were without RB Ty Montgomery (leg), CB Davon House (hamstring) and CB Damarious Randall (concussion protocol). The Redskins were missing TE Jordan Reed (toe), LB Junior Galette (hamstring), S Su'a Cravens (knee) and WR Maurice Harris (knee).\n\n___\n\nFor more AP NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and

Cousins was 2 for 6 for 9 yards in that span, while running back Rob Kelley gained 4 yards on three carries behind a starting offensive line that provided little push.\n\nWashington's fourth possession stalled when Kelley was stopped for no gain on fourth-and-1 at Green Bay's 27. After the fifth, Cousins had steered Washington to only three first downs - one via a defensive penalty - while completing 8 of 15 passes for 67 yards against a Packers secondary missing two of its top three cornerbacks. Cousins, who will earn about $24 million this season under a franchise tag, and his first-teamers stayed in for the entire first half and finally got going on drive No. 6, against defensive reserves.\n\nGreen Bay Packers tight end Martellus Bennett (80) pulls in a touchdown pass under pressure from Washington Redskins linebacker Zach Brown (53) during the first half of an NFL preseason football game in Landover, Md., Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017. (AP Photo/Mark Tenally)\n\nCousins completed a 43-yard pass to tight end Vernon Davis and a fourth-and-goal 4-yard touchdown toss to Jamison Crowder with 13 seconds left in the half to make things look a little better than they actually were for coach Jay Gruden's offense. Gruden has returned to calling plays this season after offensive coordinator Sean McVay left to coach the St. Louis Rams.\n\nPlaying on his 29th birthday, Cousins ended up 14 for 23 for 144 yards and the score. Kelley ran nine times for 9 yards.\n\nThe expectation was that Rodgers would sit out the second preseason game, just as he did a year ago. But he led the Packers 75 yards on 15 plays, capped by a 3-yard TD toss to new tight end Martellus Bennett with 5\u00bd minutes left in the first quarter, beating linebacker Zach Brown.\n\nRodgers also completed passes to Jordy Nelson, Randall Cobb and Davante Adams on the drive. On the third play, Rodgers hiked the ball as Redskins defensive lineman Stacy McGee was still trotting to the sideline, catching the hosts with 12 men on the field. The game officials didn't catch it, but Packers coach Mike McCarthy challenged, and a penalty was called after a replay review.\n\n\"I thought Aaron was excellent,\" McCarthy said. \"I thought the whole drive ... (was) exactly what you're looking for. A good run-pass mix.\"\n\nROOKIE WATCH\n\nGreen Bay: RB Jamaal Williams, a fourth-round pick out of BYU, started and had seven carries for 12 yards. ... RB Aaron Jones , taken in the fifth round from UTEP, caught a 5-yard TD pass from backup QB Todd Hundley in the second quarter. ... QB Taysom Hill, an undrafted free agent from BYU, led a seven-play, 65-yard TD drive in the fourth quarter that included his fourth-down run for a first down and his 23-yard scoring scamper for the winning points. He's competing with Joe Callahan for the third QB spot.\n\nWashington: RB Samaje Perine, a fourth-rounder from Oklahoma, ran for 45 yards on eight carries. He also caught a 29-yard pass from backup QB Colt McCoy, part of a much stronger performance for Perine than a week ago, when he fumbled.\n\nINJURIES\n\nGreen Bay: DE Dean Lowry hurt his left knee in the second quarter.\n\nWashington: RT Morgan Moses left after the game's second play, but returned later in the opening quarter.\n\nSITTING OUT\n\nThe Packers were without RB Ty Montgomery (leg), CB Davon House (hamstring) and CB Damarious Randall (concussion protocol). The Redskins were missing TE Jordan Reed (toe), LB Junior Galette (hamstring), S Su'a Cravens (knee) and WR Maurice Harris (knee).\n\n___\n\nFor more AP NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nGreen Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers (12) passes the ball during the first half of an NFL preseason football game against the Washington Redskins in Landover, Md., Saturday, Aug. 19, 2017.

Kelley ran nine times for 9 yards.\n\nThe expectation was that Rodgers would sit out the second preseason game, just as he did a year ago. But he led the Packers 75 yards on 15 plays, capped by a 3-yard TD toss to new tight end Martellus Bennett with 5\u00bd minutes left in the first quarter, beating linebacker Zach Brown.\n\nRodgers also completed passes to Jordy Nelson, Randall Cobb and Davante Adams on the drive. On the third play, Rodgers hiked the ball as Redskins defensive lineman Stacy McGee was still trotting to the sideline, catching the hosts with 12 men on the field. The game officials didn't catch it, but Packers coach Mike McCarthy challenged, and a penalty was called after a replay review.\n\n\"I thought Aaron was excellent,\" McCarthy said. \"I thought the whole drive ... (was) exactly what you're looking for. A good run-pass mix.\"\n\nROOKIE WATCH\n\nGreen Bay: RB Jamaal Williams, a fourth-round pick out of BYU, started and had seven carries for 12 yards. ... RB Aaron Jones , taken in the fifth round from UTEP, caught a 5-yard TD pass from backup QB Todd Hundley in the second quarter. ... QB Taysom Hill, an undrafted free agent from BYU, led a seven-play, 65-yard TD drive in the fourth quarter that included his fourth-down run for a first down and his 23-yard scoring scamper for the winning points. He's competing with Joe Callahan for the third QB spot.\n\nWashington: RB Samaje Perine, a fourth-rounder from Oklahoma, ran for 45 yards on eight carries. He also caught a 29-yard pass from backup QB Colt McCoy, part of a much stronger performance for Perine than a week ago, when he fumbled.\n\nINJURIES\n\nGreen Bay: DE Dean Lowry hurt his left knee in the second quarter.\n\nWashington: RT Morgan Moses left after the game's second play, but returned later in the opening quarter.\n\nSITTING OUT\n\nThe Packers were without RB Ty Montgomery (leg), CB Davon House (hamstring) and CB Damarious Randall (concussion protocol). The Redskins were missing TE Jordan Reed (toe), LB Junior Galette (hamstring), S Su'a Cravens (knee) and WR Maurice Harris (knee).", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:05:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim":

After forcing a three-and-out on the game's first possession, the unit had to go right back on the field after Packers WR Trevor Davis muffed a 56-yard punt.\n\nTaking over at the Green Bay 16-yard line, Washington couldn't do anything, though. CB Josh Hawkins broke up a second-down pass to the end zone for TE Trevor Davis, and the Redskins had to settle for a 34-yard field goal by K Dustin Hopkins.\n\nWith Rodgers starting, the Packers' offense got on the board. The chains first moved when the Packers successfully challenged that the Redskins had 12 men on the field. From there, Rodgers hit WR Jordy Nelson twice for 18 yards and WR Randall Cobb twice for 9. RB Jamaal Williams rushed five times for 15 yards. Rodgers scrambled 13 yards to convert a third-and-6 and put the ball in the red zone, and he finished the drive by connecting with TE Martellus Bennett on a 3-yard touchdown.\n\nThe 15-play drive covered 75 yards and consumed 7 minutes, 41 seconds, giving the Packers a 7-3 lead.\n\nGreen Bay's defense got another three-and-out, in essence its third straight to open the game. With the starters still in, rookie CB Kevin King made the tackle after a short pass reception, and S Ha Ha Clinton-Dix nearly picked off Washington QB Kirk Cousins' third-down pass. The ensuing punt was fielded by Davis for a 1-yard return.\n\nQB Brett Hundley took over for the Packers as the starters exited, and his first series did not go well. He was sacked on first down, and the offense was also flagged for delay of game on the drive, leading to a punt from deep in Green Bay territory. Rookie P Justin Vogel's 41-yard boot was returned 5 yards by former Packers DB Will Blackmon, giving the Redskins the ball near midfield.\n\nSecond quarter:\n\nWashington put together a late touchdown drive to close the first half, but the Packers took a 14-10 lead into the locker room at intermission.\n\nThe Packers' defense continued a strong start to the game. A defensive holding call on third down gave the Redskins a gift first down when Cousins was under siege, but on the ensuing series, a host of Packers stacked up RB Rob Kelley on fourth-and-1 from the Green Bay 27.\n\nHundley and the offense then got going. Two runs by rookie RB Aaron Jones picked up 10 yards, and Hundley hit Davis for 12 yards and WR Jeff Janis for 38 down the sideline for a first down in the red zone. A 7-yard catch-and-run by WR Geronimo Allison was preceded by a 5-yard TD pass to Jones in the flat, extending Green Bay's lead to 14-3 with 7:38 left in the half.\n\nWashington finally made a play of significance on offense, as Cousins connected with RB Chris Thompson for a 29-yard gain into Green Bay territory, but Green Bay's defense held from there, forcing another punt.\n\nHundley directed one first down with an 8-yard pass to Janis, but he was sacked on the next third down. Vogel's punt rolled dead at the Washington 22, good for 58 yards in all.\n\nJust after the two-minute warning, the Redskins got into scoring range on a 43-yard pass from Cousins to TE Vernon Davis. A 12-yard pass to WR Josh Doctson gave Washington a first down at the Green Bay 15. A 13-yard pass to Thompson made it first-and-goal, and then Thompson was stopped for a 2-yard loss. On third down, Thompson was held to no gain on a pass reception, and the Redskins decided to go for it from the 4.\n\nCousins found WR Jamison Crowder for the TD with 13 seconds left in the half.\n\nThird quarter:\n\nHundley stayed in the game to start the second half and appeared to have the Packers on the move, but his third-down completion to TE Emanuel Byrd was wiped out by a holding penalty. Hundley was then sacked on the replayed third down, and the Packers punted.\n\nWith Colt McCoy at quarterback, the Redskins got going on a 29-yard pass to rookie RB Samaje Perine. But S Kentrell Brice broke up a pass on second down, and McCoy threw incomplete on third down, leading to a punt.\n\nJoe Callahan took over at QB for the Packers but went three-and-out, with two incomplete passes and a sack.\n\nTaking over on the Green Bay 40, Washington drove for the go-ahead score. Perine rushed twice for 22 yards, and McCoy found TE Niles Paul for a 16-yard touchdown on third down. The Redskins led 17-14 with 5:30 left in the third.\n\nGreen Bay's offense went three-and-out again, with Callahan absorbing another sack.\n\nWashington drove out to midfield and faced

He finally got some in a game setting when the Green Bay Packers quarterback made a surprising appearance in Saturday's preseason game at Washington.\n\nAfter Bennett dropped a pass on Rodgers' first throw, the tight end showed why the Packers think he'll be so valuable, especially in the red zone. Bennett caught a 3-yard touchdown on what could be an unstoppable play for the Packers. Rodgers lofted a fade to Bennett, who easily snagged it over linebacker Zach Brown, a veteran who gives up 6 inches to Bennett.\n\n\"I think this is why you play the preseason,\" coach Mike McCarthy said in a halftime interview on the Packers' preseason TV network broadcast. \"You need those opportunities, create those opportunities for Marty and Aaron to have. Great execution.\"\n\nIt was the lone series for Rodgers and the No. 1 offense in the 21-17 victory over the Redskins at FedEx Field.\n\nHere's a look at other highlights from the Packers' second of four preseason games:\n\nQB depth chart: Brett Hundley played the rest of the first half and the first series of the first quarter after Rodgers' one and only series. Hundley battled shoddy protection, but directed a touchdown drive that included a 38-yard completion down the right sideline to Jeff Janis. Hundley finished 9-of-10 for 107 yards without an interception despite being sacked three times. Fourth-string QB Taysom Hill had an electrifying 23-yard scramble for a touchdown in the fourth quarter.\n\nWhen it was starters vs. starters, the Packers looked ...: like the potent offense everyone expects with a 15-yard, 75-play touchdown drive. The No. 1 defense once again held up well against the run. The Redskins had just 10 yards rushing on 11 attempts in the first half and only one rushing first down. Last week, the Packers held the Eagles to 47 rushing yards on 19 attempts.\n\nOne reason to be concerned: If the Packers were to lose one of their starting tackles -- David Bakhtiari and Bryan Bulaga -- they could be in trouble based on the way second-year pro Jason Spriggs played at left tackle Saturday. Spriggs allowed at least two sacks and might have been responsible for a third.\n\nThat guy could start: Josh Hawkins. The second-year former undrafted free agent put himself into the mix at cornerback. He got the start with Davon House (hamstring) and Damarious Randall (concussion) out. On the first series alone, Hawkins made a solid tackle on third-and-12 to force a punt, then broke up a pass in the end zone to tight end Vernon Davis after the Redskins continued the drive on a muffed punt. Later, Hawkins broke up a pass to Davis with a hard hit that jarred the ball lose, then broke up a would-be, 4-yard touchdown pass to receiver Ryan Grant.\n\nRookie watch: Only one of the Packers' top four draft picks played. That was cornerback Kevin King, who started. Fellow second-round pick Josh Jones was a surprise scratch. He got his right foot stepped on in practice Tuesday but was back on the field Wednesday. Third-round pick Montravius Adams (foot) and fourth-rounder Vince Biegel (foot) remain out indefinitely.\n\nMuffed punt: Trevor Davis, who lost the punt-return job last season when he fumbled against the Titans, muffed another one in the first quarter against the Redskins. It put Davis right back on the hot seat a week after he seemingly grabbed the job with a 68-yard return for a touchdown. Rookie cornerback King didn't help Davis because he never moved the gunner off his course and allowed him to get close to Davis.\n\nInjury report: Second-year defensive end Dean Lowry left in the first half with a knee injury. There was no immediate word on the severity. Lowry has been one of the most improved players in training camp this summer, and the Packers are a little thin on the defensive line with rookie Adams still out and Letroy Guion (released) gone. Linebacker Jordan Tripp, cornerback LaDarius Gunter and linebacker Derrick Mathews all left the game and were evaluated for concussions.\n\nPunting problems: Justin Vogel's first four hang times -- 3.9, 4.1, 3.6 and 3.81 seconds -- were not good enough. The rookie punter had been solid in practice and in the preseason opener before this outing. He finally got a good one off late in the third quarter -- a 54-yarder with 5.1 seconds of hang time. On seven punts, he played two inside the 20 and averaged 4.13 seconds of hang time.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:27:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7568627595901489, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374972", "time": "03:27:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375001", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "302611", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "score": 5}, {"id": "302622", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "score": 2}, {"id": "304975", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "score": 3}, {"id": "304976", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "score": 3}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 5}, {"id": "309400", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "score": 3}, {"id": "310124", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Washington Redskins"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Redskins", "score": 4}, {"id": "310129", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "End zone"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "score": 2}, {"id": "310743", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "score": 3}, {"id": "310749", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "score": 2}, {"id": "312020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "score": 4}, {"id": "312088", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Undrafted free agent"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent#Undrafted_free_agent", "score": 2}, {"id": "312167", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Concussion"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion", "score": 2}, {"id": "314205", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "score": 5}, {"id": "316239", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "score": 4}, {"id": "324223", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rush (gridiron football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(gridiron_football)", "score": 4}, {"id": "324226", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "score": 2}, {"id": "325505", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brett Hundley"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Hundley", "score": 3}, {"id": "325513", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Punt (gridiron football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)", "score": 3}, {"id": "326127", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Down (American and Canadian football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_(American_and_Canadian_football)", "score": 3}, {"id": "339018", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "score": 4}, {"id": "339019", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mike McCarthy (American football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_McCarthy_(American_football)", "score": 3}, {"id": "355413", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Martellus Bennett"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martellus_Bennett", "score": 4}, {"id": "362443", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Davon House"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davon_House", "score": 2}, {"id": "379283", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bryan Bulaga"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Bulaga", "score": 2}, {"id": "379294", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "David Bakhtiari"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bakhtiari", "score": 2}, {"id": "382911", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Grant"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Grant", "score": 2}, {"id": "410708", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Vernon Davis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_Davis", "score": 2}, {"id": "479659", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "FedExField"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedExField", "score": 3}, {"id": "489520", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Taysom Hill"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taysom_Hill", "score": 3}, {"id": "500201", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Zach Brown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Brown", "score": 3}], "image": "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0819%2Fr246373_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "timeCrawl": "03:27:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Packers' Aaron Rodgers-Martellus Bennett connection tough to stop in preseason debut", "originalArticle": null}

After forcing a three-and-out on the game's first possession, the unit had to go right back on the field after Packers WR Trevor Davis muffed a 56-yard punt.\n\nTaking over at the Green Bay 16-yard line, Washington couldn't do anything, though. CB Josh Hawkins broke up a second-down pass to the end zone for TE Trevor Davis, and the Redskins had to settle for a 34-yard field goal by K Dustin Hopkins.\n\nWith Rodgers starting, the Packers' offense got on the board. The chains first moved when the Packers successfully challenged that the Redskins had 12 men on the field. From there, Rodgers hit WR Jordy Nelson twice for 18 yards and WR Randall Cobb twice for 9. RB Jamaal Williams rushed five times for 15 yards. Rodgers scrambled 13 yards to convert a third-and-6 and put the ball in the red zone, and he finished the drive by connecting with TE Martellus Bennett on a 3-yard touchdown.\n\nThe 15-play drive covered 75 yards and consumed 7 minutes, 41 seconds, giving the Packers a 7-3 lead.\n\nGreen Bay's defense got another three-and-out, in essence its third straight to open the game. With the starters still in, rookie CB Kevin King made the tackle after a short pass reception, and S Ha Ha Clinton-Dix nearly picked off Washington QB Kirk Cousins' third-down pass. The ensuing punt was fielded by Davis for a 1-yard return.\n\nQB Brett Hundley took over for the Packers as the starters exited, and his first series did not go well.

Hawkins got the nod with Davon House and Damarious Randall sidelined and he rose to the occasion. In just the first half, Hawkins had a team-high five tackles and three pass break-ups, two of them on fades into the end zone. The coaches wanted to take a good look at the speedy Hawkins this week and after a really lousy practice on Wednesday, he got his act together. After Trevor Davis' fumble set up Washington deep in Packers territory, QB Kirk Cousins got TE Vernon Davis matched with Hawkins in the corner of the end zone. At the last second, Hawkins stuck his left hand out and knocked down the pass. Later, Hawkins drilled Davis on a pass across the middle, knocking the ball loose before Davis could make a move upfield. Finally, on Washington's final drive of the half, Hawkins again got tested in the corner of the end zone, this time on a throw to receiver Ryan Grant. Hawkins reached up with his 32 \u00bc-inch length arm and tipped the ball away. The performance puts Hawkins in a much stronger position heading into the third game as he battles for a spot on the 53-man roster.\n\nThumbs down\n\nThe Packers would like to be a lot further along with their backup offensive line than they are. But the truth is, they've got the potential for big problems if the backups keep playing like this. The interior position didn't look any more promising with Lucas Patrick, Justin McCray and Kofi Amichia all looking overmatched at times. McCray and Amichia had holding penalties at the start of the third quarter when the Packers were trying to re-establish their offense. McCray's penalty wiped out a 21-yard completion from Brett Hundley to TE Emanuel Byrd. Those three weren't the only ones struggling. For the second straight game, left tackle Jason Spriggs gave up a bad sack. He was beaten around the corner by LB Chris Carter on third down, a play after McCray was called for holding. Spriggs, a second-round pick last year, is going to be in a critical position this year, probably playing top back at four different positions.\n\nPreseason Week 2 photos: Packers at Washington Fullscreen Green Bay Packers tight end Martellus Bennett (80) catches a pass for a touchdown against linebacker Zach Brown (53) of the Washington Redskins Saturday, August 19, 2017 at Fedex Field in Landover, MD.

LB Jordan Tripp, LB Derrick Mathews and CB LaDarius Gunter left in the third quarter to be evaluated for concussions. Those who did not suit up for the Packers were S JoshJones (ankle), DT Montravius Adams (foot), CB Damarious Randall (concussion), WR Malachi Dupre (concussion), CB Davon House (hamstring), RB William Stanback (unspecified), C Don Barclay (ankle), WR Colby Pearson (ankle), RB Ty Montgomery (leg), and TE Aaron Peck (neck) did not play.\n\nBits and pieces\n\n\" Quarterback Aaron Rodgers indicated Saturday on Twitter after giving away four tickets to the game that he would be playing. Coach Mike McCarthy had not said this week whether Rodgers would play.\n\n\" Punt returner Trevor Davis has to catch the ball, but a big reason he muffed his first punt return was because rookie CB Kevin King missed his block on the gunner. As soon as Davis looked up, the defender was in his face and he looked like he tried to protect himself before securing the catch.\n\n\" McCarthy was on point with his instant replay challenges. He won both of them in the first half, one asserting Washington had 12 players on the field and the other that Vernon Davis had not held on long enough for a catch on the play in which Hawkins knocked the ball loose.\n\n\" Wide receiver Jeff Janis caught two passes for 46 yards, giving him three for 66 (22.0) in the preseason.\n\n\" Linebacker Joe Thomas got beat for a pair of receptions, including a 29-yarder on a wheel route to running back Chris Thompson in the second quarter.\n\n\" On the 3-yard touchdown pass from Rodgers to TE Martellus Bennett, Washington played its base defense because the Packers had two tight ends on the field. Bennett lined up as a receiver and was matched up on a linebacker.\n\nQuote of the day\n\n\"I thought Aaron was excellent.

The Washington Redskins may have been one of only three NFL teams to average more than 400 yards per game last season, but if you needed a reminder of how little that matters now, just watch them learning to crawl again this preseason.\n\nOn Saturday, for a second straight exhibition game, quarterback Kirk Cousins and the first-team offense floundered about, causing some level of concern over how long it will take this reconstructed unit to mesh. The 21-17 loss to the Green Bay Packers may be premature to develop too many grand opinions about the offense, especially with tight end Jordan Reed out and several wide receivers recovering from injury or working to gain better chemistry with Cousins. But it's safe to assume that this small sample size speaks to a transition going on within Washington's best unit. There is considerable change, from Coach Jay Gruden taking over play-calling to Terrelle Pryor Sr. getting acclimated, and the team has just three weeks to develop cohesion before the regular season begins.\n\nIt raises the question: What if the offense struggles early?\n\n\"We're a work in progress,\" Gruden admitted late Saturday night. \"No question about that.\"\n\nIn two seasons with Cousins as the starter, the trend has been that the offense starts a little slow and then takes off in the second half. But with Washington undergoing another defensive makeover, it would be helpful if the offense has a strong start to the season. If that doesn't happen, what will Washington rely on at the start?\n\nAfter a poor showing in limited action against Baltimore, the first-team offense looked bad for a longer stretch against Green Bay at FedEx Field. In its first five possessions, Cousins and Co. managed just 76 yards and three points, which came after Niles Paul recovered a fumbled punt. On that scoring drive, the offense didn't gain a yard. It ran three frustrating plays and then watched Dustin Hopkins kick a 34-yard field goal.\n\n[Starting offense again spins its wheels in 21-17 loss to the Packers]\n\nEven after the Packers substituted most of their starters, Washington had little success. Finally, during the starting offense's sixth drive, against Green Bay's backups, our curiosity was satisfied: What would it take for Washington to reach the end zone?\n\nIt took a 43-yard pass from Cousins to tight end Vernon Davis. And later, with 17 seconds left in an exasperating first half, Cousins hit Jamison Crowder for a four-yard touchdown pass on fourth down to stop the ridiculousness.\n\nAt least the first-team offense left the game with the memory of doing something positive.\n\nThen again, it was against a bunch of special teams players.\n\nIn that final drive, the offense gained 78 yards on 10 plays. In Washington's first 24 plays, it managed just 76 yards. Cousins wound up 14 of 23 for 144 yards and one touchdown, but at one point, he was just 8 of 16 for 67 yards.\n\n\"It took a little while,\" Gruden said. \"We stuttered and sputtered and missed a few throws.\"\n\nHe and Pryor, his new big target, are still searching for a rhythm. Pryor caught one pass for 11 yards, and he let another go through his hands. Cousins also missed him on what could have been a touchdown, throwing an inaccurate pass to Crowder underneath instead.\n\nIt's no shock that Cousins and his receivers aren't sharp. Washington is trying to replace two 1,000-yard receivers, DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon. While the offense still has plenty of talent and Gruden's system has been productive over the years, there was bound to be an adjustment. The problem seems even greater because Reed isn't available. If anything, that's the biggest lesson of the preseason thus far: Reed's importance to this offense is at an all-time high. When he's not available, it won't be as easy to turn to the next man up. Washington will suffer more than it ever has without him.\n\n[Redskins-Packers analysis: Team starts slow again but finally finds end zone]\n\nBut the passing game's early struggles are understandable. It was more discouraging to watch the run game provide nothing. When Cousins was directing the offense, the running backs gained just 10 yards on 11 carries. Washington couldn't run on first down, and Reed wasn't on the field to catch those short passes to ignite drives. As a result, the offense had nothing it could bank on during early downs.\n\nGruden has an interesting task. Eventually, talent will take over, and Washington will move the ball. But the coach may have to be even more clever than usual to put these particular players in the best positions to succeed. Cousins is going to have to develop greater trust in some of his receivers over the next three weeks. And while Gruden's system is still very sound, the system alone can't replace the production of Garcon and Jackson. They will be missed. Garcon's tough catches and possession-receiving gifts gave the passing game stability. Jackson's speed and threat to score a touchdown at any time created space for everyone in a way that can't be replicated, not even by Pryor.\n\n\"We all believe we've got a lot of work to do,\" Cousins said.\n\nSo Gruden isn't merely fitting prototypes into his way of doing things. These aren't just new pieces for the same puzzle. The skeleton of a good offense remains. But how long will it take for this unit to reach its potential?\n\nThat question is growing more urgent every time you catch a glimpse of this Washington football team\n\nMore Redskins

Hill rushed six times for 38 yards and completed six of 11 passes for 49 yards.\n\nBrett Hundley, another of the four quarterbacks the Packers used, was 9-for-10 for 107 yards and another score.\n\nCousins finished 14-for-23 for 144 yards and one touchdown.\n\nDallas 24, Indianapolis 19: Dak Prescott connected with Dez Bryant for a 32-yard touchdown on their first series of the preseason and rookie Cooper Rush threw two more scoring passes in the Cowboys' win over the visiting Colts. Scott Tolzien played the first half at quarterback for the Colts, but their only touchdown before halftime was Lavar Edwards' 15-yard return of Dallas backup quarterback Kellen Moore's fumble. Darren McFadden looked like a capable fill-in for Ezekiel Elliott, who is suspended for the first six games, with 59 yards on nine carries, but he was stripped of the ball by Matthias Farley on his final run late in the first quarter.\n\nTennessee 34, Carolina 27: Marcus Mariota went 6-for-8 for 61 yards and a touchdown as the Titans, who led 17-0 in the first quarter, beat the Panthers in Nashville. Turnovers set up two of the early scores, and Tennessee needed another turnover -- a sack and forced fumble by Aaron Wallace that Jimmy Staten recovered at the 3-yard line -- to set up David Fluellen's touchdown with 1:55 left to play for the win.\n\nKansas City 30, Cincinnati 12: Rookie Patrick Mahomes threw a pair of touchdown passes and two other Chiefs quarterbacks also threw for scores in a win over the host Bengals. Mahomes, the 10th overall pick from Texas Tech, was 10-for-14 for 88 yards with touchdowns of 1 and 7 yards. Alex Smith was 8-for-9 for 83 yards with a TD, and Tyler Bray threw an 18-yard touchdown pass on his first play.\n\nDetroit 16, New York Jets 6: Matthew Stafford threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Marvin Jones in the second quarter, and the host Lions shut down Christian Hackenberg and the Jets. After losing defensive lineman Kerry Hyder to an Achilles' tendon injury in their preseason opener at Indianapolis, the Lions were still able to pressure Hackenberg early on.", "dateTime":

That internal sonar, hibernating all offseason, detected a blip. Defensive tackle Stacy McGee was late reaching the sideline, leaving an extra defender on the field.\n\nRodgers doesn't miss such mistakes. Not even in August.\n\nThe Packers hustled to the line of scrimmage. Washington scurried aimlessly. Officials needed a review to confirm Washington indeed had 12 defenders on the field, but Rodgers already knew. It was preseason for everybody else.\n\nOn Saturday night, Rodgers took no time to show he's ready for the regular season.\n\nCAMP INSIDER: Josh Hawkins gets act together\n\nIntroducing two new tight ends and an inexperienced backfield, coach Mike McCarthy wanted to see how the Packers' new-look offense operated with its starting quarterback. After playing only in the third exhibition last August, Rodgers debuted a week earlier this year. McCarthy couldn't have gotten better results.\n\nRodgers conducted a 15-play drive that lasted half of the opening quarter, highlighting a good first half for the Packers' offense and defense in a 21-17 victory over Washington at FedEx Field.\n\nHe finished 6-of-8 for 37 yards, one touchdown to tight end Martellus Bennett and a 123.4 rating, but those numbers don't entirely describe his sharpness.\n\nOn a trio of third downs during the Packers' opening drive, Rodgers showed his versatility. He converted each in a different way.\n\nPreseason Week 2 photos: Packers at Washington Fullscreen Green Bay Packers inside linebacker Jake Ryan (47) hits defensive back Joshua Holsey (20) in the backfield against the Washington Redskins Saturday, August 19, 2017 at Fedex Field in Landover, MD.

His arm rifled a slant to receiver Davante Adams, picking up 6 yards on third-and-3. His legs picked up 13 yards on third-and-6, crossing the red zone.\n\nA drive that started on the Packers' 25-yard line soon concluded in the end zone.\n\nRodgers' six completions were to four different targets, including each of his top three receivers. Jordy Nelson, also playing one possession after sitting out the preseason opener, led with two catches for 19 yards. Randall Cobb had two catches for nine yards. Adams' lone reception was the third-down catch, and Bennett's lone reception was the touchdown.\n\nThe Packers used their two-tight end package heavily on the opening drive, exposing Bennett and Lance Kendricks to how quickly the offense runs under Rodgers' management. With running back Ty Montgomery sitting out with an injury he has described only as a \"soft-tissue\" ailment in his lower body, rookie Jamaal Williams started alongside Rodgers.\n\nWilliams found little running room, finishing with 12 yards on seven carries. Fellow rookie Aaron Jones was next in line and finished with 14 yards on three carries. Rookie Devante Mays was third to receive snaps and finished with 13 yards on five carries.\n\nJones also flashed his receiving potential out of the backfield, catching a 5-yard touchdown pass from backup quarterback Brett Hundley in the right flat. Jones didn't run as far after his three other receptions, finishing with 11 yards on four catches. After struggling last week against the Philadelphia Eagles, the Packers' screen game still needs work.\n\nFollowing a solid preseason debut against the Eagles, Hundley had an even better showing in Washington. Behind a shaky backup offensive line, Hundley was sacked three times but managed to complete 9 of 10 passes for 107 yards, one touchdown and a 144.6 rating.\n\nHundley engineered a seven-play, 73-yard touchdown drive that consumed just under four minutes midway through the second quarter. He had his best throw of the preseason on a 38-yard reception to Jeff Janis, dropping the football over his receiver's shoulder down the right sideline. The duo also connected for a touchdown against the Eagles.\n\nJanis led the Packers' receivers with three catches for 63 yards. Geronimo Allison had two catches for 32 yards, gaining yards after the catch with sharp juke moves following each.\n\nThe Packers' starting defense played only two series, but it dominated Washington's starting offense. Its lone points allowed came after receiver Trevor Davis fumbled a punt, giving Washington possession at the Packers' 16-yard line. The Packers held on three plays, forcing Washington to settle for a 34-yard field goal from Dustin Hopkins.\n\nAfter the second series, outside linebackers Clay Matthews and Nick Perry and safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix were done for the night. Washington kept its starters on the field, including quarterback Kirk Cousins. As more and more backups joined the Packers' defense, it held almost the entire way.\n\nWashington finally found the end zone for a 4-yard touchdown pass from Cousins to receiver Jamison Crowder on fourth-and-goal 13 seconds before halftime.\n\nThe Packers will continue their preseason action Saturday when they travel to the Denver Broncos.\n\nSkip in Skipx\n\nEmbed\n\nx\n\nShare\n\nCLOSEVIDEOS FROM GREEN BAY PACKERS TRAINING CAMP 2017Taysom Hill learning from the best at QB | 1:03\n\nGreen Bay Packers quarterback Taysom Hill spoke about his development as a quarterback and what he's learning from Mike McCarthy and Aaron Rodgers.

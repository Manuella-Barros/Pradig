{"id": 223754648, "title": "Strictly Come Dancing\u2019s Giovanni Pernice \u2018sent celebrity partner an offensive video\u2019 before live show", "text": "Giovanni Pernice allegedly sent one of his Strictly Come Dancing celebrity partners an offensive video clip ahead of filming for the live show, reports have claimed. There has been speculation over the professional dancer\u2019s behaviour since Sherlock star Amanda Abbington requested \u201ctense footage\u201d of her rehearsals with the pro after she unexpectedly quit the show in 2023. The BBC team investigating allegations of workplace misconduct against Pernice, 33, are said to have been told the dancer sent the clip to his partner at the time via Whatsapp. Speaking to The Sun, the source claimed Pernice did not appear in or make the video but that its contents had been highly offensive to the woman who received it. \u201cThe BBC was told about the video clip and that someone found the content completely inappropriate, grossly offensive,\u201d they told the publication. They added the celebrity was \u201cshocked\u201d and \u201cupset\u201d to receive the video on WhatsApp, hours before the couple \u201cwere meant to be dancing together on live television\u201d. \u2018They were told they felt intimidated by it,\u201d the source claimed. The source did not name the woman who was said to have received the clip. The Independent has contacted the BBC and Giovanni Pernice for comment. It comes days after Pernice made a statement addressing the allegations surrounding his teaching methods on Strictly Come Dancing. Writing in a post on Instagram, Pernice said on Sunday (19 May) that he denies all claims of \u201cabusive or threatening behaviour\u201d and is looking forward to proving his innocence. Addressing his fans, the dancer wrote: \u201cYou will be as surprised as I am that allegations have been made about my dance teaching methods in the media this week.\u201d The Strictly star described himself as \u201cpassionate\u201d, \u201ccompetitive\u201d and \u201cambitious\u201d, but rejected the insinuation that his behaviour had ever become \u201cabusive\u201d. \u201cI have always striven to help them be the very best dancers they can be,\u201d he said of his celebrity dance partners. \u201cThis has always come from a place of love and wanting to win \u2013 for me and my dance partners,\u201d Pernice concluded, thanking his fans for their \u201ccontinued love and support\u201d. While the 33-year-old has denied any claims of wrongdoing, it was alleged earlier this year that the Italian dancer had caused difficulties with two other former celebrity partners during their time on the show. Reports claimed that Good Morning Britain presenter Ranvir Singh and former Love Island host Laura Whitmore, who previously said she was \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with Pernice, had a \u201ctearful summit\u201d with Abbington about their respective \u201cdifficult experiences\u201d with the dancer, \u201cwho is well known to be intense during training\u201d. Speaking on The Mirror\u2019s Invite Only podcast in March, Pernice said his reputation as a \u201cperfectionist\u201d comes from \u201ccaring\u201d about the celebrity he\u2019s partnered with, stating: \u201cIn every single part of the world, if [you\u2019re] a professional dancer, we have to get these people on the Saturday night looking the best as they can.\u201d A release date for Strictly Come Dancing 2024 is yet to be announced. As per the terms and conditions: \u201cThe recording of the Strictly Come Dancing launch show will take place in September 2024 \u2013 exact date to be confirmed.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Professional dancer is the subject of a BBC investigation into allegations of workplace misconduct </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/giovanni-pernice-strictly-come-dancing-video-b2551816.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/04/04/10/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/BwotP2Lm-4VHSaSK0.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:08:24", "author": "Lydia Spencer-elliott", "authors": ["Lydia Spencer-elliott"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.067}

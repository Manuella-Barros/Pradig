{"id": 223771592, "title": "The Top 10 Quarterbacks Heading into the 2024 NFL Season", "text": "One of the more fun debates in sports is who the top quarterbacks are in the ever-changing world of the NFL. Each season we see new names emerge and older ones recede. Entering into the 2024 season, it's no different. There is more talent than almost ever before within the league at the quarterback position.Many teams have their franchise quarterback, while others are hoping for the best in the new year. But who are the best in the league? Here are the top-10 quarterbacks entering into the new 2024 season.Honorable Mention: C. J. Stroud, Houston TexansStroud doesn't make the cut simply because we only have one year of tape on him. He was one of the best quarterbacks in the league last season but we need to see it consistently. If he performs at a similar rate this year, he easily slots into the top 10.10. Jared Goff, Detroit Lions2023 stats: 4,575 yards, 30 touchdowns, 12 interceptionsOnce thought of as an afterthought in Detroit, Goff has improved his game to create a new narrative. He led the Lions to the NFC Championship game last season, in the process winning the franchise's two first playoff games in over 30 years.9. Tua Tagovailoa, Miami Dolphins2023 stats: 4,624 yards, 29 touchdowns, 14 interceptionsTagovailoa may be one of the more controversial members of this list because he can be so inconsistent at times. But in all reality, he is a good quarterback and showed it this past season. His job is made easy by the Dolphins' offensive schemes but he still needs to execute them. This coming year will tell us a lot about how far he can go as the leading man in Miami.8. Dak Prescott, Dallas Cowboys2023 stats: 4,516 yards, 26 touchdowns, 9 interceptionsLove him or hate him, Prescott is a good quarterback in the NFL. He gets a lot of hate for being on the Cowboys but he has improved his play over the years. Prescot has worked on his decision-making in games, which has allowed him to find more success. Dallas will be under a lot of pressure this season, with Prescott at the front of things leading the charge.7. Justin Herbert, Los Angeles Chargers2023 stats: 3,134 yards, 20 touchdowns, 7 interceptionsHerbert still has one of the strongest arms in the entire league but his status has taken a hit of late. After a collapse in the postseason two seasons ago, he followed that up with an inconsistent year. Now entering 2024, his offensive weapons are all gone and he will have to make it work with mainly younger players. He has the talent to make things happen, but we need to see more from him going forward.6. Aaron Rodgers, New York Jets2023 stats: N/ARodgers was injured just a few plays into his 2023 season, spoiling his first year in New York. Coming off a torn Achilles, Rodgers will have to prove that he can perform the way he did pre-injury. The 40-year-old is one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever play the game so many believe that he will be fine. New York has a ton of weapons for him to work with, giving thought to the Jets being competitive this season.5. Josh Allen, Buffalo Bills2023 stats: 4,306 yards, 29 touchdowns, 18 interceptionsThe Bills may take a step back this season but Allen remains one of the best quarterbacks in the league. His size alone makes him tough to play against and he has been better about putting himself into bad situations. One of the biggest improvements that he needs to make is with his turnovers. Allen is still prone to turning the ball over at a high rate and until he fixes that, Buffalo may not reach its full potential.4. Jalen Hurts, Philadelphia Eagles2023 stats: 3,858 yards, 28 touchdowns, 15 interceptions2023 was a strange season for Hurts as the Eagles started the year on fire. They then hit a slump in the middle part of the season and never looked back. Philadelphia was bounced early in the playoffs and will be looking for some redemption this year. Hurts' dual-threat ability makes him a tough assignment for defenses to scheme against.3. Joe Burrow, Cincinnati Bengals2023 stats: 2,309, 15 touchdowns, 6 interceptionsBurrow only played in 10 games last season due to injury and a few of those, he was hobbled. His wrist is healthy now and he is ready to remind the league what he is capable of. Burrow is one of the most accurate passers in the NFL and still has one of the best wide-receiving cores to work with.2. Lamar Jackson, Baltimore Ravens2023 stats: 3,678 yards, 24 touchdowns, 7 interceptionsJackson is the reigning league MVP and dominated everyone a year ago. He earned his second MVP award in 2023, and he has seemingly gotten better each season. Under offensive coordinator Todd Monken, Jackson took his game to new heights. His dual-threat ability makes him dangerous for opponents and he will be looking for redemption after falling in the AFC Championship game.1. Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City Chiefs2023 stats: 4,183 yards, 27 touchdowns, 14 interceptionsThis is the easiest pick from this list as Mahomes is far and away the best quarterback in the league. Kansas City enters this season as the two-time defending champion (and winners of three of the last four Super Bowls), so until someone knocks him off, this is his spot to lose.", "summary": "Who are the ten best quarterbacks entering the 2024 season?", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/sports/nfl/top-10-quarterbacks-heading-2024-nfl-season-1904789", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2399213/joe-burrow-lamar-jackson.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 17:00:01", "author": "Matt Levine", "authors": ["Matt Levine"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.216}

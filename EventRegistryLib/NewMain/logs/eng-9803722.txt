Escape", "body": "A top Spanish judge demanded explanations on Friday from police and government as to how fugitive Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont was able to return to Spain despite a pending arrest warrant and vanish again.\n\nSupreme Court Judge Pablo Llarena, who had issued the arrest warrant for Puigdemont, requested answers specifically from Catalonia's regional police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra.\n\nPuigdemont, who fled abroad after leading a failed 2017 independence bid for Catalonia, defied the warrant to return to Spain on Thursday and delivered a speech to thousands gathered at the Catalan regional parliament in Barcelona before escaping.\n\nHe had been expected to try to enter the parliament building for the investiture vote to pick a new leader for the wealthy northeastern region but instead disappeared into the crowd.\n\nCatalonia's regional police said it had arrested two officers, including one who owned the car used by Puigdemont to leave the scene.\n\nThe force, which has launched a manhunt for 61-year-old Puigdemont, denied there had been any collusion and insisted officers had planned to arrest him \"at the most opportune time so as not to generate public disorder\".\n\nPuigdemont \"took advantage of the numbers of people around him and fled the scene in a vehicle that the Mossos tried to stop but failed\" the force said on Thursday.\n\nJudge Llarena also asked the interior ministry for details of its plan to arrest him at the border as well as \"the orders that were issued\" to capture Puigdemont \"after his escape\".\n\nThe judge sought the names of \"the agents responsible for the design of the operation, those responsible for its approval and those who have been entrusted with its execution or operational deployment\".\n\nPuigdemont's lawyer, Gonzalo Boye, told Catalan radio on Friday that his client had fled abroad again, without giving details.\n\nThe secretary general of Puigdemont's hardline JxCAT party Jordi Turull said \"he is going back to Waterloo\", the Belgian city where he spent most of the seven years he has been in self-imposed exile.\n\nPuigdemont led the regional government in 2017, when it pushed ahead with an independence referendum despite a court ban, followed by a short-lived declaration of independence.\n\nHe fled Spain shortly after the failed independence bid to avoid prosecution and has since lived in Belgium and more recently France.\n\nSpain's parliament passed an amnesty law in May for those involved in the secession bid, but the Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that the measure would not fully apply to Puigdemont.\n\nTurull said Puigdemont had not planned to return to Catalonia and then escape but changed his plans when he saw the massive security presence.\n\nIt was not foreseen \"that there would be a police deployment that we have not seen in Catalonia for the biggest criminal, terrorist, drug trafficker,\" Turull told Catalan radio.\n\n\"The first scenario was that he could return to benefit.. from the amnesty law,\" he added.\n\nThe leader of the main opposition Popular Party, Alberto Nunez Feijoo, has called Puigdemont's return to Spain an \"unbearable humiliation\" that damaged the country's image.\n\nSpanish Justice Minister Felix Bolanos said on Friday the operation to arrest Puigdemont \"was the responsibility of the Mossos\", whose job it was to enforce court orders in Catalonia.\n\n\"In Spain the law must be respected and court orders must be complied with,\" the minister said.\n\nCatalonia's parliament on Thursday elected Salvador Illa of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialists as Catalonia's first head not from the pro-independence movement since 2010.",

The 61-year-old initially lived in Belgium after bolting from Spain in 2017, but his latest place of residence wasn't known.\n\nPuigdemont kept his travel plans secret before setting out to the wealthy Catalan region in northeastern Spain. He gave a speech in front of a large crowd of supporters in central Barcelona under the noses of police officers, who made no attempt to detain him.\n\nAfter his speech, in a cloak-and-dagger moment, Puigdemont went into an adjacent marquee tent. There, he hurried out of an exit and jumped into a waiting car that sped away, according to an Associated Press photographer who witnessed his departure.\n\nCatalan police arrested two of their own officers for their alleged involvement in Puigdemont's getaway, suspecting that the former leader used the private car of one of them, the force's press office told The Associated Press. No further details were available.\n\nAfter Puigdemont vanished, Catalan police -- called Mossos d'Esquadra -- checked vehicles across the city of around 1.6 million people and others heading on highways to neighboring France in an effort to nab him. The checks were called off hours later.\n\nPuigdemont shared later a video of his speech on Instagram with the message \"We're still here. Long live free Catalonia.\"\n\nOfficers initially held back from swooping to arrest Puigdemont out of concern the move might \"cause public disorder,\" a police statement said. Officers tried to stop the fleeing vehicle, but were unable to do so, it said, though it added that further arrests were expected. The statement didn't elaborate.\n\nThe Catalan police force operates separately from Spain's Polic\u00eda Nacional. At the time of the 2017 ballot, the Spanish government suspended the Mossos' chief and placed the force under investigation for failing to stop the vote. The chief and his staff were eventually exonerated.\n\nPuigdemont faces charges of embezzlement for his part in an attempt to break Catalonia away from the rest of Spain in 2017. As regional president and separatist party leader at the time, he was a key player in the independence referendum that was outlawed by the central government but went ahead anyway.\n\nThose events triggered a political crisis that roiled Spain for months.\n\nPuigdemont's appearance in Barcelona, Catalonia's capital, and his game of cat-and-mouse with police, stole the show on a day when a new president was being proclaimed at the regional parliament.\n\nLocal police were deployed in a security ring around a section of the park where Catalonia's parliament building is located behind walls, and where Puigdemont was expected to go after his speech. Meanwhile, the politician, wearing a dark suit, white shirt and tie, walked with supporters to the nearby stage where he gave his speech.\n\nAddressing the crowd in the park and at times pumping his fist, Puigdemont accused Spanish authorities of \"a crackdown\" on the Catalan separatist movement.\n\n\"For the last seven years we have been persecuted because we wanted to hear the voice of the Catalan people,\" Puigdemont said. \"They have made being Catalan into something suspicious.\"\n\nHe added: \"All people have the right to self-determination.\"\n\nThe gripping turn of events, broadcast live on Spanish television channels, was likely to bring political recriminations.\n\nThe leader of the Popular Party, the main opposition to Spain's left-of-center coalition government which has long rebuffed Catalonia's independence movement, condemned Puigdemont's return. Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o posted on X that Puigdemont's reappearance was an \"unbearable humiliation\" that damaged Spain's reputation.\n\nSpain's government encouraged a deal brokered after months of deadlock between Salvador Illa's Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) and the other main Catalan separatist party and left-wing Esquerra Republicana (ERC). That deal ensured just enough support in Catalonia's parliament for Illa to become the next regional president Thursday with 68 votes in the 135-seat chamber.\n\nIlla's new government is the first non pro-independence government in 14 years, since the PSC last held power.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Emilio Morenatti and Teresa Medrano of The Associated Press.\n\nCatalan independence leader and former President Carles Puigdemont addresses supporters after his arrival near the Catalan parliament to attend the investiture debate in Barcelona, Spain, Thursday Aug. 8, 2024.

"Spanish judge demands explanations over Puigdemont's escape", "body": "A top Spanish judge demanded explanations on Friday from police and government as to how fugitive Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont was able to return to Spain despite a pending arrest warrant and vanish again.\n\nSupreme Court Judge Pablo Llarena, who had issued the arrest warrant for Puigdemont, requested answers specifically from Catalonia's regional police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra.\n\nPuigdemont, who fled abroad after leading a failed 2017 independence bid for Catalonia, defied the warrant to return to Spain on Thursday and delivered a speech to thousands gathered at the Catalan regional parliament in Barcelona before escaping.\n\nHe had been expected to try to enter the parliament building for the investiture vote to pick a new leader for the wealthy northeastern region but instead disappeared into the crowd.\n\nCatalonia's regional police said it had arrested two officers, including one who owned the car used by Puigdemont to leave the scene.\n\nThe force, which has launched a manhunt for 61-year-old Puigdemont, denied there had been any collusion and insisted officers had planned to arrest him \"at the most opportune time so as not to generate public disorder\".\n\nPuigdemont \"took advantage of the numbers of people around him and fled the scene in a vehicle that the Mossos tried to stop but failed\" the force said on Thursday.\n\nJudge Llarena also asked the interior ministry for details of its plan to arrest him at the border as well as \"the orders that were issued\" to capture Puigdemont \"after his escape\".\n\nThe judge sought the names of \"the agents responsible for the design of the operation, those responsible for its approval and those who have been entrusted with its execution or operational deployment\".\n\nPuigdemont's lawyer, Gonzalo Boye, told Catalan radio on Friday that his client had fled abroad again, without giving details.\n\nThe secretary general of Puigdemont's hardline JxCAT party Jordi Turull said \"he is going back to Waterloo\", the Belgian city where he spent most of the seven years he has been in self-imposed exile.\n\n- 'Law must be respected' - More from this section Tebogo upstages Covid-hit Lyles, 'Super Syd' roars to world record Apple makes changes to App Store after EU warning Kids Worldwide Are Consuming More Sugary Drinks\n\nPuigdemont led the regional government in 2017, when it pushed ahead with an independence referendum despite a court ban, followed by a short-lived declaration of independence.\n\nHe fled Spain shortly after the failed independence bid to avoid prosecution and has since lived in Belgium and more recently France.\n\nSpain's parliament passed an amnesty law in May for those involved in the secession bid, but the Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that the measure would not fully apply to Puigdemont.\n\nTurull said Puigdemont had not planned to return to Catalonia and then escape but changed his plans when he saw the massive security presence.\n\nIt was not foreseen \"that there would be a police deployment that we have not seen in Catalonia for the biggest criminal, terrorist, drug trafficker,\" Turull told Catalan radio.\n\n\"The first scenario was that he could return to benefit.. from the amnesty law,\" he added.\n\nThe leader of the main opposition Popular Party, Alberto Nunez Feijoo, has called Puigdemont's return to Spain an \"unbearable humiliation\" that damaged the country's image.\n\nSpanish Justice Minister Felix Bolanos said on Friday the operation to arrest Puigdemont \"was the responsibility of the Mossos\", whose job it was to enforce court orders in Catalonia.\n\n\"In Spain the law must be respected and court orders must be complied with,\" the minister said.\n\nCatalonia's parliament on Thursday elected Salvador Illa of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialists as Catalonia's first head not from the pro-independence movement since 2010.\n\ndu-mdm/ds/ach", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Puigdemont says the vote was legal and therefore the charges linked to it have no basis.\n\nA Mossos spokesman said there was no prior arrangement with Puigdemont for his arrest and the force had decided the detention should be made \"at the most appropriate time so as not to generate public disorder.\"\n\nPuigdemont ally Laura Borras described the arrested officer on X as \"a patriot and exemplary Mosso.\"\n\nThe hunt for Puigdemont created traffic chaos in Barcelona and near the border with France as police set up roadblocks and searched car boots.\n\nIn Barcelona, several Puigdemont supporters clashed with police in a bid to breach the cordon surrounding the park housing the regional parliament building. Officers clad in riot gear used batons and pepper spray to deter them.\n\nReacting to news that Puigdemont had again absconded from under the noses of a large police deployment, a Supreme Court source said a judge had been clear in his instructions that the former Catalan president was to be arrested.\n\n\"The Mossos know that they have a detention order. The judge's writ reminded the state security forces that the national arrest warrant for aggravated embezzlement remained active and they had the obligation to detain him and bring him before the courts.\"\n\nTwo national police unions also criticised the failure to arrest Puigdemont.\n\n\"Where are the Mossos? The best-paid police force in Spain incapable of doing their job, of arresting the coup-monger and fugitive from justice Puigdemont,\" police union Jusapol said on X.\n\nTwo sources with links to the Catalan government said it had identified a problem with some rogue Mossos, who appear to be loyal to Puigdemont.\n\nAlberto Nunez Feijoo, leader of the Spain's opposition People\u00b4s Party (PP) blamed Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez for the situation, describing it as \"an unbearable humiliation.\"\n\n\"It\u00b4s unforgivable to damage Spain's image like this,\" Feijoo said on X.\n\nA

warrant and vanish again.\n\nSupreme Court Judge Pablo Llarena, who had issued the arrest warrant for Mr Puigdemont, requested answers specifically from Catalonia's regional police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra.\n\nMr Puigdemont, who fled abroad after leading a failed 2017 independence bid for Catalonia, defied the warrant to return to Spain yesterday and delivered a speech to thousands gathered at the Catalan regional parliament in Barcelona before escaping.\n\nHe had been expected to try to enter the parliament building for the investiture vote to pick a new leader for the wealthy northeastern region but instead disappeared into the crowd.\n\nCatalonia's regional police said it had arrested two officers, including one who owned the car used by Mr Puigdemont to leave the scene.\n\nThe force, which has launched a manhunt for the 61-year-old, denied there had been any collusion and insisted officers had planned to arrest him \"at the most opportune time so as not to generate public disorder\".\n\nMr Puigdemont \"took advantage of the numbers of people around him and fled the scene in a vehicle that the Mossos tried to stop but failed\" the force said yesterday.\n\nJudge Llarena also asked the interior ministry for details of its plan to arrest him at the border as well as \"the orders that were issued\" to capture Mr Puigdemont \"after his escape\".\n\nThe judge sought the names of \"the agents responsible for the design of the operation, those responsible for its approval and those who have been entrusted with its execution or operational deployment\".\n\nMr Puigdemont's lawyer, Gonzalo Boye, told Catalan radio today that his client had fled abroad again, without giving details.\n\nThe secretary general of Mr Puigdemont's hardline JxCAT party Jordi Turull said \"he is going back to Waterloo\", the Belgian city where he spent most of the seven years he has been in self-imposed exile.\n\n'Law must be respected'\n\nMr Puigdemont led the regional government in 2017, when it pushed ahead with an independence referendum despite a court ban, followed by a short-lived declaration of independence.\n\nHe fled Spain shortly after the failed independence bid to avoid prosecution and has since lived in Belgium and more recently France.\n\nSpain's parliament passed an amnesty law in May for those involved in the secession bid, but the Supreme Court ruled on 1 July that the measure would not fully apply to Mr Puigdemont.\n\nMr Turull said Mr Puigdemont had not planned to return to Catalonia and then escape but changed his plans when he saw the massive security presence.\n\nIt was not foreseen \"that there would be a police deployment that we have not seen in Catalonia for the biggest criminal, terrorist, drug trafficker,\" Mr Turull told Catalan radio.\n\n\"The first scenario was that he could return to benefit.. from the amnesty law,\" he added.\n\nThe leader of the main opposition Popular Party, Alberto Nunez Feijoo, has called Mr Puigdemont's return to Spain an \"unbearable humiliation\" that damaged the country's image.\n\nSpanish Justice Minister Felix Bolanos said today the operation to arrest Mr Puigdemont \"was the responsibility of the Mossos\", whose job it was to enforce court orders in Catalonia.\n\n\"In Spain the law must be respected and court orders must be complied with,\" the minister said.\n\nCatalonia's parliament yesterday elected Salvador Illa of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's Socialists as Catalonia's first head not from the pro-independence movement since

Amid a heavy police presence, Puigdemont told a crowd of thousands of followers in the Catalan capital he aimed to revive the independence drive that plunged Spain into political crisis in 2017. 'They thought they'd be celebrating my arrest and they thought that this punishment would dissuade us,' he told the massed gathering. 'Well, they are wrong.'\n\nAuthorities suspect that, when he had finished speaking, Puigdemont got into a white car belonging to a police officer and fled the scene, a Catalan interior department spokesperson said, sparking a frantic search by authorities that continued into the night. Former Barcelona Mayor Xavier Trias, who was present at the rally, marvelled at Puigdemont's flight, saying simply: 'It was magic.' It came after Spanish police yesterday searched the sewers after the exiled leader pledged to sneak back into the country - with a door linking the Catalan Parliament to Barcelona Zoo to prevent any elaborate attempts to breach the premises.\n\nThe regional police, known as the Mossos d'Esquadra, said two of its officers had been arrested as part of their investigation into Puigdemont's whereabouts, including the owner of the car. The separatist leader, 61, fled to Belgium seven years ago after a failed secession bid and has been living in exile ever since. He faces an arrest warrant for alleged embezzlement related to a 2017 independence referendum ruled illegal by the Spanish courts. Puigdemont says the vote was legal and therefore the charges linked to it have no basis. Spain's Socialist-led national government in Madrid approved an amnesty in May which cancelled legal proceedings against hundreds of separatists involved in the illegal referendum.\n\nBut the country's Supreme Court last month ruled the law didn't apply to an outstanding embezzlement charge against Mr Puigdemont, the former leader of the hardline Junts party. He sparked a major alert after boasting of his imminent return in a video posted on X yesterday, in which he warned: 'I have started the return journey from exile.' A Mossos spokesman said there was no prior arrangement with Puigdemont for his arrest and the force had decided the detention should be made 'at the most appropriate time so as not to generate public disorder.' Puigdemont ally Laura Borras described the arrested officer on X as 'a patriot and exemplary Mosso.'\n\nThe hunt for Puigdemont created traffic chaos in Barcelona and near the border with France as police set up roadblocks and searched car boots. In Barcelona, several Puigdemont supporters clashed with police in a bid to breach the cordon surrounding the park housing the regional parliament building. Officers clad in riot gear used batons and pepper spray to deter them. Reacting to news that Puigdemont had again absconded from under the noses of a large police deployment, a Supreme Court source said a judge had been clear in his instructions that the former Catalan president was to be arrested. 'The Mossos know that they have a detention order... they had the obligation to detain him and bring him before the courts,' the source said.\n\nTwo national police unions also criticised the failure to arrest Puigdemont. 'Where are the Mossos? The best-paid police force in Spain incapable of doing their job, of arresting the coup-monger and fugitive from justice Puigdemont,' police union Jusapol said on X. Two sources with links to the Catalan government said it had identified a problem with some rogue Mossos, who appear to be loyal to Puigdemont. A government spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Puigdemont's lawyer. His arrest could jeopardise the Socialist-led national government's fragile alliance with Puigdemont's Junts party, on which it relies for legislative support.\n\nCatalonia's parliament yesterday afternoon confirmed Salvador Illa, an ally of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, as head of the Catalan government. 'I will govern for everyone having into account the plurality and diversity of Catalonia,' Illa said. The Socialists hope taking control in Catalonia after a decade of separatist rule will turn the page on the independence drive. The Spanish parliament passed an amnesty law in May pardoning those involved in the failed 2017 secession bid, but the Supreme Court upheld arrest warrants for Puigdemont and two others who were also charged with embezzlement, ruling that the amnesty law does not apply to them. The crowd of thousands, who had gathered near the parliament to welcome him, hoped his return would help build momentum towards independence, which has lost support in recent years.\n\n'It represents the return of a symbol,' said Xavier Vizcaino, 63, who was wrapped in an independence flag. No-one had expected him to disappear again. Yesterday authorities had sealed off all but one entrance 300-year-old Catalan Parliament building, a former arsenal, which is situated in the 76-acre Parc de la Ciutadella. Formal identification was required to get through. A room-by-room sweep of the 300-year-old building is being conducted by officers, who are also checking the basement. The route to the zoo, which surrounds the neoclassical building on three sides, has been shut and guarded to prevent access.\n\nA spokesman for the Mossos d'Esquadra, Catalonia's autonomous police force, told website Politico: 'These are standard security procedures that are carried out before any investiture ceremony.' But he added officers would 'evidently' take anyone into custody who was found in the area with an outstanding arrest warrant. Mr Puigdemont decided against taking part in the European elections in June so that he could stand for the Catalan presidency. However, he came second to Socialist candidate Salvador Illa, who has made a deal to form a minority government. He believes his presence in the city could encourage elected members to ditch the deal. Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya, the moderate socialist party currently governing the region, said Mr Puigdemont's return would be an 'exceptional moment'.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The right-leaning Unified Police Union demanded that the country's National Police Force and Civil Guard take charge and that the regional officers be excluded from the investigation.\n\nThe Catalan interior minister and the police chief will give a press conference later Friday morning.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carles_Puigdemont", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carles Puigdemont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Government_of_Catalonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "President of the Government of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAC1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "RAC1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Together_for_Catalonia_(2020)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Together for Catalonia (2020)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordi_Turull", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordi Turull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L'Ampolla", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "L'Ampolla"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "L'Ampolla"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Illa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salvador Illa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzalo_Boye", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gonzalo Boye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Catalonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_the_Interior_(Spain)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of the Interior (Spain)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossos_d'Esquadra", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mossos d'Esquadra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catalan language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Guard_(Spain)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil Guard (Spain)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Catalan-separatist-Carles-Puigdemont-is-out-of-Spain-and-on.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803722", "eventUri": "eng-9803722", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

'is already back in Belgium' after brief return to Spain from exile - Olive Press News Spain", "body": "FUGITIVE Catalan politician Carles Puigdemont is 'already back in Belgium' after he briefly returned to Spain this week for the first time in seven years.\n\nThe Mossos d'Esquadra regional police force are facing serious embarrassment today after the former Catalan premier appeared outside the parliament building in Barcelona on Thursday, where he gave a speech, before vanishing and thus avoiding his arrest to face embezzlement charges.\n\nDespite the police operation to locate him on Thursday, which included a series of roadblocks and a search using a helicopter, he has managed to return to his home in Waterloo, according to Jordi Turull, the secretary general of Puigdemont's Junts per Catalunya political party.\n\nSpeaking to regional TV channel RAC1, Turull explained that Puigdemont had dinner with him in Barcelona on Tuesday evening, having arrived undetected in the city with the apparent intention of taking part in the investiture debate that was held in the parliament on Thursday, and that saw Socialist Salvador Illa voted in as premier.\n\nRead more: Mossos police chiefs to be quizzed over exiled leader's 'humiliating' escape from Barcelona\n\nPuigdemont's lawyer, Gonzalo Boye, also confirmed that the politician had already left Spain.\n\n\"He didn't come to hand himself in, he came to fight,\" said Boye about his client's brief appearance on Thursday before he reportedly escaped in a white Honda before he could be detained.\n\nBoye added that Puigdemont would be making a public statement in the coming days.\n\nTwo officers from the Mossos d'Esquadra were arrested on Thursday on allegations they assisted Puigdemont with his escape.\n\nBut Boye claimed that the arrests were illegal, according to a report in online daily 20minutos, adding that 'no actions yesterday can be considered a crime'.\n\nCarles Puigdemont fled Spain in 2017 to avoid arrest after he and other pro-independence leaders organised an illegal referendum on secession, which took place on October 1 that year, and a unilateral declaration of independence was subsequently passed in the Catalan parliament.\n\nHe has been living in self-imposed exile in Belgium ever since, and has an arrest warrant out against him on allegations of misuse of public funds.",

latest: Mossos police chiefs to be quizzed over exiled leader's 'humiliating' escape from Barcelona - Olive Press News Spain", "body": "A SUPREME Court judge has requested reports from the Catalan regional police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra, as well as the central Interior Ministry, after politician and fugitive from justice Carles Puigdemont managed to evade arrest on Thursday in Barcelona and seemingly disappear into thin air.\n\nOpposition politicians on Thursday described the situation as 'unbearable' and 'humiliating' for the Spanish state.\n\nPablo Llarena, the magistrate in charge of investigating the 2017 independence drive in Catalunya, wants information about the operation yesterday that was supposed to see Puigdemont arrested.\n\nInstead of being detained, however, he was able to appear in Barcelona - his first time on Spanish soil since he fled in the wake of the events of 2017 to avoid arrest - and give a speech, before leaving in a vehicle.\n\nRead more: Who is Carles Puigdemont and why are police hunting him in Spain?\n\nPuigdemont had been expected to enter the parliament building in the Catalan capital, where Socialist Salvador Illa was being voted in as the new regional premier.\n\nInstead he gave the authorities the slip before they could arrest him.\n\nThe whole episode has done serious reputational damage to the Mossos, given that there were more than 300 of the force's officers on the scene on Thursday.\n\nPuigdemont, who has been living in self-imposed exile in Belgium since 2017, had announced that he would come back to Spain on the day of the investiture debate.\n\nThe Mossos, according to Spanish daily El Pais, believed that his arrest would be relatively simple, and they were planning on collaring him as he entered the parliament building.\n\nHe is wanted by the Supreme Court to face charges of misappropriation of funds, and so far has not benefited from the amnesty law passed by the central Spanish government that quashes charges still faced by those involved in the Catalan independence drive, and that is designed to further calm the waters between Catalunya and Madrid.\n\nPolice sources told reporters that after he gave a speech to a crowd outside the Catalan parliament building, he and fellow politician Jordi Turull put on caps and got into a white Honda, accompanied by another two people.\n\nDespite the journalists on the scene, no one managed to capture an image of his escape.\n\nOnce the alarm had been raised, police put roadblocks in place in a bid to locate the politician.\n\nTwo officers from the Mossos were detained on Thursday on suspicion of aiding the escape.\n\nThe Interior Ministry has reportedly passed on its displeasure to the Mossos, while sources from the Policia Nacional said that Puigdemont should have been arrested before he could get to the stage to deliver his speech, El Pais reported.\n\nThe leader of the main opposition Partido Popular (PP), Alberto Nu\u00f1ez Feijoo, took to social network X to denounce the 'unbearable humiliation' that the episode represented for the Spanish state, and placed the blame squarely at Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's door.\n\nSanchez has relied on support from Puigdemont's party, Junts per Catalunya, to be voted back in as prime minister and to pass legislation, in exchange for concessions for the region.\n\nThe PP's general secretary, Cuca Gamarra, gave a statement on Thursday in which she slammed what she called an 'embarrassing spectacle' and also railed against the CNI secret service for 'not complying with its functions'.", "source": {"uri": "theolivepress.es", "dataType": "news", "title": "Olive Press News Spain"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_hunter@theolivepress.es", "name": "Simon Hunter",

Yet the occasion was overshadowed by the latest stunt by Carles Puigdemont, the former regional government leader behind the illegal October 1, 2017 independence referendum, who seemed eager to once again thumb his nose at the Spanish justice system, which has been tracking him down for seven years. Puigdemont moved to Belgium to escape.\n\nHaving willingly come to Barcelona as a regional MP, the former president of Catalonia's Generalitat fooled the police, who had orders to arrest him under a warrant for \"aggravated misuse of public funds\" linked to the expenses of organizing the banned 2017 referendum. By Friday, he was still nowhere to be found, despite a vast police presence being deployed to apprehend him. During the day, two agents of the Mossos d'Esquadra, the Catalan regional police force, were arrested for helping him to escape. His JxCAT party told Catalan radio on Friday that the leader had, once again, left for Belgium.\n\nAt 9 am on Thursday, Puigdemont first made a mockery of the police presence by appearing out of nowhere, on foot, in a small street in the El Born district, before quickly being surrounded by a crowd of pro-independence supporters who walked alongside him for the few dozen meters that separated him from the triumphal arch close to the regional Parliament. Risking arrest, Puigdemont had announced, the day before that he would keep his promise, made during the Catalan elections in May, to attend the opening session of the new legislative term, and that he would take part in an \"institutional event\" near Parliament.\n\n'Our Nelson Mandela'\n\nFrom a podium, Puigdemont delivered a six-minute speech: \"I've come to remind you that we're still here, and that we don't have the right to renounce the right to self-determination of the Catalan people,\" he said to the 4,000 or so people who had responded to the call issued by what remains of the organized pro-independence movement in Catalonia, notably the Catalan National Assembly and \u00d2mnium Cultural associations. \"Today, many were hoping to celebrate my arrest,\" he continued. \"I don't know how long it will be before we see each other again, but whatever happens, when we do, we'll be able to shout together: 'Long live a free Catalonia!'\"", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr",

A farce, revenge ... what does it bring to the independence movement?\"\n\nPuigdemont's first escape from Spain in 2017 became the stuff of legend among his followers, and a huge source of embarrassment for Spanish law enforcement.\n\nEarlier this year, Puigdemont denied that he had hidden in a car boot to avoid detection while slipping across the border in 2017 after the referendum.\n\nThe subsequent legal crackdown landed several of his cohorts in prison until Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's government pardoned them.", "source": {"uri": "expressandstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Express & Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carles_Puigdemont", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carles Puigdemont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Catalan_independence_referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2017 Catalan independence referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sallent", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sallent"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sallent"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Catalonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Ignasi_Elena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joan Ignasi Elena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordi_Turull", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordi Turull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Left_of_Catalonia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Left of Catalonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pardon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_S\u00e1nchez", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pedro S\u00e1nchez"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.expressandstar.com/resizer/v2/T4HM777SEBCLZN6XQODQVNOSOY.jpg?auth=ae008ff59eaa68e0f2ffcf4c69bd4f40b50a399a06075f6b536db049010bfe2f&width=1200&height=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803722", "eventUri": "eng-9803722", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 460917576, "relevance": 2}

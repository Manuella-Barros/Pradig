And yet, despite increased scrutiny on online \u201cpill mills\u201d and bad actors, few virtual care companies are upfront about their approach to clinical quality and patient safety. Teladoc Health At Teladoc Health, our industry-leading quality and patient safety programs have earned recognition from The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Here are the top questions you should consider asking your telehealth partners: 1. Do you have a formal patient safety program? All healthcare providers will tell you that they work hard to avoid errors of any kind. But when mistakes do happen, it\u2019s important that they become opportunities for learning and improvement. Building upon foundational elements of best-in-class brick-and-mortar patient safety systems, telehealth programs should be optimized to address the types of errors that patients and providers could encounter in a virtual setting. To do this, you need to invest in a dedicated, multidisciplinary patient safety team. At Teladoc Health, our patient safety team is comprised of physicians, nurses and a human factors engineering psychologist, with decades of combined experience from leading patient safety in brick-and-mortar systems. This team spent years conceptualizing, building and refining the customized event reporting system we use at Teladoc Health, and regularly shares our learnings at national and international conferences and other forums. Our classification model captures potential events across categories such as: diagnosis, intervention, care management, medication, communication, and cybersecurity. This foundation is important because it allows us to quickly and proactively track, classify, and investigate potential safety events that are most likely to impact members, and incorporate learnings to prevent future errors. 2. How do you address common barriers for reporting? If a physician or other provider is concerned that reporting an error could result in a cascade of disciplinary actions, they may be reluctant to report \u2013 which can lead to missed opportunities for improvement. Given our understanding that clinicians may be reluctant to share and discuss problems and patient safety concerns, in 2019, we established the first virtual care Patient Safety Organization (PSO), The Institute of Patient Safety and Quality of Virtual Care. This federally-recognized entity of Teladoc Health makes it possible for information from healthcare providers to receive certain legal protections in the spirit of safety and improvement, so that the root causes of emerging issues can be identified and addressed quickly. 3. How do you support a continuous learning environment? Identifying the errors is a foundational element of any patient safety program, but it\u2019s not enough. The hard part is turning that data into insights, and that\u2019s where the team makes a powerful difference. Having a multidisciplinary team of professionals skilled in safety science facilitates rigorous investigations that help us better identify all contributing factors to a problem, and design robust action plans to improve. By investing in a team of clinical leaders with decades of experience in this field, we\u2019ve been able to build a program that can analyze potential safety events more quickly, address root causes, and catch errors before they even reach the patient. That spirit of continuous learning and improvement extends to other domains of clinical quality. Our team is continuously improving our rates of antibiotic and oral steroid use, preventative cancer screenings, control of chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension, and patient reported outcomes in common mental health disorders like depression and anxiety. We utilize rigorous improvement science frameworks to reduce unnecessary variation in care and enable data-driven, measurable improvement. With additional pressures from payers and regulators, we\u2019re seeing more focus on quality and safety programs \u2013 and I think it\u2019s a shift that we should welcome. Investing in patient safety and quality is not just the right thing to do, it\u2019s what our patients and members deserve. Dr. George R.

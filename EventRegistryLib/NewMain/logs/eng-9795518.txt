Meanwhile, competitors such as Mr. Cooper and Rocket Mortgage have acquired servicing assets at higher coupon rates to offer refis and other products to customers when rates drop.\n\nMat Ishbia, chairman and CEO of UWM, said in a call with analysts that when rates drop, lenders will \"get flooded with refinances\" because of trillions of dollars of loans originated in the 6.5% to 8% range. Volumes will increase, as will gain-on-sale margins. In turn, \"MSR write-downs will be massive,\" he added.\n\n\"Obviously, nobody controls the MSR write-ups and write-downs. We never take credit when it goes up. We don't want to take credit when it goes down. We want to focus on origination,\" Ishbia said. \"For us, we don't buy MSRs, we originate them. I don't see a slowdown in people buying them because that's the only way they can originate.\"\n\nAs a result of the strategy, UWM reported a non-GAAP net income of $59.8 million during the second quarter of 2024, compared to a profit of $141 million in the previous quarter. Meanwhile, GAAP net income was $76.3 million, including a $115.3 million decline in the fair value its MSRs, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nUWM originated $33.6 billion in mortgages in the second quarter, higher than the $27.6 billion figure in the previous quarter and the $31.8 billion originated in Q2 2023. The company's volume in Q2 2024 consisted mainly of purchase loans, which accounted for $27.2 billion.\n\nTo compare, UWM's primary rival, Rocket Mortgage, generated $24.6 billion in closed loan volume from April to June. But Rocket also delivered a higher profit of $171 million.\n\nGain-on-sale margins for UWM declined to 106 basis points in the second quarter, compared to 108 bps in the previous quarter and 88 bps in the same period last year. Ishbia said he expects \"margins to go up\" in a lower rate environment.\n\nAnalysts at Jefferies said in a report that, following the implementation of its \"Game-On\" initiative, when UWM cut margins to gain market share, \"we have seen pricing quickly improve above historical levels, as we believe the broker market remains firmly bifurcated.\"\n\nIn a report on Tuesday morning, the analysts added that \"purchase volumes represented 81% of the volume mix, as the company continues to capitalize on the purchase-oriented originations market. However, we expect this mix to begin to shift modestly to refinance volume in the near term.\"\n\nRegarding its servicing portfolio, as UWM continues to sell MSRs opportunistically, it ended the second quarter at $189.5 billion in unpaid principal balance (UPB), compared to $299.7 billion in the previous quarter and $294.9 billion in Q2 2023.\n\nThe company generated nearly $2.4 billion in net proceeds from these sales in the second quarter. Most sales involved servicing rights on loans with coupons above 5.5%, with one-third being Ginnie Mae collateral. As a result, the company said its portfolio's weighted average coupon (WAC) was 4.31% on June 30, compared to 4.58% on March 31.\n\nLooking forward, Ishbia said the company is not focused on selling MSRs to lessen risk. Rather, it is preparing to scale its operational technology, since that was the strategy for the first three to six months of the year.\n\n\"It's playing out how we expected,\" he said. \"I'm not saying we won't sell any more MSRs, because people call us all the time to try to buy them. However, it's not a focus of mine right now. My focus is on origination, scale and dominance in this industry.\"\n\nUWM ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of available liquidity, including $680.2 million in cash.\n\nThe company anticipates third-quarter production between $31 billion and $38 billion. Meanwhile, the gain-on-sale margin is expected to be between 85 bps and 110 bps.\n\n\"The last couple of days, the market has made an inflection point where we can look at 'could the refi boom be here right now?'\" Ishbia said. \"If the 10-year [Treasury yield] stays where it's at right now and mortgage interest rates stay with that right now, we will beat this guidance from a production perspective.\n\n\"We're not quite there yet, but we're on the cusp of a potential, very interesting time.\"\n\nUWM shares were trading near $8.50 on Tuesday, down less than 2% from the previous

Reserve your spot today for an exclusive discount.\n\nShares in United Wholesale Mortgage are trading at a three-year high after the nation's largest mortgage lender posted a healthy second-quarter profit, paid down debt and said it's in prime position to capitalize and grow as mortgage rates continue to drop.\n\nAfter a $115 million write-down in the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights, UWM reported $76.3 million in second-quarter net earnings.\n\nMortgage originations were up 6 percent from a year ago, to $33.6 billion -- the highest level since Q1 2022. At 1.06 percent, gain margins were also an improvement from 0.88 percent a year ago.\n\nUWM said it expects Q3 originations of $31 billion to $38 billion, with gain margins of 0.85 percent to 1.10 percent, in line with recent quarters.\n\nWhile the outlook for lending is improving, UWM has also boosted its bottom line by more than $2 billion this year by selling off a big chunk of its loan servicing business. UWM's mortgage servicing rights (MSR) portfolio shrank by 23 percent in Q1 and by another 17 percent in Q2, to $189.5 billion.\n\nThat helped UWM finish up the quarter with about $2.7 billion in available liquidity, including $680.2 million in cash.\n\n\"We had a strategy coming in this year,\" CEO Mat Ishbia said on a call with investment analysts. \"The strategy was to de-risk, sell MSRs in the first three to six months of the year and prepare for scale, technology, and operationally ... it's playing out how we expected.\"\n\nSince hitting a 52-week low of $4.49 on Oct. 4 when mortgage rates were approaching post-pandemic peaks, UWM's share price has been on the rise as investors grow increasingly bullish about the prospects for mortgage lending to pick up as rates come back down to Earth.\n\nShares in UWM hit a new 52-week high of $8.85 on Monday after two surprisingly weak jobs reports last week put mortgage rates in a tailspin. It was the highest valuation shares in the Pontiac, Michigan-based wholesale lender have reached in more than three years.\n\n\"We're raising our price target to $10 from $8 following the earnings call and good Q2 results, as the stock remains our favorite way to position for lower interest rates,\" BTIG analyst Eric Hagen said in a note to clients.\n\nAt 6.4 percent Monday, rates on 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages are down 87 basis points from a 2024 high of 7.27 percent registered April 25, and haven't been lower since May 2023, according to rate lock data tracked by Optimal Blue. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.\n\nShares in UWM initially dropped 8 percent to $8.07 when markets opened after the release of earnings Tuesday morning but surged back to $8.66 in afternoon trading before closing the day at $8.50.\n\nShares in UWM rival Rocket Mortgage -- formerly the nation's largest mortgage lender, before ceding the title to UWM in 2022 -- also hit a new 52-week high of $18.66 Tuesday, a 160 percent gain from $7.17 on Oct. 25.\n\nRocket last week reported that Q2 net income was up 28 percent from a year ago to $178 million, with mortgage originations growing by 10 percent over that time, to $24.7 billion. Rocket says artificial intelligence tools it's developing will help it rapidly scale its business even more when mortgage lending rebounds.\n\nIshbia said UWM has also been investing in technology that will help the mortgage brokers the company works with make the most of any boom.\n\n\"In the second quarter, we announced the number of products and technology that add speed and capacity to the broker channel that really just didn't exist in 2020 and 2021,\" Ishbia said. \"We're really excited to see these things come into action.\"\n\nUWM's consumer-facing Mortgage Matchup website -- a searchable database that helps consumers find a local mortgage broker -- is the official mortgage partner of the NBA and WNBA, and Ishbia said, \"We're seeing more and more people going to this website every single day.\"\n\nUWM's newly updated TRAC+ program offers pricing incentives to mortgage brokers who agree to let UWM handle not only title review but closing and disbursement for clients who are refinancing existing loans.\n\nIshbia called TRAC+ \"a huge game changer\" because mortgage brokers \"no longer have to go outside and work with a third-party title company or anyone outside, and it saves the consumer thousands of dollars.\"\n\nUWM also continues to \"invest heavily\" in its automated document recognition and processing system, BOLT, which Ishbia said allows mortgage brokers to get initial approvals in as little as 15 minutes and enables UWM's underwriters to do \"more business every single day, with technology pulling the weight on a lot of the underwriting processes.\"\n\nAt $27.2 billion, purchase loans represented 81 percent of UWM's Q2 2024 mortgage originations. That's more than double the 40 percent share of business that purchase lending provided in Q2 2021.\n\nWhile purchase originations were down 3 percent from the same time a year ago, refinancing grew by 69 percent, to $6.5 billion.\n\nUWM originates more purchase mortgages than any of its rivals, but Ishbia said refinancing will be the biggest immediate opportunity if mortgage rates continue to fall as the economy cools.\n\n\"I always said the mini refi boom, or full refi boom ... is when you make all the money,\" Ishbia said. \"If the market turns back, we're still going to dominate in the purchase market as we have been for the last couple of years.\"\n\nWhile lenders typically sell the mortgages they originate to investors, many like to keep the rights to \"service\" those loans, collecting monthly payments from borrowers on behalf of investors.\n\nLoan servicing not only generates fee revenue that can level out ups and downs in originations but can give lenders a leg up on competitors when borrowers are ready to refinance or buy their next home.\n\nTo boost its bottom line, UWM has trimmed its loan servicing portfolio by 41 percent since the end of 2021, when it was collecting payments on more than 1 million mortgages with outstanding balances of $319.8 billion.\n\nAs a result, Q2 income from loan servicing dropped 30 percent to $143.9 million compared to Q4 2023, when that line of business generated $206.5 million in revenue.\n\nUWM has generated close to $2.4 billion in net proceeds through the end of the second quarter by selling mortgage servicing rights, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Hubacker said.\n\nProceeds from those sales have been used to pay down debt, increase production and invest in UWM's business -- while \"also maintaining a consistent dividend for our shareholders,\" he said.\n\n(Ishbia and his family -- including brother Justin and father Jeff, who both sit on the UWM's board of directors -- collect $150 million in dividend payments every quarter, The Wall Street Journal noted in November.)\n\nAsked if UWM will continue to sell servicing rights, Ishbia wouldn't rule that out -- if the price is right.\n\n\"I'm not saying we won't sell anymore MSRs, because people call us all the time to try to buy them,\" Ishbia said. \"However, it's not a focus of mine right now.

For the second quarter it posted net income of $76.3 million compared with and\n\nBTIG had predicted 8 cents a share of GAAP EPS, with industry consensus at 7 cents. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods expected 6 cents per share in both GAAP and operating EPS, but UWM reported 3 cents and 4 cents respectively.\n\nVolume-wise this was the best period for United Wholesale Mortgage since , Mat Ishbia, chairman and CEO, said on the earnings call.\n\nProduction was $33.6 billion, compared with $27.6 billion in the first quarter and $31.8 billion for the second quarter of 2023.\n\nRival Rocket Cos. reported a second\n\nWhile the gain on sale margin declined slightly from the first quarter, it was still at the upper end of previous guidance. UWM reported 106 basis points and its guidance for the period was for between 85-to-110. This compared with 108 basis points for the first quarter and 88 basis points for a year ago.\n\nKBW had expected 98 basis points, Bose George said in a flash note, while BTIG's Eric Hagen's estimate was for 96 basis points, his post earnings report said.\n\n\"We still think there's room for margin expansion in response to larger and more sustained drops in interest rates, as lenders could potentially benefit from a window of bargaining power while capacity catches up to demand,\" Hagen said. \"We especially see the company's scale factoring into the margin stability we expect at lower rates, especially versus some retail lenders whose capacity would likely take longer to reload/restaff, especially if a plummet in rates drives a rush of demand.\"\n\nFor the third quarter, UWM expects production between $31 billion and $38 billion, while Ishbia held to gain on sale guidance in the 85-to-110 basis point range.\n\nHowever, , the mortgage market \"has really made an inflection point where we can look at, could the refi boom be here right now?\" Ishbia said.\n\nIf the 10-year Treasury yield, which closed on Aug. 1 at 3.79%, and mortgage rates stay where they were, UWM will beat that guidance from a production perspective, Ishbia said. But given that the third quarter is nearly midway done, he added he was more excited for the company's prospects in the fourth quarter.\n\nLower mortgage rates were the catalyst for Hagen's investment thesis for the company, where he raised his stock price target to $10.\n\n(At noon on Aug. 6, UWM Holdings was trading at $8.55 per share, down 19 cents on the day, likely because of the earnings miss.)\n\n\"All else equal, we roughly estimate the company can do around $150 billion of annualized volume if mortgage rates were to fall below 6.5%, up from our current estimate of $120 billion this year with rates near 7%,\" Hagen said. \"We think it could support that volume with very little additional operating expense, and fairly modest mark-to-market losses in its servicing portfolio.\"\n\nMeanwhile UWM continued on its strategy of selling MSRs, and has received nearly $2.6 billion in proceeds through the end of the second quarter from bulk and excess sales, said Andrew Hubacker, chief financial officer.\n\n\"Proceeds from these sales have been used to de-lever our balance sheet, increase production and invest in our business while also maintaining a consistent dividend for our shareholders,\" Hubacker said. \"These sales have been targeted at our higher coupon MSRs, and allowed us to significantly de-risk the portfolio.\"\n\nMost of the MSRs sold had coupons over 5.5% and approximately one-third was Ginnie Mae collateral, he said.\n\nLater in the call Ishbia said going into this year, UWM's strategy was to de-risk. However, servicing sales is not something he is focusing on at this moment.\n\n\"I'm not saying we won't sell any more MSRs, because people call us all the time to try to buy them,\" Ishbia said. \"My focus is on origination, on scale and dominance in this industry right now.\"\n\nBecause of the sales, UWM ended the quarter with a $189.5 billion portfolio at a 4.31% weighted average interest rate. On March 31, it had a $229.7 billion portfolio with WAIR of 4.58%, while one prior UWM owned $294.9 billion at a 3.84% WAIR.\n\nIn May, UWM's consumer-facing website, Mortgage Matchup, became the official mortgage partner for both the National Basketball Association and Women's National Basketball Association, Ishbia noted on the call.

Additionally, the Board approved a proportional distribution to SFS Corp., which is payable on or about October 10, 2024.\n\nEarnings Conference Call Details\n\nAs previously announced, the Company will hold a conference call for financial analysts and investors on Tuesday, August 6, 2024, at 10:00 AM ET to review the results and answer questions. Interested parties may register for a toll-free dial-in number by visiting:\n\nhttps://registrations.events/direct/Q4I2815784\n\nPlease dial in at least 15 minutes in advance to ensure a timely connection to the call. Audio webcast, taped replay and a transcript will be available on the Company's investor relations website at https://investors.uwm.com/.\n\nKey Operational Metrics\n\n\"Loan origination volume\" and \"Total gain margin\" are key operational metrics that the Company's management uses to evaluate the performance of the business. \"Loan origination volume\" is the aggregate principal of the residential mortgage loans originated by the Company during a period. \"Total gain margin\" represents total loan production income divided by loan origination volume for the applicable periods.\n\nNon-GAAP Metrics\n\nThe Company's net income does not reflect the income tax provision that would otherwise be reflected if 100% of the economic interest in UWM was owned by the Company. Therefore, for comparison purposes, the Company provides \"Adjusted net income (loss),\" which is our pre-tax income (loss) together with an adjusted income tax provision (benefit), which is calculated as the provision for income taxes plus the tax effects of net income attributable to non-controlling interest determined using a blended statutory effective tax rate. \"Adjusted net income (loss)\" is a non-GAAP metric. \"Adjusted diluted EPS\" is defined as \"Adjusted net income (loss)\" divided by the weighted average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding for the applicable period, assuming the exchange and conversion of all outstanding Class D common stock for Class A common stock, and is calculated and presented for periods in which the assumed exchange and conversion of Class D common stock to Class A common stock is anti-dilutive to EPS.\n\nWe also disclose Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as earnings (loss) before interest expense on non-funding debt, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, the change in fair value of MSRs due to valuation inputs or assumptions (net), the impact of non-cash deferred compensation expense, the change in fair value of the Public and Private Warrants, the change in Tax Receivable Agreement liability and the change in fair value of retained investment securities. We exclude the change in Tax Receivable Agreement liability, the change in fair value of the Public and Private Warrants, the change in fair value of retained investment securities, and the change in fair value of MSRs due to valuation inputs or assumptions as these represent non-cash, non-realized adjustments to our earnings, which is not indicative of our performance or results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA includes interest expense on funding facilities, which are recorded as a component of interest expense, as these expenses are a direct operating expense driven by loan origination volume. By contrast, interest expense on non-funding debt is a function of our capital structure and is therefore excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nIn addition, we disclose \"Non-funding debt\" and the \"Non-funding debt to equity ratio\" as a non-GAAP metric. We define \"Non-funding debt\" as the total of the Company's senior notes, lines of credit, borrowings against investment securities, equipment note payable, and finance leases and the \"Non-funding debt-to-equity ratio\" as total non-funding debt divided by the Company's total equity.\n\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP metrics provide useful information to investors. These measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure reported by other companies.\n\nThe following tables set forth the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\nAdjusted net income\n\nQ2 2024\n\nQ1 2024\n\nQ2 2023\n\nEarnings before income taxes\n\n$\n\n77,072\n\n$\n\n184,264\n\n$\n\n230,004\n\nAdjusted income tax provision\n\n(17,263\n\n)\n\n(43,143\n\n)\n\n(54,051\n\n)\n\nAdjusted net income\n\n$\n\n59,809\n\n$\n\n141,121\n\n$\n\n175,953\n\nAdjusted diluted EPS\n\nQ2 2024\n\nQ2 2023\n\nDiluted weighted average Class A common stock outstanding\n\n95,387,609\n\n93,107,133\n\nAssumed pro forma conversion of Class D common stock (1)\n\n1,502,069,787\n\n1,502,069,787\n\nAdjusted diluted weighted average shares outstanding (1)\n\n1,597,457,396\n\n1,595,176,920\n\nAdjusted net income\n\n$\n\n59,809\n\n$\n\n175,953\n\nAdjusted diluted EPS\n\n0.04\n\n0.11\n\n(1) Reflects the pro forma exchange and conversion of antidilutive Class D common stock to Class A common stock.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\nQ2 2024\n\nQ1 2024\n\nQ2 2023\n\nNet income\n\n$\n\n76,286\n\n$\n\n180,531\n\n$\n\n228,794\n\nInterest expense on non-funding debt\n\n31,951\n\n40,243\n\n42,756\n\nProvision for income taxes\n\n786\n\n3,733\n\n1,210\n\nDepreciation and amortization\n\n11,404\n\n11,340\n\n11,441\n\nStock-based compensation expense\n\n3,937\n\n5,876\n\n3,567\n\nChange in fair value of MSRs due to valuation inputs or assumptions, net\n\n11,056\n\n(141,059\n\n)\n\n(164,526\n\n)\n\nDeferred compensation, net\n\n(1,169\n\n)\n\n1,063\n\n(564\n\n)\n\nChange in fair value of Public and Private Warrants\n\n(1,739\n\n)\n\n(686\n\n)\n\n1,175\n\nChange in Tax Receivable Agreement liability\n\n--\n\n180\n\n915\n\nChange in fair value of investment securities\n\n634\n\n269\n\n612\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\n$\n\n133,146\n\n$\n\n101,490\n\n$\n\n125,380\n\nNon-funding debt and non-funding debt to equity\n\nQ2 2024\n\nQ1 2024\n\nQ2 2023\n\nSenior notes\n\n$\n\n1,990,233\n\n$\n\n1,989,250\n\n$\n\n1,986,301\n\nSecured lines of credit\n\n--\n\n200,000\n\n500,000\n\nBorrowings against investment securities\n\n91,406\n\n94,064\n\n100,901\n\nEquipment note payable\n\n--\n\n--\n\n433\n\nFinance lease liability\n\n26,787\n\n28,536\n\n36,356\n\nTotal non-funding debt\n\n$\n\n2,108,426\n\n$\n\n2,311,850\n\n$\n\n2,623,991\n\nTotal equity\n\n$\n\n2,329,012\n\n$\n\n2,457,058\n\n$\n\n2,947,122\n\nNon-funding debt to equity\n\n0.91\n\n0.94\n\n0.89\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release and our earnings call include forward-looking statements.

(NYSE: NYSE:UWMC) to $10.00, up from the previous $8.00, while keeping a Buy rating on the stock.\n\nThe firm's decision on Tuesday follows UWM's impressive second-quarter earnings, highlighting the company's position as a top pick for investors in a declining interest rate environment.\n\nThe analyst from BTIG noted that the new $10 price target mirrors the level at which UWM Holdings completed its SPAC merger in late 2020. Despite the similarity in price targets, the analyst pointed out several improvements in the company's operations over the last four years.\n\nThe firm acknowledges that rising unemployment could impact earnings and valuation in the future, but the current investor focus appears to be on the trajectory of interest rates. The analyst believes that UWM Holdings is gaining momentum by applying operating leverage in a scenario of lower rates. T\n\nhis view is supported by the company's strategy of selling mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) last quarter to reduce risk and concentrate on its core strength as a central hub for mortgage brokers.\n\nUWM Holdings reported robust Q1 2024 results, with a total production of $27.6 billion and a net income of $180.5 million. UWM Holdings also projected an optimistic production forecast for the second quarter, ranging from $28 billion to $35 billion.\n\nSimultaneously, Barclays reaffirmed an Underweight rating on UWM Holdings, maintaining a price target of $5.00. Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, on the other hand, raised their price target for UWM Holdings to $7.00, citing the company's strong position in the purchase market. The firm adjusted financial estimates for the years ahead, taking into account recent industry projections and guidance for the second quarter.\n\nFollowing BTIG's updated price target for UWM Holdings Corp. (NYSE:UWMC), InvestingPro data and tips offer additional context for investors considering this stock. With a market capitalization of $13.73 billion and a high Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio of 107.85, UWMC is trading at a significant earnings multiple, which suggests that investors have high expectations for future earnings growth.\n\nInvestingPro Tips indicate that while net income is expected to grow, the company is quickly burning through cash. Additionally, the stock has been experiencing substantial volatility, a factor that risk-averse investors should take into account.

Loan Origination Volume of $33.6 Billion, Including Purchase Volume of $27.2 Billion.\n\nPONTIAC, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--UWM Holdings Corporation (NYSE: UWMC) (the \"Company\"), the publicly traded indirect parent of United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM), today announced its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2024. Total loan origination volume for the second quarter 2024 was $33.6 billion, of which $27.2 billion was purchase volume. The Company reported 2Q24 net income of $76.3 million, inclusive of a $115.3 million decline in fair value of MSRs, net, and diluted earnings per share of $0.03.\n\nMat Ishbia, Chairman and CEO of UWMC, said, \"The second quarter was another strong quarter, by all measures, for UWM and the wholesale channel. We collectively continue to dominate the current purchase market while investing and preparing for lower rates ahead. Our momentum is building, with margins and production both up year over year, and our focus remains on our best-in-class people, process and technology. UWM and the mortgage broker community are in a position of strength. With wholesale channel market share at a 15-year high, we are in a prime position to capitalize and grow when rates inevitably drop. UWM has never been as prepared for the upcoming opportunity as we are now.\"\n\nSecond Quarter Financial 2024 Highlights\n\nSecond Quarter Business and Product Highlights\n\nThird Quarter 2024 Outlook\n\nWe anticipate third quarter production to be in the $31 to $38 billion range, with gain margin from 85 to 110 basis points.\n\nDividend\n\nSubsequent to June 30, 2024, for the fifteenth consecutive quarter, the Company's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.10 per share on the outstanding shares of Class A common stock. The dividend is payable on October 10, 2024, to stockholders of record at the close of business on September 19, 2024. Additionally, the Board approved a proportional distribution to SFS Corp., which is payable on or about October 10, 2024.\n\nEarnings Conference Call Details\n\nAs previously announced, the Company will hold a conference call for financial analysts and investors on Tuesday, August 6, 2024, at 10:00 AM ET to review the results and answer questions. Interested parties may register for a toll-free dial-in number by visiting:\n\nhttps://registrations.events/direct/Q4I2815784\n\nPlease dial in at least 15 minutes in advance to ensure a timely connection to the call. Audio webcast, taped replay and a transcript will be available on the Company's investor relations website at https://investors.uwm.com/.\n\nKey Operational Metrics\n\nLoan origination volume and Total gain margin are key operational metrics that the Company's management uses to evaluate the performance of the business. Loan origination volume is the aggregate principal of the residential mortgage loans originated by the Company during a period. Total gain margin represents total loan production income divided by loan origination volume for the applicable periods.\n\nNon-GAAP Metrics\n\nThe Company's net income does not reflect the income tax provision that would otherwise be reflected if 100% of the economic interest in UWM was owned by the Company. Therefore, for comparison purposes, the Company provides Adjusted net income (loss), which is our pre-tax income (loss) together with an adjusted income tax provision (benefit), which is calculated as the provision for income taxes plus the tax effects of net income attributable to non-controlling interest determined using a blended statutory effective tax rate. Adjusted net income (loss) is a non-GAAP metric. \"Adjusted diluted EPS\" is defined as \"Adjusted net income (loss)\" divided by the weighted average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding for the applicable period, assuming the exchange and conversion of all outstanding Class D common stock for Class A common stock, and is calculated and presented for periods in which the assumed exchange and conversion of Class D common stock to Class A common stock is anti-dilutive to EPS.\n\nWe also disclose Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as earnings (loss) before interest expense on non-funding debt, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, the change in fair value of MSRs due to valuation inputs or assumptions (net), the impact of non-cash deferred compensation expense, the change in fair value of the Public and Private Warrants, the change in Tax Receivable Agreement liability and the change in fair value of retained investment securities. We exclude the change in Tax Receivable Agreement liability, the change in fair value of the Public and Private Warrants, the change in fair value of retained investment securities, and the change in fair value of MSRs due to valuation inputs or assumptions as these represent non-cash, non-realized adjustments to our earnings, which is not indicative of our performance or results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA includes interest expense on funding facilities, which are recorded as a component of interest expense, as these expenses are a direct operating expense driven by loan origination volume. By contrast, interest expense on non-funding debt is a function of our capital structure and is therefore excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nIn addition, we disclose Non-funding debt and the Non-funding debt to equity ratio as a non-GAAP metric. We define Non-funding debt as the total of the Company's senior notes, lines of credit, borrowings against investment securities, equipment note payable, and finance leases and the Non-funding debt-to-equity ratio as total non-funding debt divided by the Company's total equity.\n\nManagement believes that these non-GAAP metrics provide useful information to investors. These measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure reported by other companies.\n\nThe following tables set forth the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release and our earnings call include forward-looking statements.

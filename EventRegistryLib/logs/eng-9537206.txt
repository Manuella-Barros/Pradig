It's really classless from West Ham.\"\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports News reporter Danyal Khan in December, Lopetegui explained why he feels he has unfinished business in the Premier League and revealed he has met the PFA, LMA and PGMOL during his time off in a bid to prepare himself for a return to England's top division.\n\n\"It's why I've said no to different countries and different situations because I would like to stay here in England.

"body": "London (AFP) - West Ham manager David Moyes will leave \"by mutual consent\" when his contract expires at the end of the season, the Premier League club said Monday.\n\nThe announcement of Moyes's impending exit came just a day after the Hammers suffered an embarrassing 5-0 loss to London rivals Chelsea.\n\n\"West Ham United can confirm David Moyes will leave the club by mutual consent at the end of the 2023/24 season, when his contract expires,\" said a club statement.\n\nMonday's announcement came amid media speculation that former Real Madrid, Wolves and Spain manager Julen Lopetegui had agreed a deal to replace Moyes, in his second spell as West Ham manager, after the end of the current campaign.\n\nThe Chelsea defeat was the second successive away game where West Ham conceded five goals following their loss at Crystal Palace, another London club.\n\nAnd it added to the pressure on Moyes that had been mounting all season, with West Ham fans criticising him throughout the campaign for perceived negative tactics.\n\nWest Ham are currently ninth in the table, a huge 18 points adrift of the top four.\n\nMoyes, however, guided West Ham to the Europa Conference League title last season -- the club's first major honour since they won the 1980 FA Cup.\n\nBut they were knocked out of the Europa League last month following a quarter-final loss to Bayer Leverkusen.\n\n'Terrifc journey'\n\n\"I have enjoyed four-and-a-half brilliant years at West Ham, and the club is in a stronger position than when I returned back in 2019,\" Moyes told the club's website.\n\n\"When I joined West Ham for a second time, the club was one place above the relegation zone, and it has been a terrific journey to have achieved three consecutive seasons in Europe.\"\n\nThe 61-year-old Scot, a former manager of both Everton and Manchester United, added: \"After leading the club (West Ham) to safety, we guided the team to finishes of sixth and seventh in the Premier League, and I was delighted when we won the Europa Conference League title last June -- the club's first major trophy in 43 years.\n\n\"I would like to thank all the players for their support, and all the success they have achieved, over the last four-and-a-half years.\"\n\nWest Ham joint-chairman David Sullivan paid tribute to Moyes by saying: \"On behalf of everyone at West Ham United, I would like to offer our sincere thanks and gratitude to David for the contribution he has made to the football club during his time as manager.\n\n\"David has been responsible for a period of great progress and success in our history, and we are extremely grateful for all of his hard work, commitment and dedication to the role,\" added Sullivan, who hailed Moyes as an \"absolute professional\".\n\nSullivan said making the announcement with two games left to play in the league season \"allows David to get the send-off he deserves from the West Ham supporters and for us all to show our appreciation to him at our final home fixture of the season against Luton Town on Saturday\".\n\nLopetegui could now be set to succeed Moyes at the London Stadium.\n\nThe Spaniard guided Wolves to Premier League safety last season, but left the Midlands club after nine months on the eve of the new campaign in August.\n\nThe former Porto and Sevilla manager helped lift Wolves from the bottom of the table to a 13th-placed finish during his time in charge at Molineux.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

According to his friends, he has actually agreed to take the West Ham job while David Moyes, the club's most successful manager for decades, is still in the post.\n\nIt feels very much as if Lopetegui's tenure is being born under a bad sign. That is hardly unusual for the way West Ham conduct their business.

In 2018, when he was manager of Spain, he agreed to become the new boss of Real Madrid behind the back of the Spanish Football Federation a few days before the start of the World Cup and was promptly sacked.\n\nThe federation's then president, Luis Rubiales - remember him - said he had found out what Lopetegui had done five minutes before Real Madrid's announcement. The furore cast a shadow over Spain's tournament and they were knocked out by Russia in the second round. Lopetegui lasted 14 games and 138 days at the Bernabeu before he was fired.\n\nOne other thing about Lopetegui: he didn't fancy working with the financial restrictions that were to be imposed on him at Wolves this season. Gary O'Neil took over from him and not only kept Wolves up but made them prosper with intelligent, innovative coaching that has marked him out as one of the game's leading managerial prospects.\n\nThe idea that Lopetegui represents a radically different direction to Moyes is also flawed. He is an able, efficient manager. He is tactically astute. He achieved good things with Sevilla in the aftermath of his Madrid debacle. He provided echoes of that in his short time at Wolves before he walked away. But he is hardly part of a managerial avant-garde.\n\nI always felt a little bit sorry for Lopetegui over the Spain-Madrid fandango. I felt sorry for a guy who blew his one precious chance of winning the World Cup for his country because he was too weak to say no to Madrid and was then cast aside like trash by the club.\n\nI used to feel sorry for Lopetegui after he was sacked by Real Madrid - but I don't anymore after being part of West Ham's grubby handling of Moyes\n\nThe thing is, I don't feel sorry for him any more. Sullivan and the West Ham hierarchy are the villains of this piece but Lopetegui is old enough to know better than to allow himself to be part of the grubby, unpleasant handling of the exit of a manager who won the club's first major trophy for 43 years and consistently had the team punching above its weight.\n\nMoyes is the best thing to have happened to West Ham for a long time. He was pointing the club in the right direction when they got rid of him the first time in the summer of 2018. They thought Manuel Pellegrini would be an upgrade because he had won a title for Manchester City.\n\nEighteen months later, in December 2019, West Ham had to go back to Moyes to ask him to clean up the mess that Pellegrini had made. Moyes did that and much more. It was only 11 months ago that West Ham won their first European trophy for 58 years when they lifted the Europa Conference League final in Prague.\n\nThat victory made Moyes the only British manager since Sir Alex Ferguson to win a European trophy. He led West Ham to sixth place in the Premier League in 2020-21 and seventh place in 2021-22. They got to the quarter-finals of the Europa Conference League this season before losing - as everyone does - to Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nBut that's not good enough, apparently. Many supporters clearly feel it is time for a change and many more point to recent results to back up that feeling, not least the recent drubbings West Ham have suffered at the hands of Chelsea and Crystal Palace.\n\nWest Ham have come under fire for poor results, but they are still above Brighton - who have not received criticism\n\nIt seems pertinent to point out that, for all the criticism aimed at Moyes and his style of play, West Ham are two points ahead of Brighton & Hove Albion, managed by everyone's favourite boss, Roberto De Zerbi. So Moyes must still be doing something right.\n\nFunnily enough, things seem to have fallen away a bit for him since it became an open secret that the club was approaching other managers to take over at the end of the season when Moyes was still talking about his hopes of remaining at the club and signing a new deal.\n\nWhat sort of a way is that to treat a manager like Moyes? Yes, of course we have to accept there will be an element of realpolitik in the appointment of a new manager. Clubs have to plan for the future. But West Ham should have told Moyes they had decided to move on with someone else. They should have been straight with him.\n\nInstead of which, they subjected him to the low-grade humiliation of their open and awkward courtship dances with potential replacements such as Sporting Lisbon manager Ruben Amorim and Lopetegui. That prompted criticism from club legends such as Tony Cottee and Frank McAvennie. Moyes, and the club's supporters, deserved a lot, lot better.\n\nWest Ham and owner David Sullivan have subjected Moyes to humiliation after pulling the rug from under him\n\nIt was a sign of just how much rancour the club's approach was causing that technical director Tim Steidten, who was leading the search for a successor while Moyes was still talking about signing a new contract at the end of the season, had to be banned from entering the dressing room for the remainder of the campaign.\n\nIt could easily be argued that Sullivan - and the club's hierarchy - have cost West Ham a place in European competition next season by the way they have undermined Moyes' authority in the last month. They have pulled the rug out from under him.\n\nStill, it is said that a tribute is being planned for Moyes before his last home game at the London Stadium against Luton on Saturday. Maybe Sullivan will get into the spirit of it and give him a tin tack for a leaving present.\n\nMY RUN FOR ROGER\n\nYou have undoubtedly read enough about me running a long distance very slowly in the past couple of weeks. On Monday, I ran a short distance very slowly instead.\n\nThis time, it was at a brilliant mass participation event in Oxford to mark the 70th anniversary of Sir Roger Bannister running the first sub-four-minute mile at the Iffley Road track. I was lucky enough to interview Sir Roger a few years before he died and talk to a man who achieved one of the great landmarks in modern sport.\n\nThe run on Monday morning finished at the Iffley Road track and as we walked around it, I remembered that Sir Roger had said he only decided to race that day in 1954 when he looked at the flag on the spire of St John the Evangelist Church in the distance and saw that the wind was blowing in a favourable direction.\n\nThe church is still there. The flag is still there. It was still blowing in the wind.\n\nI took part in a run in Oxford to mark the 70th anniversary of Sir Roger Bannister running the first sub-four-minute mile at the Iffley Road track\n\nNEVER UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF SPORT\n\nThe wonderful thing about sport is that it gives you drama at whatever level you watch it. On Saturday morning, before I drove up to watch Manchester City-Wolves, I stopped in to see the second half of a local Under 16s girls' league title-deciding match in which my mate's daughter was playing.\n\nCharlotte's team was 2-1 down and she was generally being marked out of the game by a rather intimidating and generally accomplished right back. With 15 minutes left, Charlotte nicked the ball away from her nemesis near the touchline, advanced a few yards and chipped the ball over the goalkeeper. Cue pandemonium.\n\nA few minutes later, her team scored again and the title was won. I saw Erling Haaland hit four later that day and was filled with wonder at his power and his athleticism and his skill but it's Charlotte's goal that will live longest in my memory.", "source":

There is no doubt about that. But for two years, to my knowledge, West Ham bosses have been thinking 'Should we change direction or not, should we give a little bit more spectacle to the fans?' - more possession and the kind of thing you get with Lopetegui.\n\nOne thing clear in the Spaniard's mind was that he wanted to stay in the Premier League if possible, having left the Wolves job on the eve of this season. When West Ham approached him - and it wasn't the first conversation he has had with him - then it became clear that was this was the kind of club he was after.", "source": {"uri": "capitalfm.co.ke",

That speculation has only increased in recent months with West Ham having won just one of their previous nine Premier League games - their latest result being a 5-0 thrashing by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.\n\nAfter the game, Moyes was asked whether he had any frustration about the club's links with other managers, he said: \"I'll talk to the board at the end of the season. We'll do that then.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'm the manager, I take ownership, but some of the players have to do that too. I feel bad for the fans, I don't normally have teams who come and get beaten like this.\n\n\"But we're lacking some of the ingredients - mental toughness, leadership to not get hammered like we have been several times. I can only say I'm really sorry for the way the game went.\"\n\nIt's understood West Ham's agreement with Lopetegui would see him take over as a head coach, as opposed to the role Moyes holds as manager.\n\nIf Moyes is to be replaced, the head coach would work closely under technical director Tim Steidten - who will have more control over the recruitment.\n\nWhen Moyes was reappointed in 2019, it was under the proviso that he would have a big say in recruitment and transfers.\n\nBut with Steidten's appointment last summer, West Ham are moving towards a more European-based model.\n\nMoyes guided the club to their first European trophy since 1965 when they beat Fiorentina to lift the Europa Conference League last season.\n\nThis campaign, West Ham reached the Europa League quarter-finals and are currently ninth in the Premier League.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports News reporter Danyal Khan in December, Lopetegui explained why he feels he has unfinished business in the Premier League and revealed he has met the PFA, LMA and PGMOL during his time off in a bid to prepare himself for a return to England's top division.\n\n\"It's why I've said no to different countries and different situations because I would like to stay here in England. I feel like our team here is just starting and we want to achieve our dreams.\" Lopetegui said at the time.\n\n\"The way the country lives football here is special - it's the best league in the world, the most competitive league in the world, the best environment for the players, coaches and fans too.\"\n\nFormer Premier League defender Stephen Warnock on Sky Sports News:\n\n\"Show some class, West Ham.

"body": "Manager David Moyes will leave West Ham at the end of the Premier League season, the club have confirmed.\n\nIt comes after BBC Sport's Guillem Balague reported earlier on Monday that former Wolves boss Julen Lopetegui had agreed a deal to replace Moyes.\n\nMoyes, 61, had come under increasing pressure after a poor run of results, including Sunday's 5-0 defeat by Chelsea.\n\n\"I have enjoyed four and a half brilliant years at West Ham, and the club is in a stronger position than when I returned back in 2019,\" Moyes said.\n\nThe Scot took over for his second spell at the club in December 2019 and guided the Hammers to Europa Conference League success last season - their first major trophy for 43 years.\n\nBut his side have won just one of their past 10 games across all competitions, losing five, and, sitting ninth in the Premier League, are likely to miss out on a fourth successive season in Europe.\n\n\"When I joined West Ham for a second time, the club was one place above the relegation zone, and it has been a terrific journey to have achieved three consecutive seasons in Europe,\" Moyes added.\n\n\"I would like to thank all the players for their support, and all the success they have achieved, over the last four and a half years.\n\nWhile nothing has been signed yet, former Spain and Real Madrid boss Lopetegui is close to making a return to management with the Hammers, following his departure from Wolves in August last year.\n\nThough West Ham confirmed the search for Moyes' successor had begun, they said they will not comment until an appointment is made.\n\nThe club's joint chairman David Sullivan said Moyes had been \"responsible for a period of great progress and success\" in West Ham's history.\n\n\"David has been an absolute professional to work with and he will leave with our greatest respect and good wishes - he deserves to be held in the highest esteem for the service he has given to West Ham United, and we wish him every success in the future,\" Sullivan added.\n\n\"By making this announcement now, it allows David to get the send-off he deserves from the West Ham supporters and for us all to show our appreciation to him at our final home fixture of the season against Luton Town on Saturday.\"\n\nMoyes had a first stint in charge of West Ham when he took over following the dismissal of Slaven Bilic in November 2017.\n\nThe Hammers were in the relegation zone at the time but, despite leading the club to Premier League safety, he left in May 2018 before the appointment of Manuel Pellegrini.\n\nMoyes then succeeded Pellegrini in late 2019, with the club just one point away from the relegation zone.\n\nThe Hammers went on to secure European football through their league position in successive seasons for the first time in their history, finishing sixth in 2020-21 and seventh the following season.\n\nHe then delivered European success with victory in the Conference League final against Fiorentina in June 2023 on a memorable night in Prague, followed by a trophy parade through east London.\n\nHowever, the Hammers' heavy loss at Chelsea means they have conceded 70 goals in the Premier League this season, their joint-most in a single campaign in the competition.\n\nOnly bottom three clubs Burnley (74), Luton (78) and Sheffield United (100) have worse defensive records.\n\nAfter hosting Luton on Saturday, West Ham travel to Manchester City for their last game of the season on 19 May.", "source": {"uri": "modernghana.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Modern Ghana Media Communication

Chelsea.\n\n\"West Ham United can confirm David Moyes will leave the club by mutual consent at the end of the 2023/24 season, when his contract expires,\" said a club statement.\n\nMonday's announcement came amid media speculation that former Real Madrid, Wolves and Spain manager Julen Lopetegui had agreed a deal to replace Moyes, in his second spell as West Ham manager, after the end of the current campaign.\n\nThe Chelsea defeat was the second successive away game where West Ham conceded five goals following their loss at Crystal Palace, another London club.\n\nAnd it added to the pressure on Moyes that had been mounting all season, with West Ham fans criticising him throughout the campaign for perceived negative tactics.\n\nWest Ham are currently ninth in the table, a huge 18 points adrift of the top four.\n\nMoyes, however, guided West Ham to the Europa Conference League title last season -- the club's first major honour since they won the 1980 FA Cup.\n\nBut they were knocked out of the Europa League last month following a quarter-final loss to Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nMoyes said: \"I have enjoyed four-and-a-half brilliant years at West Ham, and the club is in a

He quit days before the start of this season after less than a year in charge.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Moyes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Moyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julen_Lopetegui", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Julen Lopetegui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sullivan_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Sullivan (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunderland_A.F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunderland A.F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/e3/de388618-8d70-5cb3-86be-5d7f1d5ad099/66392af5bc9fb.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537206", "eventUri": "eng-9537206", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 593, "textEnd": 606}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

The 57-year-old Spaniard quit Wolves over concerns about their lack of spending power but had done an excellent job in guiding them to safety.\n\nLopetegui's track record in coaching, developing players and also attractive style of play appealed to West Ham who also spoke to Sporting Lisbon Ruben Amirom as they lined up successors for Moyes.\n\nBut Lopetegui emerged as the leading candidate after a turbulent season at West Ham which will see Moyes leave at the end of his second spell in charge.\n\nMoyes led West Ham to their first European trophy since 1965 when they beat Fiorentina to lift the Europa Conference League last season. West Ham fans loved the European success but got fed-up with what they saw as a cautious style of play and that has ultimately led to Moyes' departure.\n\nMoyes saw his side lose 5-0 to Chelsea on Sunday\n\nMoyes has had two spells in charge at the London Stadium, leading them to safety in his first period in charge and then winning silverware in his next.\n\nIt looked as if Moyes would get a new contract after a big pick up in results after Christmas and there were talks about him staying on. But West Ham's exit from Europe and some big defeats - highlighted by Sunday's 5-0 thrashing at Chelsea - have confirmed his departure.\n\nMoyes was frustrated after struggling to replace Declan Rice after his \u00a3105m departure to Arsenal while he wanted more say on transfer targets.\n\nLopetegui will be expected to work more closely with technical director Tim Steidten in a more European model which is another factor why West Ham went for the Spaniard.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

But a number of heavy defeats - Sunday's 5-0 defeat at Chelsea the fifth time they have conceded five goals or more across all competitions - has made it increasingly unlikely that Moyes' contract will be extended.\n\nMoyes has also faced extensive criticism from supporters over what many perceive to be negative tactics, even though West Ham remain in the top half of the table.\n\nTalks were recently held with Sporting CP boss Ruben Amorim over succeeding Moyes at West Ham, but multiple sources, including prominent journalist Fabrizio Romano, report that it's former Wolverhampton Wanderers manager Lopetegui who is in line for a Premier League return.\n\nThe Spaniard was able to keep Wolves up last season after succeeding Bruno Lage at Molineux, but ended his tenure in August amid concerns over the club's financial situation and their inability to fulfil transfer promises made when he took over.\n\nLopetegui is understood to have 'accepted' West Ham's offer to take charge, with all parties now looking to finalise the details of his contract before putting pen to paper.\n\nWest Ham are yet to officially comment on Moyes' future, with reports previously insisting that no decision would be made until the end of the season, and it remains to be seen whether or not an announcement will be made before the home game with Luton Town on Saturday - the club's last Premier League home game of 2023/24.\n\nAs for Lopetegui, he has plenty of pedigree on the European stage. The 57-year-old led Sevilla to Europa League glory in 2020 and has previously managed Real Madrid, Porto and the Spain national team - a position he relinquished on the eve of the 2018 World Cup after news broke of his agreement with Madrid.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Moyes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Moyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julen_Lopetegui", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Julen Lopetegui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molineux_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Molineux Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Porto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Porto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevilla_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sevilla FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luton_Town_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luton Town F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Software/Web_Applications", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Software/Web Applications", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2744,h_1543,x_0,y_195/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/90min_en_international_web/01hx6n1dmj0xzyd00jw8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537206", "eventUri": "eng-9537206", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

The 5-0 defeat at Chelsea means the Hammers have conceded 70 this season - the same number as when they finished bottom of the table under Avram Grant in 2010-11 - with two games left to play.\n\nWhile West Ham have yet to officially confirm Lopetegui's arrival at the time of writing, the former Spain manager has agreed terms over a move. Lopetegui, who has also managed Sevilla and Real Madrid in his homeland, has been biding his time since leaving Wolves in August.\n\nBefore Moyes says goodbye to the Hammer, he has two more games to take charge of. They could both prove pivotal at either end of the table, with relegation-threatened Luton visiting the London Stadium on Saturday before Miyes' team travels to the Etihad Stadium for a final-day game against title contenders Manchester City.\n\n\"I have enjoyed four and a half brilliant years at West Ham, and the Club is in a stronger position than when I returned back in 2019,\" Moyes said in a statement. \"When I joined West Ham for a second time, the Club was one place above the relegation zone, and it has been a terrific journey to have achieved three consecutive seasons in Europe.\n\n\"After leading the Club to safety, we guided the team to finishes of 6th and 7th in the Premier League, and I was delighted when we won the Europa Conference League title last June - the Club's first major trophy in 43 years. I would like to thank all the players for their support, and all the success they have achieved, over the last four and a half years.\n\n\"I have really enjoyed working with everyone at West Ham, and I would like to thank the Board for giving me the opportunity to manage this great Club. I wish my eventual successor, the Directors, the players, the staff, the fans, and everybody at West Ham, all the very best for the future.\"\n\nIs Julen Lopetegui the right choice to replace David Moyes? Have your say in the comments section\n\nJulen Lopetegui is poised to succeed Moyes at the London Stadium\n\nMoyes' team started the season strongly as they looked to build on last year's Europa Conference League triumph. New signings including Mohammed Kudus and Edson Alvarez helped the club deal with the loss of captain Declan Rice to Arsenal, but Moyes cited the departure of the England midfielder when assessing the most recent defeat.\n\n\"You get the best midfield player in the country, protecting, making sure the moments and times you limit maybe 50 per cent of the attacks and the moments, when you get that then it makes you a much better defensive team,\" he said. \"We've lacked protection in front of the back four, we've lacked good enough defending, we've just not been good enough on those things in many games.\"\n\nIncoming boss Lopetegui, like Moyes, has a European trophy in his recent past. He led Sevilla to Europa League glory in 2019-20, eliminating Wolves and Manchester United along the way, but ended up leaving the club after just one win from seven games at the start of the 2022-23 season.\n\nThe 57-year-old took over at Wolves with the club bottom of the Premier League in November 2022, but led them to safety thanks in no small part to seven clean sheets in 11 home league games.

West Ham United have reportedly agreed terms with Julen Lopetegui to succeed David Moyes as manager at the end of the season.\n\nSpeculation over Moyes's future at the London Stadium has been rife for some time, with his current contract due to expire at the end of the season.\n\nThe 61-year-old, who confirmed at the end of February that he has been offered a new contract by the Hammers, has repeatedly rebuffed questions about his future, insisting that talks will not take place until after the club's final match of the season away against Manchester City on May 19.\n\nMoyes has spent just over four years at West Ham, who he successfully steered to Europa Conference League glory last season - the club's first European trophy for 58 years.\n\nHowever, the Scotsman has come under increasing pressure since the turn of the year following a poor run of results - West Ham have won just four of their 23 matches across all competitions in 2024.\n\nThe Hammers most recently suffered a humbling 5-0 defeat at Chelsea in the Premier League on Sunday, leaving them ninth in the table and five points behind the European positions with only two games left to play.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nWest Ham planning for David Moyes exit\n\nWith Moyes's future uncertain, West Ham have already sounded out potential successors and now appear to have made progress in negotiations with one of their top targets.\n\nAccording to multiple reports including BBC Sport, Spanish coach Lopetegui has agreed a deal to become West Ham's new manager at the end of the current campaign.\n\nThe report adds that nothing has been signed just yet, but the 57-year-old is close to making a return to management, nine months after leaving his post at Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\nA separate report from The Athletic claims that Bayern Munich made another enquiry for Lopetegui on Monday, but he is said to have his sights firmly set on West Ham.\n\nLopetegui is also understood to have turned down job offers from a number of other clubs in the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A and Saudi Arabia since leaving Wolves.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nLopetegui has unfinished business in Premier League\n\nLopetegui has been in the managerial business for over 20 years and has had plenty of success across Europe, most notably winning the Europa League with Sevilla in 2019-20.\n\nThe former Real Madrid and Spain manager joined Wolves in November 2022 when they were bottom of the Premier League and led the club to 13th place with 10 victories in 27 games, finishing eight points above the relegation zone.\n\nLopetegui left Molineux by mutual consent last summer amid frustrations over by the club's financial situation, but he is now keen to test himself again in the English top flight.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports News in December, Lopetegui said: \"It's why I've said no to different countries and different situations because I would like to stay here in England. I feel like our team here is just starting and we want to achieve our dreams.\n\n\"The way the country lives football here is special - it's the best league in the world, the most competitive league in the world, the best environment for the players, coaches and fans too.\"\n\nEarlier this year, West Ham had been linked with other managers including Sporting Lisbon's Ruben Amorim and Bayern Munich's soon-to-be-departing Thomas Tuchel, but Lopetegui has emerged as their first-choice target to succeed Moyes, if he decides to part ways with the Hammers this summer.\n\nID:543019:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect6414:", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_thomas@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Oliver Thomas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julen_Lopetegui", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Julen Lopetegui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Moyes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Moyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molineux_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Molineux Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevilla_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sevilla FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sm.imgix.net/23/38/david-moyes.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537206", "eventUri": "eng-9537206", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 681, "textEnd": 687}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

That speculation has only increased in recent months with West Ham having won just one of their previous nine Premier League games - their latest result being a 5-0 thrashing by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.\n\nAfter the game, Moyes was asked whether he had any frustration about the club's links with other managers, he said: \"I'll talk to the board at the end of the season. We'll do that then.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'm the manager, I take ownership, but some of the players have to do that too. I feel bad for the fans, I don't normally have teams who come and get beaten like this.\n\n\"But we're lacking some of the ingredients - mental toughness, leadership to not get hammered like we have been several times. I can only say I'm really sorry for the way the game went.\"\n\nIt's understood West Ham's agreement with Lopetegui would see him take over as a head coach, as opposed to the role Moyes holds as manager.\n\nIf Moyes is to be replaced, the head coach would work closely under technical director Tim Steidten - who will have more control over the recruitment.\n\nWhen Moyes was reappointed in 2019, it was under the proviso that he would have a big say in recruitment and transfers.\n\nBut with Steidten's appointment last summer, West Ham are moving towards a more European-based model.\n\nMoyes guided the club to their first European trophy since 1965 when they beat Fiorentina to lift the Europa Conference League last season.\n\nThis campaign, West Ham reached the Europa League quarter-finals and are currently ninth in the Premier League.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports News reporter Danyal Khan in December, Lopetegui explained why he feels he has unfinished business in the Premier League and revealed he has met the PFA, LMA and PGMOL during his time off in a bid to prepare himself for a return to England's top division.\n\n\"It's why I've said no to different countries and different situations because I would like to stay here in England. I feel like our team here is just starting and we want to achieve our dreams.\" Lopetegui said at the time.\n\n\"The way the country lives football here is special - it's the best league in the world, the most competitive league in the world, the best environment for the players, coaches and fans too.\"\n\nFormer Premier League defender Stephen Warnock on Sky Sports News:\n\n\"Show some class, West Ham. If this is the case, then make a decision on the manager and let him know one way or the other.\n\n\"If you're going around trying to find other managers and you've sounded someone out and agreed a deal with them, then get rid of David Moyes and tell him his time's up.\n\n\"At least show him some respect, don't put the pressure on him to make a decision. It's really classless from West Ham.\"\n\nCoach Ruben Amorim has pledged to stay with Sporting Lisbon after leading the club to its second Portuguese league title in four seasons.\n\nAmorim has been linked with moves to clubs including West Ham and Liverpool, but he said he does not intend to leave. His contract expires in 2026.\n\n\"I'll stay with Sporting,\" he said. \"I have a contract and this is a special moment for me and for the club. We will try to win a third title together.\"\n\nSporting clinched the league on Sunday after Benfica lost at Famalicao 2-0.

Moyes, 61, has seen his side take a sudden downturn in form this calendar year - and the writing looks to be on the wall.\n\nAccording to transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, Lopetegui has agreed terms with the Hammers to become their new head coach, replacing Moyes in the summer. However, West Ham fans have been left fuming thanks to the Spaniard's poor win rate at his first Premier League club.\n\nREAD MORE: West Ham boss David Moyes blasts how respect for managers has plunged to new depths\n\nREAD MORE: West Ham's Jarrod Bowen 'in same class' as England rivals Phil Foden and Cole Palmer\n\nLopetegui's last spell on these shores saw him take the reins at Wolves in November 2022, but he registered a win rate of just 37%, before finishing 13th and leaving in August 2023, when he was replaced by Gary O'Neil. Moyes, on the other hand, has a 44.54% win rate at the Hammers over his second spell, having previously finished sixth, seventh and 14th, with the Hammers currently in ninth.\n\nWhen it comes to major honours, both men have European trophies to their name. Lopetegui won the Europa League in 2022 while at Sevilla, while Moyes claimed the Europa Conference League last season.\n\nWhat do you think about West Ham turning to Julen Lopetegui? Let us know in the comments section\n\n\"From David Moyes to Julen Lopetegui... that is the biggest downgrade in football history. The disrespect towards a manager who won a European trophy at this club as well. Crazy,\" one fan fumed. While a second replied: \"How are they getting rid of Moyes for a downgrade lol...\"\n\n\"How's this man better than Moyes ffs,\" a third questioned. And another added: \"West Ham to replace their third most successful manager ever with a guy who did worse than Gary O'Neil at Wolves with twice the budget...\"\n\nHowever, others were more positive about the potential arrival, with some referencing how he took Sevilla into the Champions League knockout stage. One fan said: \"Julen can take them to the next level!\"\n\nAccording to The Athletic, Lopetegui is a man in demand, and Bayern Munich had been eyeing up a potential swoop for the Wolves flop. However, Lopetegui turned down the approach, seemingly favouring a move to the London Stadium.\n\nSpanish journalist Guillem Balague wrote: \"West Ham and Julen Lopetegui have reached an agreement Another chance to show, as he did at Wolves, that he is one of the top European managers.

Julen Lopetegui has emerged as a top choice despite early fan reservations regarding his potential appointment. Reports suggest the deal with Lopetegui is highly advanced, though it is not finalised yet.\n\nWith David Moyes expected to leave West Ham United at the end of the season, the club are well underway in their search for a new manager for the beginning of the 2024/25 season. David Ornstein recently reported that Sporting Lisbon boss and former Liverpool target Ruben Amirom has \"decided the move is not for him\", while another option is Lille head coach Paulo Fonseca.\n\nBut it is Julen Lopetegui who has emerged as the latest frontrunner for the job, although journalist Dean Jones has told GIVEMESPORT that there are some early reservations about the Spaniard taking over. After tasting European success last season - and their first piece of silverware for 44 years - West Ham fans understandably feel as though their club should be going to the next level.\n\nEarly indications suggest that Lopetegui - who has recent Premier League experience with Wolves - is not the man to take the Hammers forward, despite having managed the likes of Real Madrid and the Spanish national team in recent years.\n\nJulen Lopetegui 'Not the Popular Choice' Among Hammers Fans But it might be too late for West Ham to pull out of the Spaniard's appointment\n\nReports from The Guardian suggest a deal to bring Lopetegui to the London Stadium is close, but Jones has now told GIVEMESPORT that the deal is now \"very advanced\" and possibly too far advanced to make a U-turn. Despite the manager's illustrious CV, Jones feels that the early indications suggest West Ham fans do not want to see Lopetegui make a return to the English top flight with them.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"One of the big early problems around Lopetegui is that it is already becoming clear he is not a very popular choice among many in the fanbase. They have tolerated Moyes but are ready for a new era of football and I think this is a choice that most find underwhelming.\n\n\"He's got good credentials in the game generally but this is an appointment that some are already comparing to when Manuel Pellegrini was brought in. The Lopetegui talk is genuine, he has been a candidate for this job for some time but they were also serious about Ruben Amorim and Paulo Fonseca.\n\n\"I think most people will agree that this is a good moment for Moyes to go but this appointment of Lopetegui is not going down well initially and the noise around such a leak gives David Sullivan a small window of opportunity to consider whether this really is the best choice for the club going forward. I have spoken to people who say this is very advanced though, so it might have already gone too far to turn back on.\"\n\nHow Moyes and Lopetegui's most recent season in England compare (all comps) Moyes (2023/24)Lopetegui (2022/23) Matches5023 Wins219 Draws124 Losses1710 Goals for7823 Goals against8134 Points7531 PPG1.501.35 Statistics correct as of 03/05/2024 West Ham 'Not 100% Decided' on David Moyes Exit The manager could still extend his stay at the club\n\nAlthough Moyes has done a fantastic job for West Ham across two different spells at the club, many feel it is time for him to move on. Speaking on his Q&A on Thursday, Ornstein revealed that the East London club are still not 100% sure whether they will change managers this summer.\n\nHe said:\n\n\"After meeting West Ham, I understand Amorim decided a move there is not for him. If a managerial change is made - which is looking likely but not 100% decided - the likes of Lopetegui are thought to be in the frame. But if there is a preferred candidate I'm not aware of that yet.

terrific journey to have achieved three consecutive seasons in Europe.\"\n\nThe 61-year-old Scot, a former manager of Everton, added: \"After leading the club (West Ham) to safety, we guided the team to finishes of sixth and seventh in the Premier League, and I was delighted when we won the Europa Conference League title last June -- the club's first major trophy in 43 years.\n\n\"I would like to thank all the players for their support, and all the success they have achieved, over the last four-and-a-half years.\"\n\nWest Ham joint chairman David Sullivan told the club's website: \"On behalf of everyone at West Ham United, I would like to offer our sincere thanks and gratitude to David for the contribution he has made to the football club during his time as manager.\n\n\"David has been responsible for a period of great progress and success in our history, and we are extremely grateful for all of his hard work, commitment and dedication to the role.\"", "source": {"uri":

He had impressed at Wolves by guiding them to safety last season, but left amid concerns over the club's financial restrictions.\n\nMoyes will leave as one of West Ham's greatest-ever managers after guiding them to glory in last season's Europa Conference League, a result which ended the club's 43-year wait for a major trophy.\n\nThe last few months have been challenging for him and his team, though, with Sunday's 5-0 defeat at Chelsea extending their run of poor form to one victory in the last 10 games.\n\nAsked on Sunday about his future, Moyes said: \"I am going to talk to the board at the end of the season. We'll do that then.\"\n\nNews of Lopetegui's expected arrival will provide the West Ham supporters with a chance to give Moyes a proper send-off at their final home game of the season, against Luton Town, this weekend.\n\nWest Ham had also considered Sporting head coach Ruben Amorim, although his release clause of \u00a312.8 million is understood to have contributed to the club choosing to prioritise a move for Lopetegui.\n\nAmorim was also an option for Liverpool, who instead moved for Arne Slot, and the Portuguese has now declared his intention to remain at Sporting.\n\nAmorim's side were crowned champions this weekend and the 39-year-old said: \"Stay?

I wish my eventual successor, the Directors, the players, the staff, the fans, and everybody at West Ham, all the very best for the future.\"\n\nMoyes spoke after the Chelsea game of how his team have struggled since losing Declan Rice. The Hammers' captain was sold to Arsenal for \u00a3105m last summer and has helped the Gunners push for the title.\n\nWest Ham started the season strongly, winning three of their first four games and sitting sixth at the turn of the year. They have taken just 16 points from their last 17 games, though, while their defensive record of 70 goals conceded is only exceeded by the three teams in the relegation places.\n\nThe Hammers have two more matches to go under Moyes.

"body": "West Ham United have agreed terms with Julen Lopetegui to succeed David Moyes as manager.\n\nA deal is yet to be signed, but Lopetegui has emerged as the club's top managerial choice and West Ham are close to landing him.\n\nWest Ham's technical director Tim Steidten was tasked with leading the recruitment process in case the club needed to make a managerial change and terms were discussed with multiple candidates.\n\nLopetegui has turned down a number of clubs in the Premier League, La Liga and the Saudi Pro League since departing Wolverhampton Wanderers ahead of the 2023-24 campaign.\n\nBayern Munich again made an enquiry on Monday, but Lopetegui's sights are set on West Ham.\n\nThe West Ham board have received strong references from Wolverhampton Wanderers, the club he left by mutual consent in the summer.\n\nLopetegui was appointed at Molineux in November 2022 with the club bottom of the league before leading them to 10 victories in his 27 matches at the helm and a 13th-place finish -- eight points and five places above the relegation zone.\n\nWest Ham's hierarchy are also impressed by the 57-year-old's record with the Spanish national team.\n\nLopetegui was unbeaten in 20 matches in charge of Spain but was dismissed on the eve of the 2018 World Cup by the Spanish FA after Real Madrid announced they had agreed a deal to appoint him for the 2018-19 season.\n\nHe was sacked after just 14 matches in charge of Real Madrid -- winning six and losing six of his matches at the helm -- before joining Sevilla in the summer of 2019, with whom he won the Europa League title in 2020 and guided to three successive top-four finishes in La Liga.\n\nLopetegui was recently considered by Milan to replace Stefano Pioli this summer before a supporter backlash against the move.\n\nMoyes, 60, started his second stint as West Ham manager in December 2019 and led the club to the Europa League Conference title in 2023, defeating Fiorentina in the final.\n\nDespite successes in Europe, West Ham recorded a 14th-placed Premier League finish in 2022-23.\n\nMoyes has overseen 13 league defeats to date this season, including a recent 5-0 defeat to Chelsea.\n\nIt will be the second time that Moyes has left West Ham.\n\nThe Scot was previously in charge of the club for six months in the 2017-18 season before taking the job again in December 2019.\n\nThe Athletic reported last month the club also held talks with Sporting Lisbon's Ruben Amorim.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors":

Would it balls\n\nLiverpool-linked boss Ruben Amorim met with the Hammers hierarchy last month and has since apologised to the Sporting fans for doing so at a crucial time of their season.\n\nMeanwhile, Lopetegui has reportedly emerged as their top target and has \"held talks\" over the position.\n\nWest Ham were battered 5-0 by Chelsea on Sunday afternoon.\n\nMoyes, who saw his team concede five goals for the second Premier League away game in a row, having gone down 5-2 at Crystal Palace on April 21, is set to hold talks with the board over his future after the Hammers' final league match on May 19.\n\n\"Not good,\" he said of his team's display in west London. \"Lacking toughness, leadership, mental toughness. That's two games we've come away where we've conceded five.\n\n\"The manager will always take the responsibility, that's what happens when you do this job. You have to prepare them, set them up.\n\n\"But somewhere along the line the players have to take responsibility for doing their jobs and being hard to play against, and being aggressive and competitive. I question if we were all that in the first half.\"\n\nLong before half-time, West Ham looked a beaten side, standing off Chelsea and allowing their forward players all the space they needed to pick their way through and plunder Alphonse Areola's goal.\n\nIt was a dismal afternoon for Moyes, who believes Declan Rice's absence is why they have been so leaky at the back.\n\nWest Ham sold Rice (our Premier League signing of the season) to Arsenal for around \u00a3100million last summer. The England midfielder has been outstanding under Mikel Arteta this term.\n\nUNIQUE TO F365: Mediawatch | Mailbox | Winners & Losers | Bespoke Prem tables\n\nMoyes was asked why the Hammers have suffered so many heavy defeats away from home this season, simply replying: \"Declan Rice.\"\n\nHe continued: \"You get the best midfield player in the country, protecting, making sure the moments and times you limit maybe 50 per cent of the attacks and the moments, when you get that then it makes you a much better defensive team.\n\n\"We've lacked protection in front of the back four, we've lacked good enough defending, we've just not been good enough on those things in many games.\n\n\"But, you know, as I've said, you've got to be careful, you're talking about a team sitting in a really, really strong position. We've had a couple of bad days away from home, we have to try and eradicate that and make it better.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 TO THE COMMENTS! Is losing Declan Rice the reason West Ham are so leaky at the back? Join the debate here.\n\n\"As I said, I'm trying to put a bit of mental toughness when we need it. The teams I normally prepare would normally have it. You could always lose the way you lose.\n\n\"To be fair, you have to say Chelsea are in a pretty good moment at the moment. We've hit the bar three times today and Emerson's missed a sitter, so if the game had ended up 5-3 you might have said, 'hey, West Ham had a right good go'.

The Scottish tactician previously insisted that he had a contract offer on the table and would decide his own future. West Ham's Europa League exit has ended fans' expectations of another season in European competition.\n\nDavid Moyes' future at West Ham United continues to look more uncertain by the day with reports touting other managers with the London Stadium job - and The Athletic journalist David Ornstein has claimed that he doesn't believe the Scot's contract offer for next season will still be on the table after a poor run of form.\n\nThe Irons have been superb under his guidance since he began his second term as boss in 2019, embarked on three European campaigns alongside two top-seven finishes, and of course last season's Europa Conference League win a year ago - putting Moyes right up there amongst West Ham's greatest managers.\n\nBut whilst this season began in decent fashion, just three domestic wins since the turn of the year has seen the club drop from sixth-place in the Premier League into ninth, and looking a real possibility of finishing in the bottom half. Calls for Moyes' time at the London Stadium to come to an end have begun, with the club holding talks with other managers already - though whilst Moyes said back in February that he had been offered a new deal, Ornstein believes that the tables have turned and that the expectation is Moyes will move on in the summer.\n\nOrnstein: \"Moyes' Future in Hammers' Hands\" East Londoners originally \"offered\" Moyes a contract for next season\n\nSpeaking to NBC, Ornstein claimed that Moyes would be unlikely to stay at West Ham, though you could never say never - despite talks with other bosses. He said:\n\n\"The first thing to say here is that there is an expectation that David Moyes will be moving on from West Ham at the end of this season. That is not confirmed just yet, the deliberations continue.\n\n\"He did say in late February that he had been offered a contract, but it would be his decision over whether that would be signed and he would take that at the end of the season.\n\n\"But in the time that has passed, I'm not sure that contract offer is still there and I'm also not sure that it will be his decision any longer. I think it will probably be in the hands of West Ham - but whatever happens, contingency plans need to be formed.\n\n\"That's why I revealed they were in discussions with Ruben Amorim to potentially take over if there was a vacancy. My understanding now is that Amorim doesn't feel that job is for him if it comes up.\n\n\"They have also held conversations with Julen Lopetegui, formerly of Wolves. That's at quite an advanced stage, but again not done yet.\n\n\"The situation has not been helped by Tim Steidten, the sporting director, who is holding these talks, being kept away from the dressing room at the training ground and stadium - this is a very delicate situation at West Ham, so let's see how it goes.\"\n\nWest Ham Could Be Better With Managerial Changes The Irons have some superb attacking talents\n\nA Europa League exit to Bayer Leverkusen has all but killed their chances of featuring in continental competition next season, leaving fans largely underwhelmed at what promised to be another good campaign back in August.\n\nWith Jarrod Bowen, Lucas Paqueta and Mohammed Kudus in their attacking midfield ranks, West Ham have a frontline that is admired up and down the country.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: David Moyes has won 102 of his 229 games in charge of the Irons.\n\nBut with their style of football suited to a more defensively solid side, there may well be a case for fans to want to bring a new manager in; though it is so far unknown as to who that may be.\n\nRelated West Ham Have had 'Change of Mood' over David Moyes' Future The Hammers boss is set to be replaced at the end of the season\n\nStatistics courtesy of Transfermarkt.

He has the quality and the experience to do well in the Premier League and it remains to be seen whether he can get the best out of the West Ham squad. There is no doubt that the Hammers have quality players at their disposal and they should be doing better in the league.\n\nDavid Moyes helped them win the UEFA Europa Conference League last year and they did reasonably well in the Europa League this season. However, with the quality of players at their disposal, they have underperformed.\n\nThe West Ham manager was backed heavily during the summer transfer window with quality signings like Edson Alvarez, James Ward-Prowse and Mohammed Kudus.

He led the Irons to the 2022-23 Europa Conference League title.\n\nWest Ham started well this season and say sixth through Week 22, and the club reached the Europa League quarterfinals before bowing out to Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nThe Irons, however, are in danger of missing European football next season after winning just three of 14 games down the stretch. They'll finish with Luton Town at home and Man City at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nRead the full statement from Moyes, as well as thoughts from Irons joint-chairman David Sullivan, here.\n\n\"I would like to thank all the players for their support, and all the success they have achieved, over the last four and a half years.\n\n\"I have really enjoyed working with everyone at West Ham, and I would like to thank the Board for giving me the opportunity to manage this great Club.\n\n\"I wish my eventual successor, the Directors, the players, the staff, the fans, and everybody at West Ham, all the very best for the future.\"\n\nThe 61-year-old Moyes refurbished his reputation at West Ham, and the club benefited from his steady hand.\n\nThe Conference League win was wonderful, but his willingness to cede possession to everyone despite massive talent like Mohammed Kudus, Lucas Paqueta, and Jarrod Bowen led to a lot of disappointing play.\n\nThere aren't expected to be too many managerial openings this summer in the Premier League, so it seems likely Moyes will settle into the status of \"first named candidate for next open non-Big Six job.\"\n\nThe 57-year-old Lopetegui may just inspire some of West Ham's stars to considering sticking around London, but that's still a tough ask if the Irons aren't in Europe.\n\nLopetegui led Sevilla to the 2019-20 Europa League and is used to piling up wins from his time at Porto, Spain, and Sevilla. He is a former Real Madrid boss who got a very short time with Real's first team to start the 2018-19 season.\n\nHis time at Wolves showed promise but he left the club last summer over reported issues with the club's player recruitment process.\n\nLopetegui often deploys a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1 formation, though tactically he's a chameleon and there was plenty of 4-4-2 play in his short stay at Wolves. He brought in Pablo Sarabia, Mario Lemina, Craig Dawson, and Joao Gomes during that tenure.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Moyes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Moyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_North_End_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Preston North End F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julen_Lopetegui", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julen Lopetegui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Sociedad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Sociedad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Manchester_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "City of Manchester Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Redknapp", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Redknapp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luton_Town_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luton Town F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Sarabia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pablo Sarabia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr\u00e9_Gomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andr\u00e9 Gomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Dawson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Dawson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Lemina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mario Lemina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Porto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Porto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevilla_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sevilla FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrod_Bowen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrod Bowen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8c2a0ca/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3939x2216+0+205/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fbe%2Fd2%2F24cf52564cbe9ab5103ebf08b0e8%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1456569331", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537206", "eventUri": "eng-9537206", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-02", "dateEnd": "-03-01", "textStart": 2972, "textEnd": 2979}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

No West Ham manager has achieved that since Harry Redknapp over two decades ago.\n\nBut modern-day football is a brutal business.\n\nThe Scot takes charge of his penultimate game of his second spell at London Stadium against Luton on Saturday.\n\nMoyes' final task will be to plot the downfall of Pep Guardiola's Manchester City - trying to get the win likely needed to secure a historic fourth successive Premier League title on the final day.\n\nAfter that, the former Manchester United, Everton, Sunderland, Preston and Real Sociedad manager will decide whether to resume his managerial career elsewhere or take up the offer of work with Uefa around the technical aspects of the game.\n\nMany people will look at the table, look at what West Ham were and what they are now, look at the loss of Declan Rice for \u00a3105m last summer and believe no manager could have done any more.\n\nYet that overlooks a significant point.\n\nHammers fans pay to watch their team. While there is widespread appreciation for what Moyes has achieved, a growing number are fed up at the way he has gone about it.\n\nIn an era of high press, risk-taking, front-foot football, they view Moyes as a largely defensive coach.\n\nThis is unfair. There are times - the 5-0 win against Freiburg and second-leg salvage mission in the Europa League quarter-final against Bayer Leverkusen - when West Ham are a thrilling team to watch.\n\nHowever, the sentiment after those games tends to be 'why can't we play like that every week'?\n\nIn addition, they see a development pathway strong enough to produce last season's FA Youth Cup winners that hardly supplies any players for the first team.\n\nWith the exception of Rice, the only regular homegrown member of Moyes' squad has been ex-England U21s defender Ben Johnson, who is expected to leave in the summer.\n\nThis was anticipated to be a breakthrough season for 19-year-old striker Divin Mubama. The local boy is yet to start a domestic game and has not come off the bench since the draw with Sheffield United at Bramall Lane in January.\n\nMoyes is not averse to using young players. But he needs to be sure they are capable of performing at the high level required.\n\nHe was slated over the \u00a318m departure of Grady Diangana in 2020. Current sporting director Mark Noble - captain at the time - was among those to voice his disapproval. Diangana has gone on to make over 130 appearances for West Brom, most of them in the Championship, a third of them as a substitute.\n\nSupporters can have their opinions, Moyes believes he knows whether players are good enough or not - and acts accordingly.\n\nHe has tried to make West Ham less reliant on the counter-attack.\n\nWhile he sidelined record signing Sebastian Haller when he returned for a second stint as manager in December 2019 - and a second demand to drag the club clear of relegation trouble - the \u00a330.5m arrival of Italy forward Gianluca Scamacca on a five-year deal in 2022 was supposed to be part of a new era.\n\nBut after a decent start Scamacca went nine games up to the World Cup without a goal as West Ham slipped down the table. Apart from three substitute appearances, he didn't play from January until the end of the season. The Hammers needed to scrap to survive and Moyes was forced to revert to type.\n\nThey picked their way through the Europa Conference League, culminating in that glorious night when Moyes showed his emotional side by hugging his dad, who was close to tears, after finally underlining an outstanding managerial career by winning a trophy thanks to Jarrod Bowen's last-minute winner against Fiorentina.\n\nYet even as Moyes celebrated that triumph - West Ham's first silverware in 43 years - which qualified them for a third consecutive European campaign for the first time in their history, some fans felt it would be an appropriate time for him to leave.\n\nJust short of 12 months on, those supporters - and a few others it has to be admitted - have got their wish.\n\nLopetegui, cruelly dubbed by some as a Spanish Moyes because of his tactics, will be in charge next season.\n\nTime will tell whether West Ham were right to make a change or if they were treating a proud individual really badly for doing a really fine job.\n\nHowever it turns out, eventually, history will judge Moyes to be a legendary figure at West Ham.

Veteran Scottish manager David Moyes has been at the helm of the Hammers ever since late 2019. His arrival at the time was his second stint with the club after he previously took over during the 2017/18 season.\n\nMoyes was previously under fire last season as the east London side slipped in the Premier League standings. The Hammers dropped down to 14th in the table in 2022/23, a year after finishing seventh. Nevertheless, the coach essentially saved his job by winning the Europa Conference League last summer. The triumph was certainly unique as the club became the lowest-placed team in their domestic table to win a European trophy.\n\nThere have been various suggestions that West Ham recently offered their current coach a new contract. Despite feeling the heat from the fans, Moyes then claimed that any decision on his future would not come until the end of the season. The writing, however, is now on the wall and Scot is likely to depart London in the coming weeks.\n\nAccording to a report by The Guardian, Hammers brass is advancing in talks with Lopetegui. While the details still need to be ironed out, an agreement between the two sides seems to be within reach. Even though Moyes is not yet out the door, the club is certainly actively looking for his successor. It was previously reported that Sporting CP's Ruben Amorim was negotiating a deal to join West Ham.\n\nAmorim is widely seen as one of the top young coaches in all of Europe. The Portuguese manager was previously linked with fellow English side Liverpool. Nevertheless, West Ham, or any other team, would have to pay Sporting a supposed fee of around $16 million to sign the coach. This price tag was too much for the Hammers to even consider paying.\n\nUnlike Amorim, Lopetegui is currently without a job, thus making him a free agent. The Spanish manager most recently took over at Wolves during the 2022/23 campaign. He also previously coached at successful European clubs such as Real Madrid, Sevilla, and Porto. Before joining Los Blancos, the Spaniard had an unbeaten run of 20 games with the Spain national team.\n\nLopetegui may not be the most popular pick for Hammers fans. Yet, his recent work at Wolves cannot go unappreciated. The manager entered the fray at the West Midlands side with the club sitting bottom of the Premier League standings. However, Lopetegui made an instant impact with his new squad. With the Spaniard at the helm, Wolves not only avoided relegation. They climbed up to 13th in the table.\n\nLopetegui's departure from the English club was not down to his failures as their coach. Instead, the manager opted to leave the team due to their precarious financial situation. Lopetegui wanted to improve the squad by spending in the summer transfer window. The club, however, sold several key players. This list included stars such as Ruben Neves, Matheus Nunes, and Nathan Collins.\n\nWest Ham currently finds themselves ninth in the English top-flight table at the moment. The Hammers will have to make a late push to grab a European place next season, something that Lopetegui will surely be hoping for.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julen_Lopetegui", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Julen Lopetegui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Moyes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Moyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matheus_Nunes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matheus Nunes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R\u00faben_Neves", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "R\u00faben Neves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Porto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Porto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevilla_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sevilla FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fencing/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fencing/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fencing/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fencing/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://worldsoccertalk.com/api/request-image/?proxy=https://ds-images.bolavip.com/news/image?src=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.worldsoccertalk.com%2Fjpg%2Ffull%2FWST_20240503_WST_504951_West-Ham-Lopetegui.jpg[ampersand]width=1200[ampersand]height=740", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537206", "eventUri": "eng-9537206", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Only the bottom three teams have conceded more.\n\nWhat an awful tally for the club, especially when considering the fact that Moyes prides himself on being a defensive manager!\n\nPerhaps sitting back and soaking up pressure all game long is a really bad tactic that will always lead to conceding goals - who would have thought it!\n\nMoyes has theory on West Ham Premier League goals conceded tally\n\nWhat a disastrous state we're in right now as a club.\n\nWe are managed by a man who is out of his depth in the modern game, and most of the players aren't up to it either.\n\nOur defence is an absolute shambles right now, but why? What's the root cause of the issue?\n\nMoyes's answer to that question absolutely stunned me.\n\nA reporter asked the Hammers boss why his side have been so poor defensively this season, as quoted by Hayters TV:\n\n\"Declan Rice\", Moyes responded.\n\nWow, just wow. It's not like you're a professional football manager or anything Dave is it! It's not like you get paid to rebuild the team when we lose a key player, and backed extremely well financially to do so by the way!\n\nWest Ham sold Declan Rice and replaced him with Edson Alvarez and James Ward-Prowse. Moyes signed off on those deals, so the fact he's moaning about it now is utterly bizarre.\n\nLook how Brighton move on when they lose their best players, or teams abroad like Sporting or Ajax.\n\nIt seems to me like the Scot has a serious issue with the fact that he is not immortalised at West Ham, nor will he go down as a club legend in most fans' eyes.\n\nHe clearly feels like the Hammers supporters should be far more grateful to him for what he's done at the London Stadium over the past four years or so, and he took a back-handed dig at us once again after the Chelsea defeat yesterday.\n\nThe thing is, he's done at the London Stadium.

For the official record, he will leave the club by mutual consent, but that is just press release boiler plate. Given that the Hammers have their replacement already lined up, in Julen Lopetegui, the Scotsman is being forced out, plain and simple.\n\n\"West Ham United can confirm David Moyes will leave the Club by mutual consent at the end of the 2023/24 season, when his contract expires.David will depart after four and a half years in charge at London Stadium, during which time he secured two top-seven Premier League finishes, runs to the UEFA Europa League semi and quarter-finals, and victory in last season's UEFA Europa Conference League, with a 2-1 win over ACF Fiorentina in Prague securing West Ham's first major trophy since lifting the FA Cup in 1980, and their first European success since 1965.\n\nBack during the festive period, when Moyes and West Ham were doing well, there was talk of a potential contract extension for Moyes. However, once the calendar flipped, the Irons went severely downhill, and they have only won four games, across all competitions, in 2024.\n\nIt is public knowledge that Moyes and Tim Steidten, West Ham's technical director, just do not get along well at all.\n\nThe situation is so strained that Steidten has been asked to stay away from Moyes and the Irons first team.\n\nAnd Lopetegui, who has now reached an agreement with his new club, wasn't Steidten's first choice for replacing Moyes.\n\nThe east London club held talks with Sporting Lisbon's R\u00faben Amorim, but supposedly, he has a release clause that is a little too rich for their blood. Amorim publicly confirmed that he'll stay on at Sporting earlier today.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsbank.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Bank"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Moyes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Moyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julen_Lopetegui", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julen Lopetegui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACF_Fiorentina", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ACF Fiorentina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prague"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R\u00faben_Amorim", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "R\u00faben Amorim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sporting CP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thesportsbank.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/david-moyes.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537206", "eventUri": "eng-9537206", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The Scot will leave the club after five years in charge. Julen Lopetegui is rumoured as a potential replacement for Moyes at the Hammers.\n\nDavid Moyes' near five-year stint at West Ham United is set to come to an end, with the club announcing he will leave his role as manager at the end of the 2023/24 season. Arriving in December 2019, the former Everton boss came in and transformed the club from a side battling against potential relegation to one that won the Europa Conference League.\n\nThe last few years have seen some incredible highs at the club, but there have also been some pretty noticeable lows and after last season's triumph, the side have taken a step back this time around. Despite a solid start to the campaign, their form has fallen off a cliff recently, and their recent 5-0 thumping at the hands of Chelsea proved to be the final straw.\n\nAfter the humiliating loss, the club have come out and announced that the Scot will leave his role in the summer, and they will look to replace him. Moyes' future at the London Stadium has been up in the air for a while now, and rumours about his departure have been circulating online. Former Wolverhampton Wanderers boss Julen Lopetegui has already been linked with the club, and it is now official that Moyes will not return for the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nMore to follow...", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Moyes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Moyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julen_Lopetegui", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julen Lopetegui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fencing/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fencing/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-06-may-2024-06-23-pm-1393_720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537206", "eventUri": "eng-9537206", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 396, "textEnd": 409}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

clubs such as Porto, Real Madrid, the Spanish national team, and Sevilla, where he won the Europa League, Lopetegui is seen as a strong candidate for the West Ham job.\n\nIn addition to Lopetegui,

The Hammers held talks with Sporting CP boss Ruben Amorim in April but to no avail, and now it appears Lopetegui is close to landing the job.\n\nThe former Spain boss, 57, has been out of work since leaving Molineux on the eve of the Premier League season. He led Wolves to a 13th-place finish after taking over with the team bottom of the table, and signed this season's joint-top scorer Matheus Cunha.\n\nWest Ham finished a point behind Wolves in the table last season, and are three points above them this term as both teams chase a top-half finish. Both teams still have to face title contenders Manchester City before the end of the campaign, with the Londoners travelling to the Etihad Stadium on the final day.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, talks with Lopetegui have been 'gathering pace'. However, there are still understood to be some final steps to take care of before any announcement is made.\n\nMoyes, for his part, is due to hold talks with the board after the final game against Manchester City. An extended stay for the former Manchester United and Everton boss - who rejoined the Hammers midway through the 2019-20 season - has not been ruled out.\n\nLopetegui, who previously managed Sevilla and Real Madrid, has also been linked with the AC Milan job with Stefano Pioli tipped to leave the San Siro at the end of the season. Paulo Fonseca is another to have been linked with both Milan and West Ham, but Lopetegui appears to now be the front-runner to take over at the London Stadium.\n\nWould Julen Lopetegui be a good fit for West Ham? Have your say in the comments section\n\nLopetegui has been out of work since leaving Molineux\n\n\"I have nothing to announce. I am happy,\" Moyes said in April after West Ham were knocked out of the Europa League by Bayer Leverkusen. \"We are just getting on with the job. We are playing games. We have five left to play. We will get on with it. I said there was no real big rush to do anything and I still feel that way.\n\n\"We had a pretty good start to the year. We have kept it going and we have probably been sixth, seventh, eighth. I am hoping we can keep ourselves in that position. We have been there most of the year.\"\n\nHis team have now played the first two of those five games, slumping to a 5-2 defeat at Crystal Palace before drawing at home to Liverpool last time out. If they lose at Chelsea on Sunday, it will all but end their hopes of a top-six finish after a dismal run which has seen them win just one of their last eight league games.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The 57-year-old, who won the Europa League with Sevilla, had also been linked with a possible vacancy at AC Milan and was expected to attract further interest in the weeks ahead, including from Bayern Munich, prompting West Ham to push ahead with appointing him. The club had also held talks with Sporting boss Ruben Amorim but to no avail.\n\nWest Ham also noted that the decision to part ways with Moyes early will allow supporters to celebrate his tenure in the final home match of the season against Luton Town on Saturday. The 61-year-old's final match in charge will be away to Manchester City.\n\n\"On behalf of everyone at West Ham United, I would like to offer our sincere thanks and gratitude to David for the contribution he has made to the football club during his time as manager,\" said joint-chairman David Sullivan. \"David has been responsible for a period of great progress and success in our history, and we are extremely grateful for all of his hard work, commitment and dedication to the role.\n\n\"David has been an absolute professional to work with and he will leave with our greatest respect and good wishes - he deserves to be held in the highest esteem for the service he has given to West Ham United, and we wish him every success in the future.

Ham manager", "body": "Former Wolves, Real Madrid and Spain coach Julen Lopetegui has emerged as the strong favourite to replace David Moyes at West Ham.\n\nThe 57-year-old Spaniard has been out of work since leaving Wolves on the eve of this season but has a verbal agreement in place to join West Ham, according to widespread reports.\n\nMoyes is out of contract at the end of the season and has long looked unlikely to be renewed, despite the Scot insisting that a new deal remained on the table.\n\nIn the meantime the Hammers' season has unravelled in the second half of the campaign as they have exited all cup competitions and slid down the Premier League table.\n\nWest Ham also reportedly held talks with Sporting Lisbon manager Ruben Amorim, who has led them to the Portuguese title but now looks set to stay at the club.\n\nBut instead it is Lopetegui who seems set to be anointed as Moyes's replacement and tasked with reviving a squad that has wilted in worrying fashion this year.\n\nThe Basque retains a high standing in the game, having won the Europa League with Sevilla in 2020 and managed Real Madrid and the national team.\n\nHe presided over an unbeaten 20-match tenure with Spain before his sacking, on the eve of the 2018 World Cup in Russia, for agreeing to join Real Madrid.\n\nLopetegui's record is far from flawless, however, having also been dismissed by Madrid and previous clubs Sevilla, Porto and Rayo Vallecano.\n\nHe enjoyed a reasonable six months at Wolves, finishing 13th in the Premier League before departing just days before the new campaign amid reports of mutual disaffection.\n\nLopetegui is expected to take on the role of head coach rather than manager, meaning technical director Tim Steidten will have greater say over transfers.\n\nThat change in responsibilities is reported to have been one of the sticking points between West Ham and Moyes over any contract extension.\n\nIt seems certain to be a sad end to Moyes's second stint at the London Stadium, despite delivering the Europa Conference League last season.\n\nThey have won just four of 23 games in 2024 and have conceded five goals in two of their last three games, including Sunday's thrashing at Chelsea.\n\nHis last two games as West Ham boss are set to be at home to Luton Town on Saturday and away at champions Manchester City on the final day.",

On Sunday afternoon, those Chelsea supporters sang their way up to seventh in the table, courtesy of a 5-0 win -- five points clear of West Ham in ninth and with European qualification in their sights over the remaining three games.\n\nDuring the pre-match press conference on Friday, a journalist asked Moyes if his hunger remained in light of West Ham's slide down the table and several reports linking other managers with his job. \"Absolutely,\" he insisted. \"I'm nearly embarrassed for you that you asked me that. I love football -- I'm a football nut. I go to games, I watch games, I love it. I really do.\"\n\nMoyes has remained insistent for months: he will continue focusing on the job until his contract expires at the end of the season, after which he will discuss his future with the club's board. He is unquestionably their most successful manager in half a century, taking West Ham -- who were a place and one point above the relegation zone when he was appointed, for the second time, in December 2019 -- into Europe for three successive seasons and delivering a European trophy, just the second in their history.\n\nThe performance and 1-1 draw at home against Bayer Leverkusen, the German Bundesliga's still-unbeaten 2023-24 champions, in the second leg of a Europa League quarter-final just over two weeks ago demonstrated that the \"hunger\" was still there, as did a battling 2-2 draw against visitors Liverpool last weekend.\n\nSandwiched between those matches, however, was a 5-2 away defeat to Crystal Palace, a scoreline that underscored a dominant display in which Michael Olise, Eberechi Eze and Jean-Phillipe Mateta took apart a limp West Ham defence.\n\nWith another five against them today, Moyes' men have conceded 70 goals in the league this season -- the worst defensive record in the top flight outside of its bottom three and, with two games left, the joint-most the club have ever given up in a Premier League campaign.\n\nThe other season they conceded 70 was 2010-11, when West Ham finished bottom, six points adrift of the side in 19th place.\n\nWith a home game against Luton Town on Saturday and a final-day trip to a Manchester City side who may still have the title to play for remaining, this team, littered with internationals, look likely to become the sole holders of that unwanted record.\n\nIn February, Moyes said, \"Maybe there will be managers who excite them (West Ham fans) more, possibly. But the one who's sitting here wins more,\" after a 2-0 away defeat against relegation candidates Nottingham Forest. Right now, Moyes is not winning and not delivering exciting football, and it seems inevitable that he will not be patrolling the Premier League's touchlines in a West Ham tracksuit next season.\n\nAfter a brief dalliance with Sporting Lisbon coach Ruben Amorim in London, West Ham have held talks with former Spain, Real Madrid and Wolves coach Julen Lopetegui about the job for next season, placing the spotlight firmly on Moyes and how he would respond at Stamford Bridge.\n\nHe spent much of the opening exchanges outside of his technical area in close discussion with Kurt Zouma and Vladimir Coufal, West Ham's defenders on that side of the pitch. The fourth official was the subject to much of his ire early on, particularly after referee Andy Madley gave Chelsea a free kick within the first two minutes -- Coufal adjudged to have fouled Mykhailo Mudryk despite the Czech Republic international appearing to have won the ball.\n\nBut when Cole Palmer put Chelsea ahead after 15 minutes and Gallagher doubled their lead in the 30th, that resolve appeared to dissolve from a West Ham perspective.\n\nIn a bid to arrest Chelsea's offensive dominance, defensive midfielder Edson Alvarez was replaced at half-time with the scoreline at 3-0 after Madueke quickly added another, but his replacement, James Ward-Prowse, had limited influence in preventing Chelsea's attacking transitions.\n\n\"Too many poor things happened within the game,\" Moyes said. \"I didn't enjoy today at all. Players were not in position or ran out of position, opening up too easily. We made it harder for them to score in the second half, but we gave away two ridiculous goals. Not good: lacking toughness, leadership, mental toughness.\n\n\"Now (with that recent trip to Palace) it's two games that we've come away and conceded five, and look, the manager should always take the responsibility. (But) Somewhere along the line, the players have to take responsibility in doing their jobs, being hard to play against, being aggressive and competitive. I question if we were all that in the first half.\"\n\nHad Rice been out injured or even left in late January this year, when West Ham's results had tailed off, supporters may understand this reasoning. But he signed for Arsenal in the middle of last July, and Moyes' inability to find a solution over the past 10 months will not inspire confidence in a fanbase which appears to have gone from split allegiances regarding the Scot's future to an overwhelming sense of disillusion.\n\nWest Ham did hit the crossbar three times in the match, and Chelsea old boy Emerson Palmieri \"missed a sitter\", in Moyes' words, but, at this stage, any result feels inconsequential.\n\nMoyes is a West Ham legend for what he's achieved at European level, and he has guided the club to consistent success in an era where the gap between the Premier League's top six and the rest is the starkest it has ever been. For all that, he deserves enormous credit.\n\nSinking into his seat in an away dugout as the fans in the stands and his players lose interest is not how it should end.", "source": {"uri":

It didn't get any better two minutes after the restart, as Chelsea striker Nicolas Jackson got in on the act to compound Moyes' misery and then scored again late on to make it a rousing 5-0 win.\n\nWest Ham are in talks to replace Moyes at the end of this season, despite there still being no confirmation that he'll be leaving his post when his contract expires in June. Former Wolves boss Julen Lopetegui is currently the frontrunner, with Mirror Football understanding that an agreement is close to being reached.\n\nMoyes' four-and-a-half-year tenure will end on a sour note if the Irons' dismal display at Stamford Bridge is anything to go by, with Sky Sports pundits Jamie O'Hara and Clinton Morrison slamming his players. \"West Ham are on the beach,\" ex-Premier League striker Morrison claimed.\n\n\"It's just embarrassing the way they're playing at the moment, they're not enough making a challenge or anything, it looks like they've just downed tools... You've gotta keep going until the end of the season. It's not like Chelsea have been fantastic. West Ham have been terrible.\"\n\nFormer Tottenham midfielder O'Hara followed up by saying: \"It's disgraceful actually, it's shocking what they're producing. You've got West Ham fans travelling to see that game, a big game, a huge game for the football club, a London derby. They're walking about.\"\n\nYour turn! Is Julen Lopetegui the right man for West Ham? Give us your verdict in the comments section\n\nDavid Moyes' contract expires this summer\n\nMoyes maintains that his future won't be decided until the summer, saying last week: \"I've not had any communication at all. That is because we've already decided amongst ourselves that we would talk at the end of the season. There is a lot of speculation around, I understand that. But we need to get things right.\"\n\nSince then, West Ham technical director Tim Steidten has been barred from entering the first-team dressing room for the remainder of the campaign, as he puts together a succession plan. Moyes insists that there hasn't been a bust-up, though, adding: \"We don't want any distractions, we keep our eye on the ball.\n\n\"Tim's got his job to do, I've got my job to do. We've got three games to play and we want to keep focused on those. We're just going about our jobs. My job is to win the games and I'll do everything I can to do that.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

That's two games we've come away where we've conceded five.\n\n\"The manager will always take the responsibility, that's what happens when you do this job.

Lopetegui has accepted #WHUFC proposal, ready to proceed to formal stages. Details being finalised then contracts will be signed but agreement in place.\"\n\nLong before half-time in their defeat to Chelsea, West Ham looked a beaten side, standing off Chelsea and allowing their forward players all the space they needed to pick their way through and plunder Alphonse Areola's goal.\n\nCole Palmer scored the first, his 21st of the season in the league, capitalising when Kurt Zouma's half-clearance landed at his feet, before Conor Gallagher volleyed brilliantly into the corner from a loose ball.\n\nNoni Madueke nodded in the third, reacting quickest at the back post after Thiago Silva's header flashed across goal from a corner.\n\nMORE ON WEST HAM FROM F365\n\n\ud83d\udc49 'Writing on the wall' for Moyes at West Ham after blaming Rice for Chelsea hammering\n\n\ud83d\udc49 The Premier League lie has been exposed again in European disaster\n\nAnd he passed up the chance to add to his personal tally when he unselfishly squared for Nicolas Jackson to tap in two minutes into the second half, as West Ham's torrid afternoon showed no sign of easing.\n\nThey were unlucky not to register at least a consolation. It was an indictment of their misfortune that Jarrod Bowen struck the crossbar not once but three times, but it would not have substantially altered the feeling around this most comprehensive defeat.\n\nJackson completed their humiliation with his second late on to leave Moyes' situation looking increasingly uncertain.\n\nMoyes added: \"Too many poor things within the game. It's happened several times this season, which I've certainly not enjoyed. I didn't enjoy today at all.\n\n\"Players not in positions, running out of position and opening up to easily.

Moyes will forever be known as one of West Ham's greatest managers but these last few weeks have been more befitting an unloved interim coach than a man of his stature.\n\nThis drubbing by Chelsea was embarrassing for West Ham's players and, by natural extension, for Moyes too. Not for the first time in recent games, they lacked the basic ingredients required to compete in a Premier League match, and the reaction from their supporters was indicative of the wider mood: with half an hour to play, the away end was mostly empty.\n\nLondon derbies have shone an unforgiving light on West Ham in the past month. At home to Fulham in April, they lost 2-0. Away to Crystal Palace a week later, they conceded five goals. Here, against a Chelsea team that was allowed to play football at walking pace, they conceded five again.\n\nA run of one win in 10 matches is a statistical explanation for why Moyes, whose contract expires at the end of this season, is not expected to stay. This season is fizzling out and, in truth, is now threatening to become a little ugly.\n\nAt the full-time whistle, Moyes immediately hurried down the tunnel. Kevin Nolan, one of his assistant coaches, then seemed to briefly squabble with Kurt Zouma, the West Ham captain. Zouma also headed directly for the dressing room, rather than towards the remaining fans in the away end. It was not a good look.\n\nEvidently, this is not a happy camp. Just last week, technical director Tim Steidten was told to stay away from first-team areas because it was decided it would be best to prevent him from crossing paths with Moyes. Steidten, you see, is currently working to find potential replacements for Moyes (Julen Lopetegui, formerly of Wolves, is regarded by some as the leading candidate).\n\nA delicate and awkward time for all concerned, then, and it was hard to avoid the conclusion that the players know this is the end for Moyes. This was not evidence of a team fighting for the manager. The defensive organisation was non-existent, they were weak on set pieces and, by the end, most of them had simply stopped running.\n\n\"Players not in their positions, running out of position, opening up too easily,\" said Moyes, who added that the loss of Declan Rice was the main reason for his side's away defeats this season.\n\n\"We were lacking toughness, leadership. The manager will always take the responsibility because that's what you do in this job. You have to prepare them and get them right. Somewhere along the line the players have to take responsibility for doing their jobs, being hard to play against, being aggressive and competitive.\"\n\nMoyes, as he said, is not blameless. He may have sent out a team to win a European trophy a year ago, but here he also sent out a team without any discernible plan of how to deal with Cole Palmer. Just as one is worthy of praise, the other will attract criticism.\n\nSince a terrific victory at Arsenal in late December, West Ham have won just three of 17 league matches. Change of some sort is required, and a parting of the ways between Moyes and the club feels both natural and inevitable.

If let go, it would mark the second time that WHUFC have sacked Moyes, who has only won four games, across all competitions, in 2024.\n\nIt is public knowledge that Moyes and Tim Steidten, West Ham's technical director, just do not get along at all. The situation is so strained that Steidten has been asked to stay away from Moyes and the Irons first team.\n\nAnd Lopetegui wasn't Steidten's first choice for replacing Moyes either.\n\nThe east London club held talks with Sporting Lisbon's R\u00faben Amorim, but supposedly, he has a release clause that is a little too rich for their blood. Thomas Tuchel has also been linked, but it remains to be seen if he would actually take the job or not.\n\nPlus there is still a chance that he might stay put at Bayern Munich, provided the right set of situations and circumstances unfold.\n\nThe Hammers have also been linked with likes of Hansi Flick, Marco Silva, Paulo Fonseca and Graham Potter.\n\nAlso, the idea of the Lopetegui hire has certainly drawn some backlash from Hammers supporters:\n\nNo matter what happens with Moyes, he'll always have this- he ended the club's silverware drought.

I understand the gripe from fans with the style of play, but, results-wise, I think ninth is about right with the quality of squads above them. David Moyes is a goner, but I can't see the next man doing that much better, if at all. Seems playing more exciting football would be better than good results for some West Ham fans.\n\nPhil answered: I agree with much of that, Paul. I do think David Moyes has done a very good job at West Ham United and brought them a European trophy and yet I do not think he gets the credit he deserves.\n\nI do think the time has come for change because it all seems pretty joyless for everyone at West Ham and things do sometimes run their course.\n\nYou make a good point, though. I'll be very interested to see if the manager who replaces Moyes (Julen Lopetgui) does any better than him. And if playing more attractive football but finishing lower in the Premier League makes their fans any happier.\n\nI do think the time has come for Moyes to leave West Ham, but hopefully people will not forget what he achieved for them.

They have every right to pursue a new style, more excitement and new heights.\n\nHowever, for four-and-a-half years Moyes' success and approach have shielded the owners from much scrutiny.\n\nThat was commonplace before they brought Moyes back. As he leaves, they will be exposed once more if things do not seamlessly improve.\n\nBut they are taking that risk.\n\nWhat was a very promising season has ended too poorly to carry on together, while Moyes continues to butt heads with the new structure - in particular barring technical director, Tim Steidten, from entering the dressing room for the final three games.\n\nBrutally, bosses at the London Stadium see more value in Steidten than Moyes.\n\nWhile it is a shame to see his time end this way, with friction and fractures, Saturday's send-off against Luton should be heartfelt.\n\nMoyes has put his all into dragging West Ham into Europe - one assistant coach even left the club because they could not see themselves keeping pace with the manager's 12-hour days.\n\nHe would work from 7am to 7pm, before returning to his East London apartment and watching football with a ready meal, his wife Pamela living hundreds of miles away in their North West home.\n\nThat is the manager who, in time, should be remembered and honoured.\n\nHe was ridiculed for describing himself as a \"winner\" on arrival, but few can argue with the record as he leaves.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_rosser@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Jack Rosser", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Moyes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Moyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preston_North_End_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Preston North End F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Proclaimers", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Proclaimers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BET", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BET"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Press_International", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Press International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North West England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Luton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/dk-west-ham-6may_OP.png?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537206", "eventUri": "eng-9537206", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 722, "textEnd": 735}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The former Real Madrid coach can deliver the more progressive football that West Ham supporters now crave, writes Adam Bate...\n\nWest Ham's appointment of Julen Lopetegui looks a smart move. This is a coach with Premier League experience but someone eager to show what he can do with greater resources. At West Ham, he finds a club keen to embrace a new way.\n\nDavid Moyes has done well in his second spell, most memorably taking them to a European trophy. But there is an appetite for a more progressive style of play and Lopetegui's record, particularly in Spain, suggests that he can deliver that.\n\nHis brief time at Wolves means he is a known quantity and while that appears to have counted against him in the eyes of some supporters, it should not. His achievement in turning things around there showcased his motivational skills and his adaptability.\n\nGary O'Neil has rightly received praise for guiding Wolves to mid-table in a season in which relegation was regarded as a risk but when Lopetegui took charge, that risk was more than speculation - it was reality. Bottom at Christmas and five points from safety.\n\nLopetegui inherited a group of players who were on the floor having not won away all season. He changed that in his very first game in charge and found eight more wins to transform their season, eventually finishing above Moyes' West Ham in the table.\n\nSeven of those wins were achieved without conceding a goal as he tightened up defensively. The scale of the accomplishment is best highlighted by the fact that Lopetegui boasts the best win percentage of any Wolves manager in Premier League history.\n\nThe style of football was seen as pragmatic but Lopetegui would point to the dire circumstances when he arrived. 'The middle of the storm' as he put it. It was no vanity project designed to enhance his reputation in England; livelihoods were on the line.\n\nThe decision to leave Wolves has obviously had an impact on how his time there is viewed by supporters but Lopetegui sees it differently. He would argue that he did not leave because of a lack of belief in the team, it was simply a trust issue with the owners.\n\nWhile he has stated that keeping Wolves up was his most difficult achievement, a truer reflection of his preferred style of play on the pitch could be seen in his three years at Sevilla. One Europa League and three consecutive top-four finishes show that it worked.\n\nDuring his final full season with Sevilla, they were second in La Liga at the end of February - nine points clear of Barcelona and Atletico Madrid - before injuries took their toll. They still finished that season with the best defensive record in the competition.\n\nIn doing so, he became the first coach to take Sevilla into the Champions League three seasons in a row. He achieved it by making them a much more fluent passing side. The emphasis on possession increased and that change can be seen in the statistics.\n\nHe took a team that had just 52 per cent of the ball in the season prior to his arrival and lifted that to an average of almost 60 per cent through the following three campaigns, during which only Real Madrid and Barcelona had more of the ball than Sevilla.\n\nThat is why the suggestion that his football does not differ enough from that of Moyes is a little surprising. At Porto, for example, he was actually criticised for implementing a possession game that was regarded as too intricate - too Spanish - for Portuguese tastes.\n\nThis is a coach steeped in the style of play that saw Spain dominate world football. He took the U19 and U21 sides to European titles, the latter won with Thiago Alcantara in midfield. It was easy for him to embrace this approach. It was one he had learned at Barcelona.\n\nA former Real Madrid goalkeeper, he was taken to Barca by Johan Cruyff in 1994. It was a defining moment in Lopetegui's career because it changed his thinking. Speaking to him about this in his office last year, he explained the impact that Cruyff had on him.\n\n\"Johan was different,\" Lopetegui told Sky Sports. \"He started making me think about why I was doing things as a goalkeeper and the solutions we were trying to find. He started me thinking about the answers in the play. Until that moment, I did not think, I just played.\"\n\nWest Ham are getting much more than a former Wolves manager here. This is a man who was unbeaten in his two years as Spain manager, a record achieved despite having to play away games against England, Italy, Germany, France and Belgium in that time.\n\nHis preference is for a higher defensive line in a 4-3-3 formation with the full-backs providing the width and creative players operating in the spaces inside. There is already excitement at the prospect of working with Mohammed Kudus among others.\n\nAt 57, Lopetegui still wants to learn.\n\n\"The work of the coach never stops,\" he told Sky Sports. \"Tomorrow, for sure, you will learn something new about your work. This is one of the exciting things about this job because there is new information to learn every day. That is what makes it so interesting.\"\n\nHis English has improved having stayed in the country until January before returning to be closer to his family in Spain. Intriguingly, as well as seminars with young coaches, he has even met with the PGMOL in an effort to stay on top of law changes in the game.\n\nA return to football is overdue. Monchi, his sporting director at Sevilla, now working at Aston Villa, is known to be amazed that it has taken this long for a club to move for him. West Ham are the beneficiaries. Expect Lopetegui to bring the change that fans crave.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Lacking toughness, leadership, mental toughness. That's two games we've come away where we've conceded five,\" he said.\n\n\"The manager will always take the responsibility, that's what happens when you do this job. You have to prepare them, set them up.\n\n\"But somewhere along the line the players have to take responsibility for doing their jobs and being hard to play against, and being aggressive and competitive.

It keeps the momentum. I think the performance was fantastic in all aspects.\n\n\"A few weeks ago I said I was so happy because we were so close to being in this position. That is the first step.\n\n\"The team is growing up very fast now. That is the minimum standard if we want to compete in this league.\n\n\"The objective for us is to be mature and to keep the momentum. Of course we are going to try to be in Europe.

led the Hammers to the Europa Conference League last season, and made the quarter finals of the Europa League this campaign, but they look set to miss out on European football next season.\n\nSporting Lisbon boss Amorim is a man in demand, and was the favourite to succeed Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool before they decided on Arne Slot, whilst he has also been mentioned as a target for Chelsea if they replace Mauricio Pochettino.\n\nThe 39-year-old who has a release clause in excess of \u00a310m, had a meeting with West Ham last month, and apologised to Sporting Lisbon fans following the backlash he received.\n\nHammers owner David Sullivan is reportedly close to appointing former Wolves boss Julen Lopetegui as the club's next manager, but talkSPORT report Noble and Steidten would prefer Amorim to be the next manager.\n\nTalkSPORT add Amorim's release clause could be a barrier for the owners, with the Spaniard seen as a more affordable option given he's currently without a club.\n\nLopetegui would bring a wealth of experience with him, having managed the likes of Real Madrid and Seville, as well as the Spanish national team.\n\nAmorim is viewed as one of the brightest prospects in European coaching, and it would be seen as a real coup if the Hammers were to appoint him.\n\nIt's interesting how Lopetegui has emerged as the favourite for the job and is the only candidate that wouldn't cost anything.\n\nHowever if West Ham are to move forward as a club they need to be bold and appoint an exciting forward thinking manager, not just a cheap option.", "source":

With the former Wolves, Real Madrid, Porto and Spain boss expected to take over from David Moyes - HITC understands he impressed David Sullivan during initial talks last week - Lopetegui looks set to inherit a squad with only one of that aforementioned sextet remaining.\n\n\"I am expecting we will play a team with extraordinary players who will create difficulties for us,\" Lopetegui said back in 2022, via Football London.\n\n\"They can cause damage in many ways. (Said) Benrahma, (Nikola) Vlasic, (Michail) Antonio, (and Pablo) Fornals are really good players.\n\n\"(Declan) Rice, (Manuel) Lanzini, so many good players.\"\n\nRice, of course, is the \u00a3105 million midfield maestro pulling the strings in Arsenal's latest Premier League charge these days. Benrahma is at Lyon, Vlasic at Torino, Fornals is back in Spain with Real Betis while Lanzini returned to his native Argentina.\n\nThat leaves Antonio - West Ham's long-serving cannonball of a centre-forward - as the only player remaining from those Lopetegui singled out. That is not to say, of course, that the 57-year-old Spaniard will be taking over a squad of players alien to him.\n\nLopetegui's Wolverhampton Wanderers side edged past Moyes' outfit in January last year, three hard earned points secured by a team who were drifting along at the bottom of the Premier League when he succeeded Bruno Lage and ended the season in the comfort of mid-table.\n\nAccording to The Mirror, meanwhile, Lopetegui is also a big fan of Konstantinos Mavropanos, and wanted the one-time Arsenal youngster at Molineux before he swapped Stuttgart for West Ham in a \u00a319 million deal. Given that concerns over the club's budget and financial means became a major reason behind his premature departure, it's tempting to wonder if Lopetegui would still be in the Wolves hotseat today had the club managed to stump up for some of his leading transfer targets.\n\nIt's fair to say Mavropanos' debut season at the London Stadium is not one the towering Greek international will look back on too fondly; littered with high-profile mistakes and a partnership with Kurt Zouma which is yet to click into life.\n\nCould Lopetegui be the appointment which saves Mavropanos from joining a pretty echoey pantheon of modern-day West Ham flops?\n\nMany of that Hammers side who stunned Sevilla in Europe may have departed, but hopefully his admiration for Mavropanos remains.", "source": {"uri":

So, to build on that with just three league wins post-Christmas and end up with a likely ninth-placed finish is bitterly disappointing.\n\nBut fans must acknowledge what has come before and give Moyes the perfect send-off in his last home game against Luton on Saturday. The fact we are all upset with a ninth-placed finish is testament to the job he has done. He has raised the bar and he has raised our expectations, but he will leave with the highest win percentage of any manager in the club's entire history - currently 45% - and has given us fans so many unexpected and priceless memories in the process.\n\nHe deserves respect and appreciation for that, even if it is clear he should not continue as manager.", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Moyes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Moyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Pellegrini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Pellegrini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luton", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Luton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_sport/b0c2/live/79c50fe0-b62f-11ee-beb5-e1400df560f2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537206", "eventUri": "eng-9537206", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 255, "textEnd": 268}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Click the sign-up box below to receive the newsletter every Monday morning this season for our verdict on all 20 Premier League clubs\n\nWhoever takes over from David Moyes at West Ham - and Julen Lopetegui could be forgiven for turning his phone off after this one -- his No 1 priority should be selecting a new captain.\n\nIt seems impossible that Moyes, his current contract not so much running out as stumbling chaotically, will still be in charge next season. Not after another complete capitulation, a shipping of five goals for the second time in three games, and a fourth overall this term.\n\nMoyes was quick to point out that the loss of Declan Rice last summer was a big reason why only the bottom three have let in more than the Hammers' 70 goals and counting in league action alone.\n\nBut Rice has equally been missed as their captain: he wore the armband in his final season and before that when long-time leader Mark Noble was not picked.\n\nKurt Zouma is West Ham's current skipper, as poor a choice as Moyes has made in his entire managerial career. The centre-back, arguably more famous for maltreating a cat than for any on-pitch endeavour in claret and blue, had a stinker of a return to his former club Chelsea.\n\nThat can happen but what did he do on the final whistle? Vladimir Coufal, Jarrod Bowen -- unlucky to hit the woodwork three times -- and Tomas Soucek made a present of their shirts to young fans who remained in a rapidly-emptying away end.\n\nOthers went over and clapped but not Zouma.

It can come ... or not,\" Lopetegui said. \"And if you're not convinced, it is better to say no. I prefer to wait for something that fits. It's true that our experiences in England have been good, and that our idea, our aim, was to stay in the Premier League and manage a team there, but let's see where football takes us. ... There are big clubs in Europe and we will always be open to projects that excite and satisfy us.\n\n\"This time has been useful, an opportunity to renew that internal energy, to attend to personal issues, the family ... the kind of things we sometimes miss because being a coach is 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I don't understand this job in any other way and nor do my staff, but sometimes you need a reset, to step back and look at everything, think how you can evolve, how you can be better. Where do we want to go? What way direction is football heading in? What are players doing now? You have to analyze it all, and with the aim of building properly, from a preseason, which is a key question for me.\"\n\n\"When I said yes to Wolves, they were in a difficult position: bottom, five points off the next team, practically at the end of the first half of the season. Only Newcastle had survived from a situation like that in the Premier League era. But although it was November, [because of the World Cup] we knew there would be a kind of preseason. That's why we took it on. For us that's so important, it gives you the chance to build and to communicate who we are, what we're looking for, and how we work. And we will try to do that in the next project.\"\n\nLopetegui sat down with ESPN to talk about his next steps, what a manager does in between jobs and the player recruitment process.\n\nWhat's that first day at a club like? You turn up, they don't know you. What do you say to them?\n\nLopetegui: Some do, some don't. It depends what circumstances you arrive in: arriving at the start of the season is not the same as arriving in a situation of difficulty, and every club has different demands. But basically the first thing you do is introduce yourself, tell them your perceptions of the team, explain your ideas, and try to involve them in that as soon as possible: you explain what you want from them daily, what demands you will make of them, and then, day by day, it flows. Respect is so important and it's never going to be just handed to you; you have to earn it, with your knowledge, your demands -- the demands you make of yourself first -- and the way you treat and respect them.\n\nWhen a coach is out of work, are you focused on the places where opportunities might open up? Are you thinking, say, \"Man United might change coaches, Klopp's leaving Liverpool, there could be a chance for me there?\"\n\nLopetegui: That's the job of your agents. Personally, I watch and analyze a lot of football, from all sorts of clubs. So, no, not really, because those clubs have to choose you: you can have an interest but it's up to them, not you. Now, once you have been made aware of interest, then of course you focus more closely on them. Maybe you start watching them play, analyzing. But until then you're consuming, a lot of football and a lot of different teams.\n\nWhen a club calls, what happens next?\n\nLopetegui: It depends on the club. A sporting director might call you because he already knows you or because he wants to know you. Some are asking about availability, others about methodology. For me, a key question is the idea the sporting director has because he's the one laying down the guidelines along which a club is run; if that fits with your view, if he has the owners and directors on his side, convinced by that approach, then perfect.\n\nIf you know each other already, if they know your work, that happens naturally. If they don't know you, maybe you go and do a presentation where you outline your ideas, your strategies, and your methods. Sometimes a sporting director can win you over when you weren't sure, or the other way round. Sometimes the moment is right, sometimes it's not.\n\nYou talk about a \"project,\" about complicity, but sometimes a coach and a club don't see things the same way. You might have a president or a chairman who is not convinced, or you might find that the signings you want don't happen.\n\nLopetegui: Sure, but in the end, you have to adapt to the reality of a club and ultimately what you and the club want is the same thing: to win. There might be a certain player you want but he can't come, but that's not fundamental. What's fundamental is that they make your message their own, that the club goes in the same direction as you, that you go into battle together.\n\nYou say \"we.\" There's an entire staff that depends on you: assistants, fitness coaches, analysts ... that's a responsibility for people's livelihoods that's not often seen. Do they say to you \"Come on, Julen, accept this job?\"\n\nLopetegui: A lot of that depends on the club: at Wolves, for example, we had a big staff. In some clubs, you take more of your people, some you can take less. Sometimes you turn up and there's already staff in place. It's a lot of people, a lot of families, but they understand that we have come this far doing it this way, that elite sport is like this. It's a responsibility; it can be hard sometimes, yes. But they understand.\n\nWhat's it like being sacked? It must hurt?\n\nLopetegui: Yes. It's not pleasant sometimes but you generate a thick skin which is useful. Also, it depends: you leave Sevilla after the three best years in the club's history, say, and you feel the warmth and the gratitude from the fans at the moment you go, so that can be nice too. You think: OK, this is as far as we go. But that's ok. Leaving the national team was different. Every exit is different.\n\nAt Madrid, we felt that if we had been given another month, things would have looked very different. The World Cup [fall out] still wasn't quite out [of our systems], but we were still only seven points behind Barcelona. We had time. And they finished 23 points behind. We felt it was possible to fight still: players were coming back from injury, we were getting our ideas across. My feeling is pity because we were convinced we would improve.\n\nThe national team exit on the eve of the World Cup must hurt the most...\n\nLopetegui: Yes, but I try not to look back. When I do, I see that our work was very, very good. We reached the World Cup unbeaten. We had played England, Belgium, France Italy, Germany and Argentina and not lost. But there were circumstances beyond my control, which I deeply regret because I think it was bad for everyone.\n\nCould you have handled that differently? You had agreed to go to Real Madrid after the World Cup but it was announced on the eve of the tournament.\n\nLopetegui: That was nothing new in football. It had happened with [Antonio] Conte, [Louis] Van Gaal, in Spain too. You prepare your future and I was as transparent as I could be. Then it was beyond our control. It could have been managed differently [by the RFEF]; it's a pity.\n\nWhen I had renewed with Spain, there was a clause they inserted in my contract that contemplated that [exact scenario], it hurt. We felt it was very unfair, but it is in the past now. We did what we had to do, we were as transparent as possible. I look forward. If I look back it is to take strength from the experience, as a way of fuelling me. You generate a thick skin. It was complicated, a tough experience, but it's in the past.\n\nHas time proven that [Luis] Rubiales was the problem?\n\nLopetegui: I'm not going to get into that; it would be opportunistic and anything I say would be misinterpreted.\n\nIs coaching the national team very different from being at a club? You talk a lot about daily work but there isn't daily work there.\n\nLopetegui: I tried to manage the seleccion as if it was a club: I tried to build a team. I had much less time to intervene so that meant that the invention had to be more concrete, more exact, better quality. And that sometimes means less. It's about ensuring the 'pill' you give them is the exact dose. Sometimes too much information is detrimental, so you think: 'What do they really need? How will they take this?' You make it as precise, as targeted, as you can.\n\nThe Spain job was wonderful precisely because it forced me to define clearly what I wanted to say and do. I had a long time to observe and very little to intervene. You can think 'Oh, no, I don't have time,' but that doesn't help. Instead, you think: 'OK, how do I make this time count?' I had to improve my delivery, refine everything, and make the most of every moment so that when the player turns up it's ready.\n\nYou think about moments like your sacking from the Spain job, which must be horrible, about the pressure, the interests, the exposure and there must be times when you see everything that comes with being a coach and think: \"Forget that.\"\n\nLopetegui: Sure, but you always try to focus on what your work is, and what you can have an impact upon. All the rest is the context. You need to know how to manage all that, how to communicate it, how to help your players face the game in the best way. All that noise, that media attention, that noise, is intrinsic to football -- and, without that, it wouldn't be the king of sports. You have to deal with it naturally.\n\nNot least, you have to do that on behalf of your players.\n\nLopetegui: The emotional and psychological element of the game, that human part, is different depending on their age, character, and experience. There are 25 of them. The noise can indeed generate problems in terms of excessive pressure. It's like an FM radio, tuning it in, changing the volume: sometimes you have to turn it to the left, sometimes to the right. Sometimes up, sometimes down.\n\nWhy? Because you're seeking balance and sometimes it's already turned up in the build-up to a big game, a Madrid-Barcelona, a Betis-Sevilla, Spain. The coach has to find their correct emotional state -- sometimes you do that individually, sometimes with the whole group. You have to be alert to the details, to those moments when there's too much pressure. Sometimes people misinterpret it: they think a player lacks motivation and doesn't care, when it's actually an excess of pressure, a mental \"block.\" That's a key question for a coach and one of the most complicated. Beyond tactics and fitness, there's emotional balance.\n\nDo you use a psychologist?\n\nLopetegui: I think it is a coach's job: he is the one closest to the players. But you take guidance and use techniques from mental coaches, of course. I have worked on that and find it very useful. But it is you and your staff who are there every day, who have to understand how to take the pressure off a player in a given moment, be alert to his needs, and give him confidence.\n\nFrom the outside, do we fail to see how much pressure there is?\n\nLopetegui: In some cases, yes. It's not easy sometimes for the kids, but they have to learn to have thicker skin at times. Being a footballer is a nice job but also a hard one. You have to be strong, you have to know that you will fall and be ready to get up again.\n\nSome have that as standard, others less so -- and you try to help them. Isolating yourself from the outside world is impossible and counterproductive; what you can do is prepare yourself so you have the right response, regardless of what the outside world says. You still have your path, you know what you want to do and where you want to get to. In elite sport, players and coaches need a strong character.\n\nDid you have that as a player? As a goalkeeper are you more exposed?\n\nLopetegui: Yes. I look back at my era as a player and there are lots of situations you're not ready for. But experience strengthens you, thickens your skin, it teaches you what is useful to you and what isn't, what helps, and where your responsibilities start and end. It helps you understand better what you can control. It's a learning process. Some have those strengths; others develop them. But, listen, having a thick skin doesn't mean, with apologies, that you don't give a s---; it means that I know what I can control and can't and what my response will be in moments of pressure and tension.\n\nI always tell the players that there is no greater error than to be afraid of errors. I don't demand that a player never makes mistakes; I do demand that they are brave. You have to take decisions, you have to dare. And the error is assumed by the coach, taken on by him, so that they can flow. A player needs to participate in your ideas so that he feels no fear: behind every error is a coach who will defend him, and protect him.\n\nDo you also learn that football is terrible sometimes? You love the game itself but all that stuff that goes with it you could so without.\n\nLopetegui: No, because it wouldn't be football without that other part. The power that football has brings collateral damage but you have to assimilate that and accept it. There are things you can't control, like a cow watching a train go past. You accept that. Day to day, the work you do as a coach in England compared to Spain for example, you feel less of a media presence, and less external attention. You feel a little more focused on your work, without the \"entertainment\" that goes with it. And then there's the respect for the figure of the coach, which is positive.\n\nThat exposure must impose limits when you are managing a group. There must be things you can't say or do that you would like to?\n\nLopetegui: You have to take that into account, yes. You're talking and leading. And so you have to be a leader permanently, all the time. That's inescapable. You have a group that depends on you. Sometimes it's natural, sometimes it's calculated, that's true. There are going to be days when maybe you don't feel that energy but you still have to transmit it to your players.\n\nThere was a line I read years ago, from [Antonio] Conte I think: every defeat is a funeral, a death. I understand that because we all feel that way, not least because as a coach you are responsible. But the thing is, the next day you need the energy to lead 25 lads.\n\nAnd some days you don't really feel like it?\n\nLopetegui: Yes. But I have always felt that the difficult moments have brought the best out of me. That's important. In those moments when you're thinking, 'Pfff, bad times are coming,' your message has to be clearer. Internally and externally.\n\nYou have to be able to manage that. You go to the press conference, for example, and it's not just the press you're talking to, it will be consumed internally as well. They're watching, they see if what you say out there is coherent, the same as what you say in here. If you're honest, direct.\n\nA journalist's question, then: do you lie to us?\n\nLopetegui: No. I tell you what I think most helps my team. Sometimes I could be nicer. Sometimes I could give more of a headline. But the ideal headline for me is that my team has won. And with time you learn better how to manage all the games that are played. Sometimes your message is for your team, sometimes for the environment around it. Sometimes there is a message you want to deliver.\n\nDo you go into the press conference room thinking, \"I hope someone asks this?\"\n\nLopetegui: Yes, sometimes and if not, you find a way. You get to Rome via Galicia! A donde vas, manzanas traigo. [Where are you going, I bring apples: a Spanish phrase that means you respond to a question with something else entirely]. Sometimes you're conscious of the headline they want, and they ask the same thing seven different ways to get there. But you don't want to give it. You know that you can say 99 things that are interesting or useful but that one thing is what they will use. You have to be responsible for who is listening to you.\n\nAnd not be distracted?\n\nLopetegui: Football is like a circus. There are lots of rings. We're all under the same big top, but there are different stages. The coaches are the ones with our heads in the lion's mouth. And if we look elsewhere, if we allow our attention to be drawn to the other rings, that lion is going to eat us. You have to focus on what's there. We're all under the same roof. I understand a journalist's job but I know that the view is different.\n\nWe both look at the same river but you're looking at it from one bank, I'm looking at it from another. Your responsibility and mine are different. If I have the lion's jaws around my neck and I look across at ...\n\nThe clowns?\n\nLopetegui: I'm not saying clowns! Besides, what I most like are the clowns. If I look at the trapeze artists, the lion is going to bite my head off.\n\nXabi Alonso has just won the league in Germany. Mikel Arteta is top in England. Andoni Iraola has just had the best season in Bournemouth's history. Imanol Alguacil was in the Champions League with Real Sociedad. Like you, they're all from the small province of Guipuzcoa. How do you explain that?\n\nLopetegui: I can't offer a correct response: I think it's a culmination of circumstances. Indeed, the sporting culture in the Basque Country and in Guipuzcoa in particular is very deeply rooted. I don't know if there's something in the discipline with which people live sport from a young age. It could be a coincidence but there may be some guiding element, although I'm not convinced that there is a single reason.\n\nI have lived away from Guipuzcoa for almost my whole life, from the age of 8. Unai has too. Arteta lived away from a very young age. I think the fact of leaving helps you to have a perspective and mentality.\n\nWhat is the key lesson going to England from Spain, the thing you most had to adapt to?\n\nLopetegui: The first thing is to be aware that you're going to a very different competition. There are different ways of playing and different ways of refereeing too, which oblige you to adapt. In England, one of the things you feel as soon as you get there is the vertiginous pace of the game. Which is, quite simply, a product of the continuity of the game and that is a product of the refereeing. If the same action is a yellow card in Spain and not even a foul in England, you have to know that and change accordingly. You need to understand the idiosyncrasies of where you are.\n\nThings like simulation, which are frowned upon in England, more than in Spain, Italy. I feel that referees in England have a direct responsibility for the rhythm and pace of the play. Very direct. I think they feel that [responsibility to the play]. Personally, I like that. Your basic concepts remain, the essence of how you see the game, but you are evolving all the time and that's one of the elements.\n\nA coach's job is a lot about communication. Is that harder in English?\n\nLopetegui: For me it was wonderful. I was clear that I had to communicate with them in English. First, out of respect for the country and the league. Second, because players perceive that effort, the respect, and you communicate much more to them that way. In football, you can communicate everything you need [even in English]. Sometimes even better in fact because you're more vehement. And you get better daily.\n\nThat was one of the challenges I was excited about: to see if I could do my work in English. The way you work isn't so different but of course your capacity shifts. And with time you develop a depth of language you didn't have at first. And then there's French, Portuguese, Spanish: it's important to be able to talk to a player individually in his own language.\n\nIs your job more charismatic or technical?\n\nLopetegui: They're legs from the same bench. A player has to see direction, knowledge, and an idea. He has to be convinced, above all. You have to find a way of conveying your ideas that wins him over. I like that players that take you to the limit, and ask why: why are we doing this? What's the 'for'? It's good, they're showing an interest, they're not just reactive, not just following. They want to understand. That's wonderful for a coach because it forces you to examine your ideas, to explain them, to challenge yourself.\n\nDoes a player realize quick if the coach just hasn't got it?\n\nLopetegui: A player is permanently analyzing and constantly judging his coach. I did it as a player. Unconsciously, maybe, but you do. They're watching you: how you react in moments of difficulty, how you you deal with conflict in the group, what a moment of euphoria does to you, or a bad moment in defeat, how you react in a relationship with the club, if there's a problem. A coach's work is continually in the eye of the storm.", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Spaniard guided Wolves to Premier League safety last season, but left the Midlands club after nine months on the eve of the new campaign in August.\n\nThe former Porto and Sevilla manager helped lift Wolves from the bottom of the table to a 13th-placed finish during his time in charge at Molineux.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Moyes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Moyes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.\u2013Chelsea_F.C._rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C.\u2013Chelsea F.C. rivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Time in Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julen_Lopetegui", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julen Lopetegui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sullivan_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Sullivan (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molineux_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Molineux Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Porto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Porto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevilla_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sevilla FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luton_Town_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luton Town F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everton_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Everton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/514295d163b9164c22eb4ab9ed82f5ad", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537206", "eventUri": "eng-9537206", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 452726552, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 165, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 165}}}

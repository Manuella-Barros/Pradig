This will move that deadline to next Friday, May 17.\n\nThe Senate will next need to pass the extension now that it has passed the House.\n\nThe move to pass a one-week patch comes as the Senate is working its way toward passage of a five-year FAA reauthorization bill. It had become unclear, however, if that bill could pass both chambers by Friday's deadline as senators push for a variety of amendments.\n\nThe broader FAA reauthorization bill is expected to ultimately pass with widespread bipartisan support. But as debate continues over some of its provisions, any one senator could delay passage of the extension beyond the Friday night deadline as quick passage of legislation requires unanimous consent.\n\nLawmakers announced a bipartisan agreement had been reached for the broader FAA reauthorization bill at the end of last month, but the legislation has touched off wide-ranging debate.\n\nOne flashpoint has centered around flights at the DC-area Reagan National Airport - with a group of Washington area Senate Democrats who oppose adding more longer-distance flights in and out pressing for an amendment vote to strip it out of the package currently being debated.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Wednesday ahead of the House move to pass the extension that the Senate is \"working really hard\" to finish the broader FAA reauthorization.\n\n\"We're working really hard to get in and finish,\" Schumer said during his weekly press conference, though the chamber has been at an impasse over which amendment votes to include.\n\nRepublican Whip John Thune welcomed the House move to pass a one-week FAA reauthorization, but cautioned that there still has yet to be an agreement on how to move ahead quickly on the reauthorization in the United States Senate.\n\n\"It just gives us a little breathing room,\" Thune said. \"I think the goal is to try to drive through and get a result out of the Senate yet this week, but at least now if necessary, it can be punted.\"\n\nCNN's Ted Barrett, Lauren Fox and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

(Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe U.S. Senate is now one step closer to passing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) five-year reauthorization bill before the May 10 deadline.\n\nSenators voted 84-13 on May 9 to invoke cloture, which limits the timeline for debate over amendments and moves the Senate closer to passing the 1,068-page aviation bill.\n\nNow, senators have a chance to debate the legislation that would improve aircraft and airport safety, address the 3,000-person hiring shortage of air traffic controllers, and create standards for consumer refunds.\n\n\"We hope to get this done today to keep the FAA funded and operational before tomorrow's deadline,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor on May 9.\n\n\"The work we're doing on FAA is going to have practical consequences for millions of Americans that travel by air every single day, so senators have every reason in the world to continue working on a bipartisan basis to get this done.\"\n\nThe House voted on May 8 to extend the FAA deadline by a week, but the Senate must confirm the extension with unanimous consent to push back the May 10 cutoff.\n\nHowever, two senators complicated the process early in the morning on May 9, stating that they would not approve an extension because they feared it would prevent discussion of key amendments.\n\nSens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) created an amendment to strip from the FAA bill a provision that would add five round-trip flights to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington.\n\nBoth said the busy airport is overtaxed with traffic, particularly after two planes almost collided on its runway on April 18 after a miscommunication between air traffic controllers and the pilots.\n\nMr. Kaine and Mr. Warner worry approving the extension will give the Senate a chance to run out the clock without considering the various amendments proposed, including theirs.\n\n\"Last month's near miss at DCA is a flashing red warning light that this airport is overburdened and that cramming more flights onto the busiest runway in America is a terrible idea,\" Mr. Kaine and Mr. Warner wrote in a statement on May 9.\n\n\"We can't, in good conscience, greenlight that plan until we have a commitment that there will be an opportunity to put our amendment to a vote and to persuade our colleagues to prioritize the safety of millions of passengers over a few senators' desire for a direct flight home,\" they added.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), the top GOP negotiator for the FAA bill, supports adding flights to Reagan National due to the decades-old rule that limits outgoing flights from the airport to a 1,250-mile radius around Washington.\n\nFor example, residents of San Antonio, Texas, are required to go through Dallas Fort Worth International Airport instead, which Mr. Cruz noted while speaking with The Epoch Times.\n\nThe other option is to fly into Dulles International Airport, but it is further from the nation's capital.\n\nThe senator also blamed United Airlines for lobbying against adding flights to Reagan National to retain a \"monopoly\" at Dulles International.\n\nWhen asked for comment, United Airlines referred questions to the Coalition to Protect America's Regional Airports.\n\nMr. Cruz told reporters on May 9 that allowing the amendment could \"unravel\" the entire FAA bill.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) does not believe the bill will get passed on May 9.\n\n\"I think we're probably at a posture where we're gonna either run down the clock or pass an extension,\" he said to reporters on May 9, suggesting that a final vote will depend on how many objections senators make.\n\nMr. Schumer reiterated the dangers of failing to pass the bill before the deadline for FAA programs runs out.\n\n\"If we let funding for the FAA lapse, that could be disastrous for the safety of our skies and the efficiency of our airports.\n\n\"Thousands of employees might be furloughed, air traffic controllers would be forced to work longer and extra hours, [and] funding for infrastructure projects would be halted,\" he said during a floor speech on May 9.\n\n\"So, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue working together so we can fund the FAA and avoid missing tomorrow's deadline.\"", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"},

After a minimum of two-thirds of the present members voted affirmatively, the new deadline for reauthorizing the FAA is May 17.\n\nThe bill, which now sits in the Senate's lap, seeks to bolster aviation safety standards and consumer protections after the FAA recently experienced multiple near-runway collisions at several major airports due to air traffic control miscommunications. The bill also addresses the FAA's hiring shortages and risk assessment with air traffic control but left out an early proposal to raise the commercial pilot retirement age from 65 to 67.\n\n\"This legislation reflects an agreement between the House and the Senate that will protect the safety of the flying public and ensure the future of the U.S. aviation industry,\" Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Wash.) said in support of the bill while speaking on the House floor on May 8.\n\nMr. Larsen said the Senate is still \"working through its process,\" as it may consider several amendments to the bill. However, it would likely miss the original May 10 deadline, which prompted the House to quickly pass a seven-day \"clean extension\" to avoid the cutoff.\n\nRep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.) also spoke in support of the bill.\n\n\"I urge all members to support this most passed bill so we can keep our aviation system operating safely,\" he said, adding that failure to pass the bill could cost the U.S. federal government $50 million in lost revenue.\n\nA bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Reps.

Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) created an amendment to strip from the FAA bill a provision that would add five round-trip flights to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Washington.\n\nBoth said the busy airport is overtaxed with traffic, particularly after two planes almost collided on its runway on April 18 after a miscommunication between air traffic controllers and the pilots.\n\nMr. Kaine and Mr. Warner worry approving the extension will give the Senate a chance to run out the clock without considering the various amendments proposed, including theirs.\n\n\"Last month's near miss at DCA is a flashing red warning light that this airport is overburdened and that cramming more flights onto the busiest runway in America is a terrible idea,\" Mr. Kaine and Mr. Warner wrote in a statement on May 9.\n\n\"We can't, in good conscience, greenlight that plan until we have a commitment that there will be an opportunity to put our amendment to a vote and to persuade our colleagues to prioritize the safety of millions of passengers over a few senators' desire for a direct flight home,\" they added.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), the top GOP negotiator for the FAA bill, supports adding flights to Reagan National due to the decades-old rule that limits outgoing flights from the airport to a 1,250-mile radius around Washington.\n\nFor example, residents of San Antonio, Texas, are required to go through Dallas Fort Worth International Airport instead, which Mr. Cruz noted while speaking with The Epoch Times.\n\nThe other option is to fly into Dulles International Airport, but it is further from the nation's capital.\n\nThe senator also blamed United Airlines for lobbying against adding flights to Reagan National to retain a \"monopoly\" at Dulles International.\n\nWhen asked for comment, United Airlines referred questions to the Coalition to Protect America's Regional Airports.\n\nMr. Cruz told reporters on May 9 that allowing the amendment could \"unravel\" the entire FAA bill.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) does not believe the bill will get passed on May 9.\n\n\"I think we're probably at a posture where we're gonna either run down the clock or pass an extension,\" he said to reporters on May 9, suggesting that a final vote will depend on how many objections senators make.\n\nMr. Schumer reiterated the dangers of failing to pass the bill before the deadline for FAA programs runs out.\n\n\"If we let funding for the FAA lapse, that could be disastrous for the safety of our skies and the efficiency of our airports.\n\n\"Thousands of employees might be furloughed, air traffic controllers would be forced to work longer and extra hours, [and] funding for infrastructure projects would be halted,\" he said during a floor speech on May 9.\n\n\"So, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue working together so we can fund the FAA and avoid missing tomorrow's deadline.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

(Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives voted on May 8 to extend the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill, as Congress's previous May 10 deadline was quickly approaching.\n\nThe House convened to consider a seven-day extension to the FAA reauthorization bill as the Senate races against the clock to pass its version of the long-awaited piece of legislation. After a minimum of two-thirds of the present members voted affirmatively, the new deadline for reauthorizing the FAA is May 17.\n\nThe bill, which now sits in the Senate's lap, seeks to bolster aviation safety standards and consumer protections after the FAA recently experienced multiple near-runway collisions at several major airports because of air traffic control miscommunications. The bill also addresses the FAA's hiring shortages and risk assessment with air traffic control but left out an early proposal to raise the commercial pilot retirement age to 67 from 65.\n\n\"This legislation reflects an agreement between the House and the Senate that will protect the safety of the flying public and ensure the future of the U.S. aviation industry,\" Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Wash.) said in support of the bill while speaking on the House floor on May 8.\n\nMr. Larsen said that the Senate is still \"working through its process,\" as it may consider several amendments to the bill. However, it would likely miss the original May 10 deadline, which prompted the House to quickly pass a seven-day \"clean extension\" to avoid the cutoff.\n\nRep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.) also spoke in support of the bill.\n\n\"I urge all members to support this most passed bill so we can keep our aviation system operating safely,\" he said, noting that failure to pass the bill could cost the U.S. federal government $50 million in lost revenue.\n\nA bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Mr. Graves and Mr. Larsen negotiated the bill just after midnight on April 29.\n\nIn a joint statement that the group released on April 29, the lawmakers said the FAA needs \"strong and decisive direction from Congress to ensure America's aviation system maintains its gold standard.\"\n\nThe House previously voted 401-19 on Feb. 29 to provide a short-term extension -- May 10 -- to reauthorize the FAA after the Senate approved a March 8 deadline in December 2023.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) held a press conference with reporters on Capitol Hill on May 8 to address the failed bipartisan border and FAA reauthorization bills.\n\n\"We're working really hard to get it finished this week in the Senate, and that's what we hope to do,\" Mr. Schumer said.\n\nWith the new May 17 deadline, the Senate now has seven additional days to consider amendments to the bill and pass it.\n\nWhile speaking on the Senate floor on May 7, Mr. Schumer explained the Senate's progress with the FAA reauthorization bill.\n\n\"It's going to take a lot of cooperation to get this complicated bill done.

The House is poised to pass a one-week extension Wednesday, leaving the rest up to the Senate.\n\nBut if a short-term extension isn't cleared through the Senate by Friday, airports across the country would slam to a halt as funding for air traffic controllers and other critical aviation roles could run out.\n\nFurther complicating the matter, the FAA reauthorization is one of the last must-pass bills that Congress has to address this year.\n\nAs a result, Democrats and Republicans are trying to attach amendments to the already 1,000-page bill to secure funding for their personal 'pet projects.'\n\nTheir proposals include: outlawing drones flying over NFL and MLB games, adding pro-Palestine protestors to the 'no fly' list, increasing the number of flights from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA) and reintroducing whole milk onto public school lunch menus.\n\nThe FAA authorization bill provides funding for airports across the country and lawmakers are attempting to add many non-aviation related amendments to the measure\n\nA measure in the current FAA package would add additional long-haul flights from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA)\n\nAs Congress' time to pass an FAA measure is running out, lawmakers are poised to pass a short-term one week extension to give members more time to strike a deal.\n\n'In terms of the timeline, how it gets done, it buys some time if the House obviously sends us that [bill] to get it done next week,' Senate Minority Whip Jon Thune, R-S.D., told reporters.\n\n'It just gives us a little breathing room,' he said.\n\nStill, some in the Senate GOP conference have issues with some of the amendments, which could pose trouble for the bill even with an extension.\n\n'Clearly we have a number of objections on our side, which are probably not going to go away,' Thune said.\n\nBut Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., is still hoping that the FAA reauthorization could pass before Friday's deadline.\n\n'We're working really hard to get it finished this week in the Senate and that's what we hope to do,' he said at a press conference Wednesday afternoon.\n\nAnd lawmakers are adamant that the FAA authorization will not lapse, which would paralyze airports nationwide.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on Wednesday he hopes to get the Senate bill passed before the Friday deadline\n\nIf the full Senate FAA reauthorization bill or a one week extension is not passed then travelers would experience major flight delays and cancelations\n\n'Well, it will get done this week or there will be a temporary extension,' Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told DailyMail.com. 'One or the other, we're not shutting down the airports.'\n\nWhen pressed on the massive amount of amendments still being hashed out for the bill, Blumenthal admitted its one of lawmakers last chances to get legislation passed before the November elections.\n\n'There are very few vehicles for for passing bills [remaining], so people are trying to catch their bills to the FAA measure,' he said.\n\n'And so I fully understand that a lot of the unrelated or extraneous amendments simply will be rejected for that reason.'\n\nOne of the non-aviation proposals would lift tariffs on certain types of titanium sponge imports.\n\nAnother would authorize an internet-access program that provides service to rural and low-income communities.\n\nHowever, there are numerous flight-related provisions as well.\n\nOne proposal would raise the retirement age of pilots from 65 to 67 as the industry faces an aging workforce and pilot shortages.\n\nA different amendment, which has caused controversy between Republicans and Democrats, would ensure travelers are automatically refunded if their flights are canceled.\n\nThat measure is in-line with a Department of Transportation rule announced in April, but Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who is the top Republican on the committee responsible for the FAA bill, said the automatic refunding of canceled flights is not necessary as travelers often opt to immediately rebook on the same airline.\n\n'If you're flying somewhere and your flight is canceled, what most consumers want is not a refund,' Cruz told reporters Wednesday.\n\n'It would not serve consumers well to say in the instance that a flight is cancelled, they automatically refund your money even if you don't want it and you'd prefer to be rebooked.'\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, said the FAA bill will include language enabling refunds for canceled flights\n\nHe said he is still in favor of refunds in the case of canceled flights and there are still provisions in the bill to ensure that consumers are compensated, but they would not happen automatically.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan_Washington_National_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Thune", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Thune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_controller", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air traffic controller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Blumenthal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Blumenthal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Commerce,_Science,_and_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking_member", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ranking member"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Titanium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/08/21/84628423-0-image-a-13_1715201626595.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551412", "eventUri": "eng-9551412", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

This will move that deadline to next Friday, May 17.\n\nThe Senate will next need to pass the extension now that it has passed the House.\n\nThe move to pass a one-week patch comes as the Senate is working its way toward passage of a five-year FAA reauthorization bill.

Headlining that is the ongoing push by senators from the greater Washington, D.C., area to secure an amendment vote to overturn a provision in the final package that adds five new slots (or 10 round-trip flights) out of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA).\n\nNegotiators and top lawmakers have been trying to get the final bill across the finish line without allowing members additional amendment votes. But senators from Maryland and Virginia have continued to cry foul about the possibility that they will not get a crack at overturning the DCA provision, which they have opposed for the past year. They argue it is unsafe and will cause myriad delays at the airport in order to accommodate a few more long-haul flights.\n\nAll four senators voted no on opening debate.\n\nSens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) said in a new statement Thursday that they will not greenlight a plan to collapse time in order for the chamber to complete its work in swift fashion.\n\n\"Last month's near-miss at DCA is a flashing red warning light that this airport is overburdened and that cramming more flights onto the busiest runway in America is a terrible idea,\" they said, referring to an incident in mid-April.\n\n\"We can't in good conscience greenlight that plan until we have a commitment that there will be an opportunity to put our amendment to a vote, and to persuade our colleagues to prioritize the safety of millions of passengers over a few senators' desire for a direct flight home,\" the pair said.\n\nThe Maryland and Virginia senators are also objecting to the possibility of a one-week FAA extension over complaints that it would only give senators more of a chance to run out the clock without an amendment vote.\n\nManagers of the bill were buoyed by the strong vote, even though the Maryland-Virginia Senate contingent voted against moving toward final passage.\n\n\"I think our colleagues want to get this done,\" Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) told reporters. \"This is a body where people can object, and so my guess is there are still objections to adding other things, but maybe there is something we can work out, and we're still trying.\"\n\nCantwell and Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas), the top Republican on the Commerce Committee who is managing the bill for the GOP, both told reporters that if the Maryland-Virginia senators were to win an amendment vote, and it succeeded, it could \"unravel\" the entire bill.\n\nSenate GOP amused with Cruz's FAA reversal\n\nDCA has long been concentrated on short-haul flights under 1,250 miles, with less than a dozen exceptions. Most long-haul flights use Dulles International Airport and Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. Dulles is a hub for United Airlines, which has heavily lobbied against the push to add DCA flights over the past year.\n\nTop members have also tried to keep all unrelated amendments out of the FAA package over fears that the inclusion of one item over another would spur a series of holds and complicate final passage.\n\n\"Clearly, we have a number of objections on our side, which are probably not going to go away,\" Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) said Wednesday. \"It's hard to envision a scenario where you get one nongermane amendment over the objections of all the other people who have nongermane amendments they want to get considered.\n\nThe House will need to pass the bill next week in order for it to reach President Biden's desk.\n\nFor the latest news, weather, sports,

(Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe long-awaited Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill hit another hurdle on May 9 as two Democratic senators said they would block fast-tracking the legislation unless a provision adding more flights in and out of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport is removed.\n\nThe House and Senate have been racing against the clock to pass the bipartisan, five-year FAA reauthorization bill that addresses the 3,000-person shortage of air traffic controllers, provides safety standards to prevent airport runway collisions, and creates airline refund policies.\n\nThe House voted on May 8 to extend the original May 10 deadline by a week, but this new obstacle complicates the timeline for lawmakers to pass the bill before the clock runs out and FAA programs expire.\n\nThe Senate must now confirm the extension with unanimous consent to approve it ahead of the original deadline. If the Senate votes to extend the deadline, lawmakers could wait until the following week to pass the legislation and consider any amendments.\n\nSens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.), the lawmakers against the fast-track, say approving the extension will give the Senate enough time to pass the bill without considering any amendments, including theirs to remove the provision regarding additional flights at Reagan National, which services the Washington area.\n\nMr. Kaine and Mr. Warner argued that adding five new roundtrip flights would overburden the busy airport, which almost experienced a collision on April 18 when air traffic controllers cleared two planes to enter the same runway simultaneously. The two planes came within 400 feet of colliding before two different controllers ordered the pilots to slam on the brakes.\n\nA similar incident occurred the day prior at JFK International Airport in New York City.\n\n\"Last month's near miss at DCA is a flashing red warning light that this airport is overburdened and that cramming more flights onto the busiest runway in America is a terrible idea,\" Mr. Kaine and Mr. Warner wrote in a statement on May 9.\n\n\"But now, the same senators who crafted a provision in the FAA bill to do just that, behind closed doors and against the advice of all four capital region senators, are asking us to smooth a procedural path to the finish line for that bill without a promise to bring our amendment -- or any amendment -- up for a vote.\n\n\"We can't, in good conscience, greenlight that plan until we have a commitment that there will be an opportunity to put our amendment to a vote and to persuade our colleagues to prioritize the safety of millions of passengers over a few senators' desire for a direct flight home,\" they added.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), one of four bipartisan lawmakers who negotiated the FAA reauthorization bill on April 29, told The Epoch Times that he believes the reluctance to add flights to Reagan National is not about concerns over possible runway collisions.\n\nInstead, he accused United Airlines of lobbying to retain a \"monopoly\" at the competing Dulles International Airport, which also services the Washington area.\n\n\"United is lobbying furiously to stop any new flights into and out of Washington Reagan Airport because they don't want competition,\" Mr. Cruz said.\n\nThe Epoch Times contacted United Airlines for comment, but a representative referred questions to the Coalition to Protect America's Regional Airports.\n\nMr. Cruz wants additional flights at Reagan National because it could improve travel options for many living in rural areas around the country.\n\nOfficials constrained travel options in and out of Washington with a decades-old perimeter rule that limits the length of flights leaving Reagan National to a 1,250-mile radius from the city. Lawmakers living west of Minneapolis, Dallas, and Oklahoma City must catch a flight at Dulles International or Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport instead. However, there are exceptions, including direct flights from Reagon National to Salt Lake City and Seattle.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said adding flights to any busy airport requires the right resources to do so safely.\n\n\"Anytime we have a busy airport, and we have lots of them, you've got to have trained professionals that are there, and they've got to have the means and the resources to do their job correctly,\" he told The Epoch Times.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan_Washington_National_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Runway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Warner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Warner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_controller", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Air traffic controller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Kaine", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Kaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

But failure to pass the popular bipartisan bill by May 10 would be the latest setback after months of delays on the measure, and another example of Congress struggling to pass major legislation, even when it has broad support.\n\nThe bill stalled in the Senate this week after senators from Virginia and Maryland objected to a provision that would allow an additional 10 flights a day to and from the heavily trafficked Reagan Washington National Airport. Other senators have tried to add unrelated provisions, seeing it as a prime chance to enact their legislative priorities.\n\nSenators from both parties were working to clear objections Thursday and move the FAA bill, or a short extension, before the Friday deadline.\n\nThe legislation was negotiated by Republicans and Democrats who lead the House and Senate committees overseeing the FAA. The agency has been under scrutiny since it approved Boeing jets that were involved in two deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019. The legislation would govern FAA operations for the next five years.\n\nThe House passed a similar bipartisan bill last summer. Senators introduced their revised 1,069-page measure last week, with days to go before the deadline.\n\nThe legislation, which also comes after a a series of close calls between planes at the nation's airports, would increase the number of air traffic controllers and require the FAA to use new technology designed to prevent collisions between planes on runways. It would require new airline planes to have cockpit voice recorders capable of saving 25 hours of audio, up from the current two hours, to help investigators.\n\nIt would also try to improve customer service for flyers by requiring airlines to pay a refund to customers for flight delays -- at three hours for a domestic flight and six for an international one. Lawmakers tweaked the bill this week to make it even easier for customers to receive refunds, revising language that would have put most of the onus on the customer to request them. The change put the Senate bill more in line with new regulations issued by President Joe Biden's administration last week.\n\nIn addition, the bill would prohibit airlines from charging extra for families to sit together and triple maximum fines for airlines that violate consumer laws. And it would require the Transportation Department to create a \"dashboard\" so consumers can compare seat sizes on different airlines.\n\nOpening the Senate on Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer urged senators to come to agreement soon. \"Absolutely nobody should want us to slip past the deadline because that would needlessly increase risks for so many travelers and so many federal workers,\" he said.\n\nVirginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, both Democrats, have said they would object to a short-term extension of the legislation passed by the House on Wednesday unless Schumer agrees to a vote on their amendment to block the additional long-haul flights at Virginia's Reagan National. They say the airport is restricted in size and too busy already, pointing to a close call there between two planes earlier in April that they said is a \"flashing red warning light.\"\n\nSeveral Western lawmakers have argued for more flights at Reagan National, saying it is unfair to consumers that there is a restriction on long-haul flights there. The provision's chief proponent is Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, the top Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee, who has argued that San Antonio should have a direct flight from the airport.\n\nAirlines are also split on the idea. Delta Airlines has argued for more flights at Reagan National, while United Airlines, with a major operation at farther-out Dulles Airport, has lobbied against the increase.\n\nThe House last year rejected a similar provision after intense, last-minute lobbying from the Virginia delegation -- a bipartisan vote on an amendment to the FAA bill that saw members aligning not by party but geographic location. Lawmakers use the airport frequently as it's the closest Washington airport to the Capitol, and Congress has long tried to have a say in which routes have service there.\n\n\"We understand that some of our colleagues have to travel a long way to get to D.C.,\" Kaine and Warner said in a joint statement with Maryland's two senators, Democrats Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen. \"But the convenience of a handful of members is not as important as the safety of the 25 million people who use DCA every year. Last month's near-miss at this airport is a startling reminder of what's at stake if Congress jams even more flights onto the busiest runway in America.\"\n\nThe FAA says that if the law expires on Friday, the 3,600 employees would be furloughed without guarantee of back pay starting at midnight. The FAA would also be unable to collect daily airport fees that help pay for operations, and ongoing airport improvements would come to a halt.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType":

Furthermore, the additional funding for the NTSB will help support new safety initiatives and larger investigations into incidents, something that the recent Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX door plug accident may have pushed Congress to include.\n\nPhoto: Philip Pilosian | Shutterstock\n\nDespite agreeing on the vast majority of the bill's provisions, there are a few new amendments which have been added to the legislation that could lead to further discord as the May 10th deadline approaches. According to The Washington Examiner, these include adjustments to airline refund language that could prove more passenger-friendly, new restrictions surrounding flights at Reagan National Airport (DCA) and other passenger protection measures which have been put forward by members on both sides of the political aisle.\n\nA need for a consensus\n\nWith the deadline approaching so swiftly, some leaders in the Senate have begun to grow concerned about whether a compromise will be reached before Friday. In a statement, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had the following words to share:\n\n\"There are lots of people who have different amendments not relevant to the FAA that want to get them on -- I'm one of those -- but we have to get this done in a bipartisan way.\"\n\nPhoto: Markus Mainka | Shutterstock\n\nWith so many non-essential provisions, lawmakers may need to pick and choose what is most important in order to get the bill approved before the deadline. As a result of this concern, some senators have begun to explore the possibility of a short-term extension to the current FAA authorization in order to provide time for further negotiation.", "source": {"uri": "simpleflying.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Simple Flying"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_controller", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Air traffic controller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Transportation Safety Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutterstock", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shutterstock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Runway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Examiner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Examiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan_Washington_National_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/shutterstock_1908933052-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551412", "eventUri": "eng-9551412", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 319, "textEnd": 327, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 1628, "textEnd": 1635}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Sen. Maria Cantwell, the Washington Democrat who chairs the committee in charge of conducting FAA oversight, said Wednesday she expected to finish the bill Thursday.\n\nCantwell, chair of the Senate commerce committee, announced news of the agreement last month with U.S. Rep Rick Larsen, D-Everett, ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. They were joined by their Republican counterparts, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and U.S. Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo.\n\nUnderscoring the importance of a strong aviation bill, lawmakers have cited recent incidents like near-misses at airports where planes barely avoided collisions and the blowout aboard Alaska Flight 1282.\n\nIn January, a panel blew out of a Boeing 737 MAX 9 as the Alaska Airlines flight climbed out of Portland. Investigators found that workers at Boeing's Renton assembly plant improperly secured the fuselage section, a plug covering a hole that could accommodate a door.\n\nAs a result of the blowout, the 1,000-plus page aviation bill requires commercial airplanes to be equipped with recording devices that can store 25 hours of audio, a significant increase from the current devices that record for two hours. The need for longer recordings became \"abundantly clear\" after the Alaska Airlines incident, Cruz said last week on the Senate floor, when the cockpit recording in the moments after the blowout was overridden.\n\nThe bill also includes a requirement that the FAA improve its staffing standards and set targets for hiring to address the shortage of approximately 3,000 air traffic controllers.\n\n\"Everyone knows that these air traffic controllers are what guides us every day to the safety of our destinations,\" Cantwell said on the Senate floor last week. \"This bill recognizes that we have shortchanged that investment, with air traffic controllers sometimes working as many as six days a week.\"\n\nFor passengers, the bill requires refunds for anyone who is delayed three hours for a domestic flight or six hours for an international flight.\n\nThe new requirement codifies regulation from the Department of Transportation announced in April that says passengers are entitled to a refund if their flight is canceled or significantly changed and they don't choose to be rebooked or accept travel credits. It also restricts airlines from charging fees to families who want to sit together.\n\n\"Passengers deserve to get their money back when an airline owes them -- without headaches or haggling,\" U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said in a news release.\n\nThe reauthorization bill doesn't mention Boeing specifically, but aviation publication The Air Current reported Tuesday that the bill includes a provision that would grant the company five additional years to continue building 767 freighters, which are assembled at its Everett plant. Boeing would be granted a waiver from international aircraft emissions regulations, allowing the company to build the cargo carriers until 2033, the Air Current reported.\n\nFunding for the agency, which regulates how aircraft are manufactured, operated and maintained, also includes $738 million for the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates aviation accidents, as well as other incidents.\n\nFAA's mandate has been extended three times since legislation expired in September to give lawmakers more time to hammer out an agreement.\n\nThe House on Wednesday approved a one-week extension ahead of the Friday deadline amid Senate negotiations on a slate of proposed amendments, some related to aviation and others with no aviation connection but seen as last-minute efforts to tack on legislation.\n\nThe Kids Off Social Media Act, for example, an amendment introduced by Cruz and Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, would restrict social media companies from allowing anyone younger than 13 to create accounts or profiles, and from providing algorithm-served content to any user younger than 17.\n\nWithout FAA reauthorization, the agency could face some form of a shutdown In 2011, thousands of FAA workers were furloughed following a two-week congressional impasse over the FAA budget.",

Headlining that is the ongoing push by senators from the greater Washington, D.C., area to secure an amendment vote to overturn a provision in the final package that adds five new slots (or 10 roundtrip flights) out of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\n\nNegotiators and top lawmakers have been trying to get the final bill across the finish line without allowing members additional amendment votes. But senators from Maryland and Virginia have continued to cry foul about the possibility that they will not get a crack at overturning the DCA provision, which they have opposed for the past year. They argue it is unsafe and will cause myriad delays at the airport in order to accommodate a few more long-haul flights.\n\nAll four senators voted no on opening debate.\n\nSens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) said in a new statement on Thursday that they will not greenlight a plan to collapse time in order for the chamber to complete its work in swift fashion.\n\n\"Last month's near-miss at DCA is a flashing red warning light that this airport is overburdened and that cramming more flights onto the busiest runway in America is a terrible idea,\" they said, referring to an incident in mid-April.\n\n\"We can't in good conscience greenlight that plan until we have a commitment that there will be an opportunity to put our amendment to a vote, and to persuade our colleagues to prioritize the safety of millions of passengers over a few senators' desire for a direct flight home,\" the pair said.\n\nThe Maryland and Virginia senators are also objecting to the possibility of a one-week FAA extension over complaints that it would only give senators more of a chance to run out the clock without an amendment vote.\n\nManagers of the bill were buoyed by the strong vote, even though the DMV Senate contingent voted against moving toward final passage.\n\n\"I think our colleagues want to get this done,\" Senate Commerce Committee Chairwoman Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) told reporters. \"This is a body where people can object and so my guess is there are still objections to adding other things, but maybe there is something we can work out, and we're still trying.\"\n\nCantwell and Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas), the top Republican on the Commerce Committee who is managing the bill for the GOP, both told reporters that if the DMV-area senators were to win an amendment vote, and it succeeded, it could \"unravel\" the entire bill.\n\nNational Airport has long been concentrated on short-haul flights under 1,250 miles, with less than a dozen exceptions. Most long-haul flights use Dulles International Airport (IAD) and Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport.

Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) oppose the provision to add five additional roundtrip flights to Reagan National Airport.\n\nThe long-awaited Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill hit another hurdle on May 9 as two Democratic senators said they would block fast-tracking the legislation unless a provision adding more flights in and out of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport is removed.\n\nThe House and Senate have been racing against the clock to pass the bipartisan, five-year FAA reauthorization bill that addresses the 3,000-person shortage of air traffic controllers, provides safety standards to prevent airport runway collisions, and creates airline refund policies.\n\nThe House voted on May 8 to extend the original May 10 deadline by a week, but this new obstacle complicates the timeline for lawmakers to pass the bill before the clock runs out and FAA programs expire.\n\nThe Senate must now confirm the extension with unanimous consent to approve it ahead of the original deadline. If the Senate votes to extend the deadline, lawmakers could wait until the following week to pass the legislation and consider any amendments.\n\nSens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.), the lawmakers against the fast-track, say approving the extension will give the Senate enough time to pass the bill without considering any amendments, including theirs to remove the provision regarding additional flights at Reagan National, which services the Washington area.\n\nMr. Kaine and Mr. Warner argued that adding five new roundtrip flights would overburden the busy airport, which almost experienced a collision on April 18 when air traffic controllers cleared two planes to enter the same runway simultaneously. The two planes came within 400 feet of colliding before two different controllers ordered the pilots to slam on the brakes.\n\nA similar incident occurred the day prior at JFK International Airport in New York City.\n\n\"Last month's near miss at DCA is a flashing red warning light that this airport is overburdened and that cramming more flights onto the busiest runway in America is a terrible idea,\" Mr. Kaine and Mr. Warner wrote in a statement on May 9.\n\n\"But now, the same senators who crafted a provision in the FAA bill to do just that, behind closed doors and against the advice of all four capital region senators, are asking us to smooth a procedural path to the finish line for that bill without a promise to bring our amendment -- or any amendment -- up for a vote.\n\nInstead, he accused United Airlines of lobbying to retain a \"monopoly\" at the competing Dulles International Airport, which also services the Washington area.\n\n\"United is lobbying furiously to stop any new flights into and out of Washington Reagan Airport because they don't want competition,\" Mr. Cruz said.\n\nThe Epoch Times contacted United Airlines for comment, but a representative referred questions to the Coalition to Protect America's Regional Airports.\n\nMr. Cruz wants additional flights at Reagan National because it could improve travel options for many living in rural areas around the country.\n\nOfficials constrained travel options in and out of Washington with a decades-old perimeter rule that limits the length of flights leaving Reagan National to a 1,250-mile radius from the city. Lawmakers living west of Minneapolis, Dallas, and Oklahoma City must catch a flight at Dulles International or Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport instead. However, there are exceptions, including direct flights from Reagon National to Salt Lake City and Seattle.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) said adding flights to any busy airport requires the right resources to do so safely.\n\n\"Anytime we have a busy airport, and we have lots of them, you've got to have trained professionals that are there, and they've got to have the means and the resources to do their job correctly,\" he told The Epoch Times.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Warner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Warner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan_Washington_National_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Kaine", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Kaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_controller", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Air traffic controller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Runway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine announced their intention to object to a plan to fast track a short-term extension of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization Act until there is a commitment that there will be a vote on their amendment to eliminate a dangerous provision in the proposed long-term FAA reauthorization bill that would add five incoming and five outgoing flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA). The proposed one-week extension would allow Senate leadership to run out the procedural clock on consideration of the FAA bill without allowing a vote on any amendments.\n\n\"Last month's near miss at DCA is a flashing red warning light that this airport is overburdened and that cramming more flights onto the busiest runway in America is a terrible idea. But now, the same senators who crafted a provision in the FAA bill to do just that, behind closed doors and against the advice of all four capital region senators, are asking us to smooth a procedural path to the finish line for that bill without a promise to bring our amendment -- or any amendment -- up for a vote. We can't in good conscience greenlight that plan until we have a commitment that there will be an opportunity to put our amendment to a vote, and to persuade our colleagues to prioritize the safety of millions of passengers over a few senators' desire for a direct flight home.\"\n\nKaine spoke on the Senate floor yesterday about the need to remove the additional flights in the FAA reauthorization.\n\nThe additional ten flights at DCA would risk passenger safety and increase delays by 725 minutes per day, leading to a total of 12,734 minutes of overall daily delay at the airport. DCA's main runway is the busiest in the country with nearly 25 million passengers every year and is operating at near peak capacity. In April, two aircraft narrowly avoided a crash on the runway.\n\nWarner and Kaine have repeatedly sounded the alarm about the addition of flights at DCA and opposed changes to the slot and perimeter rules, which govern the number and distance of flights that can safely operate out of the airport. Last week, Kaine spoke on the Senate floor to urge his colleagues to strike the additional DCA flights from the FAA reauthorization bill.

To give lawmakers additional time to negotiate, the House on Wednesday passed a one-week extension for federal aviation programs, sending it over to the Senate, where unanimous consent will be required if it is to be approved ahead of the deadline.\n\nOne of the sticking points in the present debate is over flights at the DC-area Reagan National Airport. A group of Washington-area Senate Democrats who oppose adding more longer-distance flights in and out of the airport are pressing for an amendment vote to strip it out of the larger package currently being debated.\n\nTwo of those senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, both of Virginia, said Thursday morning that they will not grant unanimous consent on the stopgap bill unless they are promised a vote on the amendment. They cited a close call at Reagan National last month in which two jetliners almost collided after they were cleared onto the same runway.\n\n\"Last month's near miss at DCA is a flashing red warning light that this airport is overburdened and that cramming more flights onto the busiest runway in America is a terrible idea,\" Kaine and Warner wrote in a statement Thursday morning. \"But now, the same senators who crafted a provision in the FAA bill to do just that, behind closed doors and against the advice of all four capital region senators, are asking us to smooth a procedural path to the finish line for that bill without a promise to bring our amendment -- or any amendment -- up for a vote. We can't in good conscience greenlight that plan until we have a commitment that there will be an opportunity to put our amendment to a vote, and to persuade our colleagues to prioritize the safety of millions of passengers over a few senators' desire for a direct flight home.\"\n\nAt the end of the workweek, lawmakers' cars line up in DC to hustle them to nearby airports for flights home. The most convenient is Reagan National, a short drive into Virginia. The region's other two airports -- Dulles International and Baltimore/Washington International -- are at least a 40-minute drive from downtown DC.\n\nBut a decades-old perimeter rule limits the length of flights departing Reagan National to a 1,250-mile radius from DC. That means lawmakers west of Minneapolis, Oklahoma City and Dallas must catch a flight at one of the other two airports. (Over the years, a few exceptions - such as direct flights to Salt Lake City and Seattle - have been added at Reagan National.)\n\nThe compromise bill presently being negotiated would allow for five additional flights into and out of Reagan National daily -- far fewer than some had wanted.\n\nThe airport authority operating Reagan National and Dulles International, however, says the main runway at Reagan is the nation's busiest and operates at full capacity. Lawmakers' proposals to add additional flights, it says, would increase the congestion.\n\nRepublican Sen. Mike Lee -- from Utah, outside the perimeter -- drafted a proposal for adding 56 flights, with a limit of eight per hour.\n\nCNN's Clare Foran, Haley Talbot and Kristin Wilson contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) has become the subject of much bemusement among his Senate GOP colleagues as he has taken a detour from his role as a conservative rabble-rouser to playing the lead on reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n\nThe Texas senator, long-known for stirring up trouble for leadership, has suddenly gone in the reverse as he has prodded Republicans against gumming up the works for the last must-pass bill in Congress for months.\n\nBut the irony is not lost on lawmakers who have watched Cruz's mischief up close and personal, especially on government spending battles throughout the years.\n\n\"It's been entertaining to be able to watch,\" one Senate Republican told The Hill before quoting the movie \"Airplane!\" \"What's the old Hollywood joke? The foot's on the other hand.\"\n\nMultiple senators told The Hill that Cruz has been on the receiving end of numerous jokes from colleagues during weekly Senate GOP luncheons each of the past two weeks. Most members have given him high marks for his work on the FAA, but can't help themselves as Cruz tries to keep the bill on track to pass ahead of Friday's midnight deadline and keep unrelated amendments out of a final bill.\n\n\"Let's just say he's taking a lot of ribbing right now in there,\" Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said with a laugh as he stepped out of Wednesday's lunch to take a call. \"Of course, he's making a pitch that this is different than all the other times when he's insisted on having amendment votes because this one was much more transparent. ... People are slightly amused by his compliance.\"\n\nAs a second Senate Republican put it, Cruz has been frustrated by the last minute-holds and \"obstinance\" of some members.\n\n\"A lot of times, it's [been] him. ... So he's getting a little bit of his own medicine,\" the member quipped. \"It's a little humorous.\"\n\nCruz, the top Republican on the Commerce Committee, has been tasked with completing the deal on the FAA that would reauthorize the program for five years. But after more than a decade of giving leadership headaches and accruing seniority, he's been put in what has been unfamiliar territory by negotiating what lawmakers have described as a complex package.\n\nHe has also tried to argue that the process and structure of the FAA bill should be a model for further bipartisan negotiations. Cruz said that he and Senate Commerce Committee Chairwoman Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) went through regular order, had a lengthy markup process, with members on and off the committee winning inclusion of amendments and priorities.\n\nThe bill passed through the panel unanimously, putting it in the position it is now.\n\nCruz is under particular fire this go-around from members as the FAA bill represents the final attempt for lawmakers to attach their pet priorities, most of them unrelated to aviation and travel, to a must-pass legislative item until the fall and, ironically, the push to fund the government for fiscal 2025. He was, of course, one of the architects of the 16-day government shutdown back in 2013 as conservatives pushed to defund the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNevertheless, Cruz is very much in on the laughter, members say. He is widely known in the Senate for his sense of humor.\n\n\"One thing about smart people is -- they're smart,\" Cramer said. \"I think he gets the joke.\"\n\nCruz told The Hill that during Wednesday's lunch, one moderate member \"was having great joy giving me grief\" at the ongoing battle to keep the FAA push on the rails as lawmakers\n\n\"I just laughed and said, 'I'm not even going to fight back,'\" Cruz said in a brief interview.\n\nThe massive bipartisan undertaking also comes at an important time for Cruz as he is up for reelection in November and is staring down a match-up with yet another well-funded House Democrat, Rep. Colin Allred (D-Texas).\n\nThe two-term senator remains a favorite for reelection in the Lone Star State, but he has tried for months to burnish his bipartisan bonafides in order to lock down moderates and cut off any avenue for Allred to replicate the scare he received six years ago from former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas).\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) recently declared that Democrats were going to pick off the seat despite decades-long struggles by the party in the state and the uphill climb they face. No Democrat has won statewide in Texas since 1994.\n\nCruz said that he plans to campaign on the FAA bill back home in the coming months. One of the main wins for the state in this package is expected to be a direct flight between Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and San Antonio. Cruz noted that San Antonio is home to a large population of active duty service members and veterans, and that a flight that's mere steps from the Pentagon would be of great benefit to the state.\n\nSenate GOP leaders readily acknowledge Cruz's past given his penchant for giving them agita. However, they concede that he has carried a lot of weight on the FAA front and that being put in that type of position can alter one's thinking.\n\n\"Sometimes, when you're in the position of wanting to get an outcome, the legislative process looks slightly different to you than it may at other times,\" Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said, hailing Cruz for \"handling a difficult bill with a lot of moving parts.\"\n\n\"People are having fun with it,\" he added with a laugh. \"It's all good-natured humor.\"",

To give lawmakers additional time to negotiate, the House on Wednesday passed a one-week extension for federal aviation programs, sending it over to the Senate, where unanimous consent will be required if it is to be approved ahead of the deadline.\n\nOne of the sticking points in the present debate is over flights at the DC-area Reagan National Airport. A group of Washington-area Senate Democrats who oppose adding more longer-distance flights in and out of the airport are pressing for an amendment vote to strip it out of the larger package currently being debated.\n\nTwo of those senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, both of Virginia, said Thursday morning that they will not grant unanimous consent on the stopgap bill unless they are promised a vote on the amendment. They cited a close call at Reagan National last month in which two jetliners almost collided after they were cleared onto the same runway.\n\n\"Last month's near miss at DCA is a flashing red warning light that this airport is overburdened and that cramming more flights onto the busiest runway in America is a terrible idea,\" Kaine and Warner wrote in a statement Thursday morning. \"But now, the same senators who crafted a provision in the FAA bill to do just that, behind closed doors and against the advice of all four capital region senators, are asking us to smooth a procedural path to the finish line for that bill without a promise to bring our amendment -- or any amendment -- up for a vote. We can't in good conscience greenlight that plan until we have a commitment that there will be an opportunity to put our amendment to a vote, and to persuade our colleagues to prioritize the safety of millions of passengers over a few senators' desire for a direct flight home.\"\n\nAt the end of the workweek, lawmakers' cars line up in DC to hustle them to nearby airports for flights home. The most convenient is Reagan National, a short drive into Virginia. The region's other two airports -- Dulles International and Baltimore/Washington International -- are at least a 40-minute drive from downtown DC.\n\nBut a decades-old perimeter rule limits the length of flights departing Reagan National to a 1,250-mile radius from DC. That means lawmakers west of Minneapolis, Oklahoma City and Dallas must catch a flight at one of the other two airports. (Over the years, a few exceptions - such as direct flights to Salt Lake City and Seattle - have been added at Reagan National.)\n\nThe compromise bill presently being negotiated would allow for five additional flights into and out of Reagan National daily -- far fewer than some had wanted.\n\nThe airport authority operating Reagan National and Dulles International, however, says the main runway at Reagan is the nation's busiest and operates at full capacity. Lawmakers' proposals to add additional flights, it says, would increase the congestion.\n\nRepublican Sen. Mike Lee -- from Utah, outside the perimeter -- drafted a proposal for adding 56 flights, with a limit of eight per hour.\n\nCNN's Clare Foran, Haley Talbot and Kristin Wilson contributed to this

But failure to pass the popular bipartisan bill by May 10 would be the latest setback after months of delays on the measure, and another example of Congress struggling to pass major legislation, even when it has broad support.\n\nThe bill stalled in the Senate this week after senators from Virginia and Maryland objected to a provision that would allow an additional 10 flights a day to and from the heavily trafficked Reagan Washington National Airport. Other senators have tried to add unrelated provisions, seeing it as a prime chance to enact their legislative priorities.\n\nSenators from both parties were working to clear objections Thursday and move the FAA bill, or a short extension, before the Friday deadline.\n\nThe legislation was negotiated by Republicans and Democrats who lead the House and Senate committees overseeing the FAA. The agency has been under scrutiny since it approved Boeing jets that were involved in two deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019. The legislation would govern FAA operations for the next five years.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., speaks to reporters following Democratic strategy session, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, May 8, 2024. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nThe House passed a similar bipartisan bill last summer. Senators introduced their revised 1,069-page measure last week, with days to go before the deadline.\n\nThe legislation, which also comes after a a series of close calls between planes at the nation\u00b4s airports, would increase the number of air traffic controllers and require the FAA to use new technology designed to prevent collisions between planes on runways. It would require new airline planes to have cockpit voice recorders capable of saving 25 hours of audio, up from the current two hours, to help investigators.\n\nIt would also try to improve customer service for flyers by requiring airlines to pay a refund to customers for flight delays - at three hours for a domestic flight and six for an international one. Lawmakers tweaked the bill this week to make it even easier for customers to receive refunds, revising language that would have put most of the onus on the customer to request them. The change put the Senate bill more in line with new regulations issued by President Joe Biden\u00b4s administration last week.\n\nIn addition, the bill would prohibit airlines from charging extra for families to sit together and triple maximum fines for airlines that violate consumer laws. And it would require the Transportation Department to create a \"dashboard\" so consumers can compare seat sizes on different airlines.\n\nOpening the Senate on Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer urged senators to come to agreement soon. \"Absolutely nobody should want us to slip past the deadline because that would needlessly increase risks for so many travelers and so many federal workers,\" he said.\n\nVirginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, both Democrats, have said they would object to a short-term extension of the legislation passed by the House on Wednesday unless Schumer agrees to a vote on their amendment to block the additional long-haul flights at Virginia's Reagan National. They say the airport is restricted in size and too busy already, pointing to a close call there between two planes earlier in April that they said is a \"flashing red warning light.\"\n\nSeveral Western lawmakers have argued for more flights at Reagan National, saying it is unfair to consumers that there is a restriction on long-haul flights there. The provision\u00b4s chief proponent is Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, the top Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee, who has argued that San Antonio should have a direct flight from the airport.\n\nAirlines are also split on the idea. Delta Airlines has argued for more flights at Reagan National, while United Airlines, with a major operation at farther-out Dulles Airport, has lobbied against the increase.\n\nThe House last year rejected a similar provision after intense, last-minute lobbying from the Virginia delegation - a bipartisan vote on an amendment to the FAA bill that saw members aligning not by party but geographic location. Lawmakers use the airport frequently as it\u00b4s the closest Washington airport to the Capitol, and Congress has long tried to have a say in which routes have service there.\n\n\"We understand that some of our colleagues have to travel a long way to get to D.C.,\" Kaine and Warner said in a joint statement with Maryland\u00b4s two senators, Democrats Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen. \"But the convenience of a handful of members is not as important as the safety of the 25 million people who use DCA every year. Last month\u00b4s near-miss at this airport is a startling reminder of what\u00b4s at stake if Congress jams even more flights onto the busiest runway in America.\"\n\nThe FAA says that if the law expires on Friday, the 3,600 employees would be furloughed without guarantee of back pay starting at midnight. The FAA would also be unable to collect daily airport fees that help pay for operations, and ongoing airport improvements would come to a halt.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType":

But failure to pass the popular bipartisan bill by May 10 would be the latest setback after months of delays on the measure, and another example of Congress struggling to pass major legislation, even when it has broad support.\n\nThe bill stalled in the Senate this week after senators from Virginia and Maryland objected to a provision that would allow an additional 10 flights a day to and from the heavily trafficked Reagan Washington National Airport. Other senators have tried to add unrelated provisions, seeing it as a prime chance to enact their legislative priorities.\n\nSenators from both parties were working to clear objections Thursday and move the FAA bill, or a short extension, before the Friday deadline.\n\nThe legislation was negotiated by Republicans and Democrats who lead the House and Senate committees overseeing the FAA. The agency has been under scrutiny since it approved Boeing jets that were involved in two deadly crashes in 2018 and 2019. The legislation would govern FAA operations for the next five years.\n\nThe House passed a similar bipartisan bill last summer. Senators introduced their revised 1,069-page measure last week, with days to go before the deadline.\n\nThe legislation, which also comes after a a series of close calls between planes at the nation's airports, would increase the number of air traffic controllers and require the FAA to use new technology designed to prevent collisions between planes on runways. It would require new airline planes to have cockpit voice recorders capable of saving 25 hours of audio, up from the current two hours, to help investigators.\n\nIt would also try to improve customer service for flyers by requiring airlines to pay a refund to customers for flight delays -- at three hours for a domestic flight and six for an international one. Lawmakers tweaked the bill this week to make it even easier for customers to receive refunds, revising language that would have put most of the onus on the customer to request them. The change put the Senate bill more in line with new regulations issued by President Joe Biden's administration last week.\n\nIn addition, the bill would prohibit airlines from charging extra for families to sit together and triple maximum fines for airlines that violate consumer laws. And it would require the Transportation Department to create a \"dashboard\" so consumers can compare seat sizes on different airlines.\n\nOpening the Senate on Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer urged senators to come to agreement soon. \"Absolutely nobody should want us to slip past the deadline because that would needlessly increase risks for so many travelers and so many federal workers,\" he said.\n\nVirginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, both Democrats, have said they would object to a short-term extension of the legislation passed by the House on Wednesday unless Schumer agrees to a vote on their amendment to block the additional long-haul flights at Virginia's Reagan National. They say the airport is restricted in size and too busy already, pointing to a close call there between two planes earlier in April that they said is a \"flashing red warning light.\"\n\nSeveral Western lawmakers have argued for more flights at Reagan National, saying it is unfair to consumers that there is a restriction on long-haul flights there. The provision's chief proponent is Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, the top Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee, who has argued that San Antonio should have a direct flight from the airport.\n\nAirlines are also split on the idea. Delta Airlines has argued for more flights at Reagan National, while United Airlines, with a major operation at farther-out Dulles Airport, has lobbied against the increase.\n\nThe House last year rejected a similar provision after intense, last-minute lobbying from the Virginia delegation -- a bipartisan vote on an amendment to the FAA bill that saw members aligning not by party but geographic location. Lawmakers use the airport frequently as it's the closest Washington airport to the Capitol, and Congress has long tried to have a say in which routes have service there.\n\n\"We understand that some of our colleagues have to travel a long way to get to D.C.,\" Kaine and Warner said in a joint statement with Maryland's two senators, Democrats Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen. \"But the convenience of a handful of members is not as important as the safety of the 25 million people who use DCA every year. Last month's near-miss at this airport is a startling reminder of what's at stake if Congress jams even more flights onto the busiest runway in America.\"\n\nThe FAA says that if the law expires on Friday, the 3,600 employees would be furloughed without guarantee of back pay starting at midnight. The FAA would also be unable to collect daily airport fees that help pay for operations, and ongoing airport improvements would come to a halt.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news",

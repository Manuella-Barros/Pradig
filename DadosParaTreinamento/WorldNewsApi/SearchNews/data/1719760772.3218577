Former President Donald Trump arrives at Manhattan Criminal Court, Tuesday, May 28, 2024, in New ... [+] York. (AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson, Pool) Associated Press Key Facts After several days of jury selection last month, the judge and lawyers for both sides assembled a 12-person jury consisting of seven men and five women, including six who are married and three with children (six alternate jurors were also selected). All but three indicated during jury selection they had a college education, and they come from a wide array of professional backgrounds, according to multiple reports\u2014including two lawyers, two educators, a software engineer, a security engineer, a physical therapist, a salesman, an investment banker, a businessman, a product manager and a retired wealth manager. A majority are not native New Yorkers, with nine indicating they lived somewhere else before coming to New York, and two previously lived outside the U.S.\u2014the jury foreman lived in Ireland while another juror lived in Lebanon. At least five indicated they don\u2019t follow the news closely: One juror who works as a teacher, for instance, indicated her colleagues had strong opinions on Trump, but she appreciated his candor, didn\u2019t have a strong opinion either way, tried to stay out of politics and doesn\u2019t like the news, according to press reports from jury selection. While all the jurors insisted they believed they could be impartial, two expressed more significant disagreements with the former president\u2014one juror acknowledged she did not agree with \u201ca lot of his politics and his decisions as a president\u201d but believed she could be a \u201ctotally impartial juror,\u201d while another said she didn\u2019t like Trump\u2019s persona, but believed it didn\u2019t impede her from being impartial. When asked about their opinions on Trump, the remaining jurors all indicated they either had no strong opinions, or were ambivalent\u2014agreeing with some things but disagreeing with others. Where Do The Jurors Get Their News? The New York Times was the most frequently mentioned source of news among the jurors, according to pool reports, among frequently cited mainstream outlets like the Wall Street Journal. Social media was also frequently cited. One juror who works as an investment banker indicated he kept up to date with a variety of sources, frequently seeing Trump\u2019s Truth Social posts via X, while also following former Trump attorney Michael Cohen\u2014a witness against Trump in the hush money case\u2014and longtime Trump ally Kellyanne Conway. Crucial Quote \"I don't like some of my co-workers,\u201d said one juror about her feelings on Trump, according to pool reports. \u201cBut I can hear him out and understand his point of view and understand his issues.\" Surprising Fact Two of the jurors are attorneys: one a civil litigator and the other a corporate lawyer. Legal experts have noted it\u2019s unusual for one lawyer, let alone two, to be seated on a jury, according to Politico. Former Trump attorney Timothy Parlatore told CNN lawyers can sometimes become very strong voices on the jury because of their background and knowledge\u2014but they might also cut a jury cut through difficult technical language. What To Watch For There\u2019s no time limit for jurors to reach a verdict, but they will need to come to a unanimous conclusion. They could find Trump guilty of all, some or none of the counts. If they can\u2019t reach a unanimous verdict, Merchan could declare a hung jury and a mistrial. Key Background Prosecutors and attorneys for Trump wrapped up their cases in court on Tuesday. Trump has been charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records, in connection to alleged efforts to conceal a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in exchange for her silence on an alleged affair with Trump, which Trump has long denied. Finding a jury was an exhaustive process in a case that has made history as the first-ever criminal trial of a former U.S. president. Judge Juan Merchan culled through nearly 200 potential jurors, largely removing those who claimed they couldn\u2019t be impartial, and allowing each side 10 \u201dstrikes\u201d \u2014- allowing them to dismiss a juror without giving a reason. Trump, the Republican candidate for president, had said the Manhattan venue was unfair, given its traditionally Democratic leanings, and called for it to be moved to the more right-leaning Staten Island. As the Washington Post reported, a large number of jury candidates voiced complaints about Trump, with Trump at one point muttering a rebuttal\u2014which prompted a rebuke from Merchan, warning against jury intimidation. Tangent Judge Juan Merchan has been protective of the juror\u2019s identities throughout the case, given the potential for backlash or harassment\u2014Merchan has restricted access to jurors\u2019 identities and has ordered the media to be cautious about reporting on identifying features. Prior to the seating of the jury, two previously seated jurors had been dismissed\u2014one over concern about privacy. Follow me on Twitter. Send me a secure tip.

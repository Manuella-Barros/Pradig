Action Network is the official betting partner of the Chicago Tribune Belmont Stakes, the final legal of the Triple Crown races, is Saturday. Even without the drama of a potential Triple Crown winner, Belmont is a big deal among horse racing enthusiasts. Thus, it begs the question why can\u2019t you wager on traditional sports betting apps like DraftKings or BetMGM? To answer that it\u2019s important to review a couple of factors about horse racing that differentiate it from standard sports betting. With usual sports betting markets (NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB etc.) sportsbooks will determine the odds and there\u2019s not a lot of transparency. Horse racing, on the the other hand, uses pari-mutuel meaning the odds are determined by the wagers from other bettors. The more favored a horse is, the more money has been wagered on it. While that\u2019s slightly more transparent than standard sports betting, the risks associated with any betting are still very relevant. Furthermore, horse racing occupies a slightly different lane than traditional sports betting which gets into the answer to the question above. Due to betting regulations, most horse-racing wagers have to be done on a separate app. Two of the most widely used horse-racing apps are FanDuel Racing and TwinSpires. You can review the promotions ahead of Belmont 2024 below. In some states, you can bet right in the FanDuel Sportsbook app, but in others you need the separate FanDuel Racing app. FanDuel Racing: Get a $500 No Sweat First Bet There\u2019s no promo code required here so you can use the module above to access FanDuel Racing.

So in AZ, CO, IL, IN, KY, LA, MA, MD, MI, NY, OH, PA, VA, WV or WY you can sign up with this link to claim a $500 No Sweat First Bet.

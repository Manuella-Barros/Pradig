West Midlands Police said officers feared Irtiza Abbas may have committed other offences and urged victims to come forward. The 25-year-old, from Lozells, loitered near Aston University and followed a woman walking on her own. He tracked the 22-year-old along Dartmouth Middleway for a while to make sure she was alone before grabbing and attacking her on the afternoon of Tuesday, January 16. Months later he followed a 15-year-old schoolgirl as she walked home in Perry Barr. CCTV showed him following her closely along a street and looking around to make sure he was alone. When he was sure there was no-one else around he grabbed the girl and attacked her on Tuesday, April 16.

They drove around the area and spotted Abbas, but following a tussle, he escaped and fled. Officers pieced CCTV together linking the assaults and a suspect was identified. Abbas was arrested from his address in Lozells on April 22 and clothing matching the description in the CCTV was recovered. Although he did not admit his guilt in interview, police said he knew the evidence against him was so compelling that he pleaded guilty at court. He was sentenced to two years in jail following a hearing at Birmingham Crown Court. Both victims bravely allowed police to tell their story and show CCTV in the hope of encouraging other potential victims to come home. Speaking after the case, investigating officer, Det Insp Joe Davenport, said: \"We strongly believe, due to the nature of the offences, that Abbas may have committed more offences. CCTV has shown him lingering on the streets and carefully selecting his victims. He would follow them to make sure they were on their own before he struck. \"Although he's pleaded guilty to two offences there's a timeline gap and we have strong suspicions he may have offended again and again. Thanks to the support of the victims and their bravery and our teams\u2019 efforts in tracing every piece of CCTV we could, we've managed to take a serial offender and a potentially dangerous man, whose offences were deliberate, methodical and repeated, off the streets of Birmingham. \"If anyone feels something similar has happened to them and they've not come forward before, we'd ask them to reconsider. Please contact me or one of my team and we promise we will take your account seriously.\" Contact police on 101 or use the Live Chat function on the West Midlands Police website quoting crime number 20/412643/24.

Justice J. K. Omotosho of the Federal High Court, Abuja, which set aside the impeachment of the State's former deputy governor, Philip Shaibu.\n\nThe State Assembly has also filed a stay of execution on the judgement pending appeal.\n\nThe Edo State House of Assembly, had on Monday, April 8, 2024, impeached Philip Shaibu following the adoption of the report of the seven-man investigative panel set up by the State Chief Judge to probe allegations of misconduct against the former deputy governor.\n\nThe investigative panel set up the EDHA was headed by Justice S.A. Omonua (retd.) and probed Shaibu on allegations of perjury and leaking of government secrets, ending its sittings with the former deputy governor refusing to appear before it.\n\nShaibu was impeached by the vote of eighteen out of 19 members of the Assembly present at plenary, while one abstained from the headcount and voting process.\n\nRecall that the State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, had upon the impeachment of Shaibu picked Omobayo Marvellous Godwins as his deputy to complete his second tenure in office, which lapses on November 11, 2024.\n\nThe Edo State Government has said the incumbent Deputy Governor of the State, Omobayo Marvellous Godwins remains and continues to serve as the valid deputy Governor of the State pending the hearing of the appeal of the judgement that faulted the impeachment of the erstwhile deputy governor, Philip Shaibu.\n\nIn a statement, the Edo State Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Chris Nehikhare, said the State has filed a stay of execution on the judgement, urging the people of Edo State to remain calm and go about their lawful businesses.\n\nThe statement reads, \"Following the Federal High Court, Abuja judgement that faulted the impeachment of the erstwhile deputy governor, Philip Shaibu, the Edo State Government has filed a stay of execution of the judgement.\n\n\"Pending the hearing of the appeal of the judgement, the incumbent Deputy Governor, His Excellency, Omobayo Marvellous Godwins remains and continues to serve as the valid Deputy Governor of Edo State.\n\n\"He will continue to serve in this capacity and would be recognized as such.\"\n\nNehikhare charged, \"The government hereby calls on the people of Edo State to remain calm and go about their lawful businesses.\"\n\n.Your comment an affront on judiciary, says Shaibu's spokesman\n\nHowever, Ebomhiana Musa Chief Press Secretary to Edo State Deputy Governor, Rt Hon Comrade Philip Shaibu has noted that ''For us, it's a victory for democracy and the rule of law. The judiciary remains the last hope of the common man. For mere mortals who think they can play God in the lives of others, this judgement serves as a lesson. He appoints kings and kings as it pleases Him. Those who have ears, let them hear.\n\nFor the statement hurriedly issued by the Hon Commissioner for Communication, Chris Nehikhare, we see it as an affront on the judiciary, a blatant attempt to ridicule the sound judgment delivered by the Honourable Justice Omotosho of the FCT Federal High Court. The statement smarks of arrogance of power on the part of the Edo State Government, by insisting that \" nothing has changed, Omobayo remains the Deputy Governor\".\n\nChris Nihikhare and his co-travellers should be reminded that power is transient, especially for them with less than four months to vacate office.", "source": {"uri": "championnews.com.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Champion Newspapers Limited"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_State_House_of_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edo State House of Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_State", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edo State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edo State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Shaibu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philip Shaibu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay_of_execution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stay of execution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Bill_Clinton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment of Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Majority leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benin"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Benin"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California State Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honourable", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Honourable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Capital_Territory,_Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recall election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excellency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Excellency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Agency_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "News Agency of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin_Obaseki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Godwin Obaseki"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9740148", "eventUri": "eng-9740148", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-08", "textStart": 1009, "textEnd": 1016}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-11-", "textStart": 3513, "textEnd": 3524}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 229, "relevance": 1}

Deputy Governor  --  National Accord Newspaper", "body": "Comrade Philip Shaibu, the impeached Deputy Governor of Edo State\n\nA Federal High Court in Abuja on Wednesday, nullified the impeachment of Phillip Shaibu as the Deputy Governor of Edo State.\n\nJustice James Omotosho, in a judgment, ordered his reinstatement to the office on the grounds that the Edo State House of Assembly failed to comply with due process in the purported impeachment.\n\nJustice Omotosho held that the allegation on which the House of Assembly based the impeachment proceedings was untenable in law and did not constitute a gross misconduct.\n\nThe judge, therefore, ordered the Inspector-General (I-G) of Police to provide him with needed security to enable him resume office and perform the functions of the office until the end of his tenure.\n\nJustice Omotosho equally set aside the appointment of another deputy governor in the place of Shaibu.\n\nThe News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Shaibu, who was in court, shed tears of joy upon hearing the judge's pronouncements.\n\nNAN reports that on April 8, the state House of Assembly impeached Shaibu.\n\nShaibu's impeachment followed the adoption of the report of a seven-man committee set up by the chief judge of Edo Justice Daniel Okungbowa to investigate allegations of misconduct against the deputy governor.\n\nDuring plenary at the assembly complex in Benin, the Majority Leader of the House Charity Aiguobarueghian said the report of the seven-man judicial panel of inquiry presented to the House had two findings and one recommendation.\n\nAiguobarueghian said that while the report of the panel was unable to establish the case of perjury levelled against the deputy governor, the panel found him guilty of disclosure of government secrets.\n\nAccording to the report, the seven-member judicial panel of inquiry recommended that the deputy governor be impeached on grounds of disclosure of government secrets.\n\nThe Clerk of the House Yahaya Omogbai conducted a head count of the lawmakers who voted for and against the impeachment of Shaibu.\n\nEighteen out of 19 members present at plenary voted for the impeachment of the deputy governor while one abstained from the head count and voting process.\n\nThe clerk of the House stated that 2/3 (16 members of the House) was needed to carry out the impeachment (NAN)", "source": {"uri": "nationalaccordnewspaper.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Accord Newspaper"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Philip Shaibu as the Deputy Governor of Edo State, following his earlier impeachment and removal by the Edo State House of Assembly.\n\nIn the judgement delivered by Justice James Omotosho of the Federal High Court in the suit marked CS/469/24, the Court held that Ighodalo was duly nominated at the February 22nd primary election of the PDP.\n\nThe governorship primary exercise took place in Benin City. The court consequently dismissed the case filed against his nomination by the Plaintiff, Shaibu.\n\nIghodalo emerged governorship candidate of the PDP in a primary election, which held on February 22nd 2024 at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin City, Edo State.\n\nHe scored a total of 577 votes to beat his closest rival, Philip Shaibu and 10 other aspirants.\n\nHowever, the Court presided over by Hon. Justice James Omotosho held that the removal of Shaibu from office as Deputy Governor of Edo State and the subsequent appointment of Omobayo Godwins as his replacement by the Governor Godwin Obaseki was illegal, unconstitutional, null and void.\n\nThe Court held that there was a breach of the provisions of the procedure laid out in Section 188 (1) to (9) in the way and manner the impeachment process was conducted.\n\nThe court noted that the ouster clause in Section 188(10) limiting the jurisdiction was not a stand alone provision, and referred to the decision of the Nigerian Supreme Court in Inakoju v. Adeleke (2007).\n\nThe court, therefore, ordered the 1st Defendant, the Inspector General of Police to immediately restore the security of the Plaintiff as Deputy Governor of Edo State.\n\nAs of the time of filing this report, supporters of Shaibu were seen in and around the court premises celebrating the court verdict.\n\nThe court held that the impeachment was politically motivated because of his aspiration to contest the office of Governor of Edo State.\n\nMeanwhile, reactions have started to trail the two judgments.\n\nThe suspended vice national chairman of the party in the South South, Dan Orbih, has congratulated Shaibu, and urged him to use the remaining days in office to remove shame from the PDP.\n\nIn a letter to Shaibu, Orbih said, \"I want to sincerely congratulate the Deputy Governor of Edo State, Rt. Hon. Philip Shaibu over his landmark victory in the legal battle against his unlawful impeachment by some members of the Edo State House of Assembly.\n\n'I am particularly delighted by this judgment being the one who led the campaign that brought you and Governor Godwin Obaseki to serve a second term as Governor and Deputy-Governor of the state in 2020.\n\n\"I was greatly pained to watch the unfortunate drama of your impeachment, which was generally reported to have been stoked by some elements in the Government of the state.\n\n\"As you return as deputy governor of Edo State, I implore you to use your office to bring zeal to governance programmes and policies, to wit, so that we would not be totally left in shame as a party that failed in our promises to the good people of Edo State.\"\n\nAlso, a one-time ally of Governor Obaseki and former APC chairman, Aslem Ojezua, said the rule of law has prevailed.\n\nOjezua, who contested the PDP primary election, said, \"I knew this is how it would end and I am very happy about the fact that common sense and the rule of law have prevailed in Edo State.\n\n\"I was surprised about the trumped up charges against Shaibu. I condemned it and said it was a shame that this could happen in Edo. Today, the rule of law has prevailed.

The government hereby calls on the people of Edo State to remain calm and go about their lawful businesses.\"\n\nPDP Hails Court Judgement Affirming Ighodalo's Candidacy\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has commended the judgement of the Federal High Court, Abuja, which affirmed the nomination of its candidate, Dr. Asue Ighodalo, in the September 21, 2024 Governorship election in Edo State.\n\nThe Party in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, described the landmark judgement which upheld the governorship primary election held on February 22, 2024 at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin City as victory for democracy, Rule of Law and a well-founded affirmation of the propriety and credibility of the Primary election and PDP's internal democracy.\n\nThe party said that the spontaneous jubilation across Edo State at the news of the judgement reaffirmed the PDP candidate, Ighodalo, as the undisputed preference of the majority of the people of Edo State in the coming Governorship election.\n\nAlso, in a statement made by the media aide in the PDP Campaign Council, Felix Osaro, thePDP reaffirmed Ighodalo as the undisputed choice of the majority of the people of Edo State.\n\nThe statement said the party was aware of a well-oiled plot by certain egocentric and overtly ambitious individuals to orchestrate a series of coordinated smear campaigns against Ighodalo.\n\nSimilarly, the Team Asue Media Organisation (TAMO) has hailed the judgement, too.\n\nIn a statement issued in Benin City, TAMO said \"the judgment represents a landmark pronouncement by upholding the sanctity of the PDP Governorship primary in Edo State which held on February 22, 2024 at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin City. It's surely a good victory for democracy and rule of law.\"", "source": {"uri": "thisdaylive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "THISDAYLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chuks_okocha@thisdaylive.com", "name": "Chuks Okocha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "adibe_emenyonu@thisdaylive.com", "name": "Adibe Emenyonu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_governors_of_Edo_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "List of governors of Edo State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples_Democratic_Party_(Nigeria)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peoples Democratic Party (Nigeria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Shaibu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philip Shaibu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Honourable", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Honourable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_State", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edo State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edo State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_State_House_of_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Edo State House of Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin_Obaseki", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Godwin Obaseki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benin City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Benin City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Ogbemudia_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Progressives_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All Progressives Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inspector general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excellency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Excellency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9740148", "eventUri": "eng-9740148", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-22", "textStart": 697, "textEnd": 710}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

And a declarative judgement, if you follow the law, the Supreme Court law, you cannot stay a declarative judgement,\" he added.\n\nThe Edo State House of Assembly removed him from office on 8 April over allegations of gross misconduct.\n\nGovernor Godwin Obaseki immediately nominated Omobayo Godwins as Mr Shaibu's replacement. The House of Assembly confirmed Mr Godwins' appointment, and the governor promptly swore him in as the deputy governor the same day.\n\nHowever, the Federal High Court in Abuja upheld on Wednesday Mr Shaibu's suit challenging his removal from office, holding that the allegations over which the House of Assembly removed him did not constitute acts of gross misconduct.\n\nThe court nullified Mr Shaibu's removal and ordered his reinstatement to office.\n\nThe judge, James Omotosho, also ordered the payment of salaries and entitlements since the House of Assembly illegally removed him from office in April.\n\nThe House of Assembly expressed dissatisfaction with the judgment and appealed against it.\n\nBut Mr Shaibu said Thursday that based on legal procedure, he still holds the Edo State Deputy Governor's position until the court issues explicitly an order to stay the execution of the judgement.\n\nHe added that a court of law does not stop executing a declarative judgement like the one he obtained.\n\nHe further said that merely filing an appeal and applying for a stay of execution of a judgement does not automatically operate as an order of stay of execution.\n\n\"A motion or application,\" Mr Shaibu said, pausing momentarily, and added, \"Does it act like stay? You are telling me I want to do X, and I have not granted it; it cannot act as stay.\"\n\nMr Shaibu also claimed to have resumed duty. He also wrote to the government to reinstate all his political appointees.\n\nHis insistence on returning to office after obtaining the judgement shows he has rejected the counsel of a former National Legal Adviser of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mark Jacob.\n\nMr Jacob, who commented on the verdict on Arise Television's Morning Show on Thursday, said Mr Shaibu would become redundant and an outsider in the government if he returned to office.\n\nHe also viewed Mr Shaibu's desire to return to office as a long-shot dream, considering the interminable length of time it would take the Supreme Court to give the final decision on the matter.\n\nMeanwhile, the tenure that Mr Shaibu aims to complete ends in November, about four months away.\n\nSupport for APC candidate\n\nMr Shaibu alongside Governor Obaseki defected from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the PDP to realise their re-election bid in 2020.\n\nBut Mr Shaibu has declared support for his former party's governorship candidate for the upcoming 21 September Edo State governorship election, Monday Okpebholo.\n\nExplaining his stance, Mr Shaibu, whose governorship ambition drew a wedge between him and Mr Obaseki, said he was unwilling to support an outsider presented by the PDP as its governorship candidate.\n\nHe also claimed he followed in the footsteps of Mr Obaseki's endorsement of the 2023 Labour Party's presidential candidate, Peter Obi, instead of the then-PDP candidate, Atiku Abubakar.\n\nBut, months before the 2023 presidential election, Governor Obaseki, through one of his aides, denied backing Mr Obi.\n\nAllegations, counter-allegations over violence\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Shaibu blamed Thursday's attack on him and the APC governorship candidate, Mr Okpebholo, on Governor Obaseki, continuing a flurry of allegations and counter-allegations that has ensued between him and the Edo State Government after the incident.\n\nGunmen reportedly attacked Mr Shaibu and Mr Okpebholo on Thursday while departing the Benin airport shortly after they arrived from Abuja aboard a chartered flight.\n\nThe Edo State Police Command has confirmed that a police inspector died in the attack, equivocally blaming the violence on \"political gladiators\".\n\nSpeaking on the incident on Friday, Mr Shaibu said he had long received intelligence foretelling it.\n\n\"Yesterday (Thursday), I got intel that the governor has told his men that they must not allow me into town and that I am a freeborn of Edo State. Nobody can stop me from entering Edo State, and the constitution does not allow anybody to bar me from entering Edo State,\" he said.\n\nHe alleged that he had been on the governor's target since he declared his intention to run for the 2024 governorship election.\n\nHe said, \"I didn't know he would arm them that much. Reviewing it further,... I remember the governor saying during this crisis when I declared to contest for the governor that if I continued, he would destroy me. He used the words, 'If you continue, I will destroy you'. So with what happened yesterday, it was obvious that it was an attempt to actualise that statement he made that he was going to destroy me.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Edo State Government blamed Mr Shaibu for attacks on innocent residents around the airport axis in Benin, the state capital, on Thursday.\n\nContrary to Mr Shaibu's claim of coming under attack, the state government wrote in a thread of tweets on Thursday that \"Shaibu led thugs through Airport Road axis of Benin City, attacking innocent citizens and unleashing mayhem on private citizens who are going about their lawful businesses.\"\n\nIt claimed Mr Shaibu's violent tendencies were well documented, vowing that \"Shaibu will face the consequences of violence that he has resorted to in pursuit of his aim to return to the Edo State Government House even when he is aware that a stay of execution of the judgement has been filed.\"\n\nThe tweet added, \"The State Government, through this statement, is warning Shaibu to desist from this turn to violence in the pretence that he is enforcing a judgement. He is reminded that he is not above the law and is liable for the wanton destruction perpetrated by him and his co-travellers.\"\n\nAllies turned foes\n\nMr Shaibu's removal last April was the peak of the political feud between him and Governor Obaseki.\n\nThe feud stemmed from Shaibu's ambition to succeed Mr Godwin, who preferred a different person from another region of the state, which he considered better suited to the zoning arraignment in the state to succeed him.\n\nBoth men, once allies, have become adversaries.\n\nTheir re-election in 2022 was largely due to the strong alliance they formed against their former benefactor, Adams Oshiomhole, who had supported their rise to office in 2016 but fell out with Mr Obaseki before the end of Obaseki's first term.\n\nAs the 2020 election approached, they were compelled to leave the All Progressives Congress (APC), which Mr Oshiomhole then chaired at the national level, and to seek their re-election on the PDP platform. This move was driven by Mr Oshiomhole's opposition to their candidacy as the APC's flag bearers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Police arrest couple for allegedly torturing 13-year-old ward\n\nThey contested for a second term and won on the PDP platform.\n\nBut no sooner had they settled down for the second term than Mr Shaibu's ambition to succeed Mr Obaseki began to draw a wedge between them.\n\nDespite Governor Obaseki's insistence on a successor from the Edo Central zone of the state, Mr Shaibu, who hails from Edo North, obtained the PDP governorship nomination form.\n\nIn February, the governor's preferred candidate, Asue Ighodalo, emerged as the winner of the party's primary election, even though Mr Shaibu declared himself the winner of a parallel poll.\n\nThe conflict between the governor and Mr Shaibu fluctuated between periods of calm and intense strain until their deteriorating relationship reached a breaking point, catalysing Mr Shaibu's removal from office by the state House of Assembly in April.", "source": {"uri": "premiumtimesng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Premium Times Nigeria"}, "authors": [{"uri": "falmata_daniel@premiumtimesng.com", "name": "Falmata Daniel",

He emphasized that no one, including the governor, has the constitutional authority to bar him from the state.\n\nShaibu recalled the animosity that began when he announced his intention to run for the governorship under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in November 2023. He alleged that Governor Obaseki threatened to destroy him for making the declaration. Shaibu vowed to continue his political fight until the September 21 governorship election.\n\nThe deputy governor also accused Obaseki of orchestrating an attack on Thursday in Benin City, targeting his convoy and that of the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Monday Okpebholo. The attack resulted in the death of a police inspector, Okon, who was attached to Okpebholo.\n\nShaibu further criticized Governor Obaseki for allegedly destroying the office of the deputy governor and claimed he had not been paid for the past year.

Obaseki behind my attack - Philip Shaibu | TheNewsGuru", "body": "Subscribe for FREE to get LIVE NEWS UPDATE. Click here to subscribe!\n\nThe reinstated deputy governor of Edo State, Philip Shaibu, has accused Governor Godwin Obaseki of orchestrating an attack against him and Monday Okpebholo, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), in the state. Shaibu claims that Obaseki had previously threatened to \"destroy\" him.\n\nShaibu reported receiving intelligence that Obaseki instructed his men to prevent him from entering the state. This alleged directive resulted in a shootout in Benin City when Shaibu returned after the Abuja Federal High Court reinstated him as deputy governor. The clash led to the death of Okpebholo's police aide.\n\nIn an interview on Channels Television, Shaibu said, \"I got intel that the governor told his men not to allow me into town. I'm a free-born citizen of Edo State; nobody can prevent me from entering the state. The Constitution does not permit anyone to bar me from the state, whether I am a deputy governor or an ordinary citizen.\"\n\nShaibu also recalled Obaseki's threat to destroy him, adding, \"I didn't know he would arm them that much. Reviewing it further, I remembered the governor saying, 'I will destroy you.' It was an attempt to actualize that threat. However, I believe only God can destroy a man. That's why I decided to fight for the sanity and sanctity of the deputy governor's office, even after my impeachment.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenewsguru.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheNewsGuru"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abimbola_fabunmi@thenewsguru.com", "name": "Abimbola Fabunmi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Shaibu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philip Shaibu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Progressives_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All Progressives Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin_Obaseki", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Godwin Obaseki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_State", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edo State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edo State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channels_TV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Channels TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benin_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benin City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Benin City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://thenewsguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Philip-Shaibu-1.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9740148", "eventUri": "eng-9740148", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

It took the intervention of regular security agents to restore normalcy, as the armed security agents shot sporadically to disperse the warring parties.\n\nShaibu, it would be recalled, was reinstated on Wednesday by a Federal High Court, Abuja, headed by Justice J. K. Omotosho, who voided his earlier impeachment by the Edo State House of Assembly on April 8, 2024.\n\nShortly after the court judgment, Shaibu's supported boasted that the embattled deputy governor would resume his office on Thursday, just as the Edo state Government issued a statement, reiterating that the deputy governor, Godwins Omobayo, remained the valid deputy governor as the Assembly was said to have appealed the judgment and filed a stay of execution.\n\nShortly after the shootings, Shaibu drove in the company of Okpebholo to the APC State Secretariat, where they went into a closed-door meeting.\n\nReacting to the development, the legislative aide to Senator Okpebholo on Media and Communication, Godswill Inegbe, in a statement, accused a leader of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Francis Inegbeniki, of being the mastermind of the fracas.\n\nInegbe, in the statement, alleged that \"During the unprovoked brutal attack, three mobile policemen attached to the security detail of Senator Okpebholo were injured with bullet wounds, while one of the policemen has been declared dead!\n\n\"Senator Monday Okpebholo is at this moment admitted in an undisclosed hospital in Benin City receiving medical attention, and other members of his entourage who were victims of the brutal attack are in various hospitals in Benin City\", Inegbe affirmed.\n\nDenying the allegation of his involvement in the fracas, Chief Inegbeniki said that he was nowhere near the Airport not to talk of sponsoring or leading anyone to attack the motorcade of the APC candidate.\n\nDescribing the allegation as a plot to tarnish his image, the PDP leader said: \" It is not true that I led or sponsored thugs on protest along Airport road in Benin City. As I speak, I was never on Airport Road as at the time the said confrontation took place.\"\n\n\"It is very wrong for anyone for any reason to accuse me of leading or sponsoring any protest. I urge the government, security agencies and the general public to disregard the falsehood The election is around the corner, and I quite understand that my enemies would do anything desperately to blackmail me or tarnish my reputation\", he said, adding that as a peaceful and law-abiding Nigerian, and at his age, being an elder statesman, he would never contemplate such act.\n\nMeanwhile, the deputy governor's office located at Osadebey's Avenue in the Government Reservation Area has been taken over by members of the Edo State Security Network (ESSN)\n\nShaibu.\n\nIn its immediate reaction to the violence, the Edo State Government vowed that the embattled deputy governor would be made to face the music over Thursday's violence in the city.\n\nThe state government, while warning Shaibu not to resort to chaos under the guise of enforcing court judgment, reminded him that he \"is not above the law.\n\nA statement endorsed by the Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Chris Nehikhare, stated that the propensity of Shaibu for violence \"is well documented and has been warned several times by respected figures, including the revered Benin Monarch to shun violence.\"\n\nThe statement reads in parts:\n\n\"The Edo State Government has observed the level of wanton destruction perpetrated by thugs and elements working in connivance with former Deputy Governor of the State, Philip Shaibu in the guise of purportedly enforcing a judgment reinstating him in office.\n\n\"Shaibu led thugs through the Airport Road axis of Benin City, attacking innocent citizens and unleashing mayhem on private citizens who were going about their lawful businesses.\n\n\"The State Government through this statement is warning Shaibu to desist from this turn to violence in the pretense that he is enforcing a judgment. He is reminded that he is not above the law and is liable for the wanton destruction perpetrated by him and his co-travellers.\n\n\"Shaibu's violent tendencies are well documented, and he has been warned at different times by respected figures of society, including the revered Benin Monarch to shun violence.\n\n\"We want to reiterate that Shaibu will face the consequences of violence that he has resorted to in pursuit of his aim to return to the Edo State Government House even when he is aware that a stay of execution of the judgment has been filed.\n\n\"We enjoin the general public to be calm and go about their lawful businesses as the government will continue to deploy the instrumentality of the state to restore and maintain law and order in the State in the face of undue provocation.\"\n\nShaibu fell out with his principal, Governor Godwin Obaseki, over his ambition to succeed his boss, just as the governor insisted that his successor would come from the Edo Central Senatorial District, an area that has not produced the governor of the state since the inception of the current political dispensation in 1999.", "source": {"uri": "tribuneonlineng.com", "dataType":

On the issue of supporting a candidate, the constitution guarantees that you can support who you like and you can belong to any political party.\"", "source": {"uri": "naijanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naija News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ikenna_ngere@naijanews.com", "name": "Ikenna Ngere", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Shaibu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philip Shaibu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin_Obaseki", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Godwin Obaseki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edo_State", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edo State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edo State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples_Democratic_Party_(Nigeria)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peoples Democratic Party (Nigeria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Progressives_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All Progressives Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Philip-Shaibu-and-Godwin-Obaseki.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9740148", "eventUri": "eng-9740148", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-11", "textStart": 115, "textEnd": 126}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

And for me, I think politicians should respect themselves. If I was in his shoes, I would lick my wounds, go my way, take my life into my hands, and move forward,\" the lawyer, a former Attorney-General and Commissioner of Justice in Kaduna State, said.\n\nThe Edo State House of Assembly removed Mr Shaibu from office on 8 April over allegations of gross misconduct.\n\nGovernor Godwin Obaseki immediately nominated Omobayo Godwins as Mr Shaibu's replacement. The House of Assembly confirmed Mr Godwins' appointment, and the governor promptly swore him in as the deputy governor the same day.\n\nHowever, the Federal High Court in Abuja upheld Mr Shaibu's suit challenging his removal from office on Wednesday, holding that the allegations over which the House of Assembly removed him did not constitute acts of gross misconduct.\n\nThe court nullified Mr Shaibu's removal and ordered his reinstatement to office.\n\nThe judge, James Omotosho, also ordered the payment of salaries and entitlements since the House of Assembly illegally removed him from office in April.\n\nThe House of Assembly has expressed its dissatisfaction with the judgment and appealed against it.\n\nMr Jacob recalled the humiliating treatment Mr Shaibu received in the lead-up to his removal in April.\n\nHe said the hostile environment would likely persist if Mr Shaibu takes his office back.\n\n\"If I were Shaibu, I would not have pursued this matter, honestly,\" the lawyer said, adding that prior to his removal, \"he was completely redundant; he was not even, at times, allowed to enter the office; he was completely out of government,\" the former PDP legal advise said.\n\nHe said @they can open a door for him to sit somewhere, and for the next few months, he will be redundant,\" referring to the political forces that saw to Mr Shaibu's removal from office.\n\nHe also based his argument on the inefficiency of the Nigerian courts, where the House of Assembly's appeal could drag on for years.\n\nEven if Mr Shaibu were to return to office, he would leave in November, just four months before the end of his joint tenure with the governor. Given the likelihood of further appeals, it is nearly impossible for the matter to be resolved by the Supreme Court within the next year if any aggrieved party chooses to pursue the full judicial process after the Court of Appeal's decision.\n\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has scheduled 21 September for the next governorship election in the state.\n\nMr Jacob urged Mr Shaibu to abandon the idea of returning to office after making a statement with his successful legal battle against his removal.\n\nObaseki and Shaibu's political feud\n\nMr Shaibu's removal last April was the peak of the political feud between him and Governor Obaseki.\n\nThe feud stemmed from Shaibu's ambition to succeed Mr Godwin, who preferred a different person from another region of the state, which he considered better suited to the zoning arraignment in the state to succeed him.\n\nBoth men, once allies, have become adversaries.\n\nTheir re-election in 2022 was largely due to the strong alliance they formed against their former benefactor, Adams Oshiomhole, who had supported their rise to office in 2016 but fell out with Mr Obaseki before the end of Obaseki's first term.\n\nAs the 2022 election approached, they were compelled to leave the All Progressives Congress (APC), which Mr Oshiomhole then chaired at the national level, and to seek their re-election on the PDP platform. This move was driven by Mr Oshiomhole's opposition to their candidacy as the APC's flagbearers.\n\nThey contested for a second term and won on the PDP platform.\n\nBut no sooner had they settled down for the second term than Mr Shaibu's ambition to succeed Mr Obaseki began to draw a wedge between them.\n\nDespite Governor Obaseki's insistence on a successor from the Edo Central zone of the state, Mr Shaibu, who hails from Edo North, obtained the PDP governorship nomination form.\n\nIn February, the governor's preferred candidate, Asue Ighodalo, emerged as the winner of the party's primary election, even though Mr Shaibu declared himself the winner of a parallel poll.\n\nReflecting on the broken relationship during his appearance on Channels Television in November last year, Mr Shaibu said his troubles started after visiting Mr Oshiomhole to congratulate him on winning his election to the Nigerian senate last year.\n\n\"That was where my headache started because the governor's style is that a friend of the governor, you must be (a) friend to him, and an enemy to the governor, you must be enemy to him,\" Mr Shaibu, a former member of the House of Representatives who hails from the same region of the state with Mr Oshiomhole.\n\nThe conflict between the governor and Mr Shaibu fluctuated between periods of calm and intense strain until their deteriorating relationship reached a breaking point, catalysing Mr Shaibu's removal from office by the state House of Assembly in April.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Jacob blamed Mr Shaibu for his woes.\n\n\"His problem started when he committed class suicide - you don't come in as a comrade and jump ship and join people who are not your political family and expect things will go well,\" Mr Jacob, who served as the PDP National Legal Adviser during Uche Secondus' tumultuous tenure as national chairman.\n\nMr Jacob also criticised the way lawmakers come to office in Nigeria, saying that it often leads to legislative houses becoming mere extensions of the executive branch. He described this as a major national issue that demands urgent attention.\n\nStill, he urged state Houses of Assembly to maintain their independence.\n\nHe also urged politicians to desist from witch-hunting one another over political differences.", "source": {"uri": "premiumtimesng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Premium Times Nigeria"}, "authors": [{"uri":

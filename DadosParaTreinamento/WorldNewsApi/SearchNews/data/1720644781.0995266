World No. 1 Iga \u015awi\u0105tek became just the third woman to three-repeat at the French Open with her 6-2, 6-1 rout of No. 1 Jasmine Paolini in just 68 minutes in the Roland Garros final on Saturday. It was her 21st straight win at Roland Garros and put her in the company of Monica Seles (1990-92) and Justine Henin (2005-7). She is the first woman to win any major three years running since Serena Williams did it at the U.S. Open from 2012-14. \u015awi\u0105tek \u2014 who fought off a match point against Naomi Osaka in the second round \u2014 now owns five total major titles: four French Open crowns (2020, \u201822, \u201823, 24) and one U.S. Open championship (2022). She now owns as many majors as Martina Hingis and Maria Sharapova. The Polish No. 1 earned $2,563,788 for the win, while Paolini takes home $1,304,042. Paolini had reached her first major final by upsetting former Wimbledon champion and No. 4 seed Elena Rybakina in three sets in the quarterfinals and then dispatching 17-year-old Russian Mirra Andreeva in straight sets in the semis. But beating Iga in Paris is becoming akin to taking out the great Rafael Nadal at the tournament he won 14 times.

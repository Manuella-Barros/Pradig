It comes as the Democratic president has struggled to balance his support for Israel after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack -- the deadliest day for Jews worldwide since the Holocaust -- with his efforts to protect civilian life in Gaza.\n\nBiden said that on Oct. 7, Hamas \"brought to life\" that hatred with the killing of more than 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians.\n\n\"Not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting, they're already forgetting, that Hamas unleashed this terror that it was Hamas that brutalized Israelis, that it was Hamas that took and continues to hold hostages,\" Biden said. \"I have not forgotten, nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\nBiden, whose relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has grown strained over his government's push to invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah, said American support for Israel is \"iron clad...even when we disagree.\"\n\nBiden steered clear of the upcoming presidential election in his speech. But his address comes as former President Donald Trump has criticized the incumbent for not doing more to combat antisemitism -- while ignoring his own long history of rhetoric that invokes the language of Nazi Germany and plays on stereotypes of Jews in politics.The Capitol event, hosted by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, also featured remarks from House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Holocaust survivors, local youth and elected officials took part in the remembrance ceremony, which included a recitation of the Jewish prayers for the dead.\n\nThe campus protests have posed a political challenge for Biden, whose coalition has historically relied on younger voters, many of whom are critical of his public support for Israel.\n\nBiden said \"There's no place on any campus in America\" or any place in America for antisemitism or threats of violence. He added, \"We're not a lawless country -- we are a civil society\"\n\nIn conjunction with Biden's speech, his administration was announcing new steps to combat antisemitism on colleges campuses and beyond. The Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights was sending every school district and college in the nation a letter outlining examples of antisemitism and other hate that could lead to federal civil rights investigations.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security was moving to educate schools and community groups about resources and funding available to promote campus safety and address threats. And the State Department's special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism was meeting with technology companies on how to combat the rise in hateful conflict online.\n\nOn Monday, Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris and the first Jewish spouse of a nationally elected American leader, met with Jewish college students at the White House about the administration's efforts to combat antisemitism. He heard students describe their own experiences with hatred, including threats of violence and hate speech, his office said.\n\nTrump's campaign on Monday released a video on Yom Hashoah, Israel's Holocaust remembrance day, that aimed to contrast the 2024 presidential candidates' responses on antisemitism.\n\nThe video shows images of Trump visiting Israel and speeches he has given pledging to stand with Jewish people and confront antisemitism, while showing footage of the protests on campuses and clips of Biden responding to protesters upset with his administration's support for Israel in its war against Hamas.\n\nOne of the clips shows Biden saying, \"They have a point,\" but does not include the next sentence in which Biden said, \"We need to get a lot more care into Gaza.\"\n\nBiden campaign spokesman James Singer said in response that \"President Biden stands against antisemitism and is committed to the safety of the Jewish community, and security of Israel -- Donald Trump does

It comes as the Democratic president has struggled to balance his support for Israel after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack -- the deadliest day for Jews worldwide since the Holocaust -- with his efforts to protect civilian life in Gaza.\n\nBiden said that on Oct. 7, Hamas \"brought to life\" that hatred with the killing of more than 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians.\n\n\"Not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting, they're already forgetting, that Hamas unleashed this terror that it was Hamas that brutalized Israelis, that it was Hamas that took and continues to hold hostages,\" Biden said. \"I have not forgotten, nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\nBiden, whose relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has grown strained over his government's push to invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah, said American support for Israel is \"iron clad...even when we disagree.\"\n\nBiden steered clear of the upcoming presidential election in his speech. But his address comes as former President Donald Trump has criticized the incumbent for not doing more to combat antisemitism -- while ignoring his own long history of rhetoric that invokes the language of Nazi Germany and plays on stereotypes of Jews in politics.\n\nThe Capitol event, hosted by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, also featured remarks from House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Holocaust survivors, local youth and elected officials took part in the remembrance ceremony, which included a recitation of the Jewish prayers for the dead.\n\nThe campus protests have posed a political challenge for Biden, whose coalition has historically relied on younger voters, many of whom are critical of his public support for Israel.\n\nBiden said \"There's no place on any campus in America\" or any place in America for antisemitism or threats of violence. He added, \"We're not a lawless country -- we are a civil society\"\n\nIn conjunction with Biden's speech, his administration was announcing new steps to combat antisemitism on colleges campuses and beyond. The Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights was sending every school district and college in the nation a letter outlining examples of antisemitism and other hate that could lead to federal civil rights investigations.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security was moving to educate schools and community groups about resources and funding available to promote campus safety and address threats. And the State Department's special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism was meeting with technology companies on how to combat the rise in hateful conflict online.\n\nOn Monday, Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris and the first Jewish spouse of a nationally elected American leader, met with Jewish college students at the White House about the administration's efforts to combat antisemitism. He heard students describe their own experiences with hatred, including threats of violence and hate speech, his office said.\n\nTrump's campaign on Monday released a video on Yom Hashoah, Israel's Holocaust remembrance day, that aimed to contrast the 2024 presidential candidates' responses on antisemitism.\n\nThe video shows images of Trump visiting Israel and speeches he has given pledging to stand with Jewish people and confront antisemitism, while showing footage of the protests on campuses and clips of Biden responding to protesters upset with his administration's support for Israel in its war against Hamas.\n\nOne of the clips shows Biden saying, \"They have a point,\" but does not include the next sentence in which Biden said, \"We need to get a lot more care into Gaza.\"\n\nBiden campaign spokesman James Singer said in response that \"President Biden stands against antisemitism and is committed to the safety of the Jewish community, and security of Israel -- Donald Trump does not.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Michelle L.

And we will not forget.\"\n\nBiden, whose relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has grown strained over his government's push to invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah, said American support for Israel is \"iron clad...even when we disagree.\"\n\nBiden steered clear of the upcoming presidential election in his speech. But his address comes as former President Donald Trump has criticized the incumbent for not doing more to combat antisemitism -- while ignoring his own long history of rhetoric that invokes the language of Nazi Germany and plays on stereotypes of Jews in politics.\n\nThe Capitol event, hosted by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, also featured remarks from House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nThe campus protests have posed a political challenge for Biden, whose coalition has historically relied on younger voters, many of whom are critical of his public support for Israel.\n\nBiden said \"There's no place on any campus in America\" or any place in America for antisemitism or threats of violence. He added, \"We're not a lawless country -- we are a civil society\"\n\nIn conjunction with Biden's speech, his administration was announcing new steps to combat antisemitism on colleges campuses and beyond. The Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights was sending every school district and college in the nation a letter outlining examples of antisemitism and other hate that could lead to federal civil rights investigations.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security was moving to educate schools and community groups about resources and funding available to promote campus safety and address threats. And the State Department's special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism was meeting with technology companies on how to combat the rise in hateful conflict online.\n\nOn Monday, Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris and the first Jewish spouse of a nationally elected American leader, met with Jewish college students at the White House about the administration's efforts to combat antisemitism. He heard students describe their own experiences with hatred, including threats of violence and hate speech, his office said.\n\nTrump's campaign on Monday released a video on Yom Hashoah, Israel's Holocaust remembrance day, that aimed to contrast the 2024 presidential candidates' responses on antisemitism.\n\nThe video shows images of Trump visiting Israel and speeches he has given pledging to stand with Jewish people and confront antisemitism, while showing footage of the protests on campuses and clips of Biden responding to protesters upset with his administration's support for Israel in its war against Hamas.\n\nOne of the clips shows Biden saying, \"They have a point,\" but does not include the next sentence in which Biden said, \"We need to get a lot more care into Gaza.\"\n\nBiden campaign spokesman James Singer said in response that \"President Biden stands against antisemitism and is committed to the safety of the Jewish community, and security of Israel -- Donald Trump does not.\"", "source": {"uri": "who13.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "who13.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@who13.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

Statue of Freedom stands behind.\n\nBy Zeke Miller, Associated Press\n\nTuesday, May 7, 2024 | 7:45 p.m.\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden on Tuesday decried a \"ferocious surge\" in antisemitism on college campuses and around the globe in the months since Hamas attacked Israel and triggered a war in Gaza, using a ceremony to remember victims of the Holocaust to also denounce new waves of violence and hateful rhetoric toward Jews.\n\nBiden said that on Oct. 7, Hamas \"brought to life\" that hatred with the killing of more than 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, and warned that, already, people are beginning to forget who was responsible.\n\nThe president used his address to renew his declarations of unwavering support for Israel in its war against Hamas even as his relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has grown increasingly strained over Israel's push to invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah, which would surely worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis for Palestinians.\n\nA senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive matter, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the U.S. paused a shipment of bombs to Israel last week over concerns about Israel's decision on Rafah.\n\nBiden has struggled to balance his support for Israel since the attack by Hamas -- the deadliest day for Jews worldwide since the Holocaust -- with his efforts to protect civilian life in Gaza.\n\nWhile acknowledging the ceremony was taking place during \"difficult times,\" Biden made no explicit reference to the deaths of more than 34,700 Palestinians since the attack by Hamas led Israel to declare war in Gaza. The tally from the Hamas-run health ministry includes militants, but also many civilians caught up in the fighting.\n\n\"My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad, even when we disagree,\" Biden said.\n\n\"We're at risk of people not knowing the truth,\" Biden said of the horrors of the Holocaust, when 6 million Jews were systematically killed by Nazi Germany and its collaborators. \"This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world.\"\n\nBiden steered clear of the upcoming presidential election in his speech. But it played out in counterpoint to former President Donald Trump's criticism of the incumbent for not doing more to combat antisemitism. Trump has a long personal history of rhetoric that invokes the language of Nazi Germany and plays on stereotypes of Jews in politics.\n\nBiden's remarks at the Capitol played out as pro-Palestinian protests -- some of which have involved antisemitic chants and threats toward Jewish students and supporters of Israel -- rock college campuses across the country.\n\n\"As Jews around the world still cope with the atrocity and trauma of that day and its aftermath, we've seen a ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world,\" Biden said.\n\n\"Not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting, they're already forgetting, that Hamas unleashed this terror that it was Hamas that brutalized Israelis, that it was Hamas that took and continues to hold hostages,\" Biden said. \"I have not forgotten, nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\nThe Capitol event, hosted by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, also featured remarks from House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Holocaust survivors, local youth and elected officials took part in the remembrance ceremony, which included a recitation of the Jewish prayers for the dead.\n\nThe campus protests have posed a political challenge for Biden, whose coalition has historically relied on younger voters, many of whom are critical of his public support for Israel.\n\nBiden said \"There's no place on any campus in America\" or any place in America for antisemitism or threats of violence. He added, \"We're not a lawless country -- we are a civil society\"\n\nIn conjunction with Biden's speech, his administration was announcing new steps to combat antisemitism on colleges campuses and beyond. The Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights was sending every school district and college in the nation a letter outlining examples of antisemitism and other hate that could lead to federal civil rights investigations.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security was moving to educate schools and community groups about resources and funding available to promote campus safety and address threats. And the State Department's special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism was meeting with technology companies on how to combat the rise in hateful conflict online.\n\nOn Monday, Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris and the first Jewish spouse of a nationally elected American leader, met with Jewish college students at the White House about the administration's efforts to combat antisemitism. He heard students describe their own experiences with hatred, including threats of violence and hate speech, his office said.\n\nTrump's campaign on Monday released a video on Yom Hashoah, Israel's Holocaust remembrance day, that aimed to contrast the 2024 presidential candidates' responses on antisemitism.\n\nThe video shows images of Trump visiting Israel and speeches he has given pledging to stand with Jewish people and confront antisemitism, while showing footage of the protests on campuses and clips of Biden responding to protesters upset with his administration's support for Israel in its war against Hamas.\n\nOne of the clips shows Biden saying, \"They have a point,\" but it does not include the next sentence in which Biden said, \"We need to get a lot more care into Gaza.\"\n\nBiden campaign spokesman James Singer said in response that \"President Biden stands against antisemitism and is committed to the safety of the Jewish community, and security of Israel -- Donald Trump does not.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Michelle L.

The tally from the Hamas-run health ministry includes militants, but also many civilians caught up in the fighting.\n\n\"My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad, even when we disagree,\" Biden said.\n\n\"We're at risk of people not knowing the truth,\" Biden said of the horrors of the Holocaust, when 6 million Jews were systematically killed by Nazi Germany and its collaborators. \"This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world.\"\n\nBiden steered clear of the upcoming presidential election in his speech. But it played out in counterpoint to former President Donald Trump's criticism of the incumbent for not doing more to combat antisemitism. Trump has a long personal history of rhetoric that invokes the language of Nazi Germany and plays on stereotypes of Jews in politics.\n\nBiden's remarks at the Capitol played out as pro-Palestinian protests -- some of which have involved antisemitic chants and threats toward Jewish students and supporters of Israel -- rock college campuses across the country.\n\n\"As Jews around the world still cope with the atrocity and trauma of that day and its aftermath, we've seen a ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world,\" Biden said.\n\n\"Not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting, they're already forgetting, that Hamas unleashed this terror that it was Hamas that brutalized Israelis, that it was Hamas that took and continues to hold hostages,\" Biden said. \"I have not forgotten, nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\nThe Capitol event, hosted by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, also featured remarks from House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Holocaust survivors, local youth and elected officials took part in the remembrance ceremony, which included a recitation of the Jewish prayers for the dead.\n\nThe campus protests have posed a political challenge for Biden, whose coalition has historically relied on younger voters, many of whom are critical of his public support for Israel.\n\nBiden said \"There's no place on any campus in America\" or any place in America for antisemitism or threats of violence. He added, \"We're not a lawless country -- we are a civil society\"\n\nIn conjunction with Biden's speech, his administration was announcing new steps to combat antisemitism on colleges campuses and beyond. The Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights was sending every school district and college in the nation a letter outlining examples of antisemitism and other hate that could lead to federal civil rights investigations.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security was moving to educate schools and community groups about resources and funding available to promote campus safety and address threats. And the State Department's special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism was meeting with technology companies on how to combat the rise in hateful conflict online.\n\nOn Monday, Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris and the first Jewish spouse of a nationally elected American leader, met with Jewish college students at the White House about the administration's efforts to combat antisemitism. He heard students describe their own experiences with hatred, including threats of violence and hate speech, his office said.\n\nTrump's campaign on Monday released a video on Yom Hashoah, Israel's Holocaust remembrance day, that aimed to contrast the 2024 presidential candidates' responses on antisemitism.\n\nThe video shows images of Trump visiting Israel and speeches he has given pledging to stand with Jewish people and confront antisemitism, while showing footage of the protests on campuses and clips of Biden responding to protesters upset with his administration's support for Israel in its war against Hamas.\n\nOne of the clips shows Biden saying, \"They have a point,\" but it does not include the next sentence in which Biden said, \"We need to get a lot more care into Gaza.\"\n\nBiden campaign spokesman James Singer said in response that \"President Biden stands against antisemitism and is committed to the safety of the Jewish community, and security of Israel -- Donald Trump does not.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Michelle L.

The tally from the Hamas-run health ministry includes militants, but also many civilians caught up in the fighting.\n\n\"My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad, even when we disagree,\" Biden said.\n\n\"We're at risk of people not knowing the truth,\" Biden said of the horrors of the Holocaust, when 6 million Jews were systematically killed by Nazi Germany and its collaborators. \"This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world.\"\n\nBiden steered clear of the upcoming presidential election in his speech. But it played out in counterpoint to former President Donald Trump's criticism of the incumbent for not doing more to combat antisemitism. Trump has a long personal history of rhetoric that invokes the language of Nazi Germany and plays on stereotypes of Jews in politics.\n\nBiden's remarks at the Capitol played out as pro-Palestinian protests -- some of which have involved antisemitic chants and threats toward Jewish students and supporters of Israel -- rock college campuses across the country.\n\n\"As Jews around the world still cope with the atrocity and trauma of that day and its aftermath, we've seen a ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world,\" Biden said.\n\n\"Not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting, they're already forgetting, that Hamas unleashed this terror that it was Hamas that brutalized Israelis, that it was Hamas that took and continues to hold hostages,\" Biden said. \"I have not forgotten, nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\nThe Capitol event, hosted by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, also featured remarks from House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Holocaust survivors, local youth and elected officials took part in the remembrance ceremony, which included a recitation of the Jewish prayers for the dead.\n\nThe campus protests have posed a political challenge for Biden, whose coalition has historically relied on younger voters, many of whom are critical of his public support for Israel.\n\nBiden said \"There's no place on any campus in America\" or any place in America for antisemitism or threats of violence. He added, \"We're not a lawless country -- we are a civil society\"\n\nIn conjunction with Biden's speech, his administration was announcing new steps to combat antisemitism on colleges campuses and beyond. The Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights was sending every school district and college in the nation a letter outlining examples of antisemitism and other hate that could lead to federal civil rights investigations.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security was moving to educate schools and community groups about resources and funding available to promote campus safety and address threats. And the State Department's special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism was meeting with technology companies on how to combat the rise in hateful conflict online.\n\nOn Monday, Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris and the first Jewish spouse of a nationally elected American leader, met with Jewish college students at the White House about the administration's efforts to combat antisemitism. He heard students describe their own experiences with hatred, including threats of violence and hate speech, his office said.\n\nTrump's campaign on Monday released a video on Yom Hashoah, Israel's Holocaust remembrance day, that aimed to contrast the 2024 presidential candidates' responses on antisemitism.\n\nThe video shows images of Trump visiting Israel and speeches he has given pledging to stand with Jewish people and confront antisemitism, while showing footage of the protests on campuses and clips of Biden responding to protesters upset with his administration's support for Israel in its war against Hamas.\n\nOne of the clips shows Biden saying, \"They have a point,\" but it does not include the next sentence in which Biden said, \"We need to get a lot more care into Gaza.\"\n\nBiden campaign spokesman James Singer said in response that \"President Biden stands against antisemitism and is committed to the safety of the Jewish community, and security of Israel -- Donald Trump does not.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Michelle L.

But it played out in counterpoint to former President Donald Trump's criticism of the incumbent for not doing more to combat antisemitism. Trump has a long personal history of rhetoric that invokes the language of Nazi Germany and plays on stereotypes of Jews in politics.\n\nBiden's remarks at the Capitol played out as pro-Palestinian protests -- some of which have involved antisemitic chants and threats toward Jewish students and supporters of Israel -- rock college campuses across the country.\n\n\"As Jews around the world still cope with the atrocity and trauma of that day and its aftermath, we've seen a ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world,\" Biden said.\n\n\"Not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting, they're already forgetting, that Hamas unleashed this terror that it was Hamas that brutalized Israelis, that it was Hamas that took and continues to hold hostages,\" Biden said. \"I have not forgotten, nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\nThe Capitol event, hosted by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, also featured remarks from House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Holocaust survivors, local youth and elected officials took part in the remembrance ceremony, which included a recitation of the Jewish prayers for the dead.\n\nThe campus protests have posed a political challenge for Biden, whose coalition has historically relied on younger voters, many of whom are critical of his public support for Israel.\n\nBiden said \"There's no place on any campus in America\" or any place in America for antisemitism or threats of violence. He added, \"We're not a lawless country -- we are a civil society.\"\n\nIn conjunction with Biden's speech, his administration was announcing new steps to combat antisemitism on colleges campuses and beyond. The Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights was sending every school district and college in the nation a letter outlining examples of antisemitism and other hate that could lead to federal civil rights investigations.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security was moving to educate schools and community groups about resources and funding available to promote campus safety and address threats. And the State Department's special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism was meeting with technology companies on how to combat the rise in hateful conflict online.\n\nOn Monday, Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris and the first Jewish spouse of a nationally elected American leader, met with Jewish college students at the White House about the administration's efforts to combat antisemitism. He heard students describe their own experiences with hatred, including threats of violence and hate speech, his office said.\n\nTrump's campaign on Monday released a video on Yom Hashoah, Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day, that aimed to contrast the 2024 presidential candidates' responses on antisemitism.\n\nThe video shows images of Trump visiting Israel and speeches he has given pledging to stand with Jewish people and confront antisemitism, while showing footage of the protests on campuses and clips of Biden responding to protesters upset with his administration's support for Israel in its war against Hamas.\n\nOne of the clips shows Biden saying, \"They have a point,\" but it does not include the next sentence in which Biden said, \"We need to get a lot more care into Gaza.\"\n\nBiden campaign spokesman James Singer said in response that \"President Biden stands against antisemitism and is committed to the safety of the Jewish community, and security of Israel -- Donald Trump does not.\"\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Michelle L.

The tally from the Hamas-run health ministry includes militants, but also many civilians caught up in the fighting.\n\n\"My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad, even when we disagree,\" Biden said.\n\n\"We're at risk of people not knowing the truth,\" Biden said of the horrors of the Holocaust, when 6 million Jews were systematically killed by Nazi Germany and its collaborators. \"This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world.\"\n\nBiden steered clear of the upcoming presidential election in his speech. But it played out in counterpoint to former President Donald Trump's criticism of the incumbent for not doing more to combat antisemitism. Trump has a long personal history of rhetoric that invokes the language of Nazi Germany and plays on stereotypes of Jews in politics.\n\nBiden's remarks at the Capitol played out as pro-Palestinian protests -- some of which have involved antisemitic chants and threats toward Jewish students and supporters of Israel -- rock college campuses across the country.\n\n\"As Jews around the world still cope with the atrocity and trauma of that day and its aftermath, we've seen a ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world,\" Biden said.\n\n\"Not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting, they're already forgetting, that Hamas unleashed this terror that it was Hamas that brutalized Israelis, that it was Hamas that took and continues to hold hostages,\" Biden said. \"I have not forgotten, nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\nThe Capitol event, hosted by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, also featured remarks from House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Holocaust survivors, local youth and elected officials took part in the remembrance ceremony, which included a recitation of the Jewish prayers for the dead.\n\nThe campus protests have posed a political challenge for Biden, whose coalition has historically relied on younger voters, many of whom are critical of his public support for Israel.\n\nBiden said \"There's no place on any campus in America\" or any place in America for antisemitism or threats of violence. He added, \"We're not a lawless country -- we are a civil society\"\n\nIn conjunction with Biden's speech, his administration was announcing new steps to combat antisemitism on colleges campuses and beyond. The Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights was sending every school district and college in the nation a letter outlining examples of antisemitism and other hate that could lead to federal civil rights investigations.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security was moving to educate schools and community groups about resources and funding available to promote campus safety and address threats. And the State Department's special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism was meeting with technology companies on how to combat the rise in hateful conflict online.\n\nOn Monday, Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris and the first Jewish spouse of a nationally elected American leader, met with Jewish college students at the White House about the administration's efforts to combat antisemitism. He heard students describe their own experiences with hatred, including threats of violence and hate speech, his office said.\n\nTrump's campaign on Monday released a video on Yom Hashoah, Israel's Holocaust remembrance day, that aimed to contrast the 2024 presidential candidates' responses on antisemitism.\n\nThe video shows images of Trump visiting Israel and speeches he has given pledging to stand with Jewish people and confront antisemitism, while showing footage of the protests on campuses and clips of Biden responding to protesters upset with his administration's support for Israel in its war against Hamas.\n\nOne of the clips shows Biden saying, \"They have a point,\" but it does not include the next sentence in which Biden said, \"We need to get a lot more care into Gaza.\"\n\nBiden campaign spokesman James Singer said in response that \"President Biden stands against antisemitism and is committed to the safety of the Jewish community, and security of Israel -- Donald Trump does not.\"\n\n___\n\nRepublished with permission of The Associated Press.", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

The tally from the Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza includes terrorists, but also many civilians caught up in the fighting.\n\n\"My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad, even when we disagree,\" Biden said.\n\n\"We're at risk of people not knowing the truth,\" Biden said of the horrors of the Holocaust, when 6 million Jews were systematically killed by Nazi Germany and its collaborators. \"This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world.\"\n\nBiden steered clear of the upcoming presidential election in his speech. But it played out in counterpoint to former President Donald Trump's criticism of the incumbent for not doing more to combat antisemitism.\n\nTrump's campaign on Monday released a video on Yom Hashoah, Israel's Holocaust remembrance day, that aimed to contrast the 2024 presidential candidates' responses on antisemitism.\n\nThe video shows images of Trump visiting Israel and speeches he has given pledging to stand with Jewish people and confront antisemitism, while showing footage of the protests on campuses and clips of Biden responding to protesters upset with his administration's support for Israel in its war against Hamas.\n\nBiden's remarks at the Capitol played out as pro-Palestinian protests -- some of which have involved antisemitic chants and threats toward Jewish students and supporters of Israel -- rock college campuses across the country.\n\n\"As Jews around the world still cope with the atrocity and trauma of that day and its aftermath, we've seen a ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world,\" Biden said.\n\n\"Not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting, they're already forgetting, that Hamas unleashed this terror that it was Hamas that brutalized Israelis, that it was Hamas that took and continues to hold hostages,\" Biden said. \"I have not forgotten, nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\nThe Capitol event, hosted by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, also featured remarks from House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Holocaust survivors, local youth and elected officials took part in the remembrance ceremony, which included a recitation of the Jewish prayers for the dead.\n\nThe campus protests have posed a political challenge for Biden, whose coalition has historically relied on younger voters, many of whom are critical of his public support for Israel.\n\nBiden said \"There's no place on any campus in America\" or any place in America for antisemitism or threats of violence. He added, \"We're not a lawless country -- we are a civil society.\"\n\nIn conjunction with Biden's speech, his administration was announcing new steps to combat antisemitism on colleges campuses and beyond. The Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights was sending every school district and college in the nation a letter outlining examples of antisemitism and other hate that could lead to federal civil rights investigations.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security was moving to educate schools and community groups about resources and funding available to promote campus safety and address threats. And the State Department's special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism was meeting with technology companies on how to combat the rise in hateful conflict online.\n\nOn Monday, Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris and the first Jewish spouse of a nationally elected American leader, met with Jewish college students at the White House about the administration's efforts to combat antisemitism. He heard students describe their own experiences with hatred, including threats of violence and hate speech, his office said.", "source": {"uri": "reviewjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las

But his address comes as former President Donald Trump has criticized the incumbent for not doing more to combat antisemitism -- while ignoring his own long history of rhetoric that invokes the language of Nazi Germany and plays on stereotypes of Jews in politics.\n\nThe Capitol event, hosted by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, will also feature remarks from House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nThe campus protests have posed a political challenge for Biden, whose coalition has historically relied on younger voters, many of whom are critical of his public support for Israel.\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden would \"reaffirm\" the right to free speech. \"But there is no place on any campus or anywhere for antisemitism,\" she added. \"There is no place for hate speech or threats of violence against the Jewish people.\"\n\nIn conjunction with Biden's speech, his administration was announcing new steps to combat antisemitism on colleges campuses and beyond. The Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights was sending every school district and college in the nation a letter outlining examples of antisemitism and other hate that could lead to federal civil rights investigations.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security was moving to educate schools and community groups about resources and funding available to promote campus safety and address threats. And the State Department's special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism was meeting with technology companies on how to combat the rise in hateful conflict online.\n\nOn Monday, Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris and the first Jewish spouse of a nationally elected American leader, met with Jewish college students at the White House about the administration's efforts to combat antisemitism. He heard students describe their own experiences with hatred, including threats of violence and hate speech, his office said.\n\nTrump's campaign on Monday released a video on Yom Hashoah, Israel's Holocaust remembrance day, that aimed to contrast the 2024 presidential candidates' responses on antisemitism.\n\nThe video shows images of Trump visiting Israel and speeches he has given pledging to stand with Jewish people and confront antisemitism, while showing footage of the protests on campuses and clips of Biden responding to protesters upset with his administration's support for Israel in its war against Hamas.\n\nOne of the clips shows Biden saying, \"They have a point,\" but does not include the next sentence in which Biden said, \"We need to get a lot more care into Gaza.\"\n\nBiden campaign spokesman James Singer said in response that \"President Biden stands against antisemitism and is committed to the safety of the Jewish community, and security of Israel -- Donald Trump does not.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Michelle L.

And we will not forget.\"\n\nBiden, whose relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has grown strained over his government's push to invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah, said American support for Israel is \"iron clad...even when we disagree.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBiden steered clear of the upcoming presidential election in his speech. But his address comes as former President Donald Trump has criticized the incumbent for not doing more to combat antisemitism -- while ignoring his own long history of rhetoric that invokes the language of Nazi Germany and plays on stereotypes of Jews in politics.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Capitol event, hosted by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, also featured remarks from House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nThe campus protests have posed a political challenge for Biden, whose coalition has historically relied on younger voters, many of whom are critical of his public support for Israel.\n\nBiden said \"There's no place on any campus in America\" or any place in America for antisemitism or threats of violence. He added, \"We're not a lawless country -- we are a civil society\"\n\nIn conjunction with Biden's speech, his administration was announcing new steps to combat antisemitism on colleges campuses and beyond. The Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights was sending every school district and college in the nation a letter outlining examples of antisemitism and other hate that could lead to federal civil rights investigations.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security was moving to educate schools and community groups about resources and funding available to promote campus safety and address threats.

Never again.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden would speak to the \"horrors\" of the Hamas attack, and how antisemitism is on the rise globally and at home.\n\n\"And he will speak to how since October 7th, we've seen an alarming rise in antisemitism in the U.S. and our cities, our communities and on our campuses,\" she added.\n\nBiden was expected to steer clear of the upcoming presidential election in his speech. But his address comes as former President Donald Trump has criticized the incumbent for not doing more to combat antisemitism -- while ignoring his own long history of rhetoric that invokes the language of Nazi Germany and plays on stereotypes of Jews in politics.\n\nThe Capitol event, hosted by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, will also feature remarks from House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nThe campus protests have posed a political challenge for Biden, whose coalition has historically relied on younger voters, many of whom are critical of his public support for Israel.\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden would \"reaffirm\" the right to free speech. \"But there is no place on any campus or anywhere for antisemitism,\" she added. \"There is no place for hate speech or threats of violence against the Jewish people.\"\n\nIn conjunction with Biden's speech, his administration was announcing new steps to combat antisemitism on colleges campuses and beyond. The Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights was sending every school district and college in the nation a letter outlining examples of antisemitism and other hate that could lead to federal civil rights investigations.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security was moving to educate schools and community groups about resources and funding available to promote campus safety and address threats. And the State Department's special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism was meeting with technology companies on how to combat the rise in hateful conflict online.\n\nOn Monday, Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris and the first Jewish spouse of a nationally elected American leader, met with Jewish college students at the White House about the administration's efforts to combat antisemitism. He heard students describe their own experiences with hatred, including threats of violence and hate speech, his office said.\n\nTrump's campaign on Monday released a video on Yom Hashoah, Israel's Holocaust remembrance day, that aimed to contrast the 2024 presidential candidates' responses on antisemitism.\n\nThe video shows images of Trump visiting Israel and speeches he has given pledging to stand with Jewish people and confront antisemitism, while showing footage of the protests on campuses and clips of Biden responding to protesters upset with his administration's support for Israel in its war against Hamas.\n\nOne of the clips shows Biden saying, \"They have a point,\" but does not include the next sentence in which Biden said, \"We need to get a lot more care into Gaza.\"\n\nBiden campaign spokesman James Singer said in response that \"President Biden stands against antisemitism and is committed to the safety of the Jewish community, and security of Israel -- Donald Trump does not.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Michelle L.

And we will not forget.\"\n\nMr Biden, whose relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has grown strained over his government's push to invade the southern Gaza city of Rafah, said American support for Israel is \"iron-clad...even when we disagree\".\n\nHe steered clear of the upcoming presidential election in his speech,. but his address comes as former President Donald Trump has criticised him for not doing more to combat antisemitism -- while ignoring his own long history of rhetoric that invokes the language of Nazi Germany and plays on stereotypes of Jews in politics.\n\nThe Capitol event, hosted by the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, also featured remarks from House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nThe campus protests have posed a political challenge for Mr Biden, whose coalition has historically relied on younger voters, many of whom are critical of his public support for Israel.\n\nMr Biden said \"There's no place on any campus in America\" or any place in America for antisemitism or threats of violence.\n\nHe added, \"We're not a lawless country -- we are a civil society\"\n\nIn conjunction with Mr Biden's speech, his administration was announcing new steps to combat antisemitism on college campuses and beyond.\n\nThe Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights was sending every school district and college in the nation a letter outlining examples of antisemitism and other hate that could lead to federal civil rights investigations.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security was moving to educate schools and community groups about resources and funding available to promote campus safety and address threats.\n\nAnd the State Department's special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism was meeting with technology companies on how to combat the rise in hateful conflict online.\n\nOn Monday, Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris and the first Jewish spouse of a nationally elected American leader, met with Jewish college students at the White House about the administration's efforts to combat antisemitism.\n\nHe heard students describe their own experiences with hatred, including threats of violence and hate speech, his office said.\n\nMr Trump's campaign released a video on Monday, on Yom Hashoah, Israel's Holocaust remembrance day, that aimed to contrast the 2024 presidential candidates' responses to antisemitism.\n\nThe video shows images of Mr Trump visiting Israel and speeches he has given pledging to stand with Jewish people and confront antisemitism while showing footage of the protests on campuses and clips of Mr Biden responding to protesters upset with his administration's support for Israel in its war against Hamas.\n\nOne of the clips shows Mr Biden saying, \"They have a point,\" but does not include the next sentence, in which Mr Biden said, \"We need to get a lot more care into Gaza.\"\n\nMr Biden's campaign spokesman James Singer said in response that \"President Biden stands against antisemitism and is committed to the safety of the Jewish community and security of Israel -- Donald Trump does not.\"", "source": {"uri": "andoveradvertiser.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Andover Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type":

Ron DeSantis announced additional tax breaks for Floridians\n\nBiden condemns 'ferocious' rise in antisemitism, says people are 'already forgetting' Hamas' Oct. 7 attack\n\nSpeaking at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's Days of Remembrance ceremony at the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, President Joe Biden denounced a \"ferocious\" rise in antisemitism around the nation, issuing a stark warning that the world is at risk of forgetting the truth about the Holocaust and Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\n\"This ancient hatred of Jews didn't begin with the Holocaust -- it didn't end with the Holocaust either, or even after our victory in World War II,\" Biden said. \"This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness.\"\n\nEvery president dating back to the museum's opening in 1993 has delivered a keynote at a Days of Remembrance ceremony. But this year's event took on new meaning as it came just seven months after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel, which killed about 1,200 people and marked the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust.\n\n\"That hatred was brought to life on Oct. 7 of 2023,\" Biden said on Tuesday. \"On the sacred Jewish holiday of (Simchat Torah), the terrorist group Hamas unleashed the deadliest day of the Jewish people since the Holocaust -- driven by ancient desire to wipe out the Jewish people off the face of the earth.\"\n\nThe president went on to describe how people were \"slaughtered,\" \"massacred at a music festival,\" and \"brutally raped, mutilated, sexually assaulted\" by Hamas that day -- invoking language he used to describe Hamas' actions often in the wake of the attack that has not been used as frequently since.\n\nBiden then warned that the world appears to \"already\" be forgetting what sparked the war in Gaza seven months ago.\n\n\"Now, here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven-and-a-half months later, and people are already forgetting, are already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror,\" Biden said. \"It was Hamas that brutalized Israelis, it was Hamas who took and continues to hold hostages.\"\n\n\"I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget,\" the president said.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the Biden administration announced new steps to build on the first National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, released one year ago. The new actions include a letter sent to school districts and colleges outlining antisemitic discrimination that could lead to investigations and the creation by the Department of Homeland Security of an online campus safety resources guide for schools.\n\nBiden has faced pressure internationally and from some at home over his continued support of Israel as the Palestinian death toll has risen and the humanitarian crisis worsened amid Israel's retaliatory campaign in Gaza.\n\nIn the wake of the killing of seven aid workers for World Central Kitchen by an Israeli strike in Gaza, last month Biden warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that U.S. policy toward the war could change if Israel does not take actions to better address the humanitarian situation and protect civilians, according to the White House.\n\nThis week, Israel appeared to take initial steps to start a long-promised ground invasion of the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where more than a million civilians are sheltering - a move the Biden administration opposes without a plan to protect civilians.\n\nNonetheless, Biden has been steadfast in vocalizing his commitment to Israel's security -- a point he reiterated on Tuesday\n\n\"My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad, even when we disagree,\" Biden said.\n\nThe speech comes amid a rise of antisemitism nationwide in the wake of Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza. A recent report from the Anti-Defamation League showed that incidents of antisemitism reached an all-time high in 2023, with a spike coming in the aftermath of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel.\n\nProtests over Israel and Biden's approach to the war in Gaza have engulfed college campuses in recent weeks, resulting in more than 2,300 arrests and leaving some Jewish students to say they feel unsafe on campus.\n\n\"On college campuses, Jewish students, blocked, attacked, harassed while walking to class,\" Biden said on Tuesday.\n\n\"Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing, ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and Oct. 7, including Hamas' appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize Jews -- its absolutely despicable and it must stop,\" he continued.\n\nAfter facing questions about whether he would address the demonstrations on campuses for days -- particularly after House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., visited Columbia University to condemn the protests and call on Biden to visit himself -- the president delivered brief remarks from the White House on Thursday of last week in which he noted Americans have the right to protest peacefully, but emphasized there is no place for hate in America.\n\n\"Whether it's antisemitism, Islamophobia or discrimination against Arab Americans or Palestinian Americans, it's simply wrong,\" Biden said last week. \"There's no place for racism in America. It's all wrong, it's un-American.\"\n\nJohnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., also spoke at Tuesday's event at the Capitol.\n\nThe remarks came one day after Yom HaShoah -- the Hebrew phrase for Holocaust Remembrance Day -- which commemorates the 6 million Jews murdered by Nazis during the Holocaust.\n\nBiden marked Yom HaShoah in a call with Netanyahu on Monday in which the leaders jointly pledged to \"remember the 6 million Jews who were systematically targeted and murdered in the Holocaust\" and \"forcefully act against antisemitism and all forms of hate-fueled violence,\" according to a readout from the White House.\n\nDeSantis signs bill providing $1.07 billion in tax relief for Floridians\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis signed House Bill 7073 Tuesday, providing $1.07 billion in tax relief for Floridians.\n\nAccording to the governor's office, that number does not include the $450 million in toll relief DeSantis signed last month -- which brings the total of tax savings to $1.5 billion for Fiscal Year 2024-25.\n\nThis year's tax cut package, officials said, is a continuation of Florida's annual tax holidays, which include:\n\nOther tax package savings include:\n\nFor more info on the sales tax holidays, visit the Florida Department of Revenue's Sales Tax Holidays website.\n\nDEA proposes reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule III controlled substance\n\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has proposed reclassifying marijuana from a Schedule I controlled substance to a Schedule III -- which would recognize medical uses of cannabis -- saying it has less potential for abuse than some other drugs.\n\nThe move would not outright legalize marijuana for recreational use.\n\nIn Florida, recreational marijuana is on the ballot in November and advocates are hopeful it could pass.\n\nKelly Parrott is an advocate for Suncoast NORML -- an organization that pushes for the legalization of marijuana -- and says the reclassification is a step in the right direction.\n\n\"Cannabis should have never been a Schedule I,\" Parrott said. \"It's not on the same level as heroin or fentanyl.\"\n\nFlorida Gof. Ron DeSantis has said he is against legalizing marijuana for recreational use because it could lead to reducing the quality of life in the state.\n\n\"I don't want this state to be reeking of marijuana,\" he said. \"We're doing fine -- we don't need to do that.\"\n\nSome of those who oppose reclassification say marijuana remains a gateway drug that could lead to the use of other drugs.\n\nFlorida Attorney General Ashley Moody has argued that the amendment did not change the fact federal law still outlaws recreational marijuana use.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com",

More than 34,000 people have been killed in Gaza since October 7 despite the president's efforts to convince Israel to strike a balance between defending itself and preventing the deaths of Palestinian civilians. While ceasefire talks are ongoing in Doha, Qatar, there is now the looming threat of an Israeli military invasion into the Gazan city of Rafah where many civilians have taken refuge.\n\nBiden will deliver a keynote address Tuesday at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual Days of Remembrance ceremony at the US Capitol, remarks the White House says will honor the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust and \"recommit to heeding the lessons of this dark chapter: Never again.\"\n\nBiden is expected to \"speak to the horrors of October 7,\" as well as the subsequent \"alarming rise in antisemitism\" in the US, according to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.\n\nTuesday's remarks amount to a continuation of the White House's strong condemnation of antisemitism throughout the conflict - but take place in the context of a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and increasingly vocal protesters at home as Biden is trying to keep a splintering 2024 coalition intact.\n\nThe president spoke out forcefully against intensifying antisemitism and Islamophobia in the days after Hamas' attacks on Israel, saying in an October 19 Oval Office address that Americans \"can't stand by and stand silent.\" Yet in the seven months since the war began, Islamophobic and antisemitic incidents have significantly increased.\n\nThe most recent data from the Anti-Defamation League, which has tracked antisemitic incidents in the US since 1979, found a 140% increase in incidents from 2022 to 2023, with a \"dramatic\" increase taking place after October 7. And an ADL report on antisemitic attitudes in America in 2024 found that younger Americans are \"more likely to endorse anti-Jewish tropes.\"\n\n\"We are in a moment of crisis for the Jewish community. With antisemitism already at historic levels and Jewish students facing a tsunami of hate on campuses across the country, there's no more important time for a full-throated condemnation of antisemitism in all forms,\" Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the ADL, said in a statement.\n\nWhile the president has been steadfast in his condemnations of antisemitism, the war in Gaza has made for a politically perilous topic for Biden and his White House as he tries to also show empathy with the conditions Palestinians now face in Gaza. The president has faced protests at nearly every public event outside of the White House in recent months for his support of Israel's war against Hamas, and his handling of the war has been under intense scrutiny since the days after the October 7 attacks.\n\nThe president and his administration now face another potential tipping point in the war. The speech comes as Israel's military has issued a call for residents of the eastern part of the Gazan city of Rafah to \"evacuate immediately,\" raising questions about whether Israel's long-threatened assault on the city will soon be carried out - a move that the Biden administration has strongly cautioned against.\n\nDuring nearly seven months of war, more than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel's destruction of much of northern Gaza. Biden and his top lieutenants have repeatedly and emphatically made clear to their Israeli counterparts that they want to see a clear plan to protect civilians before any troops enter the area. While National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Biden \"again made this clear\" in a Monday call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, it's not clear such a plan has been presented to the US.\n\nConcurrently, Hamas announced Monday that it had agreed to a ceasefire proposal brokered by the Qatari and Egyptian governments, though the proposal appeared to have significant deviations from a proposal that had been formed with Israeli input. The Israeli government was reviewing the Hamas offer on Monday but continued operations in Rafah.\n\nThe speech also comes as the administration is ramping up its response to pro-Palestinian protests over the war that have spread across the nation's colleges and universities, with images of tension and some violence. More than 2,000 people have been arrested on college and university campuses since April 18.\n\nThe president made his most substantive comments on the matter last Thursday, saying he supports the right to protest and freedom of speech but \"order must prevail.\"\n\n\"Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancelation of classes and graduation - none of this is a peaceful protest,\" Biden said. \"Threatening people, intimidating people, instilling fear in people is not peaceful protest. It's against the law.\"\n\nBiden is expected to reaffirm the right to free speech in his speech, Jean-Pierre said, but will emphasize that \"there's no place on any campus or anywhere for antisemitism.\"\n\nAsked by a reporter whether the sentiment on campus has caused him to shift his thinking on the conflict, Biden offered an emphatic, \"No.\"\n\nThe remarks appeared to mark a shift in the administration's response to the protests. A day later, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona sent a letter to college and university presidents condemning \"abhorrent\" incidents of antisemitism on campus and highlighting available resources - a move aimed at further bolstering the administration's public-facing response to the protests.\n\nHe cited specific reports from Jewish students of being physically assaulted or harassed while walking on campus, antisemitic statements, including that Jewish students should \"go back to Poland,\" verbal abuse and swastikas found on dorm room doors.\n\nAnd on Monday, a day ahead of Biden's speech, second gentleman Doug Emhoff hosted a number of Jewish students at the White House for a roundtable. Emhoff, who is the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president and has been a key advocate on the issue, has made addressing antisemitism a cornerstone of his portfolio and has reached out to Jewish campus leaders.\n\nThe speech comes alongside a series of new actions the Biden administration is taking to build on its national strategy to counter antisemitism, the White House announced in a fact sheet.\n\nThe Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights is sending a letter to every school district and college in the country with concrete examples of antisemitic discrimination that could be investigated under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. There are currently 141 open investigations with colleges and universities under Title VI, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is working to \"build an online campus safety resource guide\" to provide \"financial, educational, and technical assistance\" for campuses. DHS is also developing and sharing \"best practices for community-based targeted violence and terrorism prevention,\" the fact sheet said.\n\nAnd the State Department's Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism \"will convene technology firms to identify best practices to address Antisemitic content online,\" the fact sheet said.\n\nBiden's speech comes one day after Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day. To mark the day, Biden's campaign issued a lengthy list of former President Donald Trump's antisemitic comments and behavior, including reports that Trump has allegedly said that Adolf Hitler \"did some good things.\"\n\nStill, Biden's steadfast support for Israel's military offensive in Gaza has eroded some of his support among the young voters he needs months before the general election. A poll by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University's Kennedy School found that only 18% of young voters approve of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com",

It has also left many of the area's 2.3 million people on the brink of starvation, according to aid groups, and sparked protests in the US demanding that universities and the Biden administration withdraw support for Israel.\n\nOn Monday, Israel vowed to press ahead with an offensive in Rafah, Hamas's last major stronghold in the Strip, amid international warnings that with over a million displaced Gazans having fled to the southern city, the operation would unleash new misery for Palestinians. Israel has said it will act to evacuate and avoid harm to civilians amid any offensive.\n\nMany Jewish Americans have been critical of Israel's Gaza campaign, leading protests against actions of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government and condemning Netanyahu in Congress.\n\nLaw enforcement and advocacy groups, meanwhile, report a sharp rise in antisemitic attacks in the United States since October 7, as well as anti-Muslim attacks. Some Americans favor zero-tolerance policies defining antisemitism broadly, while others see the threat of attacks against Jews being used to limit legitimate criticism of US support for Israel.\n\n\"Antisemitism is reaching crisis levels in our country,\" said Carol Ann Schwartz, national president of Hadassah, a women's Zionist organization that has been consulted by the White House.\n\n\"Right now, we need our leaders to not only acknowledge the pain people are feeling, but also to actively confront the anti-Israel and anti-Zionist misinformation and lies being propagated on college campuses and beyond, which have made Jews a target.\"\n\nBiden, who has mostly avoided addressing campus demonstrations or protesters over his support for Israel that have dogged him for months, will speak about the subject for the second time in five days on Tuesday. He will condemn the rise in antisemitism while affirming support for free speech, his spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Monday.\n\n\"Passions are high. The issue is being heavily politicized. There's a lot of tension. So this is a very important moment for the president to step forward,\" said Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of liberal advocacy group J Street, who has also been consulted by the White House.\n\nIt's also a key political moment for Biden, who is in a tight race with Republican rival Donald Trump. Biden may be losing crucial support from young and liberal Democrats over his support for Israel, Democrats say. But he could also lose voters supportive of the Jewish state if he skews in the other direction.\n\nBiden pledged to unite the country and said he was inspired to run by Trump's response to the 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, white nationalist rally, where marchers chanted \"Jews will not replace us.\" Biden governs a country no less divided than when he took office in 2021, most statistics show.\n\nThe FBI reported a 36% increase in anti-Jewish hate crime incidents between 2021 and 2022, the latest year for which data is available, as well as a jump in crimes against Black Americans and gay men.\n\nThe Secure Community Network (SCN), an American Jewish security organization that monitors hate incidents, has referred more than 504 individuals to law enforcement though March this year, faster than last year's pace, including threats at colleges.\n\n\"This is a scary time to be Jewish -- it's important for the president to rise to this challenge,\" said SCN CEO Michael Masters.\n\nBiden also discussed antisemitism in a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, during which he pushed for Israel not to invade Rafah, according to a readout of the conversation.\n\nThe two leaders discussed the \"shared commitment\" of Israel and the US to remember the six million Jews killed during the Holocaust by Nazi Germany \"and to forcefully act against antisemitism and all forms of hate-fueled violence,\" it said.\n\nCampus protest politics\n\nTrump has sought to exploit Democratic divisions over Israel's response and widening college protests to improve Republicans' lot with Jewish voters, who traditionally vote Democratic.\n\nPolice crackdowns on some campuses have given ammunition to Trump's long-running claim that US cities are under siege from violent crime, illegal migration and out-of-control leftist policies.\n\nTrump and the Republican Party have argued that the protests are driven by antisemitism and that Biden has failed to protect Jewish students on campus.\n\nSome of the protests have involved antisemitic chants and threats toward Jewish students and supporters of Israel. Jews say the term \"Zionist\" is increasingly used broadly as an ostensible slur against them. Many of the protesters appear to reject Jews' right to self-determination in Israel, a position the majority of US Jews adhere to.\n\n\"Jewish Americans are realizing that the Democrat Party has turned into a full-blown anti-Israel, antisemitic, pro-terrorist cabal, and that's why more and more Jewish Americans are supporting President Trump,\" said Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson.\n\nAbout seven in 10 US Jewish voters support Democrats, while three in 10 are Republican-aligned, according to the Pew Research Center. Many political analysts say Jewish voters join other Americans in rarely voting primarily on foreign policy issues.\n\nKenneth Stern, director of the Bard Center for the Study of Hate, who helped craft a modern \"working definition of antisemitism,\" said the word is being misused to stifle protected speech about Israel.\n\nThe US House of Representatives passed a bill last week that would apply the definition Stern helped develop to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws on college campuses. Stern opposes the bill.\n\n\"I don't think that you can combat hatred of any type effectively with weak democratic institutions,\" said Stern. \"When we have a government that decides it's going to stop certain things from being said, that creates an opportunity for totalitarianism, authoritarianism, and that's never good for the Jews.\"\n\nProponents of the bill argue some speech has crossed over from freedom of expression to hate and incitement, encouraging discrimination and harassment targeted toward Jews.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times

More than 34,000 people have been killed in Gaza since October 7 despite the president's efforts to convince Israel to strike a balance between defending itself and preventing the deaths of Palestinian civilians. While ceasefire talks are ongoing in Doha, Qatar, there is now the looming threat of an Israeli military invasion into the Gazan city of Rafah where many civilians have taken refuge.\n\nBiden will deliver a keynote address Tuesday at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual Days of Remembrance ceremony at the US Capitol, remarks the White House says will honor the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust and \"recommit to heeding the lessons of this dark chapter: Never again.\"\n\nBiden is expected to \"speak to the horrors of October 7,\" as well as the subsequent \"alarming rise in antisemitism\" in the US, according to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.\n\nTuesday's remarks amount to a continuation of the White House's strong condemnation of antisemitism throughout the conflict - but take place in the context of a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and increasingly vocal protesters at home as Biden is trying to keep a splintering 2024 coalition intact.\n\nThe president spoke out forcefully against intensifying antisemitism and Islamophobia in the days after Hamas' attacks on Israel, saying in an October 19 Oval Office address that Americans \"can't stand by and stand silent.\" Yet in the seven months since the war began, Islamophobic and antisemitic incidents have significantly increased.\n\nThe most recent data from the Anti-Defamation League, which has tracked antisemitic incidents in the US since 1979, found a 140% increase in incidents from 2022 to 2023, with a \"dramatic\" increase taking place after October 7. And an ADL report on antisemitic attitudes in America in 2024 found that younger Americans are \"more likely to endorse anti-Jewish tropes.\"\n\n\"We are in a moment of crisis for the Jewish community. With antisemitism already at historic levels and Jewish students facing a tsunami of hate on campuses across the country, there's no more important time for a full-throated condemnation of antisemitism in all forms,\" Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the ADL, said in a statement.\n\nWhile the president has been steadfast in his condemnations of antisemitism, the war in Gaza has made for a politically perilous topic for Biden and his White House as he tries to also show empathy with the conditions Palestinians now face in Gaza. The president has faced protests at nearly every public event outside of the White House in recent months for his support of Israel's war against Hamas, and his handling of the war has been under intense scrutiny since the days after the October 7 attacks.\n\nThe president and his administration now face another potential tipping point in the war. The speech comes as Israel's military has issued a call for residents of the eastern part of the Gazan city of Rafah to \"evacuate immediately,\" raising questions about whether Israel's long-threatened assault on the city will soon be carried out - a move that the Biden administration has strongly cautioned against.\n\nDuring nearly seven months of war, more than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel's destruction of much of northern Gaza. Biden and his top lieutenants have repeatedly and emphatically made clear to their Israeli counterparts that they want to see a clear plan to protect civilians before any troops enter the area. While National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Biden \"again made this clear\" in a Monday call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, it's not clear such a plan has been presented to the US.\n\nConcurrently, Hamas announced Monday that it had agreed to a ceasefire proposal brokered by the Qatari and Egyptian governments, though the proposal appeared to have significant deviations from a proposal that had been formed with Israeli input. The Israeli government was reviewing the Hamas offer on Monday but continued operations in Rafah.\n\nThe speech also comes as the administration is ramping up its response to pro-Palestinian protests over the war that have spread across the nation's colleges and universities, with images of tension and some violence. More than 2,000 people have been arrested on college and university campuses since April 18.\n\nThe president made his most substantive comments on the matter last Thursday, saying he supports the right to protest and freedom of speech but \"order must prevail.\"\n\n\"Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancelation of classes and graduation - none of this is a peaceful protest,\" Biden said. \"Threatening people, intimidating people, instilling fear in people is not peaceful protest. It's against the law.\"\n\nBiden is expected to reaffirm the right to free speech in his speech, Jean-Pierre said, but will emphasize that \"there's no place on any campus or anywhere for antisemitism.\"\n\nAsked by a reporter whether the sentiment on campus has caused him to shift his thinking on the conflict, Biden offered an emphatic, \"No.\"\n\nThe remarks appeared to mark a shift in the administration's response to the protests. A day later, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona sent a letter to college and university presidents condemning \"abhorrent\" incidents of antisemitism on campus and highlighting available resources - a move aimed at further bolstering the administration's public-facing response to the protests.\n\nHe cited specific reports from Jewish students of being physically assaulted or harassed while walking on campus, antisemitic statements, including that Jewish students should \"go back to Poland,\" verbal abuse and swastikas found on dorm room doors.\n\nAnd on Monday, a day ahead of Biden's speech, second gentleman Doug Emhoff hosted a number of Jewish students at the White House for a roundtable. Emhoff, who is the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president and has been a key advocate on the issue, has made addressing antisemitism a cornerstone of his portfolio and has reached out to Jewish campus leaders.\n\nThe speech comes alongside a series of new actions the Biden administration is taking to build on its national strategy to counter antisemitism, the White House announced in a fact sheet.\n\nThe Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights is sending a letter to every school district and college in the country with concrete examples of antisemitic discrimination that could be investigated under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. There are currently 141 open investigations with colleges and universities under Title VI, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is working to \"build an online campus safety resource guide\" to provide \"financial, educational, and technical assistance\" for campuses. DHS is also developing and sharing \"best practices for community-based targeted violence and terrorism prevention,\" the fact sheet said.\n\nAnd the State Department's Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism \"will convene technology firms to identify best practices to address Antisemitic content online,\" the fact sheet said.\n\nBiden's speech comes one day after Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day. To mark the day, Biden's campaign issued a lengthy list of former President Donald Trump's antisemitic comments and behavior, including reports that Trump has allegedly said that Adolf Hitler \"did some good things.\"\n\nStill, Biden's steadfast support for Israel's military offensive in Gaza has eroded some of his support among the young voters he needs months before the general election. A poll by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University's Kennedy School found that only 18% of young voters approve of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Biden claims this is one of the deadliest waves of anti-semitism against the Jews since the Holocaust.\n\nHis speech comes as Israel's retaliation has killed 35,000 people in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, according to Gaza health authorities, leaving many of the area's 2.3 million people on the brink of starvation and sparking protests in the US demanding that universities and the Biden administration withdraw support for Israel. On Monday, Israel vowed to press ahead with an offensive against Rafah in the south that threatens to unleash new misery for Palestinians.\n\nSpeaking at the Capitol, in a keynote address for the US. Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual National Commemoration of the Days of Remembrance, Biden will aim to cool an increasingly divided and divisive US debate about Jewish security, Zionism, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel.\n\nMany Jewish Americans have been critical of Israel's Gaza attacks, leading protests against actions of right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government and condemning Netanyahu in Congress.\n\nLaw enforcement and advocacy groups, meanwhile, report a sharp rise in antisemitic attacks in the United States since Oct. 7, as well anti-Muslim attacks. Some Americans favor zero-tolerance policies defining antisemitism broadly, others see the threat of attacks against Jews being used to limit legitimate criticism of US support for Israel.\n\nBiden, who has mostly avoided addressing campus demonstrations or protesters over his support for Israel that have dogged him for months, will speak about the subject for the second time in five days on Tuesday. He will condemn a rise in antisemitism while affirming support for free speech, his spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Monday.\n\n\"Passions are high. The issue is being heavily politicized. There's a lot of tension. So this is a very important moment for the president to step forward,\" said Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of liberal advocacy group J Street, who has also been consulted by the White House.\n\nIt's also a key political moment for Biden, who is in a tight race with Republican rival Donald Trump. Biden may be losing crucial support from young and liberal Democrats over his support for Israel, Democrats say.\n\nBiden pledged to unite the country and said he was inspired to run by Trump's response to the 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, white nationalist rally, where marchers chanted \"Jews will not replace us.\" Biden governs a country no less divided than when he took office in 2021, most statistics show.\n\nThe FBI reported a 36% increase in anti-Jewish hate crime incidents between 2021 and 2022, the latest year for which data is available, as well as a jump in crimes against Black Americans and gay men.\n\nThe Secure Community Network (SCN), an American Jewish security organization that monitors hate incidents, has referred more than 504 individuals to law enforcement though March this year, faster than last year's pace, including threats at colleges.\n\n\"This is a scary time to be Jewish - it's important for the president to rise to this challenge,\" said SCN CEO Michael Masters.\n\nCampus Protest Politics\n\nTrump has sought to exploit Democratic divisions over Israel's response and widening college protests to improve Republican's lot with Jewish voters, who traditionally vote Democratic.\n\nPolice crackdowns on some campuses have given ammunition to Trump's long-running claim that US cities are under siege from violent crime, illegal migration and out-of-control leftist policies.\n\nTrump and the Republican Party have argued that the protests are driven by antisemitism and that Biden has failed to protect Jewish students on campus.\n\nAbout seven in 10 U.S. Jewish voters support Democrats, while three in 10 are Republican-aligned, according to the Pew Research Center. Many political analysts say Jewish voters join other Americans in rarely voting primarily on foreign policy issues.\n\nKenneth Stern, director of the Bard Center for the Study of Hate, who helped craft a modern \"working definition of antisemitism,\" said the word is being misused to stifle protected speech about Israel.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill last week that would apply the definition Stern helped develop to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws on college campuses. Stern opposes the bill.\n\n\"I don't think that you can combat hatred of any type effectively with weak democratic institutions,\" said Stern. \"When we have a government that decides it's going to stop certain things from being said, that creates an opportunity for totalitarianism, authoritarianism, and that's never good for the Jews.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news",

Biden's speech comes at a critical time: Israel has sent tanks into Rafah and taken control of the Gaza side of a crossing to Egypt that is a major conduit for humanitarian aid. And, in the U.S., college campuses have been rocked by pro-Palestinian protests with some schools canceling commencement addresses as the demonstrates grow anti-semitic.\n\n'You can expect the president to make clear that during these sacred days of remembrance, we honor the memory of the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust and recommit to heeding the lessons of this dark chapter. Never again,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday. The president has struggled to balance his support for Israel after the October 7th attack by Hamas - the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust - with his efforts to protect the civilian population of Palestine.\n\nAbout a million refugees have crowded into Rafah. Biden on Monday warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against a full-scale assault on the area but Israeli forces moved forward anyway. Progressives have urged the president to do more to help the Palestinian refugees. And young voters, a key constituency for Biden, have expressed their dissatisfaction with the war. As the issue grows more contested, some protests on campuses have started to feature antisemitic chants and threats toward Jewish students.\n\nBiden will address the issue. The president 'will speak to how since October 7th, we've seen an alarming rise in antisemitism in the U.S. and our cities, our communities and on our campuses,' Jean-Pierre said. About 35,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to health authorities. And many of the area's 2.3 million people on the brink of starvation, with the UN worried about famine conditions. Biden himself has faced protesters at his public events with many of them calling him 'Genocide Joe.'\n\nHe has spoken little on the protesters that follow him and those who have been disrupting college campuses. More than 2,000 people have been arrested on university campuses since April 18. 'There's the right to protest but not the right to cause chaos,' he said last week in his first in-depth remarks on the matter. 'People have the right to get an education, the right to get a degree, the right to walk across the campus safely without fear of being attacked.' Biden will speak at the Capitol building in a keynote address for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual National Commemoration of the Days of Remembrance.\n\nIn conjunction with his speech, his administration is highlighting its actions to combat antisemitism. The Department of Education is sending every school district and college in the nation a letter outlining examples of antisemitism and other hate that could lead to federal civil rights investigations. Since the Oct. 7 attack, the department has opened more than 100 investigations into complaints about antisemitism and other forms of discrimination under Title VI.\n\nOn Monday, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, met with Jewish college students at the White House about the administration's efforts to combat antisemitism. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security is working to 'build an online campus safety resource guide' to provide 'financial, educational, and technical assistance' for campuses, according to a White House fact sheet And the State Department's Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism 'will convene technology firms to identify best practices to address Antisemitic content online,' the fact sheet said.\n\nBiden's Republican rival in the presidential race, Donald Trump, has looked to take advantage of Democratic divisions over Israel's response to improve the GOP's chances with Jewish voters, who traditionally vote Democratic. 'Jewish Americans are realizing that the Democrat Party has turned into a full-blown anti-Israel, antisemitic, pro-terrorist cabal, and that's why more and more Jewish Americans are supporting President Trump,' Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson, told Reuters. About seven in 10 U.S. Jewish voters support Democrats, while three in 10 are Republican-aligned, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nIn response, Biden's campaign has issued a lengthy list of Trump's antisemitic comments and behavior, including reports that Trump has allegedly said that Adolf Hitler 'did some good things.' But polls show young voters are unhappy with the president. A survey by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University's Kennedy School found that only 18% of young voters approve of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

It was Hamas who brutalized Israelis. It was Hamas who took and continues to hold hostages. I have not forgotten, nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\nThe high-profile remarks came at a fraught political moment, as a possible Israeli invasion of Rafah looms and college protests against the war in Gaza are unfolding across the U.S.\n\nBiden has faced criticism from Republicans and Democrats as he's tried to balance unwavering support for Israel's security with sympathy for the Palestinians killed and suffering in Gaza.\n\nBut his message Tuesday largely focused on his staunch support for Israel and condemnation of the atrocities against Jews witnessed on Oct. 7 as well as the harassment of the community in the months since -- including incidents on college campuses, propaganda on social media and more.\n\n\"To the Jewish community I want you to know I see your fear, your hurt, your pain. Let me reassure you as your president, you're not alone,\" Biden said. \"My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad even when we disagree.\"\n\nAt least 1,700 Israelis have been killed and 8,700 others injured by Hamas or other Palestinian militants, according to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Since Oct. 7, Israeli military operations have killed more than 34,000 people in Gaza and injured more than 78,000 others, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health.\n\nBiden did not directly comment on Gaza or the humanitarian crisis unfolding for Palestinians in his speech. On campus protests, Biden again emphasized the right to free speech but spoke out against instances were Jewish students have been \"blocked, harassed or attacked while walking to class.\"\n\n\"I understand people have strong belief and deep convictions about the world,\" he said. \"In America, we respect and protect the fundamental right to free speech, to debate and disagree, to protest peacefully and make our voices heard.\"\n\n\"But there is no place on any campus in America [or] any place in America for antisemitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind whether against Jews or anyone else,\" Biden continued.\n\nTuesday's remembrance ceremony also featured remarks by House Speaker Mike Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nBiden's faced heavy criticism from Republicans over the campus unrest, with many conservative lawmakers blasting his response as insufficient. Overall, GOP lawmakers have seized on the protests to further their narrative of \"chaos\" under the Biden administration and to show their strong support for Israel.\n\nJohnson used his remarks to continue criticism of the campus unrest, going so far as to compare them to antisemitic activity at German institutions of higher learning during World War II.\n\n\"We remember what happened then and now today we are witnessing American universities quickly becoming hostile places for Jewish students and faculty,\" he said. \"The very campuses which were once the envy of the international academy have succumbed to an antisemitic virus.\"\n\n\"Now is a time for moral clarity and we must put an end to this madness,\" Johnson said.\n\nJeffries said antisemitism and other forms of hate speech was not a \"Democratic issue or Republican issue\" but \"an American issue.\"\n\n\"We must crush antisemitism along with racism, sexism, Islamophobia, xenophobia, homophobia and all other forms of hatred together,\" Jeffries said.\n\nThe White House on Tuesday also announced new actions intended to combat the rise in antisemitism, including on college campuses.\n\nThey include directing the Department of Education to issue new guidance to school districts and universities providing examples of antisemitism and other forms of hate that trigger Title VI investigations; the creation of a website by the Department of Homeland Security and partners that includes campus safety resources; and working with technology firms to address antisemitic content online.\n\n\"We've seen a ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world,\" Biden said in his speech, adding it is \"absolutely despicable and it must stop.\"", "source": {"uri": "weisradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

'I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget,' the president said during remarks at a Holocaust remembrance ceremony at the U.S. Capitol . 'As Jews around the world still cope with the atrocities and trauma of that day and its aftermath, we've seen a ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world,' he noted.\n\nBiden's speech on Capitol Hill on Tuesday came as he tries to balance his support for Israel 's war with concern for the citizens of Gaza and amid tension in his relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netnayahu. He spoke at a critical time: Israel has sent tanks into Rafah and taken control of the Gaza side of a crossing to Egypt that is a major conduit for humanitarian aid. And, in the U.S., college campuses have been rocked by pro-Palestinian protests with some schools canceling commencement addresses as the demonstrates grow anti-semitic.\n\nThe president, in a forceful speech greeted with several rounds of applause, vowed to support Israel's right to exist 'even when we disagree.' He began his remarks by tracing the rise of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany in 1933, noting the dictator rose to 'power by rekindling one of the world's oldest forms of prejudice and hate- antisemitism' through propoganda and ecnoomic hardship. 'We recommit to heading the lessons of one of the darkest chapters in human history, revitalize and realize the responsibility of never again,' he noted.\n\nAnd, he pointed out, 'the truth is, we're at risk of people not knowing the truth.' 'Now, here we are not 75. years later, but just seven and a half months later,' he added in reference to the October 7th attack on Israel by Hamas - the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust 'People are already forgetting - already forgetting - that Hamas unleashed this terror,' he said and vowed: 'I have not forgotten nor have you. And we will not forget.'\n\nHe wore a dark suit and tie during his keynote address at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual National Commemoration of the Days of Remembrance. The audience was filled with members of Congress, Jewish leaders and survivors of the Holocaust. The president has struggled to balance his support for Israel with his efforts to protect the civilian population of Palestine. About a million refugees have crowded into Rafah. Biden on Monday warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against a full-scale assault on the area but Israeli forces moved forward anyway.\n\nProgressives have urged the president to do more to help the Palestinian refugees. And young voters, a key constituency for Biden, have expressed their dissatisfaction with the war. As the issue grows more contested, some protests on campuses have started to feature antisemitic chants and threats toward Jewish students. Biden defended Americans' right to free speech but said violence had no place in the country. 'There's no place on any campus in America - any place in America - for antisemitism or threats of violence of any time - whether against Jews or anyone else,' he said.\n\n'Destroying property - it's not peaceful protest. It's against the law. We're not a lawless country. We're civil society.' 'We know scapegoating and demonizing any minority is a threat to every minority, and to the very foundation of our democracy.' He then reiterated his committment to Israel. 'To the Jewish community, I want you to know, I see your fear, your hurt, your pain. Let me reassure as your president, you're not alone. You belong. You always have and always will. My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent state is ironclad, even when we disagree,' he said.\n\n'That's why I call on all Americans stand united against antisemitism and hate in all its forms.' About 35,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to health authorities. And many of the area's 2.3 million people on the brink of starvation, with the UN worried about famine conditions. Biden himself has faced protesters at his public events with many of them calling him 'Genocide Joe.' He has spoken little on the protesters that follow him and those who have been disrupting college campuses. More than 2,000 people have been arrested on university campuses since April 18.\n\n'There's the right to protest but not the right to cause chaos,' he said last week in his first in-depth remarks on the matter. 'People have the right to get an education, the right to get a degree, the right to walk across the campus safely without fear of being attacked.' In conjunction with Biden's speech, his administration is highlighting its actions to combat antisemitism. The Department of Education is sending every school district and college in the nation a letter outlining examples of antisemitism and other hate that could lead to federal civil rights investigations. Since the Oct. 7 attack, the department has opened more than 100 investigations into complaints about antisemitism and other forms of discrimination under Title VI.\n\nOn Monday, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, met with Jewish college students at the White House about the administration's efforts to combat antisemitism. Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security is working to 'build an online campus safety resource guide' to provide 'financial, educational, and technical assistance' for campuses, according to a White House fact sheet And the State Department's Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism 'will convene technology firms to identify best practices to address Antisemitic content online,' the fact sheet said. Biden's Republican rival in the presidential race, Donald Trump, has looked to take advantage of Democratic divisions over Israel's response to improve the GOP's chances with Jewish voters, who traditionally vote Democratic.\n\n'Jewish Americans are realizing that the Democrat Party has turned into a full-blown anti-Israel, antisemitic, pro-terrorist cabal, and that's why more and more Jewish Americans are supporting President Trump,' Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson, told Reuters. About seven in 10 U.S. Jewish voters support Democrats, while three in 10 are Republican-aligned, according to the Pew Research Center. In response, Biden's campaign has issued a lengthy list of Trump's antisemitic comments and behavior, including reports that Trump has allegedly said that Adolf Hitler 'did some good things.' But polls show young voters are unhappy with the president. A survey by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University's Kennedy School found that only 18% of young voters approve of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Yesterday, Israel vowed to press ahead with an offensive against Rafah in the south that threatens to unleash new misery for Palestinians.\n\nSpeaking at the Capitol, in a keynote address for the US Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual National Commemoration of the Days of Remembrance, Biden will aim to cool an increasingly divided and divisive US debate about Jewish security, Zionism, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel.\n\nMany Jewish Americans have been critical of Israel's Gaza attacks, leading protests against actions of right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government and condemning Netanyahu in Congress.\n\nLaw enforcement and advocacy groups, meanwhile, report a sharp rise in antisemitic attacks in the United States since Oct. 7, as well anti-Muslim attacks. Some Americans favor zero-tolerance policies defining antisemitism broadly, others see the threat of attacks against Jews being used to limit legitimate criticism of US support for Israel.\n\n\"Antisemitism is reaching crisis levels in our country,\" said Carol Ann Schwartz, national president of Hadassah, a women's Zionist organization that has been consulted by the White House.\n\n\"Right now, we need our leaders to not only acknowledge the pain people are feeling, but also to actively confront the anti-Israel and anti-Zionist misinformation and lies being propagated on college campuses and beyond, which have made Jews a target.\"\n\nBiden, who has mostly avoided addressing campus demonstrations or protesters over his support for Israel that have dogged him for months, will speak about the subject for the second time in five days today. He will condemn a rise in antisemitism while affirming support for free speech, his spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters yesterday.\n\n\"Passions are high. The issue is being heavily politicised. There's a lot of tension. So this is a very important moment for the president to step forward,\" said Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of liberal advocacy group J Street, who has also been consulted by the White House.\n\nIt's also a key political moment for Biden, who is in a tight race with Republican rival Donald Trump. Biden may be losing crucial support from young and liberal Democrats over his support for Israel, Democrats say.\n\nBiden pledged to unite the country and said he was inspired to run by Trump's response to the 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, white nationalist rally, where marchers chanted \"Jews will not replace us.\" Biden governs a country no less divided than when he took office in 2021, most statistics show.\n\nThe FBI reported a 36% increase in anti-Jewish hate crime incidents between 2021 and 2022, the latest year for which data is available, as well as a jump in crimes against Black Americans and gay men.\n\nThe Secure Community Network (SCN), an American Jewish security organization that monitors hate incidents, has referred more than 504 individuals to law enforcement though March this year, faster than last year's pace, including threats at colleges.\n\n\"This is a scary time to be Jewish - it's important for the president to rise to this challenge,\" said SCN CEO Michael Masters.\n\nCampus protest politics\n\nTrump has sought to exploit Democratic divisions over Israel's response and widening college protests to improve Republican's lot with Jewish voters, who traditionally vote Democratic.\n\nPolice crackdowns on some campuses have given ammunition to Trump's long-running claim that US cities are under siege from violent crime, illegal migration and out-of-control leftist policies.\n\nTrump and the Republican Party have argued that the protests are driven by antisemitism and that Biden has failed to protect Jewish students on campus.\n\n\"Jewish Americans are realizing that the Democrat Party has turned into a full-blown anti-Israel, antisemitic, pro-terrorist cabal, and that's why more and more Jewish Americans are supporting President Trump,\" said Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson.\n\nAbout seven in 10 US Jewish voters support Democrats, while three in 10 are Republican-aligned, according to the Pew Research Center. Many political analysts say Jewish voters join other Americans in rarely voting primarily on foreign policy issues.\n\nKenneth Stern, director of the Bard Center for the Study of Hate, who helped craft a modern \"working definition of antisemitism,\" said the word is being misused to stifle protected speech about Israel.\n\nThe US House of Representatives passed a bill last week that would apply the definition Stern helped develop to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws on college campuses. Stern opposes the bill.\n\n\"I don't think that you can combat hatred of any type effectively with weak democratic institutions,\" said Stern. \"When we have a government that decides it's going to stop certain things from being said, that creates an opportunity for totalitarianism, authoritarianism, and that's never good for the Jews.\" -- Reuters", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com",

They share their love story on Holocaust Remembrance Day\n\nWASHINGTON -- Seven months after Hamas launched the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust, President Joe Biden will be tasked with delivering one of the most high-stakes, closely watched speeches when he addresses the Holocaust memorial ceremony at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nHis remarks also fall squarely seven months from an Election Day where Biden is trying put together a coalition of young, Black, Muslim and progressive voters that sent him to the White House. But many no longer see eye-to eye with his stance in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nWith Biden at the Holocaust commemoration will be Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana who dashed for Columbia University two weeks ago as anti-Gaza war protests and record antisemitism began unsettling college campuses. President Biden's charge will be two-fold: Assuage the fears of Jewish American voters and offer reassurance to them while acknowledging the sense of betrayal felt by his base as he continues to support Israel with military aid.\n\nIn his address, Biden will talk about the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel that led to the \"deadliest day for Jewish people since the Holocaust\" and a surge in antisemitism, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters.\n\nThe president will speak to the \"horrors of October 7th,\" and how \"we've seen an alarming rise in antisemitism in the US and our cities, our communities, and our on our campuses,\" said Jean-Pierre.\n\nThe speech will be delivered during the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's Annual Days of Remembrance ceremony, which occurs the day after Israel's Yom HaShoah or Holocaust Remembrance Day to commemorate the six million Jews murdered by Nazis during World War II.\n\nOn Oct. 7, Islamist terrorist group Hamas killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took about 250 more as hostages. In the seven months since, Israel's retaliatory attacks have killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nThe war has also unleashed a humanitarian crisis. About 1.1 million people in Gaza - half of the population - have completely exhausted their food supplies and coping capacities and are struggling with catastrophic hunger and starvation, according to the U.N' s World Food Program.\n\nIn recent weeks, protests over Israel's war on Gaza have engulfed college campuses with \"Gaza Solidarity Encampments\" springing up coast-to-coast demanding an immediate cease-fire. Meanwhile, Jewish students across the country are reporting a rise in antisemitism.\n\nBiden faces commemorating the biggest massacre of Jewish people at a time when Jewish students on college campuses are feeling unsafe. All the while, key voting blocs have said they believe Israel is perpetrating a \"genocide\" against thousands of Palestinians in Gaza. Chants of \"Genocide Joe has got to go!\" has been a common refrain at college protests across the country.\n\nAfter an initial deal in November, the U.S. has been unsuccessful in brokering a second deal between Israel and Hamas. On Monday, Hamas announced it would accept a cease-fire proposal that was negotiated in Egypt without Israeli involvement surprising the Biden administration.\n\nState Department spokesman Matt Miller said the Biden administration was reviewing the Hamas announcement and \"will be discussing this response with our partners over the coming hours.\"\n\nIsrael said it would dispatch negotiators to Cairo to discuss an agreement they would be willing to sign. However, Israel began striking targets near Rafah, which has been a point of contention between the Biden administration and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"You can expect the president to make clear that during these sacred days of remembrance, we honor the memory of the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust, and we recommit to heeding the lessons of this dark chapter Never again,\" said Jean-Pierre, during the White House press briefing on Monday. \"He will speak to the horrors of October 7th, when Hamas unleashed the deadliest day for Jewish people since the Holocaust.\"\n\nThe Anti Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy group, recorded 732 campus-based antisemitic incidents between October 7 and the end of 2023 alone. It was 1,062% higher than the same two-month period in 2022, when ADL recorded only 63 incidents.\n\nBiden's speech comes on the heels of former President Donald Trump accusing Biden of running a \"Gestapo administration,\" a reference to Nazi Germany at a private campaign fundraiser over the weekend.\n\nThe comments followed Trump complaining that the multiple indictments against him were politically motivated.\n\n\"These people are running a Gestapo administration. And it's the only thing they have,\" And it's the only way they're going to win, in their opinion, and it's actually killing them. But it doesn't bother me.\"\n\nWhite House spokesperson Andrew Bates said the president is focused on bringing Americans together, \"instead of echoing the appalling rhetoric of fascists, lunching with Neo Nazis, and fanning debunked conspiracy theories that have cost brave police officer their lives.\"\n\nBut Biden must strike a delicate balance. Young Americans are more likely to sympathize with the Palestinians than the Israeli peoples, according to a new Pew report. A third of adults under 30 say their sympathies lie either entirely or mostly with the Palestinian people, while 14% say their sympathies lie entirely or mostly with the Israeli people.\n\nA Gallup survey released March 27, showed 55% of all Americans disapprove of Israel's military action. That includes 75% of Democrats, which is up from the 63% who said the same last November.\n\n\"At this time of alarming antisemitism and Holocaust denial, remembering the history and lessons of the Holocaust is crucial,\" Stuart E. Eizenstat, chairman of the Holocaust museum said in a statement. \"The combined presence of these leaders is an important statement to our nation at this very challenging moment.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yom HaShoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_(Polish_trade_union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solidarity (Polish trade union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Programme", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Food Programme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_E._Eizenstat", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuart E.

And we will not forget,' Biden told Jewish leaders\n\nBiden's speech on Capitol Hill on Tuesday came as he tries to balance his support for Israel's war with concern for the citizens of Gaza and amid tension in his relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netnayahu.\n\nHe spoke at a critical time: Israel has sent tanks into Rafah and taken control of the Gaza side of a crossing to Egypt that is a major conduit for humanitarian aid. And, in the U.S., college campuses have been rocked by pro-Palestinian protests with some schools canceling commencement addresses as the demonstrates grow anti-semitic.\n\nThe president, in a forceful speech greeted with several rounds of applause, vowed to support Israel's right to exist 'even when we disagree.'\n\nHe began his remarks by tracing the rise of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany in 1933, noting the dictator rose to 'power by rekindling one of the world's oldest forms of prejudice and hate- antisemitism' through propoganda and ecnoomic hardship.\n\n'We recommit to heading the lessons of one of the darkest chapters in human history, revitalize and realize the responsibility of never again,' he noted.\n\nAnd, he pointed out, 'the truth is, we're at risk of people not knowing the truth.'\n\n'Now, here we are not 75. years later, but just seven and a half months later,' he added in reference to the October 7th attack on Israel by Hamas - the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust\n\n'People are already forgetting - already forgetting - that Hamas unleashed this terror,' he said and vowed: 'I have not forgotten nor have you. And we will not forget.'\n\nHe wore a dark suit and tie during his keynote address at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual National Commemoration of the Days of Remembrance. The audience was filled with members of Congress, Jewish leaders and survivors of the Holocaust.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, House Speaker Mike Johnson, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries hold images of Holocaust victims during the annual Days of Remembrance ceremony for Holocaust survivors at the US Capitol\n\nSmoke rises from shopping center following Israeli airstrike on east of Rafah, Gaza\n\nThe president has struggled to balance his support for Israel with his efforts to protect the civilian population of Palestine.\n\nAbout a million refugees have crowded into Rafah. Biden on Monday warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against a full-scale assault on the area but Israeli forces moved forward anyway.\n\nProgressives have urged the president to do more to help the Palestinian refugees.\n\nAnd young voters, a key constituency for Biden, have expressed their dissatisfaction with the war.\n\nAs the issue grows more contested, some protests on campuses have started to feature antisemitic chants and threats toward Jewish students.\n\nBiden defended Americans' right to free speech but said violence had no place in the country.\n\n'There's no place on any campus in America - any place in America - for antisemitism or threats of violence of any time - whether against Jews or anyone else,' he said.\n\n'Destroying property - it's not peaceful protest. It's against the law. We're not a lawless country. We're civil society.'\n\n'We know scapegoating and demonizing any minority is a threat to every minority, and to the very foundation of our democracy.'\n\nHe then reiterated his committment to Israel.\n\n'To the Jewish community, I want you to know, I see your fear, your hurt, your pain. Let me reassure as your president, you're not alone. You belong. You always have and always will. My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent state is ironclad, even when we disagree,' he said.\n\n'That's why I call on all Americans stand united against antisemitism and hate in all its forms.'\n\nAbout 35,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to health authorities. And many of the area's 2.3 million people on the brink of starvation, with the UN worried about famine conditions.\n\nBiden himself has faced protesters at his public events with many of them calling him 'Genocide Joe.'\n\nHe has spoken little on the protesters that follow him and those who have been disrupting college campuses. More than 2,000 people have been arrested on university campuses since April 18.\n\n'There's the right to protest but not the right to cause chaos,' he said last week in his first in-depth remarks on the matter. 'People have the right to get an education, the right to get a degree, the right to walk across the campus safely without fear of being attacked.'\n\nIsraeli tanks cross into Rafah in the Gaza strip\n\nA Day of Rage for Gaza was called in New York City by student groups as campus demonstrations against the war continue\n\nIn conjunction with Biden's speech, his administration is highlighting its actions to combat antisemitism.\n\nThe Department of Education is sending every school district and college in the nation a letter outlining examples of antisemitism and other hate that could lead to federal civil rights investigations.\n\nSince the Oct. 7 attack, the department has opened more than 100 investigations into complaints about antisemitism and other forms of discrimination under Title VI.\n\nOn Monday, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, met with Jewish college students at the White House about the administration's efforts to combat antisemitism.\n\nAdditionally, the Department of Homeland Security is working to 'build an online campus safety resource guide' to provide 'financial, educational, and technical assistance' for campuses, according to a White House fact sheet\n\nAnd the State Department's Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism 'will convene technology firms to identify best practices to address Antisemitic content online,' the fact sheet said.\n\nBiden's Republican rival in the presidential race, Donald Trump, has looked to take advantage of Democratic divisions over Israel's response to improve the GOP's chances with Jewish voters, who traditionally vote Democratic.\n\n'Jewish Americans are realizing that the Democrat Party has turned into a full-blown anti-Israel, antisemitic, pro-terrorist cabal, and that's why more and more Jewish Americans are supporting President Trump,' Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson, told Reuters.\n\nAbout seven in 10 U.S. Jewish voters support Democrats, while three in 10 are Republican-aligned, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nA protester is held in the street during demonstrations in New York\n\nA Palestinian man watches as smoke rises after Israeli strikes while Israeli forces launch a ground and air operation in the eastern part of Rafah\n\nIn response, Biden's campaign has issued a lengthy list of Trump's antisemitic comments and behavior, including reports that Trump has allegedly said that Adolf Hitler 'did some good things.'\n\nBut polls show young voters are unhappy with the president.\n\nA survey by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University's Kennedy School found that only 18% of young voters approve of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.", "source": {"uri":

Never forgetting means we must keep telling the story, we must keep teaching the truth,\" Biden said at the U.S. Capitol's Emancipation Hall. \"The truth is we're at risk of people not knowing the truth.\"\n\nBiden spoke seven months to the day after the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 by Israeli tallies, in what he has called the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust.\n\n\"This hatred (of Jews) continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness,\" Biden said.\n\n\"Now here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting ... that Hamas unleashed this terror,\" he said. \"I have not forgotten, nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\nBiden's speech comes as Israel's retaliation has killed nearly 35,000 people in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, according to Gaza health authorities, left many of the area's 2.3 million people on the brink of starvation and sparked protests in the U.S. demanding that universities and Biden withdraw support for Israel.\n\nBiden acknowledged Americans' right to protest and demonstrate, but didn't mention the Gaza deaths.\n\n\"We know scapegoating and demonizing any minority is a threat to every minority,\" Biden said. \"There is no place on any campus in America for antisemitism, hate speech or threats of violence of any kind.\"\n\nIsraeli forces today seized the main border crossing between Egypt and southern Gaza, shutting down a vital aid route for Palestinian civilians as they prepared a possible offensive aimed at eliminating Hamas fighters.\n\nMany Jewish Americans have been critical of Israel's Gaza attacks, leading protests against actions of right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government and condemning Netanyahu in Congress.\n\nBiden said his commitment to Israel was ironclad, even amid disagreements with the country's government. The U.S. government has been holding up several shipments of weapons to Israel, a source told Reuters today.\n\nANTISEMITISM, HATE CRIMES JUMP\n\nLaw enforcement and advocacy groups report a sharp rise in antisemitic attacks in the U.S. since Oct. 7, as well as anti-Muslim attacks. Some Americans favor zero-tolerance policies defining antisemitism broadly, while others see the threat of attacks against Jews being used to limit legitimate criticism of U.S. support for Israel.\n\n\"Antisemitism is reaching crisis levels in our country,\" said Carol Ann Schwartz, national president of Hadassah, a women's Zionist organization that has been consulted by the White House.\n\nBiden, who is in a tight race for the White House with Republican rival Donald Trump, pledged to unite the country.\n\nHe said he was inspired to run by then-President Trump's response to the 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, white nationalist rally, where marchers chanted, \"Jews will not replace us.\" Biden now governs a country no less divided than when he took office in 2021, most statistics show.\n\nThe FBI reported a 36% increase in anti-Jewish hate crime incidents between 2021 and 2022, the latest year for which data is available, as well as a jump in crimes against Black Americans and gay men.\n\nCAMPUS PROTEST POLITICS\n\nTrump has sought to exploit Democratic divisions over Israel's response and widening college protests to improve Republicans' lot with Jewish voters, who traditionally vote Democratic.\n\nPolice crackdowns on some campuses have given ammunition to Trump's claim that U.S. cities are under siege from violent crime, illegal migration and out-of-control leftist policies. Trump's Republican Party has argued that the protests are driven by antisemitism.\n\n\"Jewish Americans are realizing that the Democrat Party has turned into a full-blown anti-Israel, antisemitic, pro-terrorist cabal,\" said Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson.\n\nBiden has asked the Department of Education to provide colleges with examples of antisemitic discrimination that could lead to a federal civil rights investigation, and technology firms to determine the best ways to monitor antisemitism online.\n\nAbout seven in 10 U.S. Jewish voters support Democrats, while three in 10 are Republican-aligned, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nKenneth Stern, director of the Bard Center for the Study of Hate, who helped craft a modern \"working definition of antisemitism,\" said the word is being misused to stifle protected speech about Israel.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill last week that would apply the definition Stern helped develop to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws on college campuses. Stern opposes the bill.\n\n\"I don't think that you can combat hatred of any type effectively with weak democratic institutions,\" said Stern. \"When we have a government that decides it's going to stop certain things from being said, that creates an opportunity for totalitarianism, authoritarianism, and that's never good for the Jews.\"", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType":

In some cases, the demonstrations have included antisemitic rhetoric and harassment targeting Jewish students.\n\n\"I understand people have strong beliefs and deep convictions about the world,\" the President said. But, he added, \"There is no place on any campus in America, any place in America, for antisemitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind.\"\n\nBiden also denounced attempts to minimise the Hamas attacks, which killed 1,200 people in Israel and sparked a war that has killed an estimated 34,000 people in Gaza.\n\n\"Now here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven-and-a-half months later, and people are already forgetting,\" Biden said. \"They are already forgetting. That Hamas unleashed this terror. It was Hamas that brutalised Israelis. It was Hamas who took and continues to hold hostages.\n\n\"I have not forgotten, nor have you,\" he said.\n\nJewish groups have been pressuring the administration to take firmer policy steps to combat antisemitism on college campuses, in particular. On Tuesday, the Biden administration fulfilled some of those requests.\n\nThe Education Department's Office for Civil Rights released new guidance to every school and college outlining examples of antisemitic discrimination, as well as other forms of hate, that could lead to investigations for violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nBiden made a tacit acknowledgement during his speech that the pro-Palestinian cause has resonated with other minority groups with histories of violence and oppression.\n\n\"We must give hate no safe harbour against anyone -- anyone,\" Biden said.\n\nFor Jews monitoring a spike in hate crimes and instances of antisemitic rhetoric amid pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses, Biden's speech was both fiercely necessary and fiercely appreciated.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League, which has been tracking antisemitic incidents since the 1970s, says the number of such episodes has reached all-time highs in four of the last five years.", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_d_shear@telegraphindia.com", "name": "Michael D.

While ceasefire talks are ongoing in Cairo and Doha, Qatar, there is now the looming threat of an Israeli military invasion into the Gazan city of Rafah where many civilians have taken refuge.\n\nBiden will deliver a keynote address Tuesday at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual Days of Remembrance ceremony at the US Capitol, remarks the White House says will honor the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust and \"recommit to heeding the lessons of this dark chapter: Never again.\"\n\nBiden is expected to \"speak to the horrors of October 7,\" as well as the subsequent \"alarming rise in antisemitism\" in the US, according to White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.\n\nThe president plans to address the long history of antisemitism and issue what one senior administration official familiar with the remarks described as a \"call to action\" on combatting antisemitism. The president plans to address the recent campus unrest, the official told CNN, by reiterating that Americans have a right to peacefully demonstrate but also rejecting antisemitic hate speech and actions resulting from those protests. The protests are not expected to be a major part of the speech, the official added.\n\nTuesday's remarks amount to a continuation of the White House's strong condemnation of antisemitism throughout the conflict - but take place in the context of a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and increasingly vocal protesters at home as Biden is trying to keep a splintering 2024 coalition intact.\n\nThe president spoke out forcefully against intensifying antisemitism and Islamophobia in the days after Hamas' attacks on Israel, saying in an October 19 Oval Office address that Americans \"can't stand by and stand silent.\" Yet in the seven months since the war began, Islamophobic and antisemitic incidents have significantly increased.\n\nThe most recent data from the Anti-Defamation League, which has tracked antisemitic incidents in the US since 1979, found a 140% increase in incidents from 2022 to 2023, with a \"dramatic\" increase taking place after October 7. And an ADL report on antisemitic attitudes in America in 2024 found that younger Americans are \"more likely to endorse anti-Jewish tropes.\"\n\n\"We are in a moment of crisis for the Jewish community. With antisemitism already at historic levels and Jewish students facing a tsunami of hate on campuses across the country, there's no more important time for a full-throated condemnation of antisemitism in all forms,\" Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the ADL, said in a statement.\n\nIn revisiting the Holocaust, the president will draw a line from that moment in history to the more recent rise in antisemitism in the US, including \"how we need to confront it forcefully when it pokes its head up,\" according to the official.\n\nBiden plans to stress the importance, too, of remembering what Hamas did on October 7, arguing that there has been denialism around the events of that horrific day. However, Biden does not intend to use his speech on Tuesday to delve into Middle East policy or the current situation in Israel or Gaza. Biden has been working with his core speech writing team and senior advisers on Tuesday's speech, offering direct input and language as the draft has come together.\n\nWhile the president has been steadfast in his condemnations of antisemitism, the war in Gaza has made for a politically perilous topic for Biden and his White House as he tries to also show empathy with the conditions Palestinians now face in Gaza. The president has faced protests at nearly every public event outside of the White House in recent months for his support of Israel's war against Hamas, and his handling of the war has been under intense scrutiny since the days after the October 7 attacks.\n\nThe president and his administration now face another potential tipping point in the war. The speech comes as Israel's military has issued a call for residents of the eastern part of the Gazan city of Rafah to \"evacuate immediately,\" raising questions about whether Israel's long-threatened assault on the city will soon be carried out - a move that the Biden administration has strongly cautioned against.\n\nDuring nearly seven months of war, more than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel's destruction of much of northern Gaza. Biden and his top lieutenants have repeatedly and emphatically made clear to their Israeli counterparts that they want to see a clear plan to protect civilians before any troops enter the area. While National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Biden \"again made this clear\" in a Monday call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, it's not clear such a plan has been presented to the US.\n\nConcurrently, Hamas announced Monday that it had agreed to a ceasefire proposal brokered by the Qatari and Egyptian governments, though the proposal appeared to have significant deviations from a proposal that had been formed with Israeli input. The Israeli government was reviewing the Hamas offer on Monday but continued operations in Rafah.\n\nThe speech also comes as the administration is ramping up its response to pro-Palestinian protests over the war that have spread across the nation's colleges and universities, with images of tension and some violence. More than 2,000 people have been arrested on college and university campuses since April 18.\n\nBiden is expected to reaffirm the right to free speech in his speech, Jean-Pierre said, but will emphasize that \"there's no place on any campus or anywhere for antisemitism.\"\n\nThe president made his most substantive comments on the matter last Thursday, saying he supports the right to protest and freedom of speech but \"order must prevail.\"\n\n\"Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancelation of classes and graduation - none of this is a peaceful protest,\" Biden said. \"Threatening people, intimidating people, instilling fear in people is not peaceful protest. It's against the law.\"\n\nAsked by a reporter whether the sentiment on campus has caused him to shift his thinking on the conflict, Biden offered an emphatic, \"No.\"\n\nThe remarks appeared to mark a shift in the administration's response to the protests. A day later, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona sent a letter to college and university presidents condemning \"abhorrent\" incidents of antisemitism on campus and highlighting available resources - a move aimed at further bolstering the administration's public-facing response to the protests.\n\nHe cited specific reports from Jewish students of being physically assaulted or harassed while walking on campus, antisemitic statements, including that Jewish students should \"go back to Poland,\" verbal abuse and swastikas found on dorm room doors.\n\nAnd on Monday, a day ahead of Biden's speech, second gentleman Doug Emhoff hosted a number of Jewish students at the White House for a roundtable. Emhoff, who is the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president and has been a key advocate on the issue, has made addressing antisemitism a cornerstone of his portfolio and has reached out to Jewish campus leaders.\n\nThe speech comes alongside a series of new actions the Biden administration is taking to build on its national strategy to counter antisemitism, the White House announced in a fact sheet.\n\nThe Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights is sending a letter to every school district and college in the country with concrete examples of antisemitic discrimination that could be investigated under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. There are currently 141 open investigations with colleges and universities under Title VI, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is working to \"build an online campus safety resource guide\" to provide \"financial, educational, and technical assistance\" for campuses. DHS is also developing and sharing \"best practices for community-based targeted violence and terrorism prevention,\" the fact sheet said.\n\nAnd the State Department's Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism \"will convene technology firms to identify best practices to address Antisemitic content online,\" the fact sheet said.\n\nBiden's speech comes one day after Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day. To mark the day, Biden's campaign issued a lengthy list of former President Donald Trump's antisemitic comments and behavior, including reports that Trump has allegedly said that Adolf Hitler \"did some good things.\" The speech was also not written to focus on drawing a political contrast with Trump, as so many of Biden's speeches are these days, the senior administration official said.\n\nStill, Biden's steadfast support for Israel's military offensive in Gaza has eroded some of his support among the young voters he needs months before the general election. A poll by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University's Kennedy School found that only 18% of young voters approve of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nCNN's Dana Bash contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

And we will not forget,\" he added.\n\nThe speech came less than a week after Biden offered his first public comments on the protests, in which he defended the pro-Palestinian demonstrators' right to assemble but slammed the activists for crossing the line into creating \"chaos.\"\n\nBiden's support for Israel has alienated many of the campus demonstrators who regularly chant that he is complicit in a \"genocide\" against Palestinians in Gaza. Young voters were essential to his victory over Donald Trump in 2020 and will likely be just as decisive in what is gearing up to be a similarly neck-and-neck rematch in November.\n\nThe anti-Israel campus protests have received a massive amount of media attention, leading many to assume that they are representative of where a majority of college students stand regarding the war in Gaza.\n\nBut a majority of the over 2,000 arrested in recent weeks have not actually been college students, and a poll published Tuesday in the Axios news site revealed that just eight percent of students have participated in the protests. The 1,250 respondents ranked the Middle East as the least important among nine other issues they keep in mind while voting.\n\nA more measured understanding of the campus protests may have given Biden the political space to speak out aggressively against them.\n\n\"We know scapegoating and demonizing any minority is a threat to every minority,\" he said. \"There is no place on any campus in America for antisemitism, hate speech or threats of violence of any kind.\"\n\n\"There's no place on any campus in America\" or any place in America for antisemitism or threats of violence, he added. \"We're not a lawless country -- we are a civil society\"\n\nIn conjunction with Biden's speech, the White House administration announced new steps to combat antisemitism on college campuses and beyond. The Education Department's Civil Rights Office sent every school district and college in the nation a letter outlining examples of antisemitism and other hate that could lead to federal civil rights investigations.\n\nThe Homeland Security Department moved to educate schools and community groups about resources and funding available to promote campus safety and address threats. The State Department's special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism also met with technology companies to discuss combating the rise in hateful content online.\n\nOn Monday, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff met with Jewish college students at the White House about the administration's efforts to combat antisemitism. He heard students describe their own experiences with hatred, including threats of violence and hate speech, his office said.\n\nBiden also spoke out more broadly against antisemitism in his Tuesday speech, which drew comparisons between the Holocaust and October 7, when Hamas-led terrorists invaded Israel, massacring some 1,200 people and taking 252 hostage.\n\nIn response, Israel launched a campaign to remove Hamas from power in Gaza, which has taken the lives of over 34,700 Palestinians in the Strip, according to unverifiable figures from Hamas health officials that do not distinguish between gunmen and civilians. Israel says it has killed 13,000 Hamas gunmen in Gaza as well as 1,000 terrorists inside Israel on October 7. Two hundred and sixty-seven IDF soldiers have been killed in the fighting in Gaza and amid operations on the border.\n\n\"As Jews around the world still cope with the atrocity and trauma of that day and its aftermath, we've seen a ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world,\" Biden said.\n\n\"'Never again' simply translated for me means: Never forget. Never forgetting means we must keep telling the story, we must keep teaching the truth,\" Biden said at the US Capitol's Emancipation Hall. \"The truth is we're at risk of people not knowing the truth.\"\n\n\"It's absolutely despicable and it must stop,\" he said regarding October 7 denialism. \"Silence and denial can hide much but it can erase nothing... it cannot be buried no matter how hard people try.\"\n\n\"We're at risk of people not knowing the truth,\" Biden said of the horrors of the Holocaust, when 6 million Jews were systematically killed by Nazi Germany and its collaborators. \"This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world.\"\n\nAddressing Jewish Americans directly, Biden said, \"I see your fear, your hurt and your pain. Let me reassure you as your president you are not alone. You belong -- you always have and you always will.\"\n\n\"My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish people and Israel is ironclad, even when we disagree,\" the president asserted, adding that he was \"working around the clock\" to secure a hostage deal that would bring about an \"immediate ceasefire\" in Gaza.",

Law enforcement and advocacy groups, meanwhile, report a sharp rise in antisemitic attacks in the United States since Oct. 7, as well anti-Muslim attacks.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday warned that the threat of antisemitism is growing, in remarks honoring the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust, as his support for Israel's assault on Gaza divides his Democratic Party. \"Never again simply translated for me means: Never forget. Never forgetting means we must keep telling the story, we must keep teaching the truth,\" Biden said as he addressed a bipartisan memorial held at the U.S. Capitol's Emancipation Hall. \"The truth is we're at risk of people not knowing the truth.\"\n\nBiden spoke seven months to the day after the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 by Israeli tallies, in what Biden has called the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. His speech comes as Israel's retaliation has killed nearly 35,000 people in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, according to Gaza health authorities, left many of the area's 2.3 million people on the brink of starvation and sparked protests in the U.S. demanding that universities and the Biden administration withdraw support for Israel.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli forces seized the main border crossing between Egypt and southern Gaza, shutting down a vital aid route for Palestinian civilians as they prepared a possible offensive aimed at eliminating Hamas fighters. In his keynote address for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual National Commemoration of the Days of Remembrance, Biden aimed to cool a divided and divisive U.S. debate about Jewish security, Zionism, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel.\n\nOne speaker who preceded Biden equated recent protests in the United States over Israel's actions with support for Hamas. Many Jewish Americans have been critical of Israel's Gaza attacks, leading protests against actions of right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government and condemning Netanyahu in Congress.\n\nLaw enforcement and advocacy groups, meanwhile, report a sharp rise in antisemitic attacks in the United States since Oct. 7, as well anti-Muslim attacks. Some Americans favor zero-tolerance policies defining antisemitism broadly, others see the threat of attacks against Jews being used to limit legitimate criticism of U.S. support for Israel. \"Antisemitism is reaching crisis levels in our country,\" said Carol Ann Schwartz, national president of Hadassah, a women's Zionist organization that has been consulted by the White House.\n\nBiden, who once avoided addressing campus demonstrations over his support for Israel, spoke about the subject for the second time in five days on Tuesday. \"Passions are high,\" said Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of liberal advocacy group J Street, who has also been consulted by the White House. \"The issue is being heavily politicized. There's a lot of tension. So this is a very important moment for the president to step forward.\"\n\nIt's also a key political moment for Biden, who is in a tight race with Republican rival Donald Trump. Biden may be losing crucial support from young and liberal Democrats over his support for Israel, Democrats say. Biden pledged to unite the country and said he was inspired to run by then-President Trump's response to the 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, white nationalist rally, where marchers chanted \"Jews will not replace us.\" Biden governs a country no less divided than when he took office in 2021, most statistics show.\n\nThe FBI reported a 36% increase in anti-Jewish hate crime incidents between 2021 and 2022, the latest year for which data is available, as well as a jump in crimes against Black Americans and gay men. The Secure Community Network (SCN), an American Jewish organization that monitors hate incidents, has referred more than 504 individuals to law enforcement though March this year, faster than last year's pace, including threats at colleges.\n\n\"This is a scary time to be Jewish - it's important for the president to rise to this challenge,\" said SCN CEO Michael Masters. CAMPUS PROTEST POLITICS\n\nTrump has sought to exploit Democratic divisions over Israel's response and widening college protests to improve Republican's lot with Jewish voters, who traditionally vote Democratic. Police crackdowns on some campuses have given ammunition to Trump's claim that U.S. cities are under siege from violent crime, illegal migration and out-of-control leftist policies. Trump's Republican Party has argued that the protests are driven by antisemitism.\n\n\"Jewish Americans are realizing that the Democrat Party has turned into a full-blown anti-Israel, antisemitic, pro-terrorist cabal, and that's why more and more Jewish Americans are supporting President Trump,\" said Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson. Biden's antisemitism strategy includes directing the Department of Education to provide colleges with examples of antisemitic discrimination that could lead to a federal civil rights investigation.\n\nAbout seven in 10 U.S. Jewish voters support Democrats, while three in 10 are Republican-aligned, according to the Pew Research Center. Many political analysts say that Jewish voters typically do not choose a president based on foreign policy alone. Kenneth Stern, director of the Bard Center for the Study of Hate, who helped craft a modern \"working definition of antisemitism,\" said the word is being misused to stifle protected speech about Israel.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill last week that would apply the definition Stern helped develop to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws on college campuses. Stern opposes the bill. \"I don't think that you can combat hatred of any type effectively with weak democratic institutions,\" said Stern. \"When we have a government that decides it's going to stop certain things from being said, that creates an opportunity for totalitarianism, authoritarianism, and that's never good for the Jews.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is

And, in the U.S., college campuses have been rocked by pro-Palestinian protests with some schools canceling commencement addresses as the demonstrates grow anti-semitic.\n\n'You can expect the president to make clear that during these sacred days of remembrance, we honor the memory of the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust and recommit to heeding the lessons of this dark chapter. Never again,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday.\n\nIsraeli tanks cross into Rafah in the Gaza strip\n\nThe president has struggled to balance his support for Israel after the October 7th attack by Hamas - the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust - with his efforts to protect the civilian population of Palestine.\n\nAbout a million refugees have crowded into Rafah. Biden on Monday warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against a full-scale assault on the area but Israeli forces moved forward anyway.\n\nProgressives have urged the president to do more to help the Palestinian refugees.\n\nAnd young voters, a key constituency for Biden, have expressed their dissatisfaction with the war.\n\nAs the issue grows more contested, some protests on campuses have started to feature antisemitic chants and threats toward Jewish students.\n\nBiden will address the issue.\n\nThe president 'will speak to how since October 7th, we\u00b4ve seen an alarming rise in antisemitism in the U.S. and our cities, our communities and on our campuses,' Jean-Pierre said.\n\nAbout 35,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to health authorities. And many of the area's 2.3 million people on the brink of starvation, with the UN worried about famine conditions.\n\nBiden himself has faced protesters at his public events with many of them calling him 'Genocide Joe.'\n\nHe has spoken little on the protesters that follow him and those who have been disrupting college campuses. More than 2,000 people have been arrested on university campuses since April 18.\n\n'There's the right to protest but not the right to cause chaos,' he said last week in his first in-depth remarks on the matter. 'People have the right to get an education, the right to get a degree, the right to walk across the campus safely without fear of being attacked.'\n\nPresident Joe Biden will condemn anti-semitism in a speech Tuesday for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual National Commemoration of the Days of Remembrance\n\nA Day of Rage for Gaza was called in New York City by student groups as campus demonstrations against the war continue\n\nBiden will speak at the Capitol building in a keynote address for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual National Commemoration of the Days of Remembrance.\n\nIn conjunction with his speech, his administration is highlighting its actions to combat antisemitism.\n\nThe Department of Education is sending every school district and college in the nation a letter outlining examples of antisemitism and other hate that could lead to federal civil rights investigations.\n\nSince the Oct. 7 attack, the department has opened more than 100 investigations into complaints about antisemitism and other forms of discrimination under Title VI.\n\nOn Monday, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, met with Jewish college students at the White House about the administration's efforts to combat antisemitism.\n\nAdditionally, the Department of Homeland Security is working to 'build an online campus safety resource guide' to provide 'financial, educational, and technical assistance' for campuses, according to a White House fact sheet\n\nAnd the State Department's Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism 'will convene technology firms to identify best practices to address Antisemitic content online,' the fact sheet said.\n\nBiden's Republican rival in the presidential race, Donald Trump, has looked to take advantage of Democratic divisions over Israel's response to improve the GOP's chances with Jewish voters, who traditionally vote Democratic.\n\n'Jewish Americans are realizing that the Democrat Party has turned into a full-blown anti-Israel, antisemitic, pro-terrorist cabal, and that's why more and more Jewish Americans are supporting President Trump,' Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson, told Reuters.\n\nAbout seven in 10 U.S. Jewish voters support Democrats, while three in 10 are Republican-aligned, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nA protester is held in the street during demonstrations in New York\n\nA Palestinian man watches as smoke rises after Israeli strikes while Israeli forces launch a ground and air operation in the eastern part of Rafah\n\nIn response, Biden's campaign has issued a lengthy list of Trump's antisemitic comments and behavior, including reports that Trump has allegedly said that Adolf Hitler 'did some good things.'\n\nBut polls show young voters are unhappy with the president.\n\nA survey by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University's Kennedy School found that only 18% of young voters approve of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust",

Protests demanding that universities cut financial ties with Israel have spread to campuses across the country, leading to confrontations with police.\n\nBiden last week spoke in-person about the demonstrations for the first time, after facing mounting pressure to respond to takeovers of college buildings, antisemitic remarks and threats to Jewish students recorded at some of them. The president said he supported the right to protest but condemned violence, antisemitism and other hate speech.\n\nTuesday's speech highlights the political dilemma facing Biden at the seven-month mark of Israel's war in Gaza, which has exposed divisions within the Democratic Party that could hurt his chances of winning the November election.\n\nBiden has said that White nationalist protesters who in 2017 marched in Charlottesville, Virginia and chanted anti-Jewish slogans prompted him to run for president. His administration established a national strategy to counter antisemitism months before Hamas, designated a terrorist group by the US and European Union, carried out its attack on Israel.\n\nCollege Democrats' Warning\n\nThe president on Tuesday plans to announce new actions tied to the strategy, including Education Department guidance to schools and colleges on examples of antisemitism that could lead to fresh investigations of alleged violations of federal anti-discrimination laws, the White House official said.\n\nYet many of the pro-Palestinian demonstrators are the type of people -- young, progressive and educated -- Biden's campaign must attract in order to win reelection. College Democrats last week posted on X that their votes \"are not to be taken for granted,\" a warning to the party that renewed fears young people could sit out the election.\n\nBiden's campaign aides have downplayed the notion the protests carry major risks for the president, saying polling data shows that while young people support an immediate cease-fire in Gaza, they do not rank the conflict high on lists of issues important to them.\n\nThe Biden administration has intensified pressure on Israel and Hamas to agree to a temporary cease-fire, with the goal of releasing hostages and rushing humanitarian aid to the territory. A cessation of hostilities could also deflate the campus protests.\n\nHamas on Monday said it agreed to a cease-fire proposal but Israel's war cabinet rejected it as \"far\" from meeting its demands, dashing hopes for an immediate pause in fighting.\n\nHouse GOP Vote\n\nThe president's public comments about the protests have previously sought to balance the protesters' free speech rights with condemnation of violence and antisemitic statements. Yet some Democrats, as well as Republicans, have urged the president to be even more forceful in rebuking the protesters.\n\nHouse Republicans aimed to pressure Democrats last week by voting on a resolution codifying the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism, which includes anti-Zionism, in federal anti-discrimination law. The resolution passed 320-91, with 70 Democrats and 21 Republicans voting against it.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The October 7 attack and the subsequent war in Gaza has proved to be one of the most politically fraught periods of Biden's presidency, one that is particularly personal for the longtime supporter of Israel who views antisemitism as antithetical to American values.\n\nBut Biden's staunch support for Israel's war against Hamas, which has now led to the deaths of more than 34,000 Palestinians, has caused deep fractures in the coalition that sent him to the White House in 2020. Protests on college campuses over Israel's campaign and the Biden administration's support for it have spread across the nation, highlighting potential problems that the president is facing with younger voters that he needs to win a second term.\n\nOn Tuesday during his keynote address at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual Days of Remembrance ceremony at the US Capitol, Biden sought to draw links between the horrors experienced by Jews under the Nazi regime to what happened in Israel last year and rising antisemitism after Hamas' attack.\n\n\"This ancient hatred of Jews didn't begin with the Holocaust - it didn't end with the Holocaust, either, or even after our victory in World War II. This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness,\" Biden said.\n\nHe continued, \"Now, here we are - not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later - and people are already forgetting. They're already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror. ... I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget.\"\n\nBiden pointed to a \"ferocious surge\" of antisemitism in the US in the aftermath of October 7, from propaganda on social media to Jewish students being harassed or attacked on campus.\n\n\"Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7 - including Hamas' appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize. It's absolutely despicable - and it must stop,\" he said, raising his voice.\n\nTuesday's remarks amount to a continuation of the White House's strong condemnation of antisemitism throughout the conflict - but take place in the context of a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and increasingly vocal protesters at home as Biden is trying to keep a splintering 2024 coalition intact.\n\nThe president spoke out forcefully against intensifying antisemitism and Islamophobia in the days after Hamas' attacks on Israel, saying in an October 19 Oval Office address that Americans \"can't stand by and stand silent.\" Yet in the seven months since the war began, Islamophobic and antisemitic incidents have significantly increased.\n\nThe most recent data from the Anti-Defamation League, which has tracked antisemitic incidents in the US since 1979, found a 140% increase in incidents from 2022 to 2023, with a \"dramatic\" increase taking place after October 7. And an ADL report on antisemitic attitudes in America in 2024 found that younger Americans are \"more likely to endorse anti-Jewish tropes.\"\n\n\"We are in a moment of crisis for the Jewish community. With antisemitism already at historic levels and Jewish students facing a tsunami of hate on campuses across the country, there's no more important time for a full-throated condemnation of antisemitism in all forms,\" Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the ADL, said in a statement.\n\nA sensitive spot for the president\n\nWhile the president has been steadfast in his condemnations of antisemitism, the war in Gaza has made for a politically perilous topic for Biden and his White House as he tries to also show empathy with the conditions Palestinians now face in Gaza. The president has faced protests at nearly every public event outside of the White House in recent months for his support of Israel's war against Hamas, and his handling of the war has been under intense scrutiny since the days after the October 7 attacks.\n\nThe president and his administration now face another potential tipping point in the war. The speech came as Israel's military has issued a call for residents of the eastern part of the Gazan city of Rafah to \"evacuate immediately,\" raising questions about whether Israel's long-threatened assault on the city will soon be carried out - a move that the Biden administration has strongly cautioned against.\n\nDuring nearly seven months of war, more than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel's destruction of much of northern Gaza. Biden and his top lieutenants have repeatedly and emphatically made clear to their Israeli counterparts that they want to see a clear plan to protect civilians before any troops enter the area. While National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Biden \"again made this clear\" in a Monday call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, it's not clear such a plan has been presented to the US.\n\nConcurrently, Hamas announced Monday that it had agreed to a ceasefire proposal brokered by the Qatari and Egyptian governments, though the proposal appeared to have significant deviations from a proposal that had been formed with Israeli input. The Israeli government was reviewing the Hamas offer on Monday but continued operations in Rafah.\n\nThe speech also came as the administration is ramping up its response to pro-Palestinian protests over the war that have spread across the nation's colleges and universities, with images of tension and some violence. More than 2,000 people have been arrested on college and university campuses since April 18.\n\nThe president made his most substantive comments on the matter last Thursday, saying he supports the right to protest and freedom of speech but \"order must prevail.\"\n\n\"Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancelation of classes and graduation - none of this is a peaceful protest,\" Biden said. \"Threatening people, intimidating people, instilling fear in people is not peaceful protest. It's against the law.\"\n\nAsked by a reporter whether the sentiment on campus has caused him to shift his thinking on the conflict, Biden offered an emphatic, \"No.\"\n\nA shift in tone\n\nThe remarks appeared to mark a shift in the administration's response to the protests. A day later, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona sent a letter to college and university presidents condemning \"abhorrent\" incidents of antisemitism on campus and highlighting available resources - a move aimed at further bolstering the administration's public-facing response to the protests.\n\nHe cited specific reports from Jewish students of being physically assaulted or harassed while walking on campus, antisemitic statements, including that Jewish students should \"go back to Poland,\" verbal abuse and swastikas found on dorm room doors.\n\nAnd on Monday, a day ahead of Biden's speech, second gentleman Doug Emhoff hosted a number of Jewish students at the White House for a roundtable. Emhoff, who is the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president and has been a key advocate on the issue, has made addressing antisemitism a cornerstone of his portfolio and has reached out to Jewish campus leaders.\n\nTuesday's speech came alongside a series of new actions the Biden administration is taking to build on its national strategy to counter antisemitism, the White House announced in a fact sheet.\n\nThe Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights is sending a letter to every school district and college in the country with concrete examples of antisemitic discrimination that could be investigated under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. There are currently 141 open investigations with colleges and universities under Title VI, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is working to \"build an online campus safety resource guide\" to provide \"financial, educational, and technical assistance\" for campuses. DHS is also developing and sharing \"best practices for community-based targeted violence and terrorism prevention,\" the fact sheet said.\n\nAnd the State Department's Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism \"will convene technology firms to identify best practices to address Antisemitic content online,\" the fact sheet said.\n\nBiden's speech came one day after Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day. To mark the day, Biden's campaign issued a lengthy list of former President Donald Trump's antisemitic comments and behavior, including reports that Trump has allegedly said that Adolf Hitler \"did some good things.\" The speech was also not written to focus on drawing a political contrast with Trump, as so many of Biden's speeches are these days, the senior administration official said.\n\nStill, Biden's steadfast support for Israel's military offensive in Gaza has eroded some of his support among the young voters he needs months before the general election. A poll by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University's Kennedy School found that only 18% of young voters approve of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nCNN's Dana Bash and MJ Lee contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Never forgetting means we must keep telling the story, we must keep teaching the truth,\" Biden said as he addressed a bipartisan memorial held at the U.S. Capitol's Emancipation Hall. \"The truth is we're at risk of people not knowing the truth.\"\n\nBiden spoke seven months to the day after the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 by Israeli tallies, in what Biden has called the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust.\n\n\"This hatred (of Jews) continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness,\" Biden said.\n\n\"Now here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting ... that Hamas unleashed this terror,\" he said. \"I have not forgotten, nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\nBiden's speech comes as Israel's retaliation has killed nearly 35,000 people in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, according to Gaza health authorities, left many of the area's 2.3 million people on the brink of starvation and sparked protests in the U.S. demanding that universities and the Biden administration withdraw support for Israel.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli forces seized the main border crossing between Egypt and southern Gaza, shutting down a vital aid route for Palestinian civilians as they prepared a possible offensive aimed at eliminating Hamas fighters.\n\nIn his keynote address for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual National Commemoration of the Days of Remembrance, Biden aimed to cool a divided and divisive U.S. debate about Jewish security, Zionism, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel.\n\nBiden said his commitment to Israel was ironclad even amid disagreements with the country's government.\n\nOne speaker who preceded Biden equated recent protests in the United States over Israel's actions with support for Hamas.\n\nMany Jewish Americans have been critical of Israel's Gaza attacks, leading protests against actions of right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government and condemning Netanyahu in Congress.\n\nLaw enforcement and advocacy groups, meanwhile, report a sharp rise in antisemitic attacks in the United States since Oct. 7, as well anti-Muslim attacks. Some Americans favor zero-tolerance policies defining antisemitism broadly, others see the threat of attacks against Jews being used to limit legitimate criticism of U.S. support for Israel.\n\n\"Antisemitism is reaching crisis levels in our country,\" said Carol Ann Schwartz, national president of Hadassah, a women's Zionist organization that has been consulted by the White House.\n\nBiden, who once avoided addressing campus demonstrations over his support for Israel, spoke about the subject for the second time in five days on Tuesday.\n\n\"Passions are high,\" said Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of liberal advocacy group J Street, who has also been consulted by the White House. \"The issue is being heavily politicized. There's a lot of tension. So this is a very important moment for the president to step forward.\"\n\nIt's also a key political moment for Biden, who is in a tight race with Republican rival Donald Trump. Biden may be losing crucial support from young and liberal Democrats over his support for Israel, Democrats say.\n\nBiden pledged to unite the country and said he was inspired to run by then-President Trump's response to the 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, white nationalist rally, where marchers chanted \"Jews will not replace us.\" Biden governs a country no less divided than when he took office in 2021, most statistics show.\n\nThe FBI reported a 36% increase in anti-Jewish hate crime incidents between 2021 and 2022, the latest year for which data is available, as well as a jump in crimes against Black Americans and gay men.\n\nThe Secure Community Network (SCN), an American Jewish organization that monitors hate incidents, has referred more than 504 individuals to law enforcement though March this year, faster than last year's pace, including threats at colleges.\n\n\"This is a scary time to be Jewish - it's important for the president to rise to this challenge,\" said SCN CEO Michael Masters.\n\nCAMPUS PROTEST POLITICS\n\nTrump has sought to exploit Democratic divisions over Israel's response and widening college protests to improve Republican's lot with Jewish voters, who traditionally vote Democratic.\n\nPolice crackdowns on some campuses have given ammunition to Trump's claim that U.S. cities are under siege from violent crime, illegal migration and out-of-control leftist policies. Trump's Republican Party has argued that the protests are driven by antisemitism.\n\n\"Jewish Americans are realizing that the Democrat Party has turned into a full-blown anti-Israel, antisemitic, pro-terrorist cabal, and that's why more and more Jewish Americans are supporting President Trump,\" said Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson.\n\nBiden's antisemitism strategy includes directing the Department of Education to provide colleges with examples of antisemitic discrimination that could lead to a federal civil rights investigation.\n\nAbout seven in 10 U.S. Jewish voters support Democrats, while three in 10 are Republican-aligned, according to the Pew Research Center. Many political analysts say that Jewish voters typically do not choose a president based on foreign policy alone.\n\nKenneth Stern, director of the Bard Center for the Study of Hate, who helped craft a modern \"working definition of antisemitism,\" said the word is being misused to stifle protected speech about Israel.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill last week that would apply the definition Stern helped develop to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws on college campuses. Stern opposes the bill.\n\n\"I don't think that you can combat hatred of any type effectively with weak democratic institutions,\" said Stern. \"When we have a government that decides it's going to stop certain things from being said, that creates an opportunity for totalitarianism, authoritarianism, and that's never good for the Jews.\"\n\n(Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt, James Oliphant, Jeff Mason and Jarrett Renshaw; Editing by Heather Timmons and Leslie Adler)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update\n\nYour morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.\n\nSuccess!

The October 7 attack and the subsequent war in Gaza has proved to be one of the most politically fraught periods of Biden's presidency, one that is particularly personal for the longtime supporter of Israel who views antisemitism as antithetical to American values.\n\n\"We must give hate no safe harbor against anyone,\" Biden said.\n\nBut Biden's staunch support for Israel's war against Hamas, which has now led to the deaths of more than 34,000 Palestinians, has caused deep fractures in the coalition that sent him to the White House in 2020. Protests on college campuses over Israel's campaign and the Biden administration's support for it have spread across the nation, highlighting potential political problems that the president is facing with the younger voters he needs to win a second term.\n\nOn Tuesday, during his keynote address at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual Days of Remembrance ceremony at the US Capitol, Biden sought to draw direct links between the horrors experienced by Jews under the Nazi regime to what happened in Israel last year and rising antisemitism after Hamas' attack.\n\n\"This ancient hatred of Jews didn't begin with the Holocaust - it didn't end with the Holocaust, either, or even after our victory in World War II. This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness,\" Biden said.\n\nHe continued, \"Now, here we are - not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later - and people are already forgetting. They're already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror. ... I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget.\"\n\nBiden pointed to a \"ferocious surge\" of antisemitism in the US in the aftermath of October 7, from propaganda on social media to Jewish students being harassed or attacked on campus.\n\n\"Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7 - including Hamas' appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize. It's absolutely despicable - and it must stop,\" he said, raising his voice.\n\nThe president spoke out forcefully against intensifying antisemitism and Islamophobia in the days after Hamas' attacks on Israel, saying in an October 19 Oval Office address that Americans \"can't stand by and stand silent.\" Yet in the seven months since the war began, Islamophobic and antisemitic incidents have significantly increased.\n\nThe most recent data from the Anti-Defamation League, which has tracked antisemitic incidents in the US since 1979, found a 140% increase in incidents from 2022 to 2023, with a \"dramatic\" increase taking place after October 7. And an ADL report on antisemitic attitudes in America in 2024 found that younger Americans are \"more likely to endorse anti-Jewish tropes.\"\n\nBiden offered a direct message to American Jews Tuesday.\n\n\"I see your fear, your hurt, and your pain. Let me reassure you as your president: You are not alone. You belong. You always have and you always will,\" he said.\n\nHe recounted the story of Tom Lantos, who escaped a Nazi labor camp during the Holocaust with the help of Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who used his diplomatic cover to hide and rescue about 100,000 Jews. Lantos became a top adviser to Biden, then a first-term senator, and later became the only Holocaust survivor elected to Congress.\n\nThe president quoted Lantos, who warned, \"The veneer of civilization is paper-thin. We are its guardians, and we can never rest.\"\n\n\"My fellow Americans: We must be the guardians,\" Biden added.\n\nA sensitive spot for the president\n\nWhile the president has been steadfast in his condemnations of antisemitism, the war in Gaza has made for a politically perilous topic for Biden and his White House as he tries to also show empathy with the conditions Palestinians now face in Gaza.\n\nThe president has faced protests at nearly every public event outside of the White House in recent months for his support of Israel's war against Hamas, and his handling of the war has been under intense scrutiny since the days after the October 7 attacks.\n\nThe president and his administration now face another potential tipping point in the war. The speech came as Israel's military has issued a call for residents of the eastern part of the Gazan city of Rafah to \"evacuate immediately,\" raising questions about whether Israel's long-threatened assault on the city will soon be carried out - a move that the Biden administration has strongly cautioned against.\n\nDuring nearly seven months of war, more than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel's destruction of much of northern Gaza. Biden and his top lieutenants have repeatedly and emphatically made clear to their Israeli counterparts that they want to see a clear plan to protect civilians before any troops enter the area. While National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Biden \"again made this clear\" in a Monday call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, it's not clear such a plan has been presented to the US.\n\nBiden on Tuesday reiterated his \"ironclad\" commitment to Israel's right to exist as an independent Jewish state - \"even when we disagree.\"\n\nHamas announced Monday that it had agreed to a ceasefire proposal brokered by the Qatari and Egyptian governments, though the proposal appeared to have significant deviations from a proposal that had been formed with Israeli input. The Israeli government was reviewing the Hamas offer on Monday but continued operations in Rafah.\n\nThe speech also came as the administration is ramping up its response to pro-Palestinian protests over the war that have spread across the nation's colleges and universities, with images of tension and some violence. More than 2,000 people have been arrested on college and university campuses since April 18.\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden reaffirmed the right to free speech, but roundly condemned antisemitism, hate speech and threats of violence \"against Jews or anyone else.\"\n\nA shift in tone\n\nBiden's speech on the topic last week appeared to mark a shift in the administration's response to the protests. A day later, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona sent a letter to college and university presidents condemning \"abhorrent\" incidents of antisemitism on campus and highlighting available resources - a move aimed at further bolstering the administration's public-facing response to the protests.\n\nHe cited specific reports from Jewish students of being physically assaulted or harassed while walking on campus, antisemitic statements, including that Jewish students should \"go back to Poland,\" verbal abuse and swastikas found on dorm room doors.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, speaking earlier at the same event as Biden on Tuesday, compared the growing unrest at college campuses to German \"elite centers of learning\" in the 1930s and 40s \"where anti-Jewish courses were introduced\" and saying \"today we are witnessing American universities quickly becoming hostile places for Jewish students and faculty.\"\n\n\"The very campuses which were once the envy of the International Academy have succumbed to an antisemitic virus. Students who were known for producing academic papers are now known for stabbing their Jewish peers in the eyes with Palestinian flags. Faculty who once produced cutting-edge research are now linking arms with pro-Hamas protesters and calling for global intifada,\" Johnson said.\n\nOn Monday, a day ahead of Biden's speech, second gentleman Doug Emhoff hosted a number of Jewish students at the White House for a roundtable. Emhoff, who is the first Jewish spouse of a president or vice president and has been a key advocate on the issue, has made addressing antisemitism a cornerstone of his portfolio and has reached out to Jewish campus leaders.\n\nTuesday's speech came alongside a series of new actions the Biden administration is taking to build on its national strategy to counter antisemitism, the White House announced in a fact sheet.\n\nThe Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights is sending a letter to every school district and college in the country with concrete examples of antisemitic discrimination that could be investigated under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. There are currently 141 open investigations with colleges and universities under Title VI, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color and national origin in programs and activities receiving federal financial assistance.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is working to \"build an online campus safety resource guide\" to provide \"financial, educational, and technical assistance\" for campuses. DHS is also developing and sharing \"best practices for community-based targeted violence and terrorism prevention,\" the fact sheet said.\n\nAnd the State Department's Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism \"will convene technology firms to identify best practices to address Antisemitic content online,\" the fact sheet said.\n\nBiden's speech came one day after Yom HaShoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day. To mark the day, Biden's campaign issued a lengthy list of former President Donald Trump's antisemitic comments and behavior, including reports that Trump has allegedly said that Adolf Hitler \"did some good things.\" The speech was also not written to focus on drawing a political contrast with Trump, as so many of Biden's speeches are these days, the senior administration official said.\n\nStill, Biden's steadfast support for Israel's military offensive in Gaza has eroded some of his support among the young voters he needs months before the general election. A poll by the Institute of Politics at Harvard University's Kennedy School found that only 18% of young voters approve of Biden's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\n'An important moment'\n\nBiden's remarks linking the Holocaust and the October 7 attack were largely praised by pro-Israel groups.\n\nJeremy Ben-Ami, president of J Street - a liberal pro-Israel advocacy group - said in a statement he is grateful to Biden \"for standing unequivocally against the sharp rise in antisemitism while also defending our First Amendment rights to speech and nonviolent protest.\"\n\nAdam Lehman, the president and CEO of Hillel International, a Jewish campus group, said in a statement Biden's remarks \"come at an important moment, as anti-Israel and anti-Jewish groups continue to pursue hateful, divisive and destructive actions that violate the civil rights of Jewish students and undermine campus safety for all students.\"\n\nHowever, leaders of two of the largest US Jewish groups that have been critical of Israel's actions in its war with Hamas said Biden had missed the mark in his description of college protests.\n\nStefanie Fox, executive director of Jewish Voice for Peace, said Biden's characterization of campus protests was \"entirely inaccurate\" and \"a really intentional misrepresentation.\" She said that \"peaceful multiracial, multifaith student protesters are simply calling out the very clear complicity of their universities in the Israeli attack on Palestinians.\"\n\nEva Borgwardt, a national spokesperson for IfNotNow, said Biden's speech \"was a misclassification of what's happening on college campuses.\"\n\n\"To respond to a few isolated incidents in what has been overwhelmingly nonviolent student protest with the use of police and state force that targets particularly Palestinian, black and brown students, Jewish students among them, is a completely irresponsible and dangerous approach to protest and does not at all advance any kind of Jewish safety,\" Borgwardt said.\n\nCNN's Eric Bradner, Nicole Goodkind, Kristin Wilson, Dana Bash and MJ Lee contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

In some cases, the demonstrations have included antisemitic rhetoric and harassment targeting Jewish students.\n\n\"I understand people have strong beliefs and deep convictions about the world,\" the president said. But, he added, \"there is no place on any campus in America, any place in America, for antisemitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind.\"\n\nMr Biden also denounced attempts to minimise the Hamas attacks, which killed 1,200 people in Israel and sparked a war that has killed an estimated 34,000 people in Gaza.\n\n\"Now here we are, not 75 years later, but just 7\u00bd months later, and people are already forgetting,\" Mr Biden said. \"They are already forgetting. That Hamas unleashed this terror. It was Hamas that brutalised Israelis. It was Hamas who took and continues to hold hostages.\n\n\"I have not forgotten, nor have you,\" he told the crowd of more than 100, including Holocaust survivors. \"And we will not forget.\"\n\nSince the outset of the war, Mr Biden has faced criticism from Arab Americans and Palestinians who have said they don't hear Mr Biden talk about the plight of their people with the same empathy and emotion that he uses to describe Israel and the Jewish people.\n\nThe leader of the World Food Program has said that parts of Gaza are experiencing a \"full-blown famine\", in part because of Israel blocking humanitarian aid.\n\nJewish groups have been pressuring the administration to take firmer policy steps to combat antisemitism on college campuses, in particular. On May 7, the Biden administration fulfilled some of those requests.\n\nThe Education Department's Office for Civil Rights released new guidance to every school and college outlining examples of antisemitic discrimination, as well as other forms of hate, that could lead to investigations for violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nThe law prohibits discrimination based on race, color and national origin, and the department has interpreted it as extending to Jewish students. Since the Oct 7 attack, the department has opened more than 100 investigations into complaints about antisemitism and other forms of discrimination. The administration also announced that the Department of Homeland Security would offer new resources, including an online campus safety resource guide.\n\nMr Nathan Diament, executive director for public policy for the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, one of the groups that has been lobbying the administration for more measures for weeks, said that the Jewish community \"need them implemented rapidly and aggressively\".\n\n\"President Biden's speech today was an important statement of moral clarity at a time when too many people seem to be morally confused,\" Mr Diament said. \"Just as important as the president's words today is the announcement that his administration is taking more steps to counter the surge of antisemitism in the US.\"\n\nThe president promised that his commitment to the security of Israel \"and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad. Even when we disagree,\" a reference to the arguments his administration has had with Israel's right-wing government about the toll the war is taking in Gaza. The speech came against the backdrop of Israel's plans to move forward with a ground operation in Rafah, which Biden opposes. More than 1 million Palestinians are sheltering in Rafah.\n\nMr Biden made a tacit acknowledgment during his speech that the pro-Palestinian cause has resonated with other minority groups with histories of violence and oppression.\n\n\"We must give hate no safe harbor against anyone - anyone,\" Mr Biden said in his speech, adding that Jewish people helped lead civil rights causes throughout history.\n\n\"From that experience,\" he added, \"we know scapegoating and demonizing any minority is a threat to every minority and the very foundation of our democracy.\"\n\nBut Mr Biden largely focused on the issue at hand. After his address, he stayed to watch three Holocaust survivors, who carried photos and mementos as they recounted their memories of loved ones. They invited the audience to stand and raise black-and-white photos of Holocaust victims that were placed on audience chairs in the air.\n\nMr Biden held a photo of four children to his chest.

His speech comes as Israel's retaliation has killed 35,000 people in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, according to Gaza health authorities, left many of the area's 2.3 million people on the brink of starvation and sparked protests in the U.S. demanding that universities and the Biden administration withdraw support for Israel. On Monday, Israel vowed to press ahead with an offensive against Rafah in the south that threatens to unleash new misery for Palestinians.\n\nSpeaking at the Capitol, in a keynote address for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual National Commemoration of the Days of Remembrance, Biden will aim to cool an increasingly divided and divisive U.S. debate about Jewish security, Zionism, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel. Many Jewish Americans have been critical of Israel's Gaza attacks, leading protests against actions of right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government and condemning Netanyahu in Congress.\n\nLaw enforcement and advocacy groups, meanwhile, report a sharp rise in antisemitic attacks in the United States since Oct. 7, as well anti-Muslim attacks. Some Americans favor zero-tolerance policies defining antisemitism broadly, others see the threat of attacks against Jews being used to limit legitimate criticism of U.S. support for Israel. \"Antisemitism is reaching crisis levels in our country,\" said Carol Ann Schwartz, national president of Hadassah, a women's Zionist organization that has been consulted by the White House.\n\n\"Right now, we need our leaders to not only acknowledge the pain people are feeling, but also to actively confront the anti-Israel and anti-Zionist misinformation and lies being propagated on college campuses and beyond, which have made Jews a target.\" Biden, who has mostly avoided addressing campus demonstrations or protesters over his support for Israel that have dogged him for months, will speak about the subject for the second time in five days on Tuesday. He will condemn a rise in antisemitism while affirming support for free speech, his spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Monday.\n\n\"Passions are high. The issue is being heavily politicized. There's a lot of tension. So this is a very important moment for the president to step forward,\" said Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of liberal advocacy group J Street, who has also been consulted by the White House. It's also a key political moment for Biden, who is in a tight race with Republican rival Donald Trump. Biden may be losing crucial support from young and liberal Democrats over his support for Israel, Democrats say.\n\nBiden pledged to unite the country and said he was inspired to run by Trump's response to the 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, white nationalist rally, where marchers chanted \"Jews will not replace us.\" Biden governs a country no less divided than when he took office in 2021, most statistics show. The FBI reported a 36% increase in anti-Jewish hate crime incidents between 2021 and 2022, the latest year for which data is available, as well as a jump in crimes against Black Americans and gay men.\n\nThe Secure Community Network (SCN), an American Jewish security organization that monitors hate incidents, has referred more than 504 individuals to law enforcement though March this year, faster than last year's pace, including threats at colleges. \"This is a scary time to be Jewish - it's important for the president to rise to this challenge,\" said SCN CEO Michael Masters.\n\nCAMPUS PROTEST POLITICS Trump has sought to exploit Democratic divisions over Israel's response and widening college protests to improve Republican's lot with Jewish voters, who traditionally vote Democratic.\n\nPolice crackdowns on some campuses have given ammunition to Trump's long-running claim that U.S. cities are under siege from violent crime, illegal migration and out-of-control leftist policies. Trump and the Republican Party have argued that the protests are driven by antisemitism and that Biden has failed to protect Jewish students on campus.\n\n\"Jewish Americans are realizing that the Democrat Party has turned into a full-blown anti-Israel, antisemitic, pro-terrorist cabal, and that's why more and more Jewish Americans are supporting President Trump,\" said Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson. About seven in 10 U.S. Jewish voters support Democrats, while three in 10 are Republican-aligned, according to the Pew Research Center. Many political analysts say Jewish voters join other Americans in rarely voting primarily on foreign policy issues.\n\nKenneth Stern, director of the Bard Center for the Study of Hate, who helped craft a modern \"working definition of antisemitism,\" said the word is being misused to stifle protected speech about Israel. The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill last week that would apply the definition Stern helped develop to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws on college campuses. Stern opposes the bill.\n\n\"I don't think that you can combat hatred of any type effectively with weak democratic institutions,\" said Stern. \"When we have a government that decides it's going to stop certain things from being said, that creates an opportunity for totalitarianism, authoritarianism, and that's never good for the Jews.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff

Never forgetting means we must keep telling the story, we must keep teaching the truth,\" Biden said at the US Capitol's Emancipation Hall. \"The truth is we're at risk of people not knowing the truth.\"\n\nBiden spoke seven months to the day after Hamas, the Palestinian terror group that rules Gaza, attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and kidnapping over 250 others as hostages in what he has called the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust.\n\n\"This hatred [of Jews] continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness,\" Biden said.\n\n\"Now here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting ... that Hamas unleashed this terror,\" he said. \"I have not forgotten, nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\nBiden's speech came amid growing opposition, including from his administration, to Israel's response to the Oct. 7 massacre. The Jewish state has waged a military campaign against Hamas in Gaza aimed at freeing the hostages and incapacitating the Islamist group to the point that it can no longer pose a major threat to the Israeli people. The Israeli war effort has sparked protests in the US demanding that universities and Biden withdraw support for Israel.\n\nBiden acknowledged Americans' right to protest and demonstrate, but didn't mention the deaths in Gaza.\n\n\"We know scapegoating and demonizing any minority is a threat to every minority,\" Biden said. \"There is no place on any campus in America for antisemitism, hate speech or threats of violence of any kind.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli forces seized the main border crossing between Egypt and southern Gaza as they prepared a possible offensive aimed at eliminating Hamas terrorists.\n\nBiden said his commitment to Israel was ironclad, even amid disagreements with the country's government. The US government has been holding up several shipments of weapons to Israel, a source told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nANTISEMITISM, HATE CRIMES JUMP\n\nLaw enforcement and advocacy groups report a sharp rise in antisemitic attacks in the US since Oct. 7.\n\n\"Antisemitism is reaching crisis levels in our country,\" said Carol Ann Schwartz, national president of Hadassah, a women's Zionist organization that has been consulted by the White House.\n\nBiden, who is in a tight race for the White House with Republican rival Donald Trump, pledged to unite the country.\n\nHe said he was inspired to run by then-President Trump's response to the 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, white nationalist rally, where marchers chanted, \"Jews will not replace us.\" Biden now governs a country no less divided than when he took office in 2021, most statistics show.\n\nThe FBI reported a 36 percent increase in anti-Jewish hate crime incidents between 2021 and 2022, the latest year for which data is available, as well as a jump in crimes against Black Americans and gay men.\n\nMore recently, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) released a report showing antisemitic incidents in the US rose 140 percent last year, reaching a record high. Most of the outrages occurred after Oct. 7, during the ensuing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.\n\nOn college campuses specifically, the ADL report found that antisemitic incidents rose 321 percent, disrupting the studies of Jewish students and leaving them uncertain about the fate of the American Jewish community.\n\nMeanwhile, antisemitic incidents have also skyrocketed to record highs in several other countries around the world, especially in Europe, since the Hamas atrocities of Oct. 7.\n\nCAMPUS PROTEST POLITICS\n\nTrump has sought to exploit Democratic divisions over Israel's response and widening college protests to improve Republicans' lot with Jewish voters, who traditionally vote Democratic.\n\nPolice crackdowns on some campuses have given ammunition to Trump's claim that US cities are under siege from violent crime, illegal migration, and out-of-control leftist policies.

Beyond classic antisemitic behavior associated with the likes of the medieval period and Nazi Germany, the examples include denial of the Holocaust and newer forms of antisemitism targeting Israel such as demonizing the Jewish state, denying its right to exist, and holding it to standards not expected of any other democratic state.\n\nCritics have argued the widely adopted definition is vague and infringes on freedom of speech, including the ability to criticize Israel.", "source": {"uri": "algemeiner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Algemeiner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

On Monday, Israel vowed to press ahead with an offensive against Rafah in the south that threatens to unleash new misery for Palestinians.\n\nSpeaking at the Capitol, in a keynote address for the US Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual National Commemoration of the Days of Remembrance, Biden will aim to cool an increasingly divided and divisive US debate about Jewish security, Zionism, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel.\n\nMany Jewish Americans have been critical of Israel's Gaza attacks, leading protests against actions of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government and condemning Netanyahu in Congress.\n\nLaw enforcement and advocacy groups, meanwhile, report a sharp rise in anti-Semitic attacks in the US since October 7, as well anti-Muslim attacks. Some Americans favour zero-tolerance policies defining anti-Semitism broadly; others see the threat of attacks against Jews being used to limit legitimate criticism of US support for Israel.\n\n\"Anti-Semitism is reaching crisis levels in our country,\" said Carol Ann Schwartz, national president of Hadassah, a women's Zionist organisation that has been consulted by the White House.\n\n\"Right now, we need our leaders to not only acknowledge the pain people are feeling, but also to actively confront the anti-Israel and anti-Zionist misinformation and lies being propagated on college campuses and beyond, which have made Jews a target.\"\n\nBiden, who has mostly avoided addressing campus demonstrations or protesters over his support for Israel that have dogged him for months, will speak about the subject for the second time in five days on Tuesday. He will condemn a rise in anti-Semitism while affirming support for free speech, his spokesperson, Karine Jean-Pierre, told reporters on Monday.\n\n\"Passions are high. The issue is being heavily politicised. There's a lot of tension. So this is a very important moment for the president to step forward,\" said Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of liberal advocacy group J Street, who has also been consulted by the White House.\n\nIt's also a key political moment for Biden, who is in a tight race with Republican rival Donald Trump. Biden may be losing crucial support from young and liberal Democrats over his support for Israel, Democrats say.\n\nBiden pledged to unite the country and said he was inspired to run by Trump's response to the 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, white nationalist rally, where marchers chanted \"Jews will not replace us.\" Biden governs a country no less divided than when he took office in 2021, most statistics show.\n\nThe FBI reported a 36% increase in anti-Jewish hate crime incidents between 2021 and 2022, the latest year for which data is available, as well as a jump in crimes against black Americans and gay men.\n\nThe Secure Community Network (SCN), a US Jewish security organisation that monitors hate incidents, has referred more than 504 individuals to law enforcement to the end of March, faster than 2023's pace, including threats at colleges.\n\n\"This is a scary time to be Jewish -- it's important for the president to rise to this challenge,\" said SCN CEO Michael Masters.\n\nCampus protest politics\n\nTrump has sought to exploit Democratic divisions over Israel's response and widening college protests to improve Republicans' lot with Jewish voters, who traditionally vote Democratic.\n\nPolice crackdowns on some campuses have given ammunition to Trump's long-running claim that US cities are under siege from violent crime, illegal migration and out-of-control leftist policies.\n\nTrump and the Republican Party have argued that the protests are driven by anti-Semitism and that Biden has failed to protect Jewish students on campus.\n\n\"Jewish Americans are realising that the Democrat Party has turned into a full-blown anti-Israel, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist cabal, and that's why more and more Jewish Americans are supporting President Trump,\" said Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson.\n\nAbout seven in 10 US Jewish voters support Democrats, while three in 10 are Republican-aligned, according to the Pew Research Center. Many political analysts say Jewish voters join other Americans in rarely voting, primarily on foreign policy issues.\n\nKenneth Stern, director of the Bard Center for the Study of Hate, who helped craft a modern \"working definition of anti-Semitism\", said the word is being misused to stifle protected speech about Israel.\n\nThe US house of representatives passed a bill last week that would apply the definition Stern helped develop to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws on college campuses. Stern opposes the bill.\n\n\"I don't think that you can combat hatred of any type effectively with weak democratic institutions,\" said Stern.", "source": {"uri": "businesslive.co.za", "dataType":

In a speech honoring the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust, Biden joined a heated American debate about Jewish security, Zionism, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel.\n\nAddressing a bipartisan audience at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual commemoration, he warned of the risk that the truth about the systematic killing of Jews during World War Two would be lost. \"'Never again' simply translated for me means: Never forget. Never forgetting means we must keep telling the story, we must keep teaching the truth,\" Biden said at the U.S. Capitol's Emancipation Hall. \"The truth is we're at risk of people not knowing the truth.\"\n\nBiden spoke seven months to the day after the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 by Israeli tallies, in what he has called the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. \"This hatred (of Jews) continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness,\" Biden said.\n\n\"Now here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting ... that Hamas unleashed this terror,\" he said. \"I have not forgotten, nor have you. And we will not forget.\" Biden's speech comes as Israel's retaliation has killed nearly 35,000 people in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, according to Gaza health authorities, left many of the area's 2.3 million people on the brink of starvation and sparked protests in the U.S. demanding that universities and Biden withdraw support for Israel.\n\nBiden acknowledged Americans' right to protest and demonstrate, but didn't mention the Gaza deaths. \"We know scapegoating and demonizing any minority is a threat to every minority,\" Biden said. \"There is no place on any campus in America for antisemitism, hate speech or threats of violence of any kind.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli forces seized the main border crossing between Egypt and southern Gaza, shutting down a vital aid route for Palestinian civilians as they prepared a possible offensive aimed at eliminating Hamas fighters. Many Jewish Americans have been critical of Israel's Gaza attacks, leading protests against actions of right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government and condemning Netanyahu in Congress.\n\nBiden said his commitment to Israel was ironclad, even amid disagreements with the country's government. The U.S. government has been holding up several shipments of weapons to Israel, a source told Reuters on Tuesday. ANTISEMITISM, HATE CRIMES JUMP\n\nLaw enforcement and advocacy groups report a sharp rise in antisemitic attacks in the U.S. since Oct. 7, as well as anti-Muslim attacks. Some Americans favor zero-tolerance policies defining antisemitism broadly, while others see the threat of attacks against Jews being used to limit legitimate criticism of U.S. support for Israel. \"Antisemitism is reaching crisis levels in our country,\" said Carol Ann Schwartz, national president of Hadassah, a women's Zionist organization that has been consulted by the White House.\n\nBiden, who is in a tight race for the White House with Republican rival Donald Trump, pledged to unite the country. He said he was inspired to run by then-President Trump's response to the 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, white nationalist rally, where marchers chanted, \"Jews will not replace us.\" Biden now governs a country no less divided than when he took office in 2021, most statistics show.\n\nThe FBI reported a 36% increase in anti-Jewish hate crime incidents between 2021 and 2022, the latest year for which data is available, as well as a jump in crimes against Black Americans and gay men. CAMPUS PROTEST POLITICS\n\nTrump has sought to exploit Democratic divisions over Israel's response and widening college protests to improve Republicans' lot with Jewish voters, who traditionally vote Democratic. Police crackdowns on some campuses have given ammunition to Trump's claim that U.S. cities are under siege from violent crime, illegal migration and out-of-control leftist policies. Trump's Republican Party has argued that the protests are driven by antisemitism.\n\n\"Jewish Americans are realizing that the Democrat Party has turned into a full-blown anti-Israel, antisemitic, pro-terrorist cabal,\" said Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson. Biden has asked the Department of Education to provide colleges with examples of antisemitic discrimination that could lead to a federal civil rights investigation, and technology firms to determine the best ways to monitor antisemitism online.\n\nAbout seven in 10 U.S. Jewish voters support Democrats, while three in 10 are Republican-aligned, according to the Pew Research Center. Kenneth Stern, director of the Bard Center for the Study of Hate, who helped craft a modern \"working definition of antisemitism,\" said the word is being misused to stifle protected speech about Israel.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill last week that would apply the definition Stern helped develop to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws on college campuses. Stern opposes the bill. \"I don't think that you can combat hatred of any type effectively with weak democratic institutions,\" said Stern. \"When we have a government that decides it's going to stop certain things from being said, that creates an opportunity for totalitarianism, authoritarianism, and that's never good for the Jews.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoating", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scapegoating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hate crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_S._Stern", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth S.

We give voice to the six million Jews who were systematically targeted, murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators during World War II,\" Mr. Biden said in his address at the Capitol on Tuesday, adding that \"we recommit\" to heeding the lessons of \"one of the darkest chapters in human history to revitalize and realize the responsibility of never again.\"\n\nThe president said the \"hatred of Jews didn't begin with the Holocaust, and didn't end with the Holocaust either.\" He added that it continues to lie \"deep in the hearts of too many people in the world,\" and was brought to life on Oct. 7.\n\n\"Now, here we are, not 75 years later, but just 7 1/2 months later, and people are already forgetting, they're already forgetting that Hamas released this terror,\" Mr. Biden said. \"I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget.\"\n\nSince the attack, there's been a \"ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world,\" Mr. Biden said. He said too many people are \"denying, downplaying, rationalizing, ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust.\"\n\n\"It's absolutely despicable and it must stop,\" the president said.\n\nThe remarks come as demonstrations against Israel's ongoing war with Hamas and its toll on Palestinians in Gaza have come to a fever pitch in recent weeks, with protests at American college campuses that have cropped up throughout the country. Some of the demonstrations have featured antisemitic rhetoric that has prompted concerns about the safety of Jewish students on campuses.\n\nNumerous political leaders have condemned antisemitic rhetoric on college campuses in recent weeks. And particularly among Republicans, the issue has become a rallying cry, as they've seized on a reluctance from university presidents to call out the rhetoric on their campuses. That ire has also shifted to the president himself more recently, as House Speaker Mike Johnson has put political pressure on Mr. Biden. Johnson also spoke at Tuesday's event.\n\n\"We must protect our Jewish students and we must give our full-throated unequivocal support to the nation of Israel,\" Johnson said. \"This is our moment.\"\n\nLast week, the president addressed the protests on college campuses, saying \"order must prevail,\" though he noted that \"dissent is essential to democracy.\" Despite pressure from Republicans, he told reporters that the National Guard should not intervene.\n\nIn his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Biden highlighted the administration's efforts to protect Jewish Americans from antisemitism. And he walked a fine line that other officials have been treading in recent weeks of upholding Americans' right to free speech while condemning acts that go too far, putting Jewish students and others in danger.\n\n\"In America, we respect and protect the fundamental right to free speech,\" Mr. Biden said. \"But there is no place on any campus in America, any place in America, for antisemitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind.\"\n\nThe remarks come amid a precarious moment in the war in Gaza, after Israel appeared to move forward Tuesday with an offensive in the heavily populated southern city of Rafah, while cease-fire negotiations remain up in the air.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Never forgetting means we must keep telling the story, we must keep teaching the truth,\" Biden said at the U.S. Capitol's Emancipation Hall. \"The truth is we're at risk of people not knowing the truth.\"\n\nBiden spoke seven months to the day after the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 by Israeli tallies, in what he has called the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust.\n\n\"This hatred (of Jews) continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness,\" Biden said.\n\n\"Now here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting ... that Hamas unleashed this terror,\" he said. \"I have not forgotten, nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\nBiden's speech comes as Israel's retaliation has killed nearly 35,000 people in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, according to Gaza health authorities, left many of the area's 2.3 million people on the brink of starvation and sparked protests in the U.S. demanding that universities and Biden withdraw support for Israel.\n\nBiden acknowledged Americans' right to protest and demonstrate, but didn't mention the Gaza deaths.\n\n\"We know scapegoating and demonizing any minority is a threat to every minority,\" Biden said. \"There is no place on any campus in America for antisemitism, hate speech or threats of violence of any kind.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli forces seized the main border crossing between Egypt and southern Gaza, shutting down a vital aid route for Palestinian civilians as they prepared a possible offensive aimed at eliminating Hamas fighters.\n\nMany Jewish Americans have been critical of Israel's Gaza attacks, leading protests against actions of right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government and condemning Netanyahu in Congress.\n\nBiden said his commitment to Israel was ironclad, even amid disagreements with the country's government. The U.S. government has been holding up several shipments of weapons to Israel, a source told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nANTISEMITISM, HATE CRIMES JUMP\n\nLaw enforcement and advocacy groups report a sharp rise in antisemitic attacks in the U.S. since Oct. 7, as well as anti-Muslim attacks. Some Americans favor zero-tolerance policies defining antisemitism broadly, while others see the threat of attacks against Jews being used to limit legitimate criticism of U.S. support for Israel.\n\n\"Antisemitism is reaching crisis levels in our country,\" said Carol Ann Schwartz, national president of Hadassah, a women's Zionist organization that has been consulted by the White House.\n\nBiden, who is in a tight race for the White House with Republican rival Donald Trump, pledged to unite the country.\n\nHe said he was inspired to run by then-President Trump's response to the 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, white nationalist rally, where marchers chanted, \"Jews will not replace us.\" Biden now governs a country no less divided than when he took office in 2021, most statistics show.\n\nThe FBI reported a 36% increase in anti-Jewish hate crime incidents between 2021 and 2022, the latest year for which data is available, as well as a jump in crimes against Black Americans and gay men.\n\nCAMPUS PROTEST POLITICS\n\nTrump has sought to exploit Democratic divisions over Israel's response and widening college protests to improve Republicans' lot with Jewish voters, who traditionally vote Democratic.\n\nPolice crackdowns on some campuses have given ammunition to Trump's claim that U.S. cities are under siege from violent crime, illegal migration and out-of-control leftist policies. Trump's Republican Party has argued that the protests are driven by antisemitism.\n\n\"Jewish Americans are realizing that the Democrat Party has turned into a full-blown anti-Israel, antisemitic, pro-terrorist cabal,\" said Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson.\n\nBiden has asked the Department of Education to provide colleges with examples of antisemitic discrimination that could lead to a federal civil rights investigation, and technology firms to determine the best ways to monitor antisemitism online.\n\nAbout seven in 10 U.S. Jewish voters support Democrats, while three in 10 are Republican-aligned, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nKenneth Stern, director of the Bard Center for the Study of Hate, who helped craft a modern \"working definition of antisemitism,\" said the word is being misused to stifle protected speech about Israel.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill last week that would apply the definition Stern helped develop to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws on college campuses. Stern opposes the bill.\n\n\"I don't think that you can combat hatred of any type effectively with weak democratic institutions,\" said Stern. \"When we have a government that decides it's going to stop certain things from being said, that creates an opportunity for totalitarianism, authoritarianism, and that's never good for the Jews.\"", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType":

In some cases, the demonstrations have included antisemitic rhetoric and harassment targeting Jewish students.\n\n\"I understand people have strong beliefs and deep convictions about the world,\" the president said. But, he added, \"there is no place on any campus in America, any place in America, for antisemitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind.\"\n\nBiden also denounced attempts to minimize the Hamas attacks, which killed 1,200 people in Israel and sparked a war that has killed an estimated 34,000 people in Gaza.\n\n\"Now here we are, not 75 years later, but just 7 1/2 months later, and people are already forgetting,\" Biden said. \"They are already forgetting. That Hamas unleashed this terror. It was Hamas that brutalized Israelis. It was Hamas who took and continues to hold hostages.\n\n\"I have not forgotten, nor have you,\" he told the crowd of more than 100, including Holocaust survivors. \"And we will not forget.\"\n\nSince the outset of the war, Biden has faced criticism from Arab Americans and Palestinians who have said they don't hear Biden talk about the plight of their people with the same empathy and emotion that he uses to describe Israel and the Jewish people.\n\nThe leader of the World Food Program has said that parts of Gaza are experiencing a \"full-blown famine,\" in part because of Israel blocking humanitarian aid.\n\nJewish groups have been pressuring the administration to take firmer policy steps to combat antisemitism on college campuses, in particular. On Tuesday, the Biden administration fulfilled some of those requests.\n\nThe Education Department's Office for Civil Rights released new guidance to every school and college outlining examples of antisemitic discrimination, as well as other forms of hate, that could lead to investigations for violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nThe law prohibits discrimination based on race, color and national origin, and the department has interpreted it as extending to Jewish students. Since the Oct. 7 attack, the department has opened more than 100 investigations into complaints about antisemitism and other forms of discrimination. The administration also announced that the Department of Homeland Security would offer new resources, including an online campus safety resource guide.\n\nNathan Diament, executive director for public policy for the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations, one of the groups that has been lobbying the administration for more measures for weeks, said that the Jewish community \"need them implemented rapidly and aggressively.\"\n\n\"President Biden's speech today was an important statement of moral clarity at a time when too many people seem to be morally confused,\" Diament said. \"Just as important as the president's words today is the announcement that his administration is taking more steps to counter the surge of antisemitism in the U.S.\"\n\nThe president promised that his commitment to the security of Israel \"and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad. Even when we disagree,\" a reference to the arguments his administration has had with Israel's right-wing government about the toll the war is taking in Gaza. The speech came against the backdrop of Israel's plans to move forward with a ground operation in Rafah, which Biden opposes. More than 1 million Palestinians are sheltering in Rafah.\n\nBiden made a tacit acknowledgment during his speech that the pro-Palestinian cause has resonated with other minority groups with histories of violence and oppression.\n\n\"We must give hate no safe harbor against anyone -- anyone,\" Biden said in his speech, adding that Jewish people helped lead civil rights causes throughout history.\n\n\"From that experience,\" he added, \"we know scapegoating and demonizing any minority is a threat to every minority and the very foundation of our democracy.\"", "source": {"uri":

(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Joe Biden aimed straight at American Jewish anxieties of the moment in a speech commemorating the Holocaust, pledging to keep alive the memory of Hamas's Oct. 7 massacres in the face of waves of anti-Israel and antisemitic actions.\n\n\"I see your fear, your hurt, your pain,\" Biden said Tuesday at the annual commemoration at the U.S. Capitol, organized by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. \"Let me reassure you as your president, you are not alone.\" The audience of Holocaust survivors, Jewish lawmakers, students and Jewish officials applauded.\n\nBiden's pledge comes as Israel launches a major operation in Rafah targeting Hamas, whose terrorists launched the war on Oct. 7, and as public sentiment -- especially among Democrats, long the political home of the Jewish community -- turns against Israel over a war that has seen a large number of civilian casualties.\n\nGet The Jewish News Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\n\"Here we are not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, people are already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror,\" Biden said, flanked by the flags of the U.S. military units that liberated Nazi death and concentration camps. \"I have not forgotten and nor have you, and we will not forget.\" The audience applauded again.\n\nBiden drew a direct line between Holocaust denial, long entrenched as a facet of antisemitism, and the tendency by some to minimise or even deny the atrocities of Oct. 7.\n\n\"Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalising, ignoring horrors of the Holocaust and October 7, including Hamas's appalling use of sexual violence, torture and terrorising,\" he said. \"It's absolutely despicable and must stop.\"\n\nBiden, like virtually every other speaker, addressed the pro-Palestinian campus protests that have swept universities across the nation, in some cases culminating in violence and police raids. As he did last week in a special statement, he said he would uphold free speech but drew the line at violence and hate speech.\n\n\"There's no place on any campus in America, any place in America for antisemitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind,\" he said.\n\nOther speakers included House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican; Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, and Abe Foxman, a Holocaust survivor and the former national director off the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nJohnson has been leading efforts by Republicans to tie the campus protests to the Biden administration, as well as link them to right-wing accusations of a liberal drift in academia. In his remarks, he compared the campus pro-Palestinian protests to the assault on Jewish students and academics before and during the Holocaust.\n\n\"We remember what happened then, and today, we are witnessing American universities quickly become hostile places for Jewish students and faculty,\" said Johnson.\n\nBiden's speech comes a year after his administration launched a strategy to combat antisemitism.\n\nThe White House before the speech listed new measures under the strategy that it would launch in coming days, including a letter from the Department of Education to schools and universities around the country outlining how expressions of antisemitism could spark investigations. Dozens of campuses have been investigated since Oct. 7.\n\nAlso listed were a planned guide for campus safety resources, and the development of best practices to prevent violence, both spearheaded by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe State Department's office of the special envoy to combat antisemitism, Deborah Lipstadt, would convene tech companies to discuss how best to deal with online antisemitic content, the White House said in its release.", "source": {"uri": "jewishnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Never forgetting means we must keep telling the story, we must keep teaching the truth,\" Biden said as he addressed a bipartisan memorial held at the U.S. Capitol's Emancipation Hall. \"The truth is we're at risk of people not knowing the truth.\"\n\nBiden spoke in a keynote address for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual National Commemoration of the Days of Remembrance, seven months to the day after the Palestinian militant group Hamas led an attack in Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people, by Israeli tallies.\n\n\"People are already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror,\" he said. \"I have not forgotten, nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\nBiden's speech comes as Israel's retaliation has killed nearly 35,000 people in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, according to Gaza health authorities, and left many of the area's 2.3 million people on the brink of starvation.\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli forces seized the main border crossing between Egypt and southern Gaza, shutting down a vital aid route for Palestinian civilians as they prepared a possible offensive aimed at eliminating Hamas fighters.\n\nBiden aimed to cool a divided and divisive U.S. debate about Jewish security, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel.\n\nHe lamented what he called a \"ferocious surge of antisemitism\" and the presence of \"vicious propaganda on social media\" while stressing that his commitment to Israel was \"ironclad\" even amid disagreements with the country's government.\n\nThe Biden administration has expressed concerns about the potential humanitarian impact of a military campaign in Rafah, but the president said Tuesday that, \"my commitment to the safety of the Jewish people and Israel is ironclad even when we disagree.\"\n\nMany Jewish Americans have been critical of Israel's Gaza attacks, leading protests against actions of right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government and condemning Netanyahu in Congress.\n\nBiden spoke about divisive protests at U.S. colleges and universities over the Israeli military's campaign in Gaza for the second time in five days on Tuesday, and said that while the country upholds freedom of speech and assembly, Jewish students should be free from harassment and verbal attacks on campuses.\n\n\"We're not a lawless country, we are a civil society,\" he said.\n\nOn Monday, Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice-President Kamala Harris and the first Jewish spouse of a nationally elected American leader, met with Jewish college students at the White House about the administration's efforts to combat antisemitism. Emhoff heard students describe their own experiences with hatred, including threats of violence and hate speech, his office said.\n\nBiden and Republican rival Donald Trump are expected to again be the two main party candidates for president in the Nov. 5 election.\n\nBiden has said he was inspired to run in the 2020 election by then-president Trump's response three years earlier to the Charlottesville, Va., white nationalist rally, where marchers chanted \"Jews will not replace us.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, he did not mention Trump, who has sought to exploit Democratic divisions over Israel's military campaign in Gaza and the widening college protests.\n\nWhile Trump's administration offered full-throated support for Israel, including moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and not disputing a previous Netanyahu government's expansion of contentious Jewish settlements on disputed territory, the candidate himself has been accused of dealing in antisemitic tropes.\n\nOn a podcast earlier this year, Trump said that \"any Jewish person that votes for Democrats hates their religion.\"\n\n\"They hate everything about Israel, and they should be ashamed of themselves because Israel will be destroyed,\" he told a radio show hosted by Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump administration official.\n\nAbout seven in 10 U.S. Jewish voters support Democrats, while three in 10 are Republican-aligned, according to the Pew Research Center. Many political analysts say that Jewish voters typically do not choose a president based on foreign policy alone.\n\nTrump's Republican Party has argued that the campus protests are driven by antisemitism.\n\nLaw enforcement and advocacy groups report a sharp rise in antisemitic attacks in the United States since Oct. 7, as well anti-Muslim attacks. The FBI reported a 36 per cent increase in anti-Jewish hate crime incidents between 2021 and 2022, the latest year for which data is available.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news",

Biden warned on Tuesday that the threat of antisemitism is growing in the United States, including on college campuses, as his support for Israel's assault on Gaza divides Democrats and alienates some young voters.\n\nIn a speech honoring the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust, Mr. Biden joined a heated American debate about Jewish security, Zionism, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel.\n\nAddressing a bipartisan audience at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual commemoration, he warned of the risk that the truth about the systematic killing of Jews during World War II would be lost.\n\n\"'Never again' simply translated for me means: Never forget. Never forgetting means we must keep telling the story, we must keep teaching the truth,\" Mr. Biden said at the US Capitol's Emancipation Hall. \"The truth is we're at risk of people not knowing the truth.\"\n\nBiden spoke seven months to the day after the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 by Israeli tallies, in what he has called the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust.\n\n\"This hatred (of Jews) continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness,\" Mr. Biden said.\n\n\"Now here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting ... that Hamas unleashed this terror,\" he said. \"I have not forgotten, nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\nMr. Biden's speech comes as Israel's retaliation has killed nearly 35,000 people in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, according to Gaza health authorities, left many of the area's 2.3 million people on the brink of starvation and sparked protests in the US demanding that universities and Mr. Biden withdraw support for Israel.\n\nMr. Biden acknowledged Americans' right to protest and demonstrate but didn't mention the Gaza deaths.\n\n\"We know scapegoating and demonizing any minority is a threat to every minority,\" Mr. Biden said. \"There is no place on any campus in America for antisemitism, hate speech or threats of violence of any kind.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli forces seized the main border crossing between Egypt and southern Gaza, shutting down a vital aid route for Palestinian civilians as they prepared a possible offensive aimed at eliminating Hamas fighters.\n\nMany Jewish Americans have been critical of Israel's Gaza attacks, leading protests against actions of right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government and condemning Netanyahu in Congress.\n\nMr. Biden said his commitment to Israel was ironclad, even amid disagreements with the country's government. The US government has been holding up several shipments of weapons to Israel, a source told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nANTISEMITISM, HATE CRIMES JUMP\n\nLaw enforcement and advocacy groups report a sharp rise in antisemitic attacks in the US since Oct. 7, as well as anti-Muslim attacks. Some Americans favor zero-tolerance policies defining antisemitism broadly, while others see the threat of attacks against Jews being used to limit legitimate criticism of US support for Israel. \"Antisemitism is reaching crisis levels in our country,\" said Carol Ann Schwartz, national president of Hadassah, a women's Zionist organization that has been consulted by the White House.\n\nMr. Biden, who is in a tight race for the White House with Republican rival Donald Trump, pledged to unite the country.\n\nHe said he was inspired to run by then-President Trump's response to the 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, white nationalist rally, where marchers chanted, \"Jews will not replace us.\" Mr. Biden now governs a country no less divided than when he took office in 2021, most statistics show.\n\nThe FBI reported a 36% increase in anti-Jewish hate crime incidents between 2021 and 2022, the latest year for which data is available, as well as a jump in crimes against Black Americans and gay men.\n\nCAMPUS PROTEST POLITICS\n\nTrump has sought to exploit Democratic divisions over Israel's response and widening college protests to improve Republicans' lot with Jewish voters, who traditionally vote Democratic.\n\nPolice crackdowns on some campuses have given ammunition to Trump's claim that US cities are under siege from violent crime, illegal migration and out-of-control leftist policies. Trump's Republican Party has argued that the protests are driven by antisemitism.\n\n\"Jewish Americans are realizing that the Democrat Party has turned into a full-blown anti-Israel, antisemitic, pro-terrorist cabal,\" said Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson.\n\nMr. Biden has asked the Department of Education to provide colleges with examples of antisemitic discrimination that could lead to a federal civil rights investigation, and technology firms to determine the best ways to monitor antisemitism online.\n\nAbout seven in 10 US Jewish voters support Democrats, while three in 10 are Republican-aligned, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nKenneth Stern, director of the Bard Center for the Study of Hate, who helped craft a modern \"working definition of antisemitism,\" said the word is being misused to stifle protected speech about Israel.\n\nThe US House of Representatives passed a bill last week that would apply the definition Mr. Stern helped develop to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws on college campuses. Mr. Stern opposes the bill.\n\n\"I don't think that you can combat hatred of any type effectively with weak democratic institutions,\" said Stern. \"When we have a government that decides it's going to stop certain things from being said, that creates an opportunity for totalitarianism, authoritarianism, and that's never good for the Jews.\" -- Reuters", "source": {"uri": "bworldonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessWorld"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoating", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scapegoating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hate crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_S._Stern", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth S.

Green and Michael D. Shear NYT News Service/Syndicate Stories\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden declared on Tuesday that hatred of Jews \"continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people,\" saying there has been a \"ferocious surge of antisemitism\" in the United States following the attacks by Hamas that killed 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7.\n\nSpeaking at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's Days of Remembrance, Biden demanded that Americans learn the lessons of what he called one of the \"darkest chapters in human history\" by opposing attacks on Jews.\n\n\"People are already forgetting, are already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror,\" Biden said from Emancipation Hall on Capitol Hill. \"It was Hamas that brutalized Israelis. It was Hamas that took and continues to hold hostages. I have not forgotten.\"\n\nBiden's address came during weeks of protests on U.S. college campuses against Israel's war in the Gaza Strip, with students demanding that the Biden administration stop sending arms to Israel. In some cases, the demonstrations have included antisemitic rhetoric and harassment targeting Jewish students.\n\n\"I understand people have strong beliefs and deep convictions about the world and America,\" the president said, referring to the protests. But, he added, \"there is no place on any campus in America, any place in America, for antisemitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind.\"\n\nHe said destroying property does not constitute a peaceful protest.\n\n\"It's against the law,\" he said. \"We're a civil society. We uphold the rule of law, and no one should have to hide or be brave just to be themselves.\"\n\nThe president vowed that his commitment to the security of Israel \"and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad. Even when we disagree,\" a reference to the arguments his administration has had with Israel's right-wing government about the deaths of tens of thousands of people in Gaza.\n\nBut he focused most of his remarks on the responsibility that Americans have to push back against what he called an \"ancient desire to wipe out the Jewish people off the face of the Earth.\" He said that desire was the driving force behind the Oct. 7 attacks.\n\nHere's what else to know:\n\n-- The speech comes at a critical moment for Biden, who has struggled to balance his support for Israel's war against Hamas with outrage over the toll it has taken on civilians in Gaza. Jewish groups have been pressuring the administration to take firmer actions to combat antisemitism.\n\n-- On Tuesday, the administration will release guidance from the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights to every school and college outlining examples of antisemitic discrimination, as well as other forms of hate, that could lead to investigations for violating the Civil Rights Act. The law prohibits discrimination based on race, color and national origin, and the department has interpreted it as extending to Jewish students. Since the Oct. 7 attack, the department has opened more than 100 investigations into complaints about antisemitism and other forms of discrimination.\n\n-- For months, Biden has faced fierce criticism over his support for Israel, even from within his own party.

In America, we respect and protect the fundamental right to free speech. To debate and disagree. To protest peacefully and make our voices heard. ...

Protestors have called for their institutions to divest from businesses that are tied to Israel and have called for a ceasefire.\n\n\"We've seen a ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world,\" Biden said. \"There is no place on any campus in America, any place in America for antisemitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind.\"\n\nBiden last week commended students' peaceful protests, while criticizing those that turned violent.\n\nAs the war reaches its seven-month mark, more than 34,000 Palestinians - 13,000 of them children - have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The war began after Hamas militants killed about 1,200 Israelis and foreigners and took 199 people hostage on Oct. 7.\n\nBiden announced several new administration initiatives to combat antisemitism Tuesday.\n\nThe Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights will issue new guidance to all school districts and colleges to provide examples of antisemitic discrimination and how those instances can violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nThe agency said it has opened more than 100 investigations in the past \"seven months into complaints alleging discrimination based on shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, including Antisemitism.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security will also build an online campus safety resource guide and develop best practices for \"community-based targeted violence and terrorism prevention to reduce these assaults and attacks,\" according to a fact sheet provided by the White House.\n\nThe Department of State also has an agency, the Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism, which will convene technology firms to identify best practices for addressing antisemitism content online.\n\nBiden was joined Tuesday by GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and Democratic House Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York.\n\nThe House last week passed legislation to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism for the Department of Education's enforcement of the Civil Rights Act. All schools that receive federal funding are required to comply with that law.\n\nSome Democrats have raised concerns that the language is too broad and could lead to restrictions on freedom of speech.\n\nThe lead drafter of the definition, Kenneth Stern, then an antisemitism expert with the American Jewish Committee, has repeatedly opposed the definition, raising concerns when the Trump administration tried to issue an executive order similar to the recent House bill.\n\n\"It was never intended to be a campus hate speech code, but that's what Donald Trump's executive order accomplished this week,\" Stern wrote in 2019. \"This order is an attack on academic freedom and free speech, and will harm not only pro-Palestinian advocates, but also Jewish students and faculty, and the academy itself.\"\n\nJohnson is also leading a House-wide effort to address the college campus protests, such as grilling university presidents and threatening to pull federal funding from those institutions.\n\nMembers of the House Education and Workforce Committee grilled Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona on Tuesday about antisemitism on college campuses. Several similar hearings are scheduled in the coming weeks.\n\n\"We are witnessing American universities quickly becoming hostile places for Jewish students and faculty,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson said there has been a rise in antisemitism since Oct. 7, which was the most deadly attack on Jews since the Holocaust.\n\n\"The threat of repeating the past is so great,\" Johnson said. \"There are

The report found that the number of antisemitic incidents in the U.S. more than doubled between 2022 and 2023, from 3,697 to 7,523. Of that increase, 52 percent of the 2023 total occurred after October 7. In France, the number of incidents quadrupled.\n\n\"For those whose views serve an anti-Jewish and anti-Zionist ideological and instrumentalist purpose, October 7 was a golden opportunity to advance further their hateful and racist fringe perspectives into mainstream conservative discourse, using it to attack rivals, mobilize supporters and attract new followers,\" the authors of the U.S. chapter of the report wrote.\n\n\"The year is not 1938, not even 1933,\" professor Uriya Shavit, head of the Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry and the Irwin Cotler Institute at Tel Aviv University, added in an accompanying press release. \"Yet if current trends continue, the curtain will descend on the ability to lead Jewish lives in the West -- to wear a Star of David, attend synagogues and community centers, send kids to Jewish schools, frequent a Jewish club on campus, or speak Hebrew.\"\n\nMost American Jews have never had to ask themselves whether it is prudent to live unapologetically Jewish lives. Now, this is becoming an open question.\n\nMore from Robert Kuttner\n\nAs campus protests have escalated, President Biden has spoken out only intermittently, strongly condemning the increased antisemitism, and warning that rights of free expression do not extend to intimidation and violence. For his first major speech on these issues, Biden has chosen today -- May 7, the day after Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day -- as the occasion, and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum as the venue.\n\nBiden will probably stick closely to the narrative themes of the ADL report. If so, he will be missing an opportunity to sort out all that is darkening democracy, and to demonstrate real leadership that could help resolve the impasse in the Mideast, disassociate himself from the Netanyahu government's vile killings of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, and restore his own credibility as president.\n\nThe crisis that has escalated since October 7 is partly about antisemitism, but that's not all it's about. And as even the ADL report obliquely concedes, Israel's behavior since then has been a gift to antisemites.\n\nBiden will likely begin, as he should, by affirming the horror of the Holocaust and resolving with Jews everywhere, \"Never again.\" He will deplore the increase in antisemitic threats and actions, and commit his presidency to keeping Jews safe and free in America.\n\nAll good, and necessary. The challenge is where Biden goes from there.\n\nGiven his temporizing on conditioning U.S. military aid to Israel on an end to the killing, starvation, and forced removal of Palestinians in Gaza, I am not optimistic that Biden will seize the moment to broaden the conversation. But no American president has better bona fides on these issues than Joe Biden, who went far beyond what might have been expected to help Israel after the slaughter of some 1,200 Israelis, the overwhelming majority of them civilians.\n\nA majority of Americans now oppose what Israel is doing to Gaza, and a majority of Americans are not antisemites.\n\nBiden needs to point out that after the Hamas massacres of October 7, there was worldwide compassion for Israelis and near universal condemnation of Hamas. But Prime Minister Netanyahu has squandered that goodwill and isolated Israel as a global pariah.\n\nA majority of Americans now oppose what Israel is doing to Gaza, and a majority of Americans are not antisemites. According to the latest Gallup poll, Americans disapprove of Israel's military actions in Gaza by a stunning margin of 55 to 36 percent. And that poll was taken in March. If anything, the disapproval has grown since then.\n\nMost younger American Jews oppose the barbaric acts of the Netanyahu government. To conflate criticism of Netanyahu's own corruption and destruction of Gaza with antisemitism, however, only plays into Netanyahu's hands.\n\nParadoxically, Holocaust Remembrance Day would be an ideal moment for Biden to distinguish antisemitism from criticism of the actions of the Netanyahu government. Biden should finally make clear that American military aid to Israel will end if Netanyahu carries out his new orders of forced relocations to Palestinians who have already been forced out of their homes at least once, as the prelude to an invasion of Rafah that the U.S. says it can't accept.\n\nUntil now, the White House language on that subject has been equivocal and mealymouthed. At the press briefing last Friday, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, \"There's more than a million Palestinian civilians living in -- well, seeking refuge in -- in Rafah. And we want to make sure that their lives are protected.\" This implies that if Netanyahu can protect their lives with another round of forced removal, then invasion under those conditions is somehow OK.\n\nBiden also needs to make it crystal clear that Netanyahu must stop sabotaging talks on a cease-fire and hostage release, just as he sabotaged the terms of the Oslo Accords. Otherwise, U.S. military aid will halt.\n\nOn the related topic of the campus protests, Biden can help Americans sort out some key distinctions that have gotten blurred in the welter of hysterical press coverage and the craven behavior of too many college presidents. Last Thursday, Biden said, \"Violent protest is not protected. Peaceful protest is ... Destroying property is not a peaceful protest. It's against the law.\"\n\nYes, but the reality is more complicated. There are large gray areas in recent protest activities, and panicky college presidents have been too quick to call in police. Most college protests have included a range of protesters, from critics of Netanyahu's inhuman actions who defend Israel's right to exist, to militant supporters of Palestine for whom \"From the river to the sea\" really does mean the obliteration of Israel.\n\nAnd while even vile speech is protected by the First Amendment, explicit threats and violent acts are not. But the most extremist of the protesters, both pro-Palestine and pro-Zion, have deliberately and opportunistically used violence in order to provoke excessive responses, and college presidents have played into their hands. As our colleague Harold Meyerson has reported, at one of the most violent campus episodes, at UCLA, the violence was instigated by far-right Jews, who are the domestic counterparts of Netanyahu.\n\nAs an Irish American, Biden may know the old Irish pub joke in which a brawl is in progress at a bar and a bystander asks, \"Is this a private fight or can anybody get into it?\"\n\nThe simplest way that Biden can cut these several knots is to end the unqualified support for Netanyahu's actions.\n\nOnce campus protests turn into brawls, they attract a range of militants with their own opportunistic agendas, from genuine antisemites to far-right Jews. Biden has no power to contain student protests. But he does have the power to address their root cause -- Israel's brutalization of civilians in Gaza.\n\nYes, antisemitism has been on the rise for several years, and one cause was Trump's dog-whistle signals to the far right and his occasionally explicit defense of overt thuggery directed against Jews, as in the Charlottesville \"Unite the Right\" march of August 2017. But what supercharged the latest upsurge are events the Mideast. Netanyahu, his apologists, and true antisemites are doing each other's bidding.\n\nOnce again, Netanyahu has mocked Biden. On Sunday, in a speech marking Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day, Netanyahu said in English, \"If Israel is forced to stand alone, Israel will stand alone.\" And on the same day, Israel issued explicit warnings to residents of part of Rafah to flee for their lives in advance of the latest invasion, Washington's objections be damned.\n\nThe simplest way that Biden can cut these several knots is to end the unqualified support for Netanyahu's actions, thus making clear by his own actions that criticism of the Israeli government is not tantamount to antisemitism.\n\nWill Biden rise to the occasion? Or will he take his cue from the narrative of the ADL and AIPAC, which work to brand all such criticism as per se antisemitic?\n\nThe fact is that conservative Jewish organizations do not speak for most American Jews. But they have inordinate influence in the corridors of power.\n\nBiden has surprised us before. Given his own history, he has turned out to be a far more progressive president that most of us anticipated. Reflexive support for Israel is part of Biden's history. But the Israel of that era is not the Israel of Netanyahu. Perhaps Biden will surprise us again.", "source": {"uri": "prospect.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The American Prospect"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_kuttner@prospect.org", "name": "Robert

In America, we respect and protect the fundamental right to free speech. To debate and disagree. To protest peacefully and make our voices heard. ... But there is no place on any campus in America, any place in America, for antisemitism and hate speech, or threats of violence of any kind,\" Biden said to applause at the event, hosted by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in the Capitol Visitor Center's Emancipation Hall.\n\n\"Violent attacks, destroying property is not peaceful protest. It's against the law. And we're not a lawless country, we're a civil society. We uphold the rule of law,\" Biden continued.\n\nThe event featured congressional leaders, Holocaust survivors and their descendants. Biden hugged the survivors and dabbed at his eyes with a tissue as he spoke with them.\n\nHis keynote address amounted to an unequivocal statement of support for Israel, delivered at a politically fraught moment. Biden has attempted to strike a delicate balance in recent weeks, at times criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the counteroffensive Israel launched after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack.\n\nThat attack killed around 1,200 people, according to the Israeli government. Meanwhile, officials in Gaza say Israel's military campaign has killed more than 34,000. On Monday, Israel appeared poised to invade Rafah, a southern Gazan city where it's estimated more than 1 million people are sheltering, despite concerns from the international community and opposition from Biden.\n\nNevertheless, Biden rallied support for Israel as he denounced antisemitism in all forms in his remarks, urging people to remember the horrors of the Holocaust and of Oct. 7.\n\n\"Here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven-and-a-half months later, and people are already forgetting ... that Hamas unleashed this terror,\" Biden said. \"That it was Hamas that brutalized Israelis. It was Hamas that took and continues to hold hostages. I have not forgotten and nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\n\"We've seen a ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world,\" the president said. \"On college campuses, Jewish students blocked, harassed, attacked while walking to class. ... It's absolutely despicable, and it must stop.\"\n\nBut Biden's steadfast support of Israel, even as he splits with Netanyahu, has angered progressive Democrats and done little to assuage Republicans, who've seized on the chaos and at times characterized Biden's response to reports of antisemitism on campus as tepid.\n\nWithout naming names, Johnson on Tuesday took aim at those trying to \"downplay and justify what happened on Oct. 7.\"\n\n\"There are some who would prefer to criticize Israel and lecture them on their military tactics -- they would rather do that than punish the terrorists who perpetrated these horrific crimes,\" Johnson said.\n\nBut Johnson also went further, attempting to draw a straight line between Nazism and American college campuses. He recalled the rise of antisemitism among academia and students during the Third Reich and the Nazis' takeover of the University of Strasbourg during World War II.\n\n\"We remember what happened then, and now today, we are witnessing American universities quickly becoming hostile places for Jewish students and faculty. The very campuses which were once the envy of the international academy, have succumbed to an antisemitic virus,\" said Johnson.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries offered a slightly more nuanced take, calling for an end not only to antisemitism, but to \"racism, sexism, Islamophobia, xenophobia, homophobia, and all other forms of hatred together. That's the American way.\"\n\nAntisemitic incidents have been documented at colleges across the country. In a report last week, the Anti-Defamation League and Tel Aviv University found a \"steep\" increase in antisemitic incidents in Western countries since Oct. 7.\n\nBut supporters of the protests argue those engaging in antisemitism are small in number and are not representative of the larger effort. They also point out that progressive Jewish students, professors and activists have played an active role in the pro-Palestinian campus movement.\n\nThose protesters, as well as some progressive congressional staffers, have sought to highlight how Israel's military response has created a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\n\nCongressional Staff for a Ceasefire Now, an anonymous group of aides calling for an end to the war, exhorted American leaders to intervene in a statement on Monday. The group said congressional staff have received many messages \"from constituents demanding an immediate ceasefire, a surge of humanitarian aid, and the release of all hostages.\"\n\n\"As over 1.5 million Palestinian civilians await a brutal invasion of Rafah, as Gazan children starve from a man-made famine, and as over 100 unaccounted-for Israeli hostages may be in the line of fire, we are calling on President Biden and our bosses in Congress to listen to their constituents as we have: Demand an immediate end to Israel's assault on the civilians of Gaza before it is too late,\" the group wrote.", "source": {"uri": "rollcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roll Call"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_papp@rollcall.com", "name": "Justin Papp", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Some of the demonstrations have featured antisemitic rhetoric that has prompted concerns about the safety of Jewish students on campuses.\n\nNumerous political leaders have condemned antisemitic rhetoric on college campuses in recent weeks. And particularly among Republicans, the issue has become a rallying cry, as they've seized on a reluctance from university presidents to call out the rhetoric on their campuses. That ire has also shifted to the president himself more recently, as House Speaker Mike Johnson has put political pressure on Mr. Biden. Johnson is also set to speak at Tuesday's event.\n\nLast week, the president addressed the protests on college campuses, saying \"order must prevail,\" though he noted that \"dissent is essential to democracy.\" Despite pressure from Republicans, he told reporters that the National Guard should not intervene.\n\nIn his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Biden is expected to focus on the administration's efforts to protect Jewish Americans from antisemitism. But he'll also walk a fine line that officials have been treading in recent weeks of upholding Americans' right to free speech while condemning acts that go too far, putting Jewish students and others in danger.\n\nThe remarks come amid a precarious moment in the war in Gaza, after Israel appeared to move forward Tuesday with an offensive in the heavily populated southern city of Rafah, while cease-fire negotiations remain up in the air.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/07/c4101b32-cc1d-4250-90c4-84242112c3d3/thumbnail/1200x630/d3a86ce114bb32df58d056efe6d2f697/gettyimages-2151191176.jpg?v=1d6c78a71b7b6252b543a329b3a5744d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545587", "eventUri": "eng-9545587", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 234, "textEnd": 240, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Credit - BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI -- AFP/Getty Images\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday warned of \"the ferocious surge of antisemitism\" in the wake of pro-Palestinian protests that have swept college campuses nationwide over Israel's war with Hamas, and vowed to continue to support Israel.\n\n\"I understand people have strong beliefs and deep convictions about the world,\" Biden said at a ceremony at the U.S. Capitol to remember victims of the Holocaust. \"But there is no place on any campus in America or any place in America for antisemitism or hate speech, or threats of violence of any kind.\"\n\nAs college commencement season begins, many of which have been canceled or disrupted by protests, Biden addressed the climate at American universities. \"On college campuses, Jewish students [have been] blocked, harassed, attacked, while walking to class,\" Biden said. \"Antisemitism, antisemitic posters, slogans calling for the annihilation of Israel, the world's only Jewish state. Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing, ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and Oct. 7... It is absolutely despicable, and it must stop.\n\nBiden's remarks come as he faces increasing pressure to stop sending arms to Israel as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza grows. More than 34,000 people have been killed in Gaza, with many of the area's 2.3 million people on the brink of starvation, following Hamas' kidnapping of more than 200 hostages and killing of 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nRead More: Biden Condemns Campus Unrest Over Israel-Hamas War: 'None of This Is a Peaceful Protest'\n\nBiden on Tuesday signaled that he would continue to support Israel even as his relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has soured over his government's push to invade the southern Gaza city of Razah. \"My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people and Israel is ironclad,\" Biden said, \"even when we disagree.\"\n\nWhile Biden has been a longtime supporter of Israel's right to defend itself, he continues to face intense scrutiny for the civilian casualties and humanitarian crisis resulting from the conflict. Protests at college campuses across the country have erupted over Israel's response and his Administration's handling of the war, highlighting potential problems could face among young voters as he seeks re-election.\n\nBiden said that his Administration is \"working around the clock\" to free remaining hostages in Gaza. Hamas on Monday said it has accepted a ceasefire deal proposed by Egypt and Qatar which seeks to halt the seven-month war with Israel, though it's unclear what the ceasefire deal entails and whether Israel will accept the terms.\n\n\"People are already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror,\" Biden said. \"I have not forgotten.\"\n\nDuring his speech, Biden also honored the memory of the 6 million Jews killed in the Holocaust and reaffirmed his commitment to never forgetting the lessons of \"one of the darkest chapters in human history.\"\n\n\"Never again simply translated for me means: Never forget. Never forgetting means we must keep telling the story, we must keep teaching the truth,\" Biden said. \"The truth is we're at risk of people not knowing the truth.\" Biden connected the Holocaust to the Oct. 7 attack, which was the deadliest day for Jews in Israel since: \"Here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later -- people are already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror...

Both, he said, were \"driven by the ancient desire to wipe out the Jewish people off the face of the earth.\"\n\nBiden spoke with particular conviction as he condemned the violent protests that have played out across college campuses over the war, leaving many Jewish students fearful of attending class.\n\nVoice rising as he talked, the president said, \"To the Jewish community, I want you to know: I see your fear, your hurt, your pain. Let me reassure you, as your president you're not alone. You belong. You always have and you always will.\"\n\nUnderscoring the oddities of the 2024 presidential race, Biden appeared at the same time the presumptive GOP nominee, Donald Trump, sat in a New York City courtroom and listened to the latest witness in his criminal trial: adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nAmerican politics has long been filled with so-called split-screen moments. But this one might rank as the starkest, with Biden talking solemnly about one of the darkest episodes in human history as Daniels recounted having sex with Trump in his hotel room in 2006.\n\nBiden used the speech to define the limits of acceptable campus protest. While students have a distinct right to protest peacefully, they're not free to harass and intimidate Jewish students with whom they may disagree, he said.\n\nHe rattled off ways that campus protesters have abused their freedoms, forcing frightened Jewish students to hide their Jewish stars beneath their shirts.\n\n\"There is no place on any campus in America, or any place in America, for antisemitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind,\" Biden said.\n\n\"We've seen a ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world,\" he added. On college campuses, he said, Jewish students have been \"blocked, harassed and attacked while walking to class.\"\n\nThe Biden administration says it has worked aggressively to combat antisemitism. Last year, the White House released a National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism that outlines more than 100 actions the administration has taken and continues to take to fight antisemitism in the U.S. The strategy involves actions by the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to strengthen security for Jewish institutions, along with actions by the Department of Education to combat antisemitism.\n\nIn the months following Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7, Biden secured $400 million for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program through a supplemental spending bill that passed in February, which provides funding for security improvements and training to nonprofits and houses of worship, especially Jewish institutions.\n\nThe Biden administration on Tuesday announced additional actions by the Departments of Education, Homeland Security and State in an effort to counter antisemitism.\n\nThe Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights issued new guidance to school districts and colleges that provides examples of antisemitism discrimination and other forms of hate that could prompt investigations into civil rights violations.\n\nYet the department has faced criticism from both parties that it has been lax in investigating reports of campus antisemitism. Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D.-N.J., sent a letter to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona last month objecting to the pace of the department's investigations under Title VI of the 1964 civil rights act.\n\n\"While the evidence is often clear and convincing, many Title VI investigations have remained unresolved for months, and even years,\" Gottheimer wrote.\n\nTestifying before the House Education Committee on Tuesday, Cardona said he would consider revoking federal funds from schools that fail to protect students from antisemitic acts.\n\n\"If a school openly refuses to adhere to Title VI, revoking funds is something that I can do and I would do,\" Cardona said.\n\nDHS plans to work with interagency partners to create an online campus safety resources guide and provide assistance to campuses through an accessible website. It will also develop best practices for community-based violence and terrorism prevention.\n\nThe Office of the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism at the Department of State will gather and consult with technology firms to formulate best practices to counter antisemitic content found online.\n\nCORRECTION (May 7, 2024, 2:18 p.m. ET): Due to an editing error, a previous version of this article misstated where Biden gave his speech.

It didn't end with the Holocaust either.\"\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday warned that the threat of antisemitism is growing, in remarks honoring the 6 million Jews killed in the Nazi Holocaust eighty years ago.\n\nAnd his keynote address for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual commemoration of the genocide came seven months to the day after the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 by Israeli tallies.\n\n\"That hatred was brought to life on October 7, in 2023, on a sacred Jewish holiday, the terrorist group Hamas unleashed the deadliest day of the Jewish people since the Holocaust.\"\n\nThe Hamas attack provoked an Israeli retaliation that has so far killed 35,000 residents of the Gaza Strip.\n\nAnd it stirred up dramatic protests on U.S. college campuses by students demanding an end to the Israeli assault. Some Jewish students have said the demonstrations have included harassment and antisemitic instances.\n\nThat comes against a backdrop in already-rising threats. The FBI reported a 36% increase in anti-Jewish hate crime incidents between 2021 and 2022, the latest year for which data is available, as well as a jump in crimes against Black Americans and gay men.\n\nMIKE JOHNSON: \"To every Jewish student listening to us, no matter where you are around the country. You have my word. The U.S. House of Representatives will do everything in our power to ensure that you are safe.\"\n\nRepublicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have condemned pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campuses, painting them as Hamas sympathizers.\n\nIn some cases, police have forcefully torn down student encampments and arrested hundreds. Those arrested include University of Texas at Austin freshman Arwyn Heilrayn.\n\nREPORTER: \"What is your reaction to people saying that these demonstrations are reflecting some antisemitism on campuses?\"\n\nHEILRAYN: \"I would reflect back the voices of the Jewish protesters that have been standing side by side with us, that this is not antisemitic, that this is pro-Palestinian.\"\n\nThe police crackdowns prompted criticism that universities were clamping down on political speech. And Biden has tried to walk a careful line as his own Democratic Party has appeared divided over those sympathetic to Palestinians' plight and others who insist on Israel's right to defend itself.\n\n\"We respect and protect the fundamental right to free speech, to debate and disagree. To protest peacefully, and make our voices heard. I understand, that's America. But there is no place on any campus in America, no place in America, for antisemitism or hate speech, or threats of violence of any kind.\"\n\nBiden sought to reassure Jewish Americans, who overwhelming vote for Democratic candidates, that he would stand with them.\n\n\"To the Jewish community, I want you to know, I see your fear, your hurt and your pain. Let me reassure you, as your president, you are not alone.\"\n\nBiden also said his commitment to Israel was ironclad even amid disagreements with the country's government.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hate crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Texas at Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/video.reutersnews.com/b867d9a7fbb3710febaae6b4ddec51d1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545587", "eventUri": "eng-9545587", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 490, "textEnd": 496, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

As he did last week in a special statement, he said he would uphold free speech but drew the line at violence and hate speech.\n\n\"There's no place on any campus in America, any place in America for antisemitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind,\" he said.\n\nOther speakers included House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican; Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, and Abe Foxman, a survivor and the former national director off the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nJohnson has been leading efforts by Republicans to tie the campus protests to the Biden administration, as well as link them to right-wing accusations of a liberal drift in academia. In his remarks, he compared the campus pro-Palestinian protests to the assault on Jewish students and academics before and during the Holocaust.\n\n\"We remember what happened then, and today, we are witnessing American universities quickly become hostile places for Jewish students and faculty,\" said Johnson.\n\nBiden's speech comes a year after his administration launched a strategy to combat antisemitism. The White House before the speech listed new measures under the strategy that it would launch in coming days, including a letter from the Department of Education to schools and universities around the country outlining how expressions of antisemitism could launch investigations. Multiple investigations have been launched since Oct. 7.\n\nAlso listed were a planned guide for campus safety resources, and the development of best practices to prevent violence, both spearheaded by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nThe State Department's office of the special envoy to combat antisemitism, Deborah Lipstadt, would convene tech companies to discuss how best to deal with online antisemitic content, the White House said in its release.", "source": {"uri": "jta.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish Telegraphic Agency"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ron_kampeas@jta.org",

This year's observation will last through Sunday, May 12.\n\n\"At this time of alarming antisemitism and Holocaust denial, remembering the history and lessons of the Holocaust is crucial,\" Stuart Eizenstat, the museum's chairman, said prior to introducing the president.\n\nEizenstat questioned what Holocaust survivors would think about witnessing the rise of harassment and threats on college campuses.\n\nSix candles were lit during the ceremony in memory of the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust. The annual observance also honors the American troops that fought in World War II, and invites Holocaust victims to share their family stories.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) also participated in the ceremony.\n\n\"Memories teach us democracy is fragile,\" Speaker Johnson said. \"We have to remember that. We are all capable to falling prey our worst impulses.\"\n\nOn Oct. 7, Hamas militants attacked Israel in a surprise siege, killing 1,200 people and taking another 250 hostage in the largest loss of Jewish lives since the Holocaust, as Jeffries reminded the audience at the ceremony on Tuesday.\n\nIsraeli officials believe that more than 130 people remain in captivity in Gaza, but it is difficult to know exact numbers.\n\n\"People are already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror,\" Biden said. \"I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget.\"\n\nIsrael has responded to the Oct. 7 attacks with an extensive bombing campaign in Gaza. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said Tuesday that 34,789 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli attacks on the Gaa Strip since the war began.\n\nIsrael's military operation in Gaza has since become a flashpoint on U.S. college campuses, starting with a \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" protest at Columbia University that began on April 18. Similar demonstrations have spread to other elite schools like New York University, Princeton, Emerson College and the University of Southern California.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League (ADL) said more than a dozen colleges, including Harvard, are \"failing\" to protect students, while an additional 53 have \"deficient approaches\" or \"corrections needed.\"\n\n\"Scapegoating and demonizing any minority is a threat to every minority,\" Biden said Tuesday.\n\nThe ADL -- along with the Orthodox Union, Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, Jewish Federations of North America, Hillel International, Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law and the National Council of Jewish Women - urged the Biden administration last week to \"do more to protect Jewish students and the broader student community from intimidation, harassment and violence.\"\n\n\"My commitment to the Jewish people, the security of Israel and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is iron clad, even when we disagree,\" Biden said.\n\n\"The Jewish community, I want you to know, I see your fear and your hurt and your pain. Let me reassure you, as your President, you're not alone. You belong. You always have and you always will.\"\n\nBiden said the work of fighting antisemitism cannot just be on politicians. He called on all Americans to support their Jewish neighbors.\n\nIn his remarks, Speaker Johnson said students, faculty and staff were \"threatening\" Jewish students on their own college campuses, calling this a time of Israel's \"greatness need.\" He called for \"decisive\" action against antisemitism and \"unequivocal\" support to Israel.\n\n\"Now is a time for moral clarity,\" the speaker said. \"We must put an end to this madness...The threat of repeating the past is so great.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_E._Eizenstat", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stuart E.

The attack provoked a conflict that is ongoing to this day and has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians.\n\n\"We've seen a ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world,\" since the October attack, said Biden. \"Now here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting, already forgetting, that Hamas unleashed this terror.\"\n\n'You belong'\n\nBiden assured the Jewish community: \"You belong. You always have, and you always will. ... My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad, even when we disagree.\"\n\nAmy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, applauded Biden's speech and said in a statement that antisemitism is everybody's problem, not just one for Jews.\n\n\"Rising antisemitic conspiracy theories and hate are a threat that undermines each and every American's safety and our core democratic norms and values,\" Spitalnick said. \"We're grateful for President Biden's clear moral leadership confronting this threat, including through the historic U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism.\n\n\"We urge Congress to quickly move the Countering Antisemitism Act forward for a vote, support robust implementation of the National Strategy, and significantly increase funding for the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights to investigate fully and address acts of antisemitism -- and all civil rights violations -- on campus. It's time to make clear that just, inclusive societies are ones in which Jews and all communities are safe and free.\"\n\nMounting pro-Palestinian protests on U.S. college campuses have raised questions about whether criticizing the world's only Jewish state as it continues to besiege Gaza should be seen as antisemitic speech.\n\n\"It is perfectly OK to object to the policies of a state,\" said Mirette Mabrouk, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. \"It is never OK to be a bigot. So, when the state of Israel conflates the two -- conflates being Jewish with the policies of the state of Israel -- it makes it significantly more difficult for people to object to the policies of Israel, because you don't want to come across as being antisemitic. That is absolute nonsense.\"\n\nVOA asked White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre where the Biden administration draws that line.\n\n\"I shouldn't have to talk about a line,\" she replied. \"It's very clear.

Invoking racist tropes, Biden claimed that Hamas militants harbor the same \"ancient hatred\" of Jewish people that spurred the Holocaust -- an equivalence that has been drawn by Israeli officials time and time again to justify Israel's brutality against Palestinians.\n\nAntisemitic \"hatred was brought to life on October 7 of 2023,\" Biden said, by Hamas militants \"driven by an ancient desire to wipe out the Jewish people off the face of the earth.\" At one point, he equated the attack on October 7 to the Holocaust. \"Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing, ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust on October 7, including Hamas's appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize Jews.\"\n\nThis statement is incorrect and dangerous for many reasons, as human rights advocates have pointed out. As a group, Hamas is far from \"ancient\" -- Hamas was established 37 years ago by revolutionaries seeking to liberate Palestine from decades of violent Israeli occupation, ethnic cleansing and apartheid, with an opposition to Zionism, not the Jewish people, as the group established in their 2017 charter.\n\nSaying that there is an \"ancient desire\" to kill Jewish people within the Palestinian resistance, then, implies that Biden believes that Palestinians have an innate desire to oppose Jewish people -- an implication that many advocates for Palestinian rights have pointed out is deeply racist, and an accusation that has long been levied against Palestinians in order to justify their slaughter.\n\n\"Hamas was founded in 1987. So when the president says 'ancient desires' to eliminate the Jews, he's making a point about Arabs/Muslims as inherently and viscerally genocidal,\" said AJ+'s Sana Saeed on social media.\n\nThe president spent roughly half of his speech, supposedly aimed at addressing antisemitism, denouncing Hamas and student protesters against genocide, without a word about the antisemitism growing within the Republican Party and embraced by his opponent in the presidential election. This is only the latest example of Biden and Zionists within his administration cynically using antisemitism as a bludgeon to silence critics of Israel's genocide -- a practice that many Jewish anti-Zionists have said only makes it harder to fight actual antisemitism.\n\nBiden is one of the only people in the world with the singular power to end Israel's genocide, which has killed at least 34,000 Palestinians so far, including over 14,500 children, with full U.S. backing.\n\nBut rather than stop Israel as it began its raid of Rafah on Monday and Tuesday -- something Biden said was a \"red line\" that Israel cannot cross just two months ago and that advocates have warned is the \"final phase\" of the genocide -- Biden focused on vilifying the wave of pro-Palestine student protesters opposing Israel's genocide. For the second time in days, he smeared the protesters as antisemitic without evidence, and vowed to crack down on them.\n\n\"We've seen a ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world,\" Biden said before going on to reference the protests. After implying that campus protests and pro-Palestine advocates were a danger to Jewish people in the U.S., he said that his administration is \"mobilizing the full force of the federal government to protect Jewish communities.\"\n\nJewish advocates for Palestinian rights reacted with horror to Biden's speech.\n\n\"It is a horrific lie that Jewish safety is protected by the Israeli government's slaughter of Palestinian families or that riot police arresting peaceful protestors is for the sake of Jewish students,\" said Stefanie Fox, Jewish Voice for Peace's executive director, in a statement. \"Biden's speech used accusations of antisemitism to distract the American public from our complicity in the ongoing genocide of Palestinians. It was a grotesque betrayal of the memories of our families murdered in the Holocaust.\"\n\nThese remarks play into the tradition of Zionists weaponizing antisemitism in order to fuel repression of pro-Palestine advocates, levying accusations of antisemitism against advocates when many Jewish advocates and Jewish organizations have said that they have seen no evidence of widespread antisemitism among protesters. Rather, Zionists are seeking to obfuscate the history of Palestinian resistance and Israeli occupation by saying that any criticism of Israel is antisemitic; ironically, Zionist Republicans have invoked detestable antisemitic tropes themselves in order to smear protesters as the real antisemites.\n\nMembers of Congress recently sought to codify this into law with a bill that would explicitly adopt a definition of antisemitism that includes criticism of Israel. But this conflation actually risks worsening antisemitism and weakening the movement against it, as San Diego State University political science professor Jonathan Graubart recently wrote for Truthout.\n\n\"Shamelessly ... the [Anti-Defamation League] and other mainstream Jewish organizations add fuel to antisemitism by subordinating the struggle against antisemitism to advocacy on behalf of the state of Israel,\" Graubart wrote. \"Rather than educate the public about the dangers of conflating Israel's actions with Jews at large, these organizations do the opposite by framing virtually all criticisms of Israel as antisemitic.\"", "source": {"uri": "truthout.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Truthout"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sharon_zhang@truthout.org", "name": "Sharon Zhang",

He delivered the keynote address at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual Days of Remembrance ceremony on Tuesday.\n\n\"On the sacred Jewish holiday, the terrorist group Hamas unleashed the deadliest day of the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Driven by ancient desire to wipe out the Jewish people off the face of the Earth, over 1,200 innocent people, babies, parents, grandparents, slaughtered in a kibbutz, massacred at a music festival, brutally raped, mutilated, and sexually assaulted.\"\n\n\"Now here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven and half months later and people are already forgetting. They are already forgetting. That Hamas unleashed this terror. It was Hamas that brutalized Israelis. It was Hamas who took and continues to hold hostages. I have not forgotten nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\nThe protesters on college campuses haven't really \"forgotten.\" They just don't care. Like the simple-minded dullards they are, they equate what Hamas did on October 7 (if they believe it was actually Hamas and not a \"false flag\" operation by Israel) with Israel's response and find that the scales aren't balanced, that more Palestinians have been killed than Israelis and thus Israel is guilty of war crimes.\n\nBiden acknowledges this and adds a powerful rebuttal.\n\n\"Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing, ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7, including Hamas's appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize Jews. It's absolutely despicable, and it must stop. Silence and denial can hide much, but it can erase nothing. Some injustices are so heinous, so horrific, so grievous, they cannot be married -- buried -- no matter how hard people try.\"\n\nBiden's peroration tried to draw a line between legitimate protest and hate.\n\n\"It's in moments like this we have to put these principles that we're talking about into action. I understand people have strong beliefs and deep convictions about the world. In America, we respect and protect the fundamental right to free speech. To debate, disagree, to protest peacefully, make our voices heard. I understand, that's America. But there is no place on any campus in America -- any place in America -- for antisemitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind. Whether against Jews or anyone else. Violent attacks, destroying property is not peaceful protest. It's against the law. And we are not a lawless country. We're a civil society. We uphold the rule of law, and no one should have to hide or be brave just to be themselves.\"\n\nAll in all, it was a very powerful, very moving speech. But Biden's commitment to the Jewish state is entirely another matter. That same enemy who \"raped, mutilated and sexually assaulted\" 1,200 Jews on October 7, is being given new life by Joe Biden.\n\nBiden is refusing to release 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs as Israel begins its final assault on the last five battalions of Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah.\n\nSpeaking against Hamas violence while enabling the terrorists to fight another day is a level of hypocrisy rare even for Biden. It made his beautiful, powerful speech absolutely meaningless.\n\nAssociated Press:\n\nU.S. officials had declined for days to comment on the halted transfer, word of which came as Biden on Tuesday described U.S. support for Israel as \"ironclad, even when we disagree.\"\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to square the arms holdup with Biden's rhetoric in support of Israel, saying only, \"Two things could be true.\"\n\nNo, both cannot be true. You can't support Israel with an \"ironclad\" resolve and not supply them with the arms they need to destroy their terrorist enemy.\n\nOne reason Biden might want Hamas to survive is the matter of who governs in Gaza after the war and the coming refugee crisis that could easily destabilize Egypt and cause chaos in the largest Arab state by population in the Middle East.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would no doubt love to occupy Gaza or install a pro-Israel government in the territory, but that's not likely to happen. The international community will see to it that a successor to Hamas takes charge in Gaza. For Biden, that's fine as long as the new Gaza government keeps the Palestinians on their side of the Egyptian border.\n\nThe aftermath of the war is going to be very messy and chaotic.", "source":

terror attack and Israel's controversial war in Gaza during a speech to a Holocaust remembrance event.\n\nA somber Biden said the world should not look away from hatred and violence against Jews.\n\n\"This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world,\" a somber Biden said. \"\"We must give hate no safe harbor.\"\n\nThe president spoke at an event at the Capitol marking the annual Holocaust Remembrance Day, known in Hebrew as Yom haShoah, which marks the anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also spoke, underlining bipartisan support for the message of tolerance.\n\nBiden emphatically blamed the Oct. 7 terror attack on the same ancient hatred of Jews that led to the Holocaust nearly a century ago.\n\nHe pleaded with Americans to never forget the murder of 6 million Jews by the Nazis and pointedly noted that Oct. 7 was the single deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust.\n\n\"Not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting, they're already forgetting, that Hamas unleashed this terror, that it was Hamas that brutalized Israelis,\" Biden told the crowd, which included silver-haired Holocaust survivors.\n\n\"I have not forgotten, nor have you,\" he added. \"And we will not forget.\"\n\nThe speech came as Israel pushed ahead with its military offensive in the Gaza city of Rafah even after Hamas said it had agreed to a ceasefire deal that would include the release of hostages held by the terror group.\n\nThe U.S. has urged Israel to avoid the bloody new offensive and to seek a permanent end to the fighting in Gaza, pushes that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has mostly rejected.\n\nBiden acknowledged rising tensions with Israel but said the ties between the two nations remain unshakable.\n\nThe seemingly unending Israeli offensive has sparked pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses in New York and nationwide.\n\nBiden last week backed the police crackdowns on protests that have disrupted campuses or included threats against Jewish or pro-Israel students.\n\n\"There's no place on any campus in America\" for anti-Semitism or threats of violence,\" Biden said. \"We're not a lawless country -- we are a civil society\"", "source": {"uri":

On a sacred Jewish holiday, the terrorist group Hamas unleashed the deadliest day of the Jewish people since the Holocaust.\n\nDriven by ancient desire to wipeout the Jewish people off the face of the Earth, over 1,200 innocent people -- babies, parents, grandparents -- slaughtered in their kibbutz, massacred at a musical festival, brutally raped, mutilated, and sexually assaulted. Thousands more carrying wounds, bullets, and shrapnel from the memory of that terrible day they endured. Hundreds taken hostage, including survivors of the Shoah.\n\nNow, here we are, not 75 years later but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting. They're already forgetting that Hamas unleased [sic] this terror, that it was Hamas that brutalized Israelis, that it was Hamas who took and continues to hold hostages. I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget.\n\nAnd as Jews around the world still cope with the atrocities and trauma of that day and its aftermath, we've seen a ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world: vicious propaganda on social media, Jews forced to keep their -- hide their kippahs under baseball hats, tuck their Jewish stars into their shirts.\n\nOn college campuses, Jewish students blocked, harassed, attacked while walking to class.\n\nAntisemitism -- antisemitic posters, slogans calling for the annihilation of Israel, the world's only Jewish State.\n\nToo many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing, ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7th, including Hamas's appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize Jews.\n\nIt's absolutely despicable, and it must stop.\n\nFirst of all, where was such a strong condemnation sooner? He claims he has \"not forgotten,\" and also that \"we will not forget.\" Those reassurances should and could have come sooner. It's not just the attack on October 7, but also the pro-Hamas protests taking place on college campuses across the country. Biden gave remarks last Thursday when he called out those protests. Not only were such remarks delayed, but he's also gone for a \"both sides\" angle previously and will likely do so again.\n\nLater in his speech, he also raised issues he should have brought up far sooner, specifically about campus protests where terrorist sympathizers have taken over, including at George Washington University, in Biden's own backyard:\n\nSo, in moments like this, we have to put these principles that we're talking about into action.\n\nI understand people have strong beliefs and deep convictions about the world. In America, we respect and protect the fundamental right to free speech, to debate and disagree, to protest peacefully and make our voices heard.\n\nI understand. That's America.\n\nBut there is no place on any campus in America -- any place in America -- for antisemitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind -- (applause) -- whether against Jews or anyone else.\n\nViolent attacks, destroying property is not peaceful protest. It's against the law. And we are not a lawless country. We're a civil society. We uphold the rule of law.\n\nAnd no one should have to hide or be brave just to be themselves. (Applause.)\n\nEven more recently, with potentially strong consequences for the president, is how his remarks come after he's withheld ammunition from Israel. As Townhall has been covering, Republican senators are reaching out to demand answers from Biden on the issue.\n\nSeveral times during Tuesday's White House press briefings, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre refused to speak to questions about arms sales, just as she and White House National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby did during Monday's press briefing. Yet somehow still claimed that support for Israel from the United States is \"ironclad.\"\n\nRight after the excerpt above, Biden segued into making reference to Israel as well, including how he and his administration often \"disagree\" with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, although he didn't mention Netanyahu by name:\n\nTo the Jewish community, I want you to know I see your fear, your hurt, and your pain.\n\nLet me reassure you, as your President, you are not alone. You belong. You always have, and you always will.\n\nAnd my commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad, even when we disagree. (Applause.)\n\nMy administration is working around the clock to free remaining hostages, just as we have freed hostages already, and we will not rest until we bring them all home. (Applause.)\n\nThe remarks were not the only way in which the Biden administration has commemorated Holocaust Remembrance Day. As Spencer covered on Monday, the president posted about it from his official X account on Sunday.\n\nThat being said, there was no statement posted to the White House on Sunday. It didn't come until Monday, and was from Vice President Kamala Harris. Although it was shared to the vice president's official account, and reposted by her political one, it did not appear to be shared by other accounts from those with the White House. Not even Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish and who was referenced in Harris' statement on Monday and Biden's remarks on Tuesday, did not share the statement, though he made another post about Holocaust Remembrance Day on Monday from his official account.\n\nSpeaking of Emhoff, his daughter, Ella Emhoff, has been speaking up in favor of Gaza and even raising money for the terrorist-infested UNRWA of the anti-Israel United Nations. She removed her donation link after the New York Post caught wind, though.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Let me reassure you, as your president, you're not alone. You belong. You always have and you always will,\" Biden said.\n\nThe speech was closely watched given the turmoil in the Middle East and its stunning political reaction in the US. Biden might have caused offense had he been overtly political at a Capitol Hill event marking one of history's most vicious crimes - the Nazi genocide against Jews. But everyone understood the context. It will therefore not be forgotten that while addressing current developments, Biden refused to dance between his deeply felt support for Israel and criticism from his own party for not tempering Israel's assault in Gaza.\n\nThe president did not send any cautionary message to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who appears to be moving toward an offensive against Hamas in Rafah that Biden's administration fears could cause human carnage. The most pro-Israel president of modern times in fact stressed the inviolability of his support whatever happens. \"My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad. Even when we disagree,\" he said at a Holocaust Memorial Museum event on Capitol Hill.\n\nBiden also made few efforts to try to appease fury among progressive Democrats and Arab Americans, including in the critical swing state of Michigan, over his support for Israel in its response to the Hamas terrorist attacks, which killed 1,200 people in October. Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The reaction of Biden's most liberal Democratic critics to his speech could be important amid growing fears of some in the party that the war could critically fracture his coalition ahead of November's election.\n\nAfter encountering protesters chanting \"Genocide Joe\" at campaign events, Biden also made no clear reference to the extreme suffering of Gazans during the current crisis, although he did add that his administration was tirelessly working to end the conflict through a diplomatic initiative in the Middle East.\n\nHe took an uncompromising line on campus protests. While praising the right to free speech as a fundamental American value, he condemned reported instances when some Jewish students have faced antisemitic taunting. \"Destroying property is not peaceful protest. It's against the law. We're not a lawless country. We're civil society. We uphold the rule of law, and no one should have to hide or be brave just to be themselves,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden's speech harked back to an age when presidents sought to address the nation, to reset a controversial debate and to control a narrative at a politically sensitive moment. Whether this is even possible in the tumult of the social media age is questionable. But Biden's remarks were an unequivocal statement of a position of principle six months ahead of his election rematch with his predecessor Donald Trump.\n\nThe comparison between the candidates is rarely as starkly on show as on Tuesday morning. While Biden was addressing the nation in the ceremonial trappings of the presidency, Trump was in court in Manhattan listening to a key witness, former adult film star Stormy Daniels, testify about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump during his hush money trial arising from the 2016 election. Trump denies the affair and has pleaded not guilty in the case.\n\nAt any other time, Biden's choice of words and subject matter would not have been controversial. Presidents habitually warn about the dangers of forgetting or misrepresenting one of history's most heinous crimes -- the slaughter of around 6 million Jews by Nazi Germany. But Israel's response to the October 7 Hamas terror attacks has sparked a worldwide protest movement fueled by high-profile demonstrations at many American college campuses. Some of the domestic fury toward Biden is rooted in a view of pro-Palestinian advocates and family members of Gazans in the United States that Israel's bombings of civilian areas where Hamas is embedded represent a crime against humanity tantamount to genocide.\n\nBut Biden made clear that there was no justification for the October 7 terror attacks, implicitly dismissing efforts from some pro-Palestinian supporters to point out that they followed years of Israeli repression against the people of Gaza. In doing so, he aligned himself with the view of many Israelis that the attacks -- the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust -- sprung from the same desire to wipe Jews off the planet and threaten Israel's right to exist.\n\nHe condemned \"too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7 -- including Hamas' appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize Jews. It's absolutely despicable -- and it must stop,\" raising his voice at the end of the sentence.\n\n\"Now, here we are -- not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later -- and people are already forgetting. They're already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror. ... I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget.\"\n\nEverything a president does is inherently political, and landmark speeches always address multiple audiences. There's no doubt that Biden's speech was carefully watched in Israel and may be interpreted as a sign there may be no price for Netanyahu to pay if he ignores US warnings about a Rafah offensive to rout out Hamas leadership -- even if Biden's credibility is called into question.\n\nWhile Biden's approach Tuesday may irk progressives, it might offer some cover on his right flank. Republicans, led by Trump, are portraying campus protests as left-wing extremism that Biden can't control and are calling for a new strongman president to restore order. The president can ill afford such a view to take hold among centrist swing state voters.\n\nRepublican Speaker Mike Johnson, who has led House Republicans in painting campus protests as a symbol of an extremist liberal rot in elite schools, on Tuesday used the Holocaust memorial event to conjure his most graphic analogy yet.\n\n\"German universities ... were at the heart of the renaissance and intellectual life. But it was at those same elite centers of learning where Jewish faculty and students were expelled, where anti-Jewish courses were introduced, and where professors performed horrific pseudo-science experiments on Jews brought from nearby concentration camps,\" the Louisiana Republican said. \"We remember what happened then, and today, we are witnessing American universities quickly become hostile places for Jewish students and faculty.\"\n\nAs heinous as the abuse faced by Jewish students at US universities is, there is currently no true parallel between the Nazis' organized project to destroy Judaism to create a White master race. In fact, in recent years, anti-Jewish extremism has bubbled up more from the far-right in protests like the one in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 that Trump was equivocal in condemning -- which Biden has said convinced him to run for the White House. Trump reached for Nazi imagery over the weekend to falsely accuse Biden of being behind his multiple legal threats when he blasted the president and Democrats for running a \"Gestapo\" administration.\n\nIt was only the latest instance when political figures of the right and the left coopted false historical parallels for political gain. Some progressives have, for instance, compared Trump's autocratic tendencies to 1930s tyrants in a way that cheapens some of history's horrors and obscures real understanding of the exact nature of the threat to democracy that the GOP presumptive nominee may pose.\n\nUnderstanding history and preventing it from being manipulated for political gain was a major focus of Biden's speech, which was delivered on the 79th anniversary of VE Day, when the allies defeated Nazism in World War II.\n\n\"Never forgetting means we must keep telling the story. We must keep teaching the truth. We must keep teaching our children and our grandchildren. The truth is, we're at risk of people not knowing the truth,\" Biden said.\n\nIt was an especially poignant message coming from an 81-year-old president who was born during the war against Nazism and who, unlike today's young people, grew up when the dark shadow of the 1940s was a vivid memory shared by people who lived through it rather than a second-hand experience in history classes and movies.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

This time, the President's words were infused with an unusual poignancy. He was speaking after months of renewed concern about antisemitism, particularly on university campuses, where students have protested, camped on lawns and occupied buildings in opposition to Israel's war in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"I am calling on all Americans to stand united against antisemitism and hate in all its forms,\" said Mr. Biden, whose three children all married into Jewish families. He addressed Jewish Americans directly, saying, \"I see your fear and your heart.\"\n\n\"You are not alone,\" he added. \"You belong. You always have and always will.\"\n\nMr. Biden said he had taken his grandchildren to tour the remains of the Nazi concentration camp at Dachau, Germany. He spoke of a hatred that \"continues to live deep in the hearts of too many people in the world,\" and condemned the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, which sparked the war.\n\nA day before Mr. Biden's remarks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre, appearing at a similar event in Ottawa, spoke out against antisemitism in Canada. The leaders made the remarks the same day B'nai Brith Canada, a Jewish human-rights organization, released a report saying that the number of antisemitic incidents in Canada had reached a record high in 2023, with more than twice as many episodes as the group recorded in 2022.\n\n\"These kinds of speeches in Ottawa and Washington are meaningful, they are validating and they provide an opportunity to set out initiatives to address the situation we are confronted with today,\" Shimon Koffler Fogel, the chief executive officer of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, the advocacy group for Jewish federations across Canada, said in an interview. \"These speeches do more than bring a degree of comfort. They bring some reassurance to the Jewish community that is under such pressure today.\"\n\nThe group is supporting Ontario's Bill 166, which would give the province oversight of postsecondary institutions' anti-racism policies. The proposed legislation has sparked concern among some educators about political interference.\n\nA year ago, Mr. Biden created a National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism. During his Holocaust-remembrance speech, the President said the new agency is now \"mobilizing the full force of the federal government to protect Jewish communities.\"\n\nIn co-ordination with Mr. Biden's speech on Tuesday, his administration released guidelines for how educational institutions should define antisemitic discrimination and other hate speech that could lead to federal prosecutions.\n\nThe President made his speech less than a week after the U.S. House of Representatives, by a 320-91 vote, approved an antisemitism bill that soon will go before the Senate. The measure would require the federal Department of Education, for the purposes of enforcing anti-discrimination laws, to employ the definition of antisemitism crafted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. This is a standard used in half the American states that some civil libertarians nonetheless consider a breach of freedom of expression, and that others have said unfairly conflates criticism of Israel with hatred of Jewish people.\n\nThe American Jewish Committee said in its 2023 report on antisemitism that nearly 63 per cent of American Jews had told a survey that the status of Jews in the U.S. had grown less secure over the past year. Three out of four American Jews said the Hamas attacks made them feel less safe at home, and about half said fear of antisemitism had prompted them to alter their behaviour.\n\nThe problem seems most acute on university campuses. A quarter of current or recent Jewish college students said they felt uncomfortable or unsafe at campus events, according to a leading advocacy group for Jews and Israel. A quarter also said they had avoided wearing or carrying identifying religious objects.\n\nMr. Biden said there is \"no place on any campus\" for antisemitic rhetoric or acts.\n\nThere is political advantage for Mr. Biden in saying these things. He took 68 per cent of the Jewish vote in 2020, and Jews have supported the Democratic nominee in every election in the past 100 years - sometimes, as in 1940 and 1944 for Franklin Delano Roosevelt, and in 1964 for Lyndon Johnson, at levels at or beyond 90 per cent.\n\nSome Democrats believe such remarks enhance Mr. Biden's profile as the November election approaches.\n\n\"In this election, when it comes down to the swing voters who are still undecided - maybe a very small percentage - a president who consistently does his best to demonstrate moral leadership will benefit,\" said Steven Grossman, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a former president of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the leading pro-Israel lobby group. \"These kinds of speeches, this kind of rhetoric, the moral clarity in trying to turn language into positive action, makes a difference.\"", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and

It's absolutely despicable and it must stop.\"\n\nBiden, dubbed \"Genocide Joe\" by many of the anti-Israel protesters, has for months increasingly accused Israel of doing too little to avoid killing civilians and aid workers in Gaza.\n\nReclaiming more forceful pro-Israel rhetoric that he used earlier in the conflict, Biden blamed Hamas for starting the seven-month-old war.\n\n\"The terrorist group Hamas unleashed the deadliest day of the Jewish people since the Holocaust, driven by ancient desire to wipe out the Jewish people off the face of the earth,\" he said. \"Over 1,200 innocent people -- babies, parents, grandparents -- slaughtered in their kibbutz, massacred at a music festival, brutally raped, mutilated, and sexually assaulted.\n\n\"Thousands more [are] carrying wounds, bullets and shrapnel from the memory of that terrible day they endured. Hundreds [were] taken hostage, including survivors of the [Holocaust]. Now, here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven-and-a-half months later, and people are already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror -- that it was Hamas that brutalized Israelis, that it was Hamas that took and continues to hold hostages. I have not forgotten, nor have you and we will not forget.\"\n\nBiden added: \"My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people and the security of Israel and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad, even when we disagree.\"\n\nThe US leader visited Israel just days after Hamas' surprise attacks in southern Israel and in October denounced the terror group's death toll data from inside Gaza as propaganda -- before appearing in February to embrace those figures as he increased pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry claims nearly 35,000 have died in the territory of 2 million.\n\nBiden said publicly in February that the Israeli operation in Gaza was \"over the top\" and on Monday warned Netanyahu in a phone call not to invade Rafah, where US officials believe more than 1 million Gaza residents are living.\n\nPolling shows Biden's re-election at risk due to backlash from key Democratic constituencies, such as younger voters, Arab Americans and Muslim Americans -- while Netanyahu has pushed back on Biden's mounting criticism.\n\n\"If Israel is forced to stand alone, Israel will stand alone,\" Netanyahu said in a defiant speech Sunday at Jerusalem's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.\n\n\"Eighty years ago in the Holocaust, the Jewish people were totally defenseless against those who sought our destruction. No nation came to our aid. Today, we again face enemies bent on our destruction.\n\n\"I say to the leaders of the world: No amount of pressure, no decision by any international forum will stop Israel from defending itself...

He assured Jewish Americans of their place in the country amid the continuing protests over Israel's seven-month-old war against Hamas, telling them: \"You're not alone, you belong. You always have and you always will.\"\n\nIn fiery remarks delivered at the United States Capitol to an audience that included multiple Holocaust survivors, Mr Biden recalled how his father had taught him and his siblings about \"the horrors of the Shoa\" around the dinner table as they grew up in Delaware, and said he has looked to impart the same lessons on his children and grandchildren, including by taking them to the site of the Dachau concentration camp \"so they could see and bear witness to the perils of indifference, the complicity of silence in the face of evil\".\n\nThe president explicitly compared the motivations of the Nazis who perpetrated the mass murder of Europe's Jews with the Hamas militants who committed the October 2023 attacks which constituted the worst slaughter of Jews since 1945.\n\nHe warned that the \"ancient hatred of Jews\" did not end with the fall of Nazi Germany, but \"continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world\".\n\n\"That hatred was brought to life on 7 October 2023,\" he said. \"Now here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later. And people are already forgetting or already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror\".\n\n\"It was Hamas that brutalised Israelis, it was Hamas that took and continues to hold hostages,\" he continued. \"I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget!\"\n\nThe president also warned of a \"ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world\" since that day, including on some college campuses where Jewish students, he said, have been kept from attending class by protesters. And he denounced the antisemitic slogans and chants used by some of the protesters, including those \"calling for the annihilation of Israel, the world's own Jewish state\" or \"denying, downplaying, rationalising, ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and 7 October\".\n\n\"It's absolutely despicable and it must stop,\" he said.\n\nMr Biden's remarks came just hours after the White House announced a series of new actions to combat the rising antisemitism he spoke of at the Capitol.\n\nRepublicans have accused the president of failing to denounce campus protests across the country that have, in some cases, involved police action and violence. His critics say that elements of the Democratic voter base are themselves antisemitic and that Mr Biden fears their reaction.\n\nBut Mr Biden came out forcefully against the violent and antisemitic elements of the pro-Palestinian protests in remarks from the White House last week. At the time, he said peaceful protest was \"in the best tradition of how Americans respond to consequential issues\" while stressing that the US is not a \"lawless country\".\n\n\"We're a civil society, and order must prevail,\" he said. \"Destroying property is not a peaceful protest - it's against the law. Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancellation of classes and graduations - none of this is a peaceful protest; threatening people, intimidating people, instilling fear in people is not peaceful protest. It's against the law.\"\n\nThe president reiterated his call for protests to remain within the law at the Capitol on Tuesday, yet as the protests have persisted, so have accusations that the pro-Palestinian demonstrations are per se antisemitic. Concerns have also been raised over whether Jewish students are being denied the right to an education by the actions of some protesters - and the inaction of campus authorities.\n\nTo that end, the Department of Education has sent a \"Dear Colleague\" letter to higher education institutions to lay out guidance on what constitutes antisemitic discrimination that could lead to consequences. The letter uses as its guidance the portions of the Civil Rights Act which prohibit discrimination \"based on actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics\" in the form of a \"hostile environment\" or \"different treatment\".\n\nIn addition, eight Biden administration cabinet departments have issued written guidance which makes clear that the Civil Rights Act \"prohibits certain forms of antisemitic, Islamophobic, and related forms of discrimination in federally funded programs and activities\".\n\nAccording to the White House, these policy rollouts are meant to build on the National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism which the Biden administration rolled out one year ago this month.\n\nA fact sheet distributed to reporters ahead of the president's remarks stated that the Biden administration's strategy \"includes over 100 actions the Biden-Harris Administration has taken, and continues to take, to address the rise of antisemitism in the United States, as well as over 100 calls to action for Congress, state and local governments, companies, technology platforms, students, educators, civil society, faith leaders, and others\".\n\nLeaders of major Jewish organisations that weighed in on Mr Biden's remarks and his administration's work combatting antisemitism did so on positive terms.\n\nAmy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, said in a statement that her organisation was \"grateful for President Biden's clear moral leadership confronting this threat, including through the historic US National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism\".\n\n\"We know that Jewish safety is inextricably linked to the safety of other communities and the health and vibrancy of our democracy. Rising antisemitic conspiracy theories and hate are a threat that undermines each and every American's safety and our core democratic norms and values. Right now, antisemitism is being normalized in new and dangerous ways - used as a political weapon by those who seek to pit communities against one another and isolate Jews from the very coalitions we need to advance inclusive societies,\" she said.\n\n\"We urge Congress to quickly move the Countering Antisemitism Act forward for a vote, support robust implementation of the National Strategy ... it's time to make clear that just, inclusive societies are ones in which Jews and all communities are safe and free,\" she added.\n\nJeremy Ben-Ami, the president of the progressive Jewish group J Street, also said his group was \"grateful\" to Mr Biden \"for standing unequivocally against the sharp rise in antisemitism while also defending our First Amendment rights to speech and nonviolent protest\".\n\n\"We're also deeply appreciative that, on the 7-month anniversary of October 7, the President pledged that his administration will not rest until we bring the hostages home,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_feinberg@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Andrew Feinberg", "type": "author",

The House last week passed legislation with bipartisan support calling on the Department of Education to adopt a broader definition of antisemitism used by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, though some critics have argued it would infringe on free speech rights.\n\nBiden's speech comes as the Israel-Hamas war has divided the Democratic Party, as some progressives have called for Biden to take a stronger stance against Israel's invasion of Gaza amid a rising death toll. The sentiment has spilled onto college campuses in the form of dramatic pro-Palestinian protests that have led to mass arrests, canceled classes and graduations, and an alarming rise in incidents of antisemitism. Biden has expressed unwavering support for Israel, while at the same time urging Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to take a more measured approach to the military action in Gaza to spare the lives of civilians and humanitarian aid workers. While Biden's staunch support for Israel has deterred some in his progressive base, his growing frustration with Netanyahu has prompted some Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, to blame him for the protests and rise in incidents of antisemitism since the start of the war on Oct. 7.\n\nBiden had been virtually silent on the campus protests up until last week, when he delivered brief remarks from the White House in defense of \"peaceful protest,\" but also warned \"violent protest is not protected.\" The comments came as police at campuses across the country, including UCLA and Columbia University, dismantled protest encampments and arrested hundreds of demonstrators. \"We are a civil society, and order must prevail,\" Biden said, adding that he would not call the National Guard to intervene, as some Republicans have suggested, nor would he change his Israel-Hamas war policies.\n\nBiden Condemns 'Chaos' Amid Tense Campus Protests -- Doesn't Support Calling In

Let me reassure you, as your president, you're not alone. You belong. You always have and you always will,\" Biden said.\n\nThe speech was closely watched given the turmoil in the Middle East and its stunning political reaction in the US. Biden might have caused offense had he been overtly political at a Capitol Hill event marking one of history's most vicious crimes - the Nazi genocide against Jews. But everyone understood the context. It will therefore not be forgotten that while addressing current developments, Biden refused to dance between his deeply felt support for Israel and criticism from his own party for not tempering Israel's assault in Gaza.\n\nThe president did not send any cautionary message to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who appears to be moving toward an offensive against Hamas in Rafah that Biden's administration fears could cause human carnage. The most pro-Israel president of modern times in fact stressed the inviolability of his support whatever happens. \"My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad. Even when we disagree,\" he said at a Holocaust Memorial Museum event on Capitol Hill.\n\nBiden also made few efforts to try to appease fury among progressive Democrats and Arab Americans, including in the critical swing state of Michigan, over his support for Israel in its response to the Hamas terrorist attacks, which killed 1,200 people in October. Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The reaction of Biden's most liberal Democratic critics to his speech could be important amid growing fears of some in the party that the war could critically fracture his coalition ahead of November's election.\n\nAfter encountering protesters chanting \"Genocide Joe\" at campaign events, Biden also made no clear reference to the extreme suffering of Gazans during the current crisis, although he did add that his administration was tirelessly working to end the conflict through a diplomatic initiative in the Middle East.\n\nHe took an uncompromising line on campus protests. While praising the right to free speech as a fundamental American value, he condemned reported instances when some Jewish students have faced antisemitic taunting. \"Destroying property is not peaceful protest. It's against the law. We're not a lawless country. We're civil society. We uphold the rule of law, and no one should have to hide or be brave just to be themselves,\" Biden said.\n\nAn attempt to reset the narrative\n\nBiden's speech harked back to an age when presidents sought to address the nation, to reset a controversial debate and to control a narrative at a politically sensitive moment. Whether this is even possible in the tumult of the social media age is questionable. But Biden's remarks were an unequivocal statement of a position of principle six months ahead of his election rematch with his predecessor Donald Trump.\n\nThe comparison between the candidates is rarely as starkly on show as on Tuesday morning. While Biden was addressing the nation in the ceremonial trappings of the presidency, Trump was in court in Manhattan listening to a key witness, former adult film star Stormy Daniels, testify about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump during his hush money trial arising from the 2016 election. Trump denies the affair and has pleaded not guilty in the case.\n\nAt any other time, Biden's choice of words and subject matter would not have been controversial. Presidents habitually warn about the dangers of forgetting or misrepresenting one of history's most heinous crimes -- the slaughter of around 6 million Jews by Nazi Germany. But Israel's response to the October 7 Hamas terror attacks has sparked a worldwide protest movement fueled by high-profile demonstrations at many American college campuses. Some of the domestic fury toward Biden is rooted in a view of pro-Palestinian advocates and family members of Gazans in the United States that Israel's bombings of civilian areas where Hamas is embedded represent a crime against humanity tantamount to genocide.\n\nBut Biden made clear that there was no justification for the October 7 terror attacks, implicitly dismissing efforts from some pro-Palestinian supporters to point out that they followed years of Israeli repression against the people of Gaza. In doing so, he aligned himself with the view of many Israelis that the attacks -- the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust -- sprung from the same desire to wipe Jews off the planet and threaten Israel's right to exist.\n\nHe condemned \"too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7 -- including Hamas' appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize Jews. It's absolutely despicable -- and it must stop,\" raising his voice at the end of the sentence.\n\n\"Now, here we are -- not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later -- and people are already forgetting. They're already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror. ... I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget.\"\n\nJohnson compares anger on some American campuses to Nazism\n\nEverything a president does is inherently political, and landmark speeches always address multiple audiences. There's no doubt that Biden's speech was carefully watched in Israel and may be interpreted as a sign there may be no price for Netanyahu to pay if he ignores US warnings about a Rafah offensive to rout out Hamas leadership -- even if Biden's credibility is called into question.\n\nWhile Biden's approach Tuesday may irk progressives, it might offer some cover on his right flank. Republicans, led by Trump, are portraying campus protests as left-wing extremism that Biden can't control and are calling for a new strongman president to restore order. The president can ill afford such a view to take hold among centrist swing state voters.\n\nRepublican Speaker Mike Johnson, who has led House Republicans in painting campus protests as a symbol of an extremist liberal rot in elite schools, on Tuesday used the Holocaust memorial event to conjure his most graphic analogy yet.\n\n\"German universities ... were at the heart of the renaissance and intellectual life. But it was at those same elite centers of learning where Jewish faculty and students were expelled, where anti-Jewish courses were introduced, and where professors performed horrific pseudo-science experiments on Jews brought from nearby concentration camps,\" the Louisiana Republican said. \"We remember what happened then, and today, we are witnessing American universities quickly become hostile places for Jewish students and faculty.\"\n\nAs heinous as the abuse faced by Jewish students at US universities is, there is currently no true parallel between the Nazis' organized project to destroy Judaism to create a White master race. In fact, in recent years, anti-Jewish extremism has bubbled up more from the far-right in protests like the one in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 that Trump was equivocal in condemning -- which Biden has said convinced him to run for the White House. Trump reached for Nazi imagery over the weekend to falsely accuse Biden of being behind his multiple legal threats when he blasted the president and Democrats for running a \"Gestapo\" administration.\n\nIt was only the latest instance when political figures of the right and the left coopted false historical parallels for political gain. Some progressives have, for instance, compared Trump's autocratic tendencies to 1930s tyrants in a way that cheapens some of history's horrors and obscures real understanding of the exact nature of the threat to democracy that the GOP presumptive nominee may pose.\n\nUnderstanding history and preventing it from being manipulated for political gain was a major focus of Biden's speech, which was delivered on the 79th anniversary of VE Day, when the allies defeated Nazism in World War II.\n\n\"Never forgetting means we must keep telling the story. We must keep teaching the truth. We must keep teaching our children and our grandchildren. The truth is, we're at risk of people not knowing the truth,\" Biden said.\n\nIt was an especially poignant message coming from an 81-year-old president who was born during the war against Nazism and who, unlike today's young people, grew up when the dark shadow of the 1940s was a vivid memory shared by people who lived through it rather than a second-hand experience in history classes and

It was some of his most pointed criticism of Hamas since the attack...reports Asian Lite News\n\nPresident Joe Biden warned against what he called a \"ferocious surge\" of antisemitism in the US and around the world during a Holocaust remembrance event on Tuesday.\n\nHe said too many people had been \"denying, downplaying, rationalising the horrors of the Holocaust\". Biden also condemned those who he said had forgotten the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel. It was some of his most pointed criticism of Hamas since the attack.\n\n\"It was Hamas that brutalised Israelis,\" Mr Biden said. \"It was Hamas that took and continues to hold hostages. I have not forgotten.\"\n\nThe president also criticised what he characterised as lawless behaviour and hateful rhetoric directed at Jewish people by some pro-Palestinian protesters on US university campuses in recent weeks.\n\nHe said that \"scapegoating and demonising a minority\" threatens all minorities.\n\nThe speech followed police interventions to dismantle several protest camps at colleges around the country. The demonstrators have faced complaints of intimidation and hate speech, which organisers have denied.\n\nAt the same time they say they have been subject to Islamophobic and racist remarks by counter-demonstrators.\n\nAhead of the speech, the White House announced new measures aimed at countering antisemitism, expanding on a national strategy first published in June. They include the creation of online resources \"to ensure that colleges and universities do a better job of protecting both Jewish students and all of their students\", as well as new guidance for schools.\n\nSince the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas militants and the subsequent Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, Jewish students in the US have reported an increase in antisemitic incidents. According to the Anti-Defamation League, a leading Jewish advocacy group, incidents spiked nationally in the final three months of 2023, and rose 321% on university campuses.\n\nOne Jewish student at Columbia University - where a protest encampment sparked a wave of pro-Palestinian demonstrations - previously told the BBC that she had been called a \"murderer\" and told to \"go back to Poland\".\n\nWhile the protesters have said they were demonstrating peacefully for a ceasefire in Gaza, several encampments in university buildings have been shut down by police over concerns about escalating violence. Others have been allowed to continue on the proviso they remain peaceful.\n\nIn the six months since the Israel-Hamas conflict began, the Biden administration has attempted to balance support for Israel with addressing growing domestic dissent over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza.\n\nBut while some have accused Mr Biden of not doing enough to end the fighting, he has faced criticism from Republicans for publicly seeking to limit Israel's actions and not speaking about the protests sooner.", "source": {"uri": "asianlite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Local News for British Asian and Indian Community in London"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asian Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoating", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scapegoating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Defamation League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://asianlite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Biden-.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545587", "eventUri": "eng-9545587", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 52, "textEnd": 61, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.5372549019607843, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Never forgetting means we must keep telling the story, we must keep teaching the truth,\" Biden said as he addressed a bipartisan memorial held at the US Capitol's Emancipation Hall. \"The truth is we're at risk of people not knowing the truth.\"\n\nBiden spoke seven months to the day after the Palestinian group, Hamas, attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 by Israeli tallies, in what Biden has called the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust.\n\nHowever, since then, it has been revealed by Haaretz that helicopters and tanks of the Israeli army had, in fact, killed many of the 1,139 soldiers and civilians claimed by Israel to have been killed by the Palestinian Resistance.\n\nHis speech comes as Israel's retaliation has killed nearly 35,000 people in Gaza, according to Gaza Health Authorities, left many of the area's 2.3 million people on the brink of starvation and sparked protests in the US demanding that universities and the Biden administration withdraw support for Israel.\n\nOPINION: Civilisational unity, not clash: How Gaza challenged Samuel Huntington's fantasies\n\nOn Tuesday, Israeli forces seized the main border crossing between Egypt and southern Gaza, shutting down a vital aid route for Palestinian civilians as they prepared a possible offensive aimed at eliminating Hamas fighters.\n\nIn his keynote address for the US Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual National Commemoration of the Days of Remembrance, Biden aimed to cool a divided and divisive US debate about Jewish security, Zionism, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel.\n\nOne speaker who preceded Biden equated recent protests in the United States over Israel's actions with support for Hamas.\n\nMany Jewish Americans have been critical of Israel's Gaza attacks, leading protests against actions of right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government and condemning Netanyahu in Congress.\n\nLaw enforcement and advocacy groups, meanwhile, report a sharp rise in anti-Semitic attacks in the United States since 7 October, as well anti-Muslim attacks. Some Americans favour zero-tolerance policies defining anti-Semitism broadly, others see the threat of attacks against Jews being used to limit legitimate criticism of US. support for Israel.\n\n\"Anti-Semitism is reaching crisis levels in our country,\" said Carol Ann Schwartz, national president of Hadassah, a women's Zionist organisation that has been consulted by the White House.\n\nBiden, who once avoided addressing campus demonstrations over his support for Israel, spoke about the subject for the second time in five days on Tuesday.\n\n\"Passions are high,\" said Jeremy Ben-Ami, president of liberal advocacy group, J Street, who has also been consulted by the White House. \"The issue is being heavily politicised. There's a lot of tension. So this is a very important moment for the President to step forward.\"\n\nIt is also a key political moment for Biden, who is in a tight race with Republican rival, Donald Trump. Biden may be losing crucial support from young and liberal Democrats over his support for Israel, Democrats say.\n\nBiden pledged to unite the country and said he was inspired to run by then-President Trump's response to the 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, white nationalist rally, where marchers chanted \"Jews will not replace us.\" Biden governs a country no less divided than when he took office in 2021, most statistics show.\n\nREVIEW: Good Jew Bad Jew -- Racism, Anti-Semitism and the Assault on Meaning\n\nThe FBI reported a 36 per cent increase in anti-Jewish hate crime incidents between 2021 and 2022, the latest year for which data is available, as well as a jump in crimes against Black Americans and gay men.\n\nThe Secure Community Network (SCN), an American Jewish organisation that monitors hate incidents, has referred more than 504 individuals to law enforcement though March this year, faster than last year's pace, including threats at colleges.\n\n\"This is a scary time to be Jewish - it's important for the President to rise to this challenge,\" said SCN CEO, Michael Masters.\n\nCampus protest politics\n\nTrump has sought to exploit Democratic divisions over Israel's response and widening college protests to improve Republican's lot with Jewish voters, who traditionally vote Democratic.\n\nPolice crackdowns on some campuses have given ammunition to Trump's claim that US cities are under siege from violent crime, illegal migration and out-of-control leftist policies. Trump's Republican Party has argued that the protests are driven by anti-Semitism.\n\n\"Jewish Americans are realising that the Democrat Party has turned into a full-blown anti-Israel, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist cabal, and that's why more and more Jewish Americans are supporting President Trump,\" said Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson.\n\nBiden's anti-Semitism strategy includes directing the Department of Education to provide colleges with examples of anti-Semitic discrimination that could lead to a federal civil rights investigation.\n\nAbout seven in 10 US Jewish voters support Democrats, while three in 10 are Republican-aligned, according to the Pew Research Centre. Many political analysts say that Jewish voters typically do not choose a president based on foreign policy alone.\n\nKenneth Stern, director of the Bard Centre for the Study of Hate, who helped craft a modern \"working definition of anti-Semitism,\" said the word is being misused to stifle protected speech about Israel.\n\nThe US House of Representatives passed a bill last week that would apply the definition Stern helped develop to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws on college campuses. Stern opposes the bill.\n\n\"I don't think that you can combat hatred of any type effectively with weak democratic institutions,\" said Stern. \"When we have a government that decides it's going to stop certain things from being said, that creates an opportunity for totalitarianism, authoritarianism and that's never good for the Jews.\"", "source": {"uri": "middleeastmonitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Middle East Monitor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_P._Huntington", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samuel P.

Ritchie Torres (D-NY), a staunch Israel supporter and critic of Biden, said the president \"spoke with moral clarity on the scourge of antisemitism.\"\n\n\"The president's unequivocal condemnation of antisemitism -- wherever it arises -- underscores his fundamental decency,\" Torres said in a statement. \"We cannot allow antisemitism to fester in our society.\"\n\nRep. Jared Moskowitz (D-FL), a Jewish critic of Biden, praised him for a \"powerful condemnation of antisemitism and your commitment to the safety of Jews worldwide.\"\n\nBiden's speech was given for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's Days of Remembrance to honor the memory of the 6 million Jews killed in the 1940s.\n\n\"The Jewish community, I want you to know: I see your fear, your hurt, your pain,\" he said. \"Let me reassure you, as your president, you're not alone. You belong. You always have and you always will. And my commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad even when we disagree.\"\n\nMany senators, Republicans and Democrats alike, said they were either unaware of the event or had not seen Biden's remarks, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who is Jewish. He has sided with pro-Palestinian voices and urged the administration to rethink its support of Israel because it could become Biden's Vietnam as a foreign policy crisis.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) accused college administrators and local officials in towns facing unrest over demonstrations of failing to heed Biden's calls for law and order.\n\n\"In the face of a mob that increasingly represents their political base, elected leaders have shrunk from their duty to ensure that the order President Biden referenced last week actually prevails,\" McConnell said.\n\nThe Biden administration is reportedly withholding the delivery of U.S. ammunition to Israel as the ally prepares a full-scale invasion of Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza, that critics fear could worsen the humanitarian situation. The administration has not denied the move, fueling additional criticism from lawmakers.\n\nSen. John Fetterman (D-PA), who's been saddled with names by progressives like \"genocide promoter\" for his staunch support of Israel, declined to \"make a judgment\" on Biden's Holocaust remembrance speech but told the Washington Examiner that he \"strongly disagrees\" with withholding ammunition.\n\n\"That's a mistake, and we should reverse that,\" Fetterman said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSen. Roger Marshall (R-KS) viewed Biden's rhetoric on Israel and antisemitism as positive but said his \"actions and words don't jive.\"\n\n\"He's done this before, where he says he supports Israel but then he funds Iran,\" Marshall told the Washington Examiner. \"I appreciate the kind words, but I think his actions need to line up, and they don't. The latest action is diverting weapons that should be going to Israel, most likely sending those to Ukraine, but we know for sure he stopped them.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com",

Some 250 people were also taken hostage in the attack.\n\n\"The protesters are demanding divestment, meaning the sale of financial assets either related to Israeli companies or shares in other corporations perceived to assist the Israeli military,\" Sucharov said. \"In addition, many protests include calls for the disclosure of those financial ties. They also feature demands for colleges and universities to distance themselves from Israel by ending study-abroad programs and academic exchanges.\"\n\nThey are having some modest success in their mission.\n\nBrown University protesters managed to persuade the administration to hold a vote on divesting from companies connected to the Israeli military. In return, the protesters agreed to dismantle their encampment.\n\nPortland State University administrators agreed to pause its relationship with Boeing, which is a military contractor as well as a civilian aircraft manufacturer.\n\nDuring Tuesday's U.S. Holocaust Memorial Days of Remembrance ceremony in Washington, D.C., however, both President Joe Biden and U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson decried the surge in antisemitism on college campuses.\n\nBiden said that on Oct. 7 Hamas \"brought to life\" that hatred with the killing of more than 1,200 Israelis -- mostly civilians -- and warned that people are beginning to forget who was responsible.\n\n\"My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad -- even when we disagree,\" Biden said.\n\n\"There's no place on any campus in America\" or any place in America for antisemitism or threats of violence, he said.\n\nIn conjunction with Biden's speech, his administration announced new steps to combat antisemitism on colleges campuses and beyond. The Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights is sending every school district and college in the nation a letter outlining examples of antisemitism and other hate that could lead to federal civil rights investigations.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is also moving to educate schools and community groups about resources and funding available to promote campus safety and address threats. And the State Department's special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism is meeting with technology companies on how to combat the rise in hateful conflict online, according to the Associated Press.\n\nJohnson said college campuses are quickly become hostile places for Jewish students and faculty.\n\n\"The very campuses which were once the envy of the international academy have succumbed to an antisemitic virus,\" he said. \"Students who were known for producing academic papers, are now known for stabbing Jewish peers in the eyes with Palestinian flags. Faculty who once produced cutting-edge research are linking arms with pro-Hamas protesters calling for a 'global intifada.' Administrators who were once lauded by their peers for leadership are barring Jewish faculty and choosing not to protect their Jewish students. Jewish students are physically threatened when they walk on campus, as their peers hold posters repeating the Nazi propaganda and the program: the final solution. Now is a time for moral clarity - we must put an end to this madness.\"\n\n*\n\nInformer is written by Crystal Stevenson, American Press executive editor.

I have not forgotten.\"\n\nThe president also criticised what he characterised as lawless behaviour and hateful rhetoric directed at Jewish people by some pro-Palestinian protesters on US university campuses in recent weeks.\n\nHe said that \"scapegoating and demonising a minority\" threatens all minorities.\n\nThe speech followed police interventions to dismantle several protest camps at colleges around the country. The demonstrators have faced complaints of intimidation and hate speech, which organisers have denied.\n\nAt the same time they say they have been subject to Islamophobic and racist remarks by counter-demonstrators.\n\nAhead of the speech, the White House announced new measures aimed at countering antisemitism, expanding on a national strategy first published in June. They include the creation of online resources \"to ensure that colleges and universities do a better job of protecting both Jewish students and all of their students\", as well as new guidance for schools.\n\nSince the 7 October attack on Israel by Hamas militants and the subsequent Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, Jewish students in the US have reported an increase in antisemitic incidents. According to the Anti-Defamation League, a leading Jewish advocacy group, incidents spiked nationally in the final three months of 2023, and rose 321% on university campuses.\n\nOne Jewish student at Columbia University - where a protest encampment sparked a wave of pro-Palestinian demonstrations - previously told the BBC that she had been called a \"murderer\" and told to \"go back to Poland\".\n\nWhile the protesters have said they were demonstrating peacefully for a ceasefire in Gaza, several encampments in university buildings have been shut down by police over concerns about escalating violence. Others have been allowed to continue on the proviso they remain peaceful.\n\nIn the six months since the Israel-Hamas conflict began, the Biden administration has attempted to balance support for Israel with addressing growing domestic dissent over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza.\n\nBut while some have accused Mr Biden of not doing enough to end the fighting, he has faced criticism from Republicans for publicly seeking to limit Israel's actions and not speaking about the protests sooner.\n\nIf you have any stories or news that you would like to share with the global online community, please feel free to share it with us by contacting us directly at [email protected]", "source": {"uri": "brudirect.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BruneiDirect"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoating", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scapegoating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Defamation League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545587", "eventUri": "eng-9545587", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 334, "textEnd": 343, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities - that deal with that problem.\"\n\nWhen asked by Spectrum News North Carolina political anchor Tim Boyum about Biden's comments and if he would have a red line in Israel's war with Hamas, Trump replied: \"Well, I wouldn't do what Biden did. He just abandoned Israel. I've never seen anything like it.\"\n\nTrump then criticized why Jewish people -- who typically overwhelmingly back Democrats -- vote the way they do. A Pew Research Center survey from last month showed that 69% of Jewish voters align with the Democratic Party, while 29% back Republicans. Since 2020, Jewish voter share among Democrats increased 8%.\n\n\"Why Jewish people vote for Democrats is beyond me,\" Trump said. \"I think maybe they'll change their mind, but they've been wedded to Democrats for you know, for 50 years, probably more than that. And there's been no president has ever done anything close to what I've done for Israel.\"\n\nAs president, Trump in 2020 oversaw bilateral agreements between Israel and Arab nations known as the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between the Jewish state, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. That year, he also announced an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan alongside Netanyahu that was criticized by Palestinian leaders and the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Biden at the time called it a \"political stunt\" that could \"set back peace even more.\" In 2017, Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and oversaw the opening of a U.S. embassy in the holy city, a move that enraged Palestinians.\n\nBut Biden has been steadfast in his support for Israel, particularly in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 -- the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust -- and sparked the war in Gaza. Biden just last month signed into law a foreign aid bill providing billions in aid for Israel in its war against Hamas, as well as humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza.\n\nTrump on Thursday charged that Biden has \"totally gone on the other side\" and \"dropped Israel.\"\n\n\"If you're Jewish and you vote for him, I say shame on you,\" Trump added.\n\nIt's not the first time Trump has used such rhetoric to condemn Jewish voters who pick Democrats. On Rosh Hashanah last year -- one of the holiest days on the Jewish calendar -- Trump shared a post on his Truth Social platform accusing those who did not support him in 2020 of voting \"to destroy America and Israel.\"\n\n\"Just a quick reminder for liberal Jews who voted to destroy America & Israel because you believed false narratives!\" the image read. \"Let's hope you learned from your mistake & make better choices moving forward! Happy New Year!\"\n\nIn March of this year, Trump said in an interview that Jewish people who vote for Democrats \"hate Israel\" and hate \"their religion,\" and last month said that \"any Jewish person who votes for a Democrat or votes for Biden should have their head examined.\" His remarks were condemned by the White House, Biden's reelection campaign and other advocates.\n\nBiden, who has deep ties to the Jewish community dating back to his time representing Delaware in the Senate, visited Israel's Holocaust museum, Yad Vashem, in 2022, where he met with survivors and took part in a wreath laying ceremony. He has also condemned some of the protests at college campuses across the country and just this week offered a forceful condemnation of a rise in antisemitism at a Holocaust remembrance ceremony.\n\nTrump has accused Biden of being weak on antisemitism, though just last week said that the Democratic president is running a \"Gestapo administration,\" his latest reference to Nazi Germany.\n\nWhen it comes to Israel's potential invasion of Rafah, a city in southern Gaza where more than 1 million civilians are sheltering, Trump said that they \"have to get the job done,\" citing the atrocities of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack.\n\n\"They've done things that nobody thought - nobody's ever seen anything like it,\" Trump added.\n\nIsrael has said that Rafah is Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza, but several countries, including the U.S., have expressed alarm about the prospect of a full-scale ground invasion.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum

Ritchie Torres (D-NY), a staunch Israel supporter and critic of Biden, said the president \"spoke with moral clarity on the scourge of antisemitism.\"\n\n\"The president's unequivocal condemnation of antisemitism -- wherever it arises -- underscores his fundamental decency,\" Torres said in a statement. \"We cannot allow antisemitism to fester in our society.\"\n\nRep. Jared Moskowitz (D-FL), a Jewish critic of Biden, praised him for a \"powerful condemnation of antisemitism and your commitment to the safety of Jews worldwide.\"\n\nBiden's speech was given for the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's Days of Remembrance to honor the memory of the 6 million Jews killed in the 1940s.\n\n\"The Jewish community, I want you to know: I see your fear, your hurt, your pain,\" he said. \"Let me reassure you, as your president, you're not alone. You belong. You always have and you always will. And my commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad even when we disagree.\"\n\nMany senators, Republicans and Democrats alike, said they were either unaware of the event or had not seen Biden's remarks, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who is Jewish. He has sided with pro-Palestinian voices and urged the administration to rethink its support of Israel because it could become Biden's Vietnam as a foreign policy crisis.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) accused college administrators and local officials in towns facing unrest over demonstrations of failing to heed Biden's calls for law and order.\n\n\"In the face of a mob that increasingly represents their political base, elected leaders have shrunk from their duty to ensure that the order President Biden referenced last week actually prevails,\" McConnell said.\n\nThe Biden administration is reportedly withholding the delivery of U.S. ammunition to Israel as the ally prepares a full-scale invasion of Rafah, the southernmost city in Gaza, that critics fear could worsen the humanitarian situation. The administration has not denied the move, fueling additional criticism from lawmakers.\n\nSen. John Fetterman (D-PA), who's been saddled with names by progressives like \"genocide promoter\" for his staunch support of Israel, declined to \"make a judgment\" on Biden's Holocaust remembrance speech but told the Washington Examiner that he \"strongly disagrees\" with withholding ammunition.\n\n\"That's a mistake, and we should reverse that,\" Fetterman said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSen. Roger Marshall (R-KS) viewed Biden's rhetoric on Israel and antisemitism as positive but said his \"actions and words don't jive.\"\n\n\"He's done this before, where he says he supports Israel but then he funds Iran,\" Marshall told the Washington Examiner. \"I appreciate the kind words, but I think his actions need to line up, and they don't. The latest action is diverting weapons that should be going to Israel, most likely sending those to Ukraine, but we know for sure he stopped them.\"\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Credit: Konstantin Goldenberg/Shutterstock.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) condemned the antisemitic campus protests that have proliferated across the United States while at a Holocaust remembrance ceremony on Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual days of commemoration event at the Capitol building in Washington, Biden compared the denial of the murder of 6 million Jews in the Holocaust to ongoing efforts to deny Hamas's massacre in Israel on Oct. 7.\n\n\"Here we are, not 75 years later but just seven and a half months later, and people are already forgetting,\" Biden said. \"They're already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror, that it was Hamas that brutalized Israelis, that it was Hamas who took and continues to hold hostages. I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget.\"\n\nBiden noted that Jewish students on campuses across the country had been \"blocked, harassed, attacked while walking to class\" and been met with slogans calling for the destruction of the Jewish state.\n\n\"Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing, ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and Oct. 7, including Hamas's appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize Jews,\" Biden said. \"It's absolutely despicable, and it must stop.\"\n\nJohnson (R-La.) issued a similar warning, saying that it is time to \"put an end to this madness\" of Jew-hatred on college campuses.\n\n\"The very campuses that were once the envy of the international academy have succumbed to an antisemitic virus,\" he said. \"Students who were known for producing academic papers are now known for stabbing their Jewish peers in the eyes with Palestinian flags. Faculty who once produced cutting-edge research, are now linking arms with pro-Hamas protesters and calling for global intifada.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) also decried Jew-hatred at Tuesday's event, saying that it must be confronted along with other forms of bigotry.\n\n\"We must crush antisemitism along with racism, sexism, Islamophobia, xenophobia, homophobia and all other forms of hatred together,\" he said. \"That's the American way.

However, it contradicted policies aimed at letting the terrorists win and appeasing pro-Hamas voters.\n\nWhen President Joe Biden wants to say the right things about Israel and antisemitism, he knows how to do it. Much like his comments immediately after the Oct. 7 massacres, his speech at a Holocaust commemoration held in the U.S. Capitol on May 7 struck all the right notes. He not only spoke appropriately about the Six Million slain by the Nazis, he correctly noted that, \"This ancient hatred of Jews didn't begin with the Holocaust. It didn't end with the Holocaust either. Or after -- even after our victory in World War II. This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness. That hatred was brought to life on October 7th of 2023.\"\n\nGoing on, he acknowledged that the current war has unleashed a surge of antisemitism in the United States that has been particularly felt on college campuses. He even detailed the unspeakable atrocities of Oct. 7 (which, according to a live New York Times update about the speech, offends \"pro-Palestinian\" protesters who deny Hamas's crimes). And unlike his first comments about the antisemitic campus protests, he didn't try to balance that with either bogus concerns about a largely mythical problem of Islamophobia or discussions about the alleged sufferings of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. He also placed the blame for the current war squarely on the Hamas terror organization.\n\nYet, the president said, \"people are already forgetting. They are already forgetting. That Hamas unleashed this terror. It was Hamas that brutalized Israelis. It was Hamas who took and continues to hold hostages. I have not forgotten nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\nA broken promise\n\nWhile his words earned the applause they garnered, that last statement isn't true. That's because his policies -- as distinct from some of his speeches that were, like those at the Holocaust ceremony, largely aimed at Jewish voters -- contradict that promise.\n\nAlthough he initially endorsed the Israeli goal of eliminating Hamas and seemed to implicitly commit to that again in his speech, the entire thrust of Biden's current Middle East policy is quite the opposite. He is doing everything he can, including threats of cutting off certain military weapons, diplomatic maneuvers at the United Nations and duplicitous efforts to push through an agreement with the terrorist group, to save Hamas from defeat just when Israel put it on the ropes.\n\nBiden has essentially been playing a double game on the war with Hamas since Oct. 7.\n\nAt times, his words have been just what Israel and its friends needed to hear as they reeled from the largest mass slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust. But just as the antisemitic left didn't wait for the Israel Defense Forces to begin its counter-offensive into Gaza to begin to flip the narrative about the conflict to one about Palestinian victimhood instead of one about the atrocities of Oct. 7, similarly, Biden began to edge away from his initial strong stand behind Jerusalem at the same time.\n\nThough the elimination of Hamas and the end of its rule over Gaza are actually compatible with Biden's quixotic quest to revive a two-state solution to the conflict that the Palestinians have never wanted, the administration has done all it could to delay and minimize the IDF's efforts since October. And since Israel is dependent on U.S. arms and ammunition -- both in terms of offensive operations and the Iron Dome anti-missile batteries that were working overtime in the war's first months as Hamas fired thousands of rockets and missiles at Israeli civilians -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu felt he had no choice to slow down and limit the army's efforts.\n\nThroughout this period, Biden and the rest of his foreign-policy team continued to smear the IDF's actions as \"over the top.\" They blamed it for creating a humanitarian disaster in Gaza. The truth was that Israel's armed forces were using more care to avoid civilian casualties than any other modern army involved in urban combat, including that of the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAppeasing the antisemitic left\n\nThe reason for Biden's carping at Israel had nothing to do with human rights or America's strategic interests. It was motivated by politics.\n\nFrom the moment that the Oct. 7 attacks happened, the left wing of the president's Democratic Party has been vocal in its distaste for Israel and opposition to a successful effort to take out Hamas. So-called \"progressives,\" as well as the extremists of the left-wing congressional \"Squad,\" were falsely accusing Israel of war crimes and \"genocide\" even before the bodies of the Oct. 7 victims were cold. They are motivated by intersectional and critical race theory ideologies, which falsely label Israel as a \"white\" oppressor and regard the Palestinian war to destroy the one Jewish state on the planet as a righteous cause. They want self-determination for everyone but Jews, perceiving Hamas's genocidal goals as a form of justified \"resistance.\"\n\nLiving as he does in a left-wing bubble inside the White House and, as he has always been throughout his long political career, a weathervane determined to stay in sync with liberal fashion, Biden thinks the anger at his initial pro-Israel policies is the reason why he continues to trail former President Donald Trump in the polls. He believes that mollifying disaffected young leftists, as well as Arab and Muslim-American voters, is the key to retaining the support of the Democratic base. As some leftist pundits have put it, he must defeat Netanyahu before he can beat Trump. But the truth is that his problems have nothing to do with Israel, and there are far more votes to be lost in the pro-Israel center of American politics than from left-wing Israel-haters.\n\nStill, and to his credit, Biden didn't make good on his threats to cut off arms until recently. And though he allowed one ceasefire resolution to pass the U.N. Security Council that would have granted Hamas a reprieve without even returning any of the hostages they kidnapped, the administration held off going further than that -- vetoing other dangerous resolutions, including one that would have rewarded the Palestinians for their terrorism with the world body's recognition of their statehood.\n\nPreserving Hamas in Rafah\n\nBut once the IDF had backed Hamas into the last enclave it held in Gaza, Biden stopped talking out of both sides of his mouth and made it clear that he opposed Israel going into Rafah and destroying the last operational Hamas military forces that had retreated there.\n\nHe's gone to great lengths and expense to support humanitarian aid for civilians in Hamas-held portions of the Strip and blamed Israel for interrupting the flow of supplies there, including the building of a U.S. floating harbor to assist in the distribution of food and fuel. That has happened even though it's long been obvious that if there is any real privation there, it is solely because Hamas is stealing the aid that arrives and reserving it for its own use.\n\nJust as troubling, he's put the full force of American influence behind an effort to broker a ceasefire deal with Hamas that will essentially hand the terror group a victory in the war it started.\n\nThe terms of the proposed deals that Washington has backed are appalling. They call for the release of some hostages, but only a percentage of those Hamas is still holding under who knows what horrible conditions. And the pressure that Washington has exerted on Netanyahu to take a deal on virtually any terms and conditions -- along with the way it has coordinated this with Hamas's ally, Qatar -- has given the terrorists all the leverage. That's why Hamas continues to turn down even the most lopsided of agreements; its leaders are convinced that Biden will not let them be defeated. That means they think they can hold out for a deal that will end the war and return the situation to the pre-Oct. 7 status quo in Gaza and still not give up all the hostages, let alone be held accountable for mass murder.\n\nEven when it comes to the surge in antisemitism in the United States, the gap between Biden's Holocaust speech rhetoric and the reality of his policies grows wider every day. He may have chided the pro-Hamas protests for their violence, rule-breaking and antisemitism. But the only people trying to hold the universities accountable are his Republican opponents. There is no sign that the administration is willing to take any action to withhold funds from these schools.\n\nMoreover, even though the protesters won't forgive him for his pro-Israel statements and have labeled him \"genocide Joe,\" Biden has refused to break with openly antisemitic members of his party like Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). Just as telling was his administration's invitation to the anti-Zionist IfNotNow group that has spread antisemitic blood libels to a meeting about antisemitism and its inclusion of the pro-Hamas Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) among those who were allowed to give input on an antisemitism initiative that was nothing but virtue-signaling anyway.\n\nActions speak louder\n\nSo, while Biden's Holocaust speech soothed the feelings of American Jews who are reeling from an unprecedented spike in antisemitism, especially at educational institutions where Jews have thought they were welcome, his actions speak much louder than those words.\n\nAn administration that is using every tactic it can think of to prevent Israel from eliminating Hamas can't claim that it has not forgotten Oct. 7. Stopping Israel from going into Rafah isn't about saving Palestinian lives; Hamas is all too happy to sacrifice as many of its people as necessary if that advances their goal of isolating and smearing Israel. It's about an effort to convince American leftists and Hamas supporters that Biden isn't as pro-Israel as he sometimes wants to pretend to be.\n\nHaving allegedly run for president in 2020 because of his supposed concerns about the hate on display from neo-Nazis at the August 2017 \"Unite the Right\" neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Va., he is now trying to hold onto office by intermittently appeasing left-wing antisemites and undermining Netanyahu's efforts to prevent Hamas from committing more atrocities on Israeli soil. The only calculus to judge Biden's touting of the Holocaust or Oct. 7 -- or to determine if he truly cares about preserving Israel's security -- is whether he will let Hamas be destroyed. If not, all of his rhetoric about those subjects is nothing more than hypocrisy and hot air.\n\nJonathan S. Tobin is editor-in-chief of JNS (Jewish News Syndicate).

Biden took his own children and grandchildren to the Dachau concentration camp in Germany to make sure they learned that same lesson.\n\nHis track record on the issue makes him uniquely positioned to make the case that Americans need to pay attention to antisemitic incidents, said Sarah Hurwitz, former speech writer for Michelle Obama and author of Here all Along, a book about Judaism.\n\n\"I think he perceives something very old and very ugly coming back to haunt us,\" Hurwitz said.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tamara_keith@npr.org", "name": "Tamara Keith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dachau_concentration_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dachau concentration camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2024/05/07/gettyimages-2151357546_wide-80589f42e5e5dae3fc5eba57c0e77922c216fc2a.jpg?s=1400&c=100&f=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545587", "eventUri": "eng-9545587", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 99, "textEnd": 104}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 376, "textEnd": 382, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

In his remarks, the president reaffirmed the sacred pledge of \"never again\" and denounced rising antisemitism, unequivocally declaring \"there's no place on any campus in America -- or any place in America -- for antisemitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind.\"\n\nI was in the Capitol when Biden delivered his speech, just as I was at the White House when he spoke with Jewish American leaders on Oct. 11, four days after the worst massacre of Jewish people since the Holocaust. In both instances, the president's empathy, sincerity, and commitment to Jewish Americans was palpable. He has been unwavering in his support of Jews amid the rise of antisemitism and has affirmed that \"The United States has Israel's back. And I have yours as well, both at home and abroad.\"\n\nBiden has translated these words into action, including through his unprecedented National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, pledge of $14.3 billion in emergency military assistance to Israel, and directing the U.S. military to intervene and defend Israel from an Iranian attack last month, which saved countless Israeli lives.\n\nThe sharp distinction between Biden and former President Donald Trump regarding Israel and antisemitism has become more evident following Oct. 7. The same day that Biden spoke with Jewish leaders in the aftermath of the horrific Hamas attack, Donald Trump callously mocked Israel, disparaged Israeli leaders, and praised Hezbollah -- an Iranian-backed terrorist organization withmore than 100,000 missiles positioned on Israel's northern border. That day, in a speech in West Palm Beach, Trumpasserted that Israeli leaders \"let us down,\" ridiculed Israel's defense minister and called him a \"jerk,\" and suggested Israel was weak.\n\nThe contrast between these two presidential candidates in the immediate aftermath of Oct. 7 could not have been clearer. On the same day that Biden emphatically committed to the safety and security of Israel and Jews around the world, Trump criticized Israel as it struggled to identify its hostages and bury its dead.\n\nMore recently, in a lengthy interview with Israel Hayom, Trumpurged the Israeli military to \"finish up\" in Gaza, appeared toblame Israel for rising antisemitism, and never mentioned the more than 130 hostages still held captive by Hamas. According to TheNew York Times, Trump's call for Israel to end the war in Gaza alarmed those on the right, including his former national security adviser, John Bolton. As Bolton explained to the Times, the Israel HaYom interview \"proves...that Trump's support for Israel in the first term is not guaranteed in the second term, because Trump's positions are made on the basis of what's good for Donald Trump, not on some coherent theory of national security.\"\n\nTrump's policy toward Israel has always been self-serving, perhaps best illustrated when, three years after moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, Trump defiantlydeclared he took such action \"for the Evangelicals.\" At the time, hebemoaned his lack of support among Jewish Americans, struggling to understand why Evangelical Christians would be \"more excited by that [embassy move] than Jewish people.\" What Trump failed to understand is that, regardless of where the U.S. Embassy in Israel is located, more than three-quarters of Jewish American voters continue to have an unfavorable view of him.\n\nJewish voters' overwhelming rejection of Trump is both tied to -- and frequently results in -- his blatant antisemitic statements, including when hesaid in 2019 that Jewish Americans who vote for Democrats demonstrate \"total lack of knowledge or disloyalty,\" invoking anantisemitic dual loyalty accusation. He repeated this earlier this year when heaccused the vast majority of Jewish voters of hating Israel and hating their religion because they vote for Democrats,concluding they should be \"ashamed of themselves.\"\n\nThe only Jews who should be ashamed are the 22 percent with a favorable view of Donald Trump, who has proven beyond a doubt that he is \"a bigot, a fraud, a misogynist, [and] a bully\" toquote the chair of the Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC), Norm Coleman from March 2016. Not only has Trump repeatedly attacked the majority of Jews, but he's aligned with and echoed dangerous right-wing extremists, pointedly refused to condemn white supremacy and instead called on the Proud Boys to \"stand back and stand by,\" inciting a deadly insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021, for which he was impeached.\n\nMeanwhile, Joe Biden has repeatedly declared his support for Jewish Americans amid growing antisemitism. He is working to finalize a hostage release and ceasefire deal, and his moral clarity and leadership stand in stark contrast with the utter void of morality and decency from Donald Trump, who spends his days in a New York courtroom facing multiple felonies and only refers to \"hostages\" in the context of those detained for perpetrating an insurrection.\n\nThis election isn't really about partisan politics - it's a choice between a defender of democracy and someone who vows to be a \"dictator on day one.\" It's a choice between someone fighting to restore the soul of our nation and someone who has repeatedly denigrated it. When faced with those options, it really shouldn't be a difficult decision for Jewish voters or any Americans.\n\nHalie Soifer is CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America (JDCA).

A coalition of GOP lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called on Columbia University President Minouche Shafik to resign over her handling of the demonstrations, while multiple GOP-led House committees have launched investigations into schools' handling of the protests, threatening to withhold federal funding if they're found to be in violation of Title VI. The House last week passed legislation with bipartisan support calling on the Department of Education to adopt a broader definition of antisemitism used by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, though some critics have argued it would infringe on free speech rights.\n\nBiden's speech comes as the Israel-Hamas war has divided the Democratic party, as some progressives have called for Biden to take a stronger stance against Israel's attacks in Gaza amid a rising death toll. The sentiment has spilled onto college campuses in the form of dramatic pro-Palestinian protests that have led to mass arrests, cancelled classes and graduations, and an alarming rise in incidents of antisemitism. Biden has expressed unwavering support for Israel, while at the same time urging Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to take a more measured approach to the attacks in Gaza to spare the lives of civilians and humanitarian aid workers. While his staunch support for Israel has deterred some in his progressive base, his growing frustration with Netanyahu has prompted some Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, to blame him for the protests and rise in incidents of antisemitism since the start of the war on Oct. 7.\n\nBiden had been virtually silent on the campus protests up until last week, when he delivered brief remarks from the White House in defense of \"peaceful protest,\" but also warned \"violent protest is not protected.\" The comments came as police at campuses across the country, including UCLA and Columbia University, dismantled protest encampments and arrested hundreds of demonstrators. \"We are a civil society, and order must prevail,\" Biden said, adding that he would not call the National Guard to intervene, as some Republicans have suggested, nor would he change his Israel-Hamas war policies.\n\nBiden Condemns 'Chaos' Amid Tense Campus Protests -- Doesn't Support Calling In National

On Tuesday, he made strong public remarks about the antisemitism on college campuses and the next day he drew a line in the sand on CNN declaring that he will halt all military aid to Israel if they go into Rafah.\n\nWhat's in Rafah? The final remains of the Hamas terrorist infrastructure and over 130 alive or dead hostages, some of whom are Americans!\n\nWith Biden telling Israel not to enter Rafah, he sends a clear message to the world that he is supporting Hamas, does not care about the hostages, and trust me, the Iranians, Russians and Chinese are watching -- just as they have been for the last three years.\n\nWhat is deeply troubling to me and so many Jewish Americans is that Biden's legacy on almost all issues has been strong words not backed up by any tangible actions.\n\nIf Biden truly believes the antisemitism happening on college campuses is abhorrent -- just as every decent American does -- then why isn't he deploying the National Guard to restore calm and protect Jewish students?\n\nCollege campuses across the United States have witnessed an alarming and sharp rise in antisemitic incidents. From offensive graffiti such as swastikas being painted on the office doors of a Jewish professor at Columbia to hostile demonstrations against Jewish student groups all around the country, these acts of hatred have created an atmosphere of fear and unease among Jewish students.\n\nWhile this has come to the surface on the national stage recently, this has been brewing for the past decade on every single college campus in America.\n\nAs an American, I am deeply disturbed by the recent surge in antisemitic riots and hate-driven events targeting Jewish students on college campuses across our nation. The scenes of violence, intimidation and anti-Jewish rhetoric are not only appalling but also emblematic of a broader trend of bigotry that threatens the very fabric of our educational institutions.\n\nIt is also worth noting that if you were to ask these hooligans who are setting up encampments if they are Democrats or Republicans, I would bet that not a single one would identify as Republican.\n\nDespite these concerning trends, Biden's response to this issue has been notably muted and I would argue that he is totally derelict in his duties as president.\n\nIt would appear that Biden and House Democrats like Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer are far more interested in ensuring they don't upset their Muslim voting blocks in Michigan and Minnesota or the Hamas terrorists in Gaza than doing the right thing in using the full might of the federal government to squash these protests immediately.\n\nThe Biden administration, like its predecessors, is attempting to navigate their desired balance in addressing Middle East conflicts and their impact on domestic sentiments in an effort to placate their liberal base of voters and donors.\n\nThis approach completely overlooks the seriousness of antisemitism on home soil and of course is a major slap in the face to the Jewish Democrat electorate in America.\n\nWhen student groups such as Students for Justice in Palestine post graphics that say \"F*ck the Police\" and the Biden White House doesn't condemn it, we know exactly where their support lies.\n\nTo be honest, what we are witnessing is not merely a clash of ideas or political disagreements; it is a sinister manifestation of antisemitism, fueled by ignorance, hate and ideological extremism.\n\nFrom shouting vile slurs to vandalizing Jewish spaces to denying that Hamas killed, raped and kidnapped innocent Israelis on Oct. 7th, these actions have no place in civilized discourse and should be unequivocally condemned by all.\n\nThe recent antisemitic riots on college campuses should serve as a wake-up call for all Americans who cherish freedom and oppose bigotry. As conservatives, we must stand united in denouncing antisemitism wherever it rears its ugly head and ensure that our educational institutions remain safe and inclusive for everyone. Anything less would be a betrayal of our values and a disservice to future generations.\n\nIt is high time that we reclaim our campuses as bastions of intellectual freedom and tolerance. The failure to address and confront antisemitism head-on not only threatens the well-being of Jewish students but also undermines the foundational principles of diversity and inclusion that universities claim to uphold.\n\nI know that many Americans understand the importance of protecting the rights of all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs. Antisemitism is not just an attack on Jews, it is an assault on the very values of decency, respect and equality that form the bedrock of our society.\n\nTo combat this rising tide of hatred towards Jews, we must demand accountability from university administrators and urge our elected officials, especially Democrats, to speak out forcefully against antisemitism. This requires concrete actions, including enhanced security measures, disciplinary measures against perpetrators of hate crimes and revoking the F-1 and M-1 visas of any college student who is taking part in these protests.\n\nAmerica must uphold the rule of law and prioritize the safety of our citizens and residents, especially within educational environments. Any student who engages in violence or participates in antisemitic riots should face swift and decisive consequences, including immediate deportation for non-citizens.\n\nBryan E.

The ceremony, a yearly event since the Holocaust Museum's founding in 1980, honors the liberation of Nazi concentration camps by US troops and their allies. Convened at the US Capitol Visitor Center, it highlights the work the museum does in heightening awareness of the horrors of the Shoah and the ugly and vicious forms of discrimination and political rhetoric that lead up to it. As the roster of speakers at this year's commemoration all noted, this year's gathering occurs amid a nationwide wave of student protests against Israel's war in Gaza that, in their view, has again made antisemitism a looming threat to Jewish identity and well-being.\n\nThis was certainly the central theme of the event's headline oration -- President Joe Biden's discussion of contemporary antisemitism and measures to combat it. Over the past week, the White House had been promoting Biden's speech as a means of tempering the fraught climate of debate surrounding the war -- but like the other speakers at the rostrum, Biden was trapped in a paradox: Even as he was invoking the lessons of capital-h History, and its injunction never again to permit a horrific event like the Holocaust to happen, he could only offer up a foreshortened, decontextualized, and ultimately ahistorical account of the political situation in Gaza, the Middle East, and the United States. Thus, for instance, Hamas's horrific attacks of October 7, steeped in a political movement dedicated to Israel's extinction, amount to a reprise of Nazism, while critics protesting Israel's inhumane conduct of its war, are by definition collaborators at best and overt antisemites at worst. \"Not 75 years, but just seven and half months later, people are already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror,\" Biden said. \"I have not forgotten, nor have you -- and we will not forget.\"\n\nYet like the other speakers denouncing a purported surge of antisemitism across American campuses, Biden did not mention the reason the protests have taken off: Israel's brutal war wreaking collective punishment for the October 7 attacks, destroying critical infrastructure, and now manufacturing widespread famine. Instead, the demonstrations were, Biden suggested, the return of a primordial \"hatred that continues to lie in the hearts of too many in the world.\" As a result, \"on college campuses, Jewish students are blocked, harassed, and attacked on the way to class,\" while protesters brandish slogans that \"call for the elimination of Israel, the world's only Jewish state.\" This is, he continued, the reflection of an \"injustice...so heinous and grievous that it cannot be buried.\" The only way to fend it off is \"to remember our history so we don't surrender our future to the horrors of the past.\"\n\nIn spelling out the practical application of this dictum, Biden mostly revisited his earlier remarks on the campus protests. America is still bound to \"respect the right to free speech,\" Biden conceded, but cautioned that \"there is no place on our campuses for antisemitism, hate speech, or violence.\" (For an invaluable survey of the actual character of campus anti-war protests, and just how little these three scourges figure into them, see Rick Perlstein's excellent column on the new anti-antisemitism, in The American Prospect.)\n\nIn addition, Biden lectured, \"the destruction of property is not peaceful protest -- it's against the law,\" Biden announced, overlooking that many civil rights protests in the Jim Crow South were deemed destructive of property -- as were, for that matter, Revolutionary-era actions such as the Boston Tea Party. \"No one should have to hide or to be afraid to just be themselves,\" Biden said -- even though this is an accurate description of the Palestinian experience under Israeli occupation, particularly after the Netanyahu government scotched the most recent version of a US-brokered cease-fire and commenced bombing and tank incursions in Rafah on Monday, choking off the principal avenue of aid to Gazans. For all the efforts to conjure the specter of a menacingly intolerant siege of America's institutions of higher education at the hands of antisemitic ideologues, Biden and the other speakers sidestepped the inconvenient truth that Israeli forces have leveled all 12 of Gaza's universities and more than 200 schools altogether.\n\nIt's a heartbreaking irony that the country responsible for these inhumane assaults was founded in the wake of the Shoah, as a means of permanently securing Jewish survival. But the current catastrophe in Gaza is also an injunction to heed those lessons of history -- including the discomfiting truth that communities brutalized by unimaginable suffering aren't immunized from visiting the same traumas on other populations. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, in keeping with his leadership post in a party exploiting ethnic and racial resentments and his own Christian nationalist worldview, delivered a disgraceful speech equating campus protests against the Gaza war with Holocaust-era hate crimes, both maligning anti-war dissent and trivializing Nazi genocide. \"The very campuses that were once the envy of the international economy have succumbed to an antisemitic virus,\" Johnson said. \"Students who were known for producing papers are now known for stabbing their Jewish peers in the eyes with Palestinian flags\" -- dramatically escalating a single right-wing Twitterfied talking point based on the willful distortion of an inadvertent scrape at a Yale protest.\n\nHe then invoked the horrors of the Holocaust to suggest they've directly interpenetrated the present: \"If you close your eyes in the quiet of your own heart, you can hear the glass of Jewish storefronts shattered by stormtroopers.... You can hear screams coming from the gas chambers.\" He then switched over to the October 7 Hamas attacks and landed on this tidy moral: \"Just as in the 1940s, this violence is perpetrated by those who hate the Star of David.... Some are even blaming Israel\" for the October 7 attacks, Johnson said: \"They'd rather do that than punish the terrorists.\"\n\nWhen Johnson isn't pledging fulsome support for Israel before Jewish crowds, he's peddling the vile slander that George Soros -- long the villain of first resort for right-wing antisemites in the vanguard of Trumpian bigotry -- is funding the anti-Israel protests on campus. Nor was any mention made of Johnson's equally full-throated support for Donald Trump, who extolled the good character of Nazi protesters chanting \"Jews will not replace you\" in Charlottesville and hosted Gen Z Nazi propagandist Nick Fuentes at his Mar-a-Lago hate compound. Meanwhile, Johnson's Christian-nationalist movement harbors an opportunistic enthusiasm for Israel that's rooted in readings of end-time prophecy that are themselves more than adjacent to bald antisemitism -- but these, too, are historical complexities that can't be neatly contained in the wan injunction to remember a benighted past to reclaim a brighter future.\n\nIndeed, Trump's repellant gloss on Charlottesville wound up having a grim salience after the proceedings at the Visitor Center wound down. It turned out that, as the assembled speakers were playing up the threat of antisemitic violence on US campuses, a hard-line Zionist protester at Columbia drove his car into a group of anti-war protesters. It further turned out that the accused attacker was Reuven Kahane -- a grandcousin of Meir Kahane, the militant, racist founder of the Jewish Defense League and the Israeli Kach Party who now is a spiritual mascot of Israel's extreme religious right. It's difficult to conjure a more instructive instance of what Jewish philosopher Walter Benjamin -- who'd committed suicide while on the run from the Nazis -- used to call the cunning of history: the notion that the solemn course of events often switches abruptly back against our efforts to ascribe our own higher intentions to it. It's a historical lesson that we all need to learn -- and no one more so than the assembled political leaders holding forth on intolerance and violence at the Capitol Visitor Center.", "source":

We must keep teaching our children and our grandchildren. The truth is we're at risk of people not knowing the truth.\" He then added, in reference to Hamas's October 7 genocidal attack against Israel, \"Here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven-and-a-half months later, and people are already forgetting. They're already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror. I have not forgotten, nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\nThey were appropriate words for the somber occasion, but unfortunately, coming from Biden, they were little more than words. Biden has repeatedly shown that while he may talk a big game, he equivocates when it comes to backing it up. To make matters worse, on the very day Biden challenged America and the world to \"never forget\" what the Jews suffered in the Holocaust, his administration hit pause on sending a shipment of precision bombs to Israel.\n\nAccording to Politico, the Biden administration \"is essentially taking action through inaction\" as it continues to pressure Israel into stopping its advance on the city of Rafah in the Gaza Strip. Indeed, the munitions \"were ready to be shipped to Israel when word of the hold came down.\"\n\nWhat good is remembering the Holocaust if you are unwilling to do everything in your power to stop such a genocide of the Jews from happening again?\n\nThe truth is that Biden's policymaking is guided by reelection concerns, not a commitment to our closest ally in the Middle East. He is bleeding the radical Left youth vote, who have so embraced the Marxist dynamic of oppressor vs. oppressed that they have actually sided with Hamas against Israel.\n\nBiden's criticism of Israel has increased, as he is desperately trying to get the Jewish state to agree to a ceasefire that would only serve to ensure that Hamas survives. Hence, the dubious narrative of Israel being engaged in a genocidal war against the Palestinians, as the Biden administration regularly repeats its concerns for protecting innocent civilians in Gaza.\n\nThe trouble is, by stopping the shipment of precision bombs, Biden has made it that much harder for Israel to carry out targeted strikes against Hamas while avoiding civil casualties. Furthermore, Biden has ironically only ensured that the war will drag on for even longer as Israel presses to end the Hamas threat once and for all.\n\nIn his Holocaust speech, Biden said, \"We must give hate no safe harbor.\" How is seeking to prevent Israel from defeating Hamas, a terrorist organization that continually spews hatred of Israel and Jews, a commitment to giving no safe harbor to hate?\n\nWith this kind of equivocation, how can any of our allies trust Biden to honor America's commitments? Taiwan has got to be wondering whether Biden will raise a finger in defense if China attacks across the Strait.\n\nOnce again, what good is \"remembering\" if you are unwilling to learn the lesson from history? Israel exists today because of the Holocaust. To truly remember the Holocaust is to act in defense of Israel's right to exist and to defend itself from foreign threats.

He assured Jewish Americans of their place in the country amid the continuing protests over Israel's seven-month-old war against Hamas, telling them: \"You're not alone, you belong. You always have and you always will.\"\n\nIn fiery remarks delivered at the United States Capitol to an audience that included multiple Holocaust survivors, Mr Biden recalled how his father had taught him and his siblings about \"the horrors of the Shoa\" around the dinner table as they grew up in Delaware, and said he has looked to impart the same lessons on his children and grandchildren, including by taking them to the site of the Dachau concentration camp \"so they could see and bear witness to the perils of indifference, the complicity of silence in the face of evil\".\n\nThe president explicitly compared the motivations of the Nazis who perpetrated the mass murder of Europe's Jews with the Hamas militants who committed the October 2023 attacks which constituted the worst slaughter of Jews since 1945.\n\nHe warned that the \"ancient hatred of Jews\" did not end with the fall of Nazi Germany, but \"continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world\".\n\n\"That hatred was brought to life on 7 October 2023,\" he said. \"Now here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later. And people are already forgetting or already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror\".\n\n\"It was Hamas that brutalised Israelis, it was Hamas that took and continues to hold hostages,\" he continued. \"I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget!\"\n\nThe president also warned of a \"ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world\" since that day, including on some college campuses where Jewish students, he said, have been kept from attending class by protesters. And he denounced the antisemitic slogans and chants used by some of the protesters, including those \"calling for the annihilation of Israel, the world's own Jewish state\" or \"denying, downplaying, rationalising, ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and 7 October\".\n\n\"It's absolutely despicable and it must stop,\" he said.\n\nMr Biden's remarks came just hours after the White House announced a series of new actions to combat the rising antisemitism he spoke of at the Capitol.\n\nRepublicans have accused the president of failing to denounce campus protests across the country that have, in some cases, involved police action and violence. His critics say that elements of the Democratic voter base are themselves antisemitic and that Mr Biden fears their reaction.\n\nBut Mr Biden came out forcefully against the violent and antisemitic elements of the pro-Palestinian protests in remarks from the White House last week. At the time, he said peaceful protest was \"in the best tradition of how Americans respond to consequential issues\" while stressing that the US is not a \"lawless country\".\n\n\"We're a civil society, and order must prevail,\" he said. \"Destroying property is not a peaceful protest - it's against the law. Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancellation of classes and graduations - none of this is a peaceful protest; threatening people, intimidating people, instilling fear in people is not peaceful protest. It's against the law.\"\n\nThe president reiterated his call for protests to remain within the law at the Capitol on Tuesday, yet as the protests have persisted, so have accusations that the pro-Palestinian demonstrations are per se antisemitic. Concerns have also been raised over whether Jewish students are being denied the right to an education by the actions of some protesters - and the inaction of campus authorities.\n\nTo that end, the Department of Education has sent a \"Dear Colleague\" letter to higher education institutions to lay out guidance on what constitutes antisemitic discrimination that could lead to consequences. The letter uses as its guidance the portions of the Civil Rights Act which prohibit discrimination \"based on actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics\" in the form of a \"hostile environment\" or \"different treatment\".\n\nIn addition, eight Biden administration cabinet departments have issued written guidance which makes clear that the Civil Rights Act \"prohibits certain forms of antisemitic, Islamophobic, and related forms of discrimination in federally funded programs and activities\".\n\nAccording to the White House, these policy rollouts are meant to build on the National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism which the Biden administration rolled out one year ago this month.\n\nA fact sheet distributed to reporters ahead of the president's remarks stated that the Biden administration's strategy \"includes over 100 actions the Biden-Harris Administration has taken, and continues to take, to address the rise of antisemitism in the United States, as well as over 100 calls to action for Congress, state and local governments, companies, technology platforms, students, educators, civil society, faith leaders, and others\".", "source": {"uri":

Antisemitic posters, slogans calling for the annihilation of Israel, the world's only Jewish state.\"\n\nHe drew a distinction between peaceful protest and hateful rhetoric, saying that \"America will respect and protect the fundamental right to free speech.\"\n\n\"Debate and disagree, protest peacefully, make our voices heard,\" Mr. Biden said. \"I understand. That's America, but there is no place on any campus in America, any place in America, for antisemitism or hate speech or threats or violence of any kind.\"\n\nHe took aim at the pro-Palestinian protests roiling U.S. college campuses, which prompted more than 2,000 arrests nationwide in the last two weeks and caused Columbia University and the University of Southern California to cancel their main-stage graduations in favor of small-school ceremonies.\n\n\"Whether against Jews or anyone else, violent attacks, destroying property, is not a peaceful protest. It's against the law, and we're not a lawless country,\" Mr. Biden said. \"We're a civil society. We uphold the rule of law. And no one should have to hide or be brave just to be themselves.\"\n\nThe White House paired the speech with the announcement of \"several new actions to counter the abhorrent rise of Antisemitism in the United States,\" building on the U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism released last year.\n\nThe actions included the letter that the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights sent Friday to 5,000 higher-education institutions giving examples of antisemitic discrimination, including Jewish students being harassed while walking on campus and being told to \"go back to Poland.\"\n\nBoth of those have happened in the last few weeks as anti-Israel protesters erect \"Gaza Solidarity Encampments\" on university lawns, refusing to leave until their demands for colleges to divest from Israel are met.\n\nIn addition, eight cabinet-level agencies clarified in writing for the first time that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \"prohibits certain forms of antisemitism, Islamophobic, and related forms of discrimination.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Much like his comments immediately after the Oct. 7 massacres, his speech at a Holocaust commemoration held in the U.S. Capitol on May 7 struck all the right notes. He not only spoke appropriately about the Six Million slain by the Nazis, he correctly noted that, \"This ancient hatred of Jews didn't begin with the Holocaust. It didn't end with the Holocaust either. Or after -- even after our victory in World War II. This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness. That hatred was brought to life on October 7th of 2023.\"\n\nGoing on, he acknowledged that the current war has unleashed a surge of antisemitism in the United States that has been particularly felt on college campuses. He even detailed the unspeakable atrocities of Oct. 7 (which, according to a live New York Timesupdate about the speech, offends \"pro-Palestinian\" protesters who deny Hamas's crimes). And unlike his first comments about the antisemitic campus protests, he didn't try to balance that with either bogus concerns about a largely mythical problem of Islamophobia or discussions about the alleged sufferings of Palestinian Arabs in the Gaza Strip. He also placed the blame for the current war squarely on the Hamas terror organization.\n\nYet, the president said, \"people are already forgetting. They are already forgetting. That Hamas unleashed this terror. It was Hamas that brutalized Israelis. It was Hamas who took and continues to hold hostages. I have not forgotten nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\nA broken promise\n\nWhile his words earned the applause they garnered, that last statement isn't true. That's because his policies -- as distinct from some of his speeches that were, like those at the Holocaust ceremony, largely aimed at Jewish voters -- contradict that promise.\n\nAlthough he initially endorsed the Israeli goal of eliminating Hamas and seemed to implicitly commit to that again in his speech, the entire thrust of Biden's current Middle East policy is quite the opposite.\n\nHe is doing everything he can, including threats of cutting off certain military weapons, stalling deliveries of bombs, diplomatic maneuvers at the United Nations and duplicitous efforts to push through an agreement with the terrorist group, to save Hamas from defeat just when Israel put it on the ropes.\n\nBiden has essentially been playing a double game on the war with Hamas since Oct. 7.\n\nAt times, his words have been just what Israel and its friends needed to hear as they reeled from the largest mass slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust. But just as the antisemitic left didn't wait for the Israel Defense Forces to begin its counter-offensive into Gaza to begin to flip the narrative about the conflict to one about Palestinian Arab victimhood instead of one about the atrocities of Oct. 7, similarly, Biden began to edge away from his initial strong stand behind Jerusalem at the same time.\n\nThough the elimination of Hamas and the end of its rule over Gaza are actually compatible with Biden's quixotic quest to revive a 'two-state solution' that the Palestinian Arabs have never wanted, the administration has done all it could to delay and minimize the IDF's efforts since October. And since Israel is dependent on U.S. arms and ammunition -- both in terms of offensive operations and the Iron Dome anti-missile batteries that were working overtime in the war's first months as Hamas fired thousands of rockets and missiles at Israeli civilians -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu felt he had no choice but to slow down and limit the army's efforts.\n\nThroughout this period, Biden and the rest of his foreign-policy team continued to smear the IDF's actions as \"over the top.\" They blamed it for creating a humanitarian disaster in Gaza. The truth was that Israel's armed forces were using more care to avoid civilian casualties than any other modern army involved in urban combat, including that of the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAppeasing the antisemitic left\n\nThe reason for Biden's carping at Israel had nothing to do with human rights or America's strategic interests. It was motivated by politics.\n\nFrom the moment that the Oct. 7 attacks happened, the left wing of the president's Democratic Party has been vocal in its distaste for Israel and opposition to a successful effort to take out Hamas. So-called \"progressives,\" as well as the extremists of the left-wing congressional \"Squad,\" were falsely accusing Israel of war crimes and \"genocide\" even before the bodies of the Oct. 7 victims were cold. They are motivated by intersectional and critical race theory ideologies, which falsely label Israel as a \"white\" oppressor and regard the Palestinian Arab war to destroy the one Jewish state on the planet as a righteous cause. They want self-determination for everyone but Jews, perceiving Hamas's genocidal goals as a form of justified \"resistance.\"\n\nLiving as he does in a left-wing bubble inside the White House and, as he has always been throughout his long political career, a weathervane determined to stay in sync with liberal fashion, Biden thinks the anger at his initial pro-Israel policies is the reason why he continues to trail former President Donald Trump in the polls. He believes that mollifying disaffected young leftists, as well as Arab and Muslim-American voters, is the key to retaining the support of the Democratic base.\n\nAs some leftist pundits have put it, he must defeat Netanyahu before he can beat Trump. But the truth is that his problems have nothing to do with Israel, and there are far more votes to be lost in the pro-Israel center of American politics than from left-wing Israel-haters.\n\nTo his credit, Biden didn't make good on his threats to cut off arms until recently. And though he allowed one ceasefire resolution to pass the U.N. Security Council that would have granted Hamas a reprieve without even returning any of the hostages they kidnapped, the administration held off going further than that -- vetoing other dangerous resolutions, including one that would have rewarded the Palestinian Arabs for their terrorism with the world body's recognition of their statehood.\n\nPreserving Hamas in Rafah\n\nBut once the IDF had backed Hamas into the last enclave it held in Gaza, Biden stopped talking out of both sides of his mouth and made it clear that he opposed Israel going into Rafah and destroying the last operational Hamas military forces that had retreated there.\n\nHe's gone to great lengths and expense to support humanitarian aid for civilians in Hamas-held portions of the Strip and falsely blamed Israel for interrupting the flow of supplies there, including the building of a U.S. floating harbor to assist in the distribution of food and fuel. That has happened even though it's long been obvious that if there is any real privation there, it is solely because Hamas is stealing the aid that arrives and reserving it for its own use.\n\nJust as troubling, he's put the full force of American influence behind an effort to broker a ceasefire deal with Hamas that will essentially hand the terror group a victory in the war it started.\n\nThe terms of the proposed deals that Washington has backed are appalling. They call for the release of some hostages, but only a percentage of those Hamas is still holding under who knows what horrible conditions. And the pressure that Washington has exerted on Netanyahu to take a deal on virtually any terms and conditions -- along with the way it has coordinated this with Hamas's ally, Qatar -- has given the terrorists all the leverage.\n\nThat's why Hamas continues to turn down even the most lopsided of agreements; its leaders are convinced that Biden will not let them be defeated. That means they think they can hold out for a deal that will end the war and return the situation to the pre-Oct. 7 status quo in Gaza and still not give up all the hostages, let alone be held accountable for mass murder.\n\nEven when it comes to the surge in antisemitism in the United States, the gap between Biden's Holocaust speech rhetoric and the reality of his policies grows wider every day. He may have chided the pro-Hamas protests for their violence, rule-breaking and antisemitism. But the only people trying to hold the universities accountable are his Republican opponents. There is no sign that the administration is willing to take any action to withhold funds from these schools.\n\nMoreover, even though the protesters won't forgive him for his pro-Israel statements and have labeled him \"genocide Joe,\" Biden has refused to break with openly antisemitic members of his party like Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). Just as telling was his administration's invitation to the anti-Zionist IfNotNow group that has spread antisemitic blood libels to a meeting about antisemitism and its inclusion of the pro-Hamas Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) among those who were allowed to give input on an antisemitism initiative that was nothing but virtue-signaling anyway.\n\nActions speak louder\n\nSo, while Biden's Holocaust speech soothed the feelings of American Jews who are reeling from an unprecedented spike in antisemitism, especially at educational institutions where Jews have thought they were welcome, his actions speak much louder than those words.\n\nAn administration that is using every tactic it can think of to prevent Israel from eliminating Hamas can't claim that it has not forgotten Oct. 7. Stopping Israel from going into Rafah isn't about saving Palestinian Arab lives; Hamas is all too happy to sacrifice as many of its people as necessary if that advances their goal of isolating and smearing Israel. It's about an effort to convince American leftists and Hamas supporters that Biden isn't as pro-Israel as he sometimes wants to pretend to be.\n\nHaving allegedly run for president in 2020 because of his supposed concerns about the hate on display from neo-Nazis at the August 2017 \"Unite the Right\" neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Va., he is now trying to hold onto office by intermittently appeasing left-wing antisemites and undermining Netanyahu's efforts to prevent Hamas from committing more atrocities on Israeli soil.\n\nThe only calculus to judge Biden's touting of the Holocaust or Oct. 7 -- or to determine if he truly cares about preserving Israel's security -- is whether he will let Hamas be destroyed. If not, all of his rhetoric about those subjects is nothing more than hypocrisy and hot air.", "source": {"uri": "israelnationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Israel National News"},

Much like his comments immediately after the Oct. 7 massacres, his speech at a Holocaust commemoration held in the U.S. Capitol on May 7 struck all the right notes. He not only spoke appropriately about the Six Million slain by the Nazis, he correctly noted that, \"This ancient hatred of Jews didn't begin with the Holocaust. It didn't end with the Holocaust either. Or after -- even after our victory in World War II. This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness. That hatred was brought to life on October 7th of 2023.\"\n\nGoing on, he acknowledged that the current war has unleashed a surge of antisemitism in the United States that has been particularly felt on college campuses. He even detailed the unspeakable atrocities of Oct. 7 (which, according to a live New York Times update about the speech, offends \"pro-Palestinian\" protesters who deny Hamas's crimes). And unlike his first comments about the antisemitic campus protests, he didn't try to balance that with either bogus concerns about a largely mythical problem of Islamophobia or discussions about the alleged sufferings of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. He also placed the blame for the current war squarely on the Hamas terror organization.\n\nYet, the president said, \"people are already forgetting. They are already forgetting. That Hamas unleashed this terror. It was Hamas that brutalized Israelis. It was Hamas who took and continues to hold hostages. I have not forgotten nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\nA broken promise\n\nWhile his words earned the applause they garnered, that last statement isn't true. That's because his policies -- as distinct from some of his speeches that were, like those at the Holocaust ceremony, largely aimed at Jewish voters -- contradict that promise.\n\nAlthough he initially endorsed the Israeli goal of eliminating Hamas and seemed to implicitly commit to that again in his speech, the entire thrust of Biden's current Middle East policy is quite the opposite. He is doing everything he can, including threats of cutting off certain military weapons, diplomatic maneuvers at the United Nations and duplicitous efforts to push through an agreement with the terrorist group, to save Hamas from defeat just when Israel put it on the ropes.\n\nBiden has essentially been playing a double game on the war with Hamas since Oct. 7.\n\nAt times, his words have been just what Israel and its friends needed to hear as they reeled from the largest mass slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust. But just as the antisemitic left didn't wait for the Israel Defense Forces to begin its counter-offensive into Gaza to begin to flip the narrative about the conflict to one about Palestinian victimhood from the atrocities of Oct. 7, similarly, Biden began to edge away from his initial strong stand behind Jerusalem at the same time.\n\nThough the elimination of Hamas and the end of its rule over Gaza are actually compatible with Biden's quixotic quest to revive a two-state solution to the conflict that the Palestinians have never wanted, the administration has done all it could to delay and minimize the IDF's efforts since October. And since Israel is dependent on U.S. arms and ammunition -- both in terms of offensive operations and the Iron Dome anti-missile batteries that were working overtime in the war's first months as Hamas fired thousands of rockets and missiles at Israeli civilians -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu felt he had no choice to slow down and limit the army's efforts.\n\nThroughout this period, Biden and the rest of his foreign-policy team continued to smear the IDF's actions as \"over the top.\" They blamed it for creating a humanitarian disaster in Gaza. The truth was that Israel's armed forces were using more care to avoid civilian casualties than any other modern army involved in urban combat, including that of the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAppeasing the antisemitic left\n\nThe reason for Biden's carping at Israel had nothing to do with human rights or America's strategic interests. It was motivated by politics.\n\nFrom the moment that the Oct. 7 attacks happened, the left wing of the president's Democratic Party has been vocal in its distaste for Israel and opposition to a successful effort to take out Hamas. So-called \"progressives,\" as well as the extremists of the left-wing congressional \"Squad,\" were falsely accusing Israel of war crimes and \"genocide\" even before the bodies of the Oct. 7 victims were cold. They are motivated by intersectional and critical race theory ideologies, which falsely label Israel as a \"white\" oppressor and regard the Palestinian war to destroy the one Jewish state on the planet as a righteous cause. They want self-determination for everyone but Jews, perceiving Hamas's genocidal goals as a form of justified \"resistance.\"\n\nLiving as he does in a left-wing bubble inside the White House and, as he has always been throughout his long political career, a weathervane determined to stay in sync with liberal fashion, Biden thinks the anger at his initial pro-Israel policies is the reason why he continues to trail former President Donald Trump in the polls. He believes that mollifying disaffected young leftists, as well as Arab and Muslim-American voters, is the key to retaining the support of the Democratic base. As some leftist pundits have put it, he must defeat Netanyahu before he can beat Trump. But the truth is that his problems have nothing to do with Israel, and there are far more votes to be lost in the pro-Israel center of American politics than from left-wing Israel-haters.\n\nStill, and to his credit, Biden didn't make good on his threats to cut off arms. And though he allowed one ceasefire resolution to pass the U.N. Security Council that would have granted Hamas a reprieve without even returning any of the hostages they kidnapped, the administration held off going further than that -- vetoing other dangerous resolutions, including one that would have rewarded the Palestinians for their terrorism with the world body's recognition of their statehood.\n\nPreserving Hamas in Rafah\n\nBut once the IDF had backed Hamas into the last enclave it held in Gaza, Biden stopped talking out of both sides of his mouth and made it clear that he opposed Israel going into Rafah and destroying the last operational Hamas military forces that had retreated there.\n\nHe's gone to great lengths and expense to support humanitarian aid for civilians in Hamas-held portions of the Strip and blamed Israel for interrupting the flow of supplies there, including the building of a U.S. floating harbor to assist in the distribution of food and fuel. That has happened even though it's long been obvious that if there is any real privation there, it is solely because Hamas is stealing the aid that arrives and reserving it for its own use.\n\nJust as troubling, he's put the full force of American influence behind an effort to broker a ceasefire deal with Hamas that will essentially hand the terror group a victory in the war it started.\n\nThe terms of the proposed deals that Washington has backed are appalling. They call for the release of some hostages, but only a percentage of those Hamas is still holding under who knows what horrible conditions. And the pressure that Washington has exerted on Netanyahu to take a deal on virtually any terms and conditions -- along with the way it has coordinated this with Hamas's ally, Qatar -- has given the terrorists all the leverage. That's why Hamas continues to turn down even the most lopsided of agreements; its leaders are convinced that Biden will not let them be defeated. That means they think they can hold out for a deal that will end the war and return the situation to the pre-Oct. 7 status quo in Gaza and still not give up all the hostages, let alone be held accountable for mass murder.\n\nEven when it comes to the surge in antisemitism in the United States, the gap between Biden's Holocaust speech rhetoric and the reality of his policies grows wider every day. He may have chided the pro-Hamas protests for their violence, rule-breaking and antisemitism. But the only people trying to hold the universities accountable are his Republican opponents. There is no sign that the administration is willing to take any action to withhold funds from these schools.\n\nMoreover, even though the protesters won't forgive him for his pro-Israel statements and have labeled him \"genocide Joe,\" Biden has refused to break with openly antisemitic members of his party like Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). Just as telling was his administration's invitation to the anti-Zionist IfNotNow group that has spread antisemitic blood libels to a meeting about antisemitism and its inclusion of the pro-Hamas Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) among those who were allowed to give input on an antisemitism initiative that was nothing but virtue-signaling anyway.\n\nActions speak louder\n\nSo, while Biden's Holocaust speech soothed the feelings of American Jews who are reeling from an unprecedented spike in antisemitism, especially at educational institutions where Jews have thought they were welcome, his actions speak much louder than those words.\n\nAn administration that is using every tactic it can think of to prevent Israel from eliminating Hamas can't claim that it has not forgotten Oct. 7. Stopping Israel from going into Rafah isn't about saving Palestinian lives; Hamas is all too happy to sacrifice as many of its people as necessary if that advances their goal of isolating and smearing Israel. It's about an effort to convince American leftists and Hamas supporters that Biden isn't as pro-Israel as he sometimes wants to pretend to be.\n\nHaving allegedly run for president in 2020 because of his supposed concerns about the hate on display from neo-Nazis at the August 2017 \"Unite the Right\" neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Va., he is now trying to hold onto office by intermittently appeasing left-wing antisemites and undermining Netanyahu's efforts to prevent Hamas from committing more atrocities on Israeli soil. The only calculus to judge Biden's touting of the Holocaust or Oct. 7 -- or to determine if he truly cares about preserving Israel's security -- is whether he will let Hamas be destroyed. If not, all of his rhetoric about those subjects is nothing more than hypocrisy and hot air.

The vast majority of these refugees have been displaced multiple times.\n\nIsrael bombed residential homes throughout Gaza Monday, leaving dozens dead -- mostly women and children -- and dozens more wounded and buried under the rubble. On Tuesday, Israel seized, and blocked, the Rafah border crossing, shutting a vital lifeline of food for the starving population of Gaza.\n\nIn a speech on Tuesday, President Joe Biden effectively endorsed Israel's onslaught on the city, cynically seeking to exploit the Holocaust to justify US support for the Israeli state's genocide of the Palestinians.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden declared:\n\nThis ancient hatred of Jews didn't begin with the Holocaust... This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people... That hatred was brought to life on October 7, 2023.\n\nBiden's attempt to equate the Holocaust, the industrial extermination of over six million Jews by Nazi Germany, the most powerful capitalist state in Europe, with the events of October 7 is a complete falsification of history.\n\nThe only parallel between the Holocaust and the past six months is the way in which the far-right Zionist regime is echoing the crimes perpetrated by German fascism against the Jewish people -- this time against the Palestinians of Gaza.\n\nThe Palestinians had no responsibility for the Holocaust whatsoever. And the events of October 7, an uprising by a captive, imprisoned and dispossessed people, have far more in common with the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising against the Nazi occupation.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden did not make a single reference to the suffering and death inflicted upon the people of Gaza, or to the 75 years of dispossession and Israeli crimes against the Palestinians, which have included numerous acts of mass murder from 1948 on by the Israeli state.\n\nBiden's speech mirrored, in all essentials, remarks given on Friday by Benjamin Netanyahu at a Holocaust commemoration ceremony, in which the far-right Israeli prime minister pledged to assault Rafah and subjugate all of Gaza as the only means to \"guarantee our existence and our future.\"\n\nIn his remarks Tuesday, Biden reaffirmed his administration's total support for the Israeli genocide in Gaza, declaring, \"My commitment to... the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad, even when we disagree.\"\n\nIn fact, Biden's claim to \"disagree\" with the invasion of Rafah is a lie. By publicly declaring that there will be no consequences for whatever the Israeli regime does, the White House is effectively giving a blank check to massacre the population of Gaza.\n\nBiden's invocation of the Holocaust was likewise aimed at legitimizing his administration's crackdown on anti-genocide protests, which has also seen the arrest of hundreds of Jewish people protesting the Gaza genocide. Biden declared:\n\nWe've seen a ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world. Vicious propaganda on social media. Jews are forced to hide their kippahs under baseball hats, to tuck their Jewish stars into their shirts. On college campuses, Jewish students are blocked, harassed, and attacked while walking into class. Antisemitic posters and slogans calling for the annihilation of Israel, the world's only Jewish state. Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing, and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7.\n\nAll of this, again, is a complete absurdity. The mass demonstrations throughout the United States have featured widespread participation by Jewish people. Many have included prominent displays of Jewish religious worship with the fraternal participation of Muslims, Christians and atheists.\n\nThe claim that Biden's defense of the Gaza genocide and his crackdown on anti-war protests are motivated by opposition to antisemitism is a lie. In the US, Biden is openly allied with notorious antisemites, such as Majorie Taylor Greene and the leaders of the January 6 insurrection, in backing police attacks on anti-war protestors. In Ukraine, Biden is funding and arming the fascistic Zelensky regime, whose national hero is the holocaust collaborator Stepan Bandera.\n\nThose really threatened by violence are the protestors, hundreds of whom have been arrested, beaten, tear-gassed and shot with rubber bullets in the course of Biden's police crackdown. Over the weekend, New York City Mayor Eric Adams threatened to \"terminate\" protests against the Gaza genocide, while Senator Tom Cotton refereed to protests as \"little Gazas,\" implying that the police should treat protestors like Gazans are treated by Israel.\n\nIn slandering opposition to genocide as antisemitism, Biden is repeating the Zionist lie that equates Jewish identity with support for Israel. According to this right-wing narrative, American Jews are defined by their religion, which in turn is conflated with the Israeli state.\n\nThe Zionist state is, and always has been, an instrument of imperialism. Historically, Zionism emerged as a reactionary ideology based on the false claim that antisemitism was an inevitable and permanent feature of society that could be combated only through the creation of a Jewish ethno-nationalist state.\n\nIt was and remains an ideology based on bitter hostility toward the socialist movement and its anti-capitalist and internationalist program, which enjoyed powerful support among the Jewish masses. In its ideological and historical origins, Zionism mirrors key features of fascism and antisemitism itself, which, in the modern period, arose above all as a reaction against the socialist working class movement.\n\nBiden's efforts to justify the predatory interests of US imperialism by invoking the Holocaust are rightly seen by millions of people around the world as a transparent fraud. The real content of Biden speech is an open endorsement, by the world's leading imperialist power, of genocide as an instrument of state policy, exposing the intention of imperialism to repeat the greatest crimes of the 20th century.\n\nRead moreAs Biden backs police assault on anti-genocide protests, Netanyahu prepares Rafah bloodbath3 May 2024Contact usRelated TopicsFind out more about these

On Tuesday, he made strong public remarks about the antisemitism on college campuses and the next day he drew a line in the sand on CNN declaring that he will halt all military aid to Israel if they go into Rafah. (RELATED: REP. AARON BEAN: It's Time To Boot Activist Agendas From Our K-12 Schools)\n\nWhat's in Rafah? The final remains of the Hamas terrorist infrastructure and over 130 alive or dead hostages, some of whom are Americans!\n\nWith Biden telling Israel not to enter Rafah, he sends a clear message to the world that he is supporting Hamas, does not care about the hostages, and trust me, the Iranians, Russians and Chinese are watching -- just as they have been for the last three years.\n\nWhat is deeply troubling to me and so many Jewish Americans is that Biden's legacy on almost all issues has been strong words not backed up by any tangible actions.\n\nIf Biden truly believes the antisemitism happening on college campuses is abhorrent -- just as every decent American does -- then why isn't he deploying the National Guard to restore calm and protect Jewish students?\n\nCollege campuses across the United States have witnessed an alarming and sharp rise in antisemitic incidents. From offensive graffiti such as swastikas being painted on the office doors of a Jewish professor at Columbia to hostile demonstrations against Jewish student groups all around the country, these acts of hatred have created an atmosphere of fear and unease among Jewish students.\n\nWhile this has come to the surface on the national stage recently, this has been brewing for the past decade on every single college campus in America.\n\nAs an American, I am deeply disturbed by the recent surge in antisemitic riots and hate-driven events targeting Jewish students on college campuses across our nation. The scenes of violence, intimidation and anti-Jewish rhetoric are not only appalling but also emblematic of a broader trend of bigotry that threatens the very fabric of our educational institutions.\n\nIt is also worth noting that if you were to ask these hooligans who are setting up encampments if they are Democrats or Republicans, I would bet that not a single one would identify as Republican.\n\nDespite these concerning trends, Biden's response to this issue has been notably muted and I would argue that he is totally derelict in his duties as president.\n\nIt would appear that Biden and House Democrats like Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer are far more interested in ensuring they don't upset their Muslim voting blocks in Michigan and Minnesota or the Hamas terrorists in Gaza than doing the right thing in using the full might of the federal government to squash these protests immediately.\n\nThe Biden administration, like its predecessors, is attempting to navigate their desired balance in addressing Middle East conflicts and their impact on domestic sentiments in an effort to placate their liberal base of voters and donors.\n\nThis approach completely overlooks the seriousness of antisemitism on home soil and of course is a major slap in the face to the Jewish Democrat electorate in America.\n\nWhen student groups such as Students for Justice in Palestine post graphics that say \"F*ck the Police\" and the Biden White House doesn't condemn it, we know exactly where their support lies.\n\nTo be honest, what we are witnessing is not merely a clash of ideas or political disagreements; it is a sinister manifestation of antisemitism, fueled by ignorance, hate and ideological extremism.\n\nFrom shouting vile slurs to vandalizing Jewish spaces to denying that Hamas killed, raped and kidnapped innocent Israelis on Oct. 7th, these actions have no place in civilized discourse and should be unequivocally condemned by all.\n\nThe recent antisemitic riots on college campuses should serve as a wake-up call for all Americans who cherish freedom and oppose bigotry. As conservatives, we must stand united in denouncing antisemitism wherever it rears its ugly head and ensure that our educational institutions remain safe and inclusive for everyone. Anything less would be a betrayal of our values and a disservice to future generations.\n\nIt is high time that we reclaim our campuses as bastions of intellectual freedom and tolerance. The failure to address and confront antisemitism head-on not only threatens the well-being of Jewish students but also undermines the foundational principles of diversity and inclusion that universities claim to uphold. (RELATED: JOSH HAMMER: Biden Is Committing Political Suicide By Appeasing Hamas)\n\nI know that many Americans understand the importance of protecting the rights of all individuals, regardless of their background or beliefs. Antisemitism is not just an attack on Jews, it is an assault on the very values of decency, respect and equality that form the bedrock of our society.\n\nTo combat this rising tide of hatred towards Jews, we must demand accountability from university administrators and urge our elected officials, especially Democrats, to speak out forcefully against antisemitism. This requires concrete actions, including enhanced security measures, disciplinary measures against perpetrators of hate crimes and revoking the F-1 and M-1 visas of any college student who is taking part in these protests.\n\nAmerica must uphold the rule of law and prioritize the safety of our citizens and residents, especially within educational environments. Any student who engages in violence or participates in antisemitic riots should face swift and decisive consequences, including immediate deportation for non-citizens.\n\nBryan E.

Tobin is editor-in-chief of JNS (Jewish News Syndicate). Follow him @jonathans_tobin.\n\nWhen President Joe Biden wants to say the right things about Israel and antisemitism, he knows how. Much like his comments immediately after the Oct. 7 massacres, his speech at a Holocaust commemoration held in the U.S. Capitol on May 7 struck all the right notes. He not only spoke appropriately about the Six Million slain by the Nazis, he correctly noted that, \"This ancient hatred of Jews didn't begin with the Holocaust. It didn't end with the Holocaust either. Or after -- even after our victory in World War II. This hatred continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world and requires our continued vigilance and outspokenness. That hatred was brought to life on October 7th of 2023.\"\n\nGoing on, he acknowledged that the current war has unleashed a surge of antisemitism in the United States that has been particularly felt on college campuses. He even detailed the unspeakable atrocities of Oct. 7 (which, according to a live New York Times update about the speech, offends \"pro-Palestinian\" protesters who deny Hamas's crimes). And unlike his first comments about the antisemitic campus protests, he didn't try to balance that with either bogus concerns about a largely mythical problem of Islamophobia or discussions about the alleged sufferings of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. He also placed the blame for the current war squarely on the Hamas terror organization.\n\nYet, the president said, \"people are already forgetting. They are already forgetting. That Hamas unleashed this terror. It was Hamas that brutalized Israelis. It was Hamas who took and continues to hold hostages. I have not forgotten nor have you. And we will not forget.\"\n\nA broken promise\n\nWhile his words earned the applause they garnered, that last statement isn't true. That's because his policies -- as distinct from some of his speeches that were, like those at the Holocaust ceremony, largely aimed at Jewish voters -- contradict that promise.\n\nAlthough he initially endorsed the Israeli goal of eliminating Hamas and seemed to implicitly commit to that again in his speech, the entire thrust of Biden's current Middle East policy is quite the opposite. He is doing everything he can, including threats of cutting off certain military weapons, diplomatic maneuvers at the United Nations and duplicitous efforts to push through an agreement with the terrorist group, to save Hamas from defeat just when Israel put it on the ropes.\n\nBiden has essentially been playing a double game on the war with Hamas since Oct. 7.\n\nAt times, his words have been just what Israel and its friends needed to hear as they reeled from the largest mass slaughter of Jews since the Holocaust. But just as the antisemitic left didn't wait for the Israel Defense Forces to begin its counter-offensive into Gaza to begin to flip the narrative about the conflict to one about Palestinian victimhood from the atrocities of Oct. 7, similarly, Biden began to edge away from his initial strong stand behind Jerusalem at the same time.\n\nThough the elimination of Hamas and the end of its rule over Gaza are actually compatible with Biden's quixotic quest to revive a two-state solution to the conflict that the Palestinians have never wanted, the administration has done all it could to delay and minimize the IDF's efforts since October. And since Israel is dependent on U.S. arms and ammunition -- both in terms of offensive operations and the Iron Dome anti-missile batteries that were working overtime in the war's first months as Hamas fired thousands of rockets and missiles at Israeli civilians -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu felt he had no choice to slow down and limit the army's efforts.\n\nThroughout this period, Biden and the rest of his foreign-policy team continued to smear the IDF's actions as \"over the top.\" They blamed it for creating a humanitarian disaster in Gaza. The truth was that Israel's armed forces were using more care to avoid civilian casualties than any other modern army involved in urban combat, including that of the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nAppeasing the antisemitic left\n\nThe reason for Biden's carping at Israel had nothing to do with human rights or America's strategic interests. It was motivated by politics.\n\nFrom the moment that the Oct. 7 attacks happened, the left wing of the president's Democratic Party has been vocal in its distaste for Israel and opposition to a successful effort to take out Hamas. So-called \"progressives,\" as well as the extremists of the left-wing congressional \"Squad,\" were falsely accusing Israel of war crimes and \"genocide\" even before the bodies of the Oct. 7 victims were cold. They are motivated by intersectional and critical race theory ideologies, which falsely label Israel as a \"white\" oppressor and regard the Palestinian war to destroy the one Jewish state on the planet as a righteous cause. They want self-determination for everyone but Jews, perceiving Hamas's genocidal goals as a form of justified \"resistance.\"\n\nLiving as he does in a left-wing bubble inside the White House and, as he has always been throughout his long political career, a weathervane determined to stay in sync with liberal fashion, Biden thinks the anger at his initial pro-Israel policies is the reason why he continues to trail former President Donald Trump in the polls. He believes that mollifying disaffected young leftists, as well as Arab and Muslim-American voters, is the key to retaining the support of the Democratic base. As some leftist pundits have put it, he must defeat Netanyahu before he can beat Trump. But the truth is that his problems have nothing to do with Israel, and there are far more votes to be lost in the pro-Israel center of American politics than from left-wing Israel-haters.\n\nStill, and to his credit, Biden didn't make good on his threats to cut off arms. And though he allowed one ceasefire resolution to pass the U.N. Security Council that would have granted Hamas a reprieve without even returning any of the hostages they kidnapped, the administration held off going further than that -- vetoing other dangerous resolutions, including one that would have rewarded the Palestinians for their terrorism with the world body's recognition of their statehood.\n\nPreserving Hamas in Rafah\n\nBut once the IDF had backed Hamas into the last enclave it held in Gaza, Biden stopped talking out of both sides of his mouth and made it clear that he opposed Israel going into Rafah and destroying the last operational Hamas military forces that had retreated there.\n\nHe's gone to great lengths and expense to support humanitarian aid for civilians in Hamas-held portions of the Strip and blamed Israel for interrupting the flow of supplies there, including the building of a U.S. floating harbor to assist in the distribution of food and fuel. That has happened even though it's long been obvious that if there is any real privation there, it is solely because Hamas is stealing the aid that arrives and reserving it for its own use.\n\nJust as troubling, he's put the full force of American influence behind an effort to broker a ceasefire deal with Hamas that will essentially hand the terror group a victory in the war it started.\n\nThe terms of the proposed deals that Washington has backed are appalling. They call for the release of some hostages, but only a percentage of those Hamas is still holding under who knows what horrible conditions. And the pressure that Washington has exerted on Netanyahu to take a deal on virtually any terms and conditions -- along with the way it has coordinated this with Hamas's ally, Qatar -- has given the terrorists all the leverage. That's why Hamas continues to turn down even the most lopsided of agreements; its leaders are convinced that Biden will not let them be defeated. That means they think they can hold out for a deal that will end the war and return the situation to the pre-Oct. 7 status quo in Gaza and still not give up all the hostages, let alone be held accountable for mass murder.\n\nEven when it comes to the surge in antisemitism in the United States, the gap between Biden's Holocaust speech rhetoric and the reality of his policies grows wider every day. He may have chided the pro-Hamas protests for their violence, rule-breaking and antisemitism. But the only people trying to hold the universities accountable are his Republican opponents. There is no sign that the administration is willing to take any action to withhold funds from these schools.\n\nMoreover, even though the protesters won't forgive him for his pro-Israel statements and have labeled him \"genocide Joe,\" Biden has refused to break with openly antisemitic members of his party like Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). Just as telling was his administration's invitation to the anti-Zionist IfNotNow group that has spread antisemitic blood libels to a meeting about antisemitism and its inclusion of the pro-Hamas Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) among those who were allowed to give input on an antisemitism initiative that was nothing but virtue-signaling anyway.\n\nActions speak louder\n\nSo, while Biden's Holocaust speech soothed the feelings of American Jews who are reeling from an unprecedented spike in antisemitism, especially at educational institutions where Jews have thought they were welcome, his actions speak much louder than those words.\n\nAn administration that is using every tactic it can think of to prevent Israel from eliminating Hamas can't claim that it has not forgotten Oct. 7. Stopping Israel from going into Rafah isn't about saving Palestinian lives; Hamas is all too happy to sacrifice as many of its people as necessary if that advances their goal of isolating and smearing Israel. It's about an effort to convince American leftists and Hamas supporters that Biden isn't as pro-Israel as he sometimes wants to pretend to be.\n\nHaving allegedly run for president in 2020 because of his supposed concerns about the hate on display from neo-Nazis at the August 2017 \"Unite the Right\" neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Va., he is now trying to hold onto office by intermittently appeasing left-wing antisemites and undermining Netanyahu's efforts to prevent Hamas from committing more atrocities on Israeli soil. The only calculus to judge Biden's touting of the Holocaust or Oct. 7 -- or to determine if he truly cares about preserving Israel's security -- is whether he will let Hamas be destroyed. If not, all of his rhetoric about those subjects is nothing more than hypocrisy and hot air.", "source": {"uri": "jns.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish News Syndicate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_s_tobin@jns.org", "name": "Jonathan S.

They're already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror.\"\n\nHe denounced the \"ferocious surge\" of antisemitism in the US, saying too many people are \"denying, downplaying, rationalizing and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and Oct. 7 -- including Hamas' appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize. It's absolutely despicable -- and it must stop.\"\n\nBravo!\n\nThe speech was well written and well delivered as Biden largely avoided his usual stumbles and mumbles.\n\nIt's also remarkable that he has such strong feelings about the rancid antisemitism unfolding in America, given how quiet he has been despite a clamor for him to denounce it.\n\nYet a speech, even an excellent one, is just a speech unless it is backed up with actions and policy.\n\nAnd therein lies the disconnect between what Biden says and what he's actually doing, and not doing.\n\nMany of his actions over the last six months actually undercut the sentiments he expressed Tuesday.\n\nAnd the conflicting pattern continues as he foolishly appears determined to stop Israel from eliminating the remnants of Hamas with its assault on Rafah.\n\nThis is a crucial time in Israel's history.\n\nIran, by activating Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, is generating the most serious threat to Israel's existence in decades.\n\nYet instead of the world rallying to help crush the threat, the wolves in Europe and America smell blood and see a chance to neuter if not destroy the Jewish state.\n\nWhile Biden's heart may be with Israel, he has too often sought a balance of interests, as if good and evil are equally deserving.\n\nAnd so with one hand, he offers Israel military support, and with the other he condemns its methods in Gaza and denounces its democratically elected government, the only one in the region.\n\nHe promises Palestinians a state, over Israeli objections and without any plan for security, guaranteeing the current war will not be the last.\n\nSimilarly, the antisemitism he decries has been roiling college campuses for months, yet he waited until the Holocaust event to wholeheartedly denounce it.\n\nAnd his Department of Justice, which has been a bulldog at his beck and call when it comes to prosecuting his political opponents, is AWOL in the face of a clear conspiracy to harass Jews and foment hatred across the country.\n\nIn defiance of a necessary strategy, he stubbornly refuses to tighten the screws on Iran, giving the mullahs more money and more freedom to torment Israel and our other regional allies.\n\nNearly a quarter of the globe's population is Muslim, and Muslims are the majority in nearly 50 nations.\n\nIsrael stands alone and its survival in such a nasty neighborhood would be questionable without America's backing.\n\nBut by feuding with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, abstaining as the United Nations Security Council passed a poisonous resolution and even withholding an arms shipment that Congress authorized, the president casts doubt on his commitment to Israel and gives hope to those advocating genocide of the Jews.\n\nWeakness is one thing, but the president's latest move takes the cake for double dealing.\n\nReports say Americans knew Arab mediators in Egypt had sweetened a cease-fire offering to Hamas, but didn't tell Israel.\n\nNetanyahu's government first learned of the secret offer only when Hamas said it accepted the terms, The Times of Israel and others reported.\n\nThe outcome of this drip-drip-drip of appeasement is predictable: Israel's enemies, in the Mideast and in the United States, are emboldened.\n\nAlthough Biden clearly aims to placate many young voters critical of Israel, including Muslim Americans in swing states, the effect is like feeding a crocodile a small piece of meat.\n\nEach bite is followed by a demand for more.\n\nAs a result, Biden is hurting Israel without helping himself politically.\n\nThere is a larger issue at work, too, and that is the way the often-violent protests have spilled out of campuses and into the streets of American cities.\n\nBy attacking police and historic monuments, and snarling traffic, the keffiyeh-wearing pro-Hamas mobs are creating widespread disorder and fear.\n\nNo incumbent can benefit from those images being played in homes and on smartphones.\n\nThe disorder helps Donald Trump make the case that Biden is a weak president who cannot keep Americans safe or lead a fragmented world.\n\nThat impression of weakness is confirmed by the president's failure to gain the release of American citizens held hostage by Hamas.\n\nHe says repeatedly he won't rest until they're free, but Hamas has paid no price for taking and holding them. He only puts pressure on Israel.\n\nNetanyahu and his war cabinet, clearly regarding the cat-and-mouse peace talks as a stalling tactic, are finally making their first big military foray into Rafah, Hamas' last stronghold.\n\nIf there are living hostages of any nationality, they are likely there.\n\nAnd Hamas senior commanders, along with four battalions of terrorists, are there, too.\n\nBecause it could mark Hamas' last stand, it's a given the terror leaders declared their acceptance of the nonexistent cease-fire deal as a ruse to head off the Israeli attack.\n\nAs a public relations gambit, it worked for several hours and gave the usual haters ammunition to blast Israel as the obstacle to peace.\n\nAll the more reason why Israel is determined to finish the job.\n\nIf Biden won't help, he can stay out of the way and let Israel do what it must.\n\nThat's the least an ally should do.\n\nNaomi Laulus offers advice to college presidents, writing: \"With the Hamas puppets corralled in their encampments, colleges should prop up huge screens and announce to the jihadist wannabes that they are airing the terrorists' unfiltered filming of their Oct. 7 atrocities, including rapes, mutilations, and babies in ovens.\"\n\n\"They should explain that just like the Nazis, Hamas terrorists filmed these atrocities because they took pride in their acts.\"\n\n\"And then they should blast the volume so no one can avoid the horror.\"\n\nCount reader Robert Daddario as unimpressed by the campus rabble's grasp of facts.\n\nHe writes: \"From now on, whenever I hear the words 'college-educated voters,' I'll think, 'the indoctrinated ignorant!'\u2009\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They're already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror, that it was Hamas that brutalized Israelis, that it was Hamas who took and continues to hold hostages. I have not forgotten, nor have you, and we will not forget.\"\n\nThat is one tale of Biden, the tale of a US president with a deep sympathy for the State of Israel born of what he heard of the Holocaust around his father's table in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and strong friendships with Jews he established over the years such as late congressman Tom Lantos, a Holocaust survivor.\n\nYet on the same day that Biden delivered this heartfelt speech, The Wall Street Journal reported that for the first time since the Gaza war began, the US is delaying sending precision weapons to Israel. The Washington Post quoted a US official saying this should be seen as a shot across Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bow to underscore the seriousness of US concerns about a Rafah invasion.\n\nThat, too, is a tale of Biden.\n\nHow to reconcile the two? The first Biden, strongly supportive of Israel and fully aware that Hamas is responsible for the current war, with the second Biden, the one delaying weapons to Israel, a move that - if extended - could curtail efforts to defeat Hamas and harm Israel if a wider war erupts in Lebanon.\n\nBiden said that he had not forgotten Hamas's atrocities. But that is not the only thing he has not forgotten. He has also not forgotten, in his telling and the telling of his spokespersons, the civilian fatality rate in this war. And he has also not forgotten that his administration is coming under intense pressure from protestors on college campuses and the progressive wing of his party to pressure Israel to stop the war and to distance itself from the Jewish State.\n\nIn short, Biden is walking a tightrope, balancing his instinctive support for Israel and the Jews with genuine concerns about civilian casualties and the fear of how those casualties will impact his reelection chances, which right now can be categorized as \"iffy.\"\n\nOne of the basic political assumptions in the US in recent months - an assumption that has gained ground during the highly publicized anti-Israel protests on dozens of campuses around the country - is that Biden's policies on Israel will alienate Arab voters and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez-style progressives, a demographic he will need to win in crucial swing states like Michigan.\n\nBut there is a flip side to that coin. If Biden is not seen as supportive enough of Israel, or if moderate Democrats get spooked by the protests, sometimes violent, filling their television screens night after night, that could push them out of the Democratic camp in November.\n\nIt's not as if Biden only wins votes by turning on Israel, and everything else stays static. Being seen as too tough on Israel could cost him dearly among Jewish and pro-Israel supporters in a close election, and there are states out there beyond Michigan, with its large bloc of Arab voters, that he needs to win - swing states - in which the shift of a few percentages among Jewish or pro-Israel Democrats could make a huge difference.\n\nBiden behind his competitor in the polls\n\nFor instance, polls show that Biden is significantly behind Trump in the battleground states of Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Georgia, which all have substantial Jewish populations.\n\nBut there is more to the story than that. While the media's focus on the Gaza war makes it seem as though this is the main issue driving the conversation in the US and will be the central issue of importance for American voters in November, that is far from the truth.\n\nIn American elections, foreign policy issues are traditionally way down the list of the problems that the electorate prioritizes, with the top issues generally being issues such as the economy, abortion, immigration, and gun control.\n\nEven among the country's youth, the \"conflict in the Middle East\" is a low-priority issue, something that runs counter to the impression one might walk away with having watched campuses all over the country explode over the issue. Axios reported this week on a Generation Lab poll of 1,250 US college students that found that only 13% of them ranked the Middle East as their most important issue, ninth on a list of nine that was topped by healthcare reform, educational funding and access, and economic fairness and opportunity.\n\nEven among the country's youth, the \"conflict in the Middle East\" is a low-priority issue, something that runs counter to the impression one might walk away with having watched campuses all over the country explode over the issue. Axios reported this week on a Generation Lab poll of 1,250 US college students that found that only 13% of them ranked the Middle East as their most important issue, ninth on a list of nine that was topped by healthcare reform, educational funding, and access, and economic fairness and opportunity.\n\nSpeaking of the college protests, it is worth noting that the last time the campuses were in such an upheaval was some 56 years ago when students protested, marched, and conducted sit-ins against the Vietnam War in colleges across the country. Like 2024, 1968 was an election year.\n\nIn that election, Richard Nixon, running on a law and order ticket that resonated loudly for many reasons - including because of the anti-war protests - defeated the Democratic candidate Hubert Humphrey. Four years later, Nixon defeated another Democratic candidate, George McGovern. One lesson from that period was that the \"silent majority\" - middle America - was turned off and frightened by the rebelliousness and lawlessness that they saw in the campus protests and in race riots that plagued that era.\n\nWill history repeat itself, and Biden get hurt in the upcoming election because of scenes of chaos and lawlessness on some campuses?\n\nJonathan Chait wrote an article this week in New York Magazine headlined \"Biden is Losing the Election in the Center, Not the Left.\" According to Chait's argument, the more significant threat to the president's reelection chances is moderate voters defecting from Biden rather than Arab American or youthful progressives.\n\nThe protests on campus, he argued, are \"contributing to the sense of chaos and failure that is harming Biden and helping Trump.\"\n\nThe reason the Trump-Biden race is close, and Biden is trailing in the polls, is not because he is hemorrhaging far-left voters, but rather moderate ones who, among other problems, they have with Biden's domestic agenda, are frightened by the chaos and anarchy the protests represent. \"The people he needs to win back are not occupying college campuses,\" Chait wrote.\n\nThis helps to explain the tale of two Bidens: a president who has to appeal to all sides. He needs to retain Jewish and pro-Israel voters, as well as Arab voters and anti-Israeli progressives. He also has to ensure that the Democratic middle holds.\n\nIn the process, he often sends mixed signals and contradictory messages: threatening to reassess policy toward Gaza if Israel does not alter its course in the war on the one hand, helping Israel shoot down hundreds of Iranian missiles and drones on the other; holding up arms sales to Israel on one day and passionately expressing support for Israel and Jews the next.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust",

As university leaders, you are undoubtedly facing intense pressure from various perspectives. Here are five keys issues and questions you have probably asked yourselves -- but you likely got the answers wrong:\n\n1. Isn't it paramount that we support free speech and allow students to protest?\n\nFree speech is fundamental in American society, allowing diverse opinions to be heard -- even controversial ones. However, speech that threatens specific individuals or groups does not qualify as protected speech. At some campuses, rhetoric has escalated to dangerous levels, with calls for violence against Israeli cities and Jewish students. Such expressions exceed the bounds of free speech.\n\nJewish students have been targeted, physically intimidated, and even violently attacked. All of this puts much of the anti-Israel protests beyond the protection of free speech.\n\nWhile protecting free speech is part of the equation, creating an environment that condemns and protects against racism and discrimination is also crucial. Imagine if the KKK wanted to protest in the middle of Columbia University chanting that \"blacks are not welcome here\" or if anti-gay groups were calling for homosexuals to be targeted and harassed. Would any university leader stand for this? Would anyone want to attend a university that allows this?\n\n2. Aren't these protests against Israel, not Jews? We should not equate the two.\n\nThe stated reason for the protests is to condemn Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. However, much of the rhetoric has devolved into antisemitism against Jewish students. Since the war began, 73% of Jewish college students reported experiencing antisemitic incidents, from vandalism to threats of violence. Additionally, 44% of non-Jewish students also stated that they witnessed antisemitism on campus. These are astonishing numbers.\n\nThe core of the connection between anti-Israel hate and antisemitism is the centrality that Israel plays in Jewish identity. One cannot separate Israel from Judaism. The Land of Israel is central to Judaism's history, sacred texts, prayers, and religious observance. Israel cannot be separated from Judaism -- it is integral to it. Thus, for so many Jews, an attack on Israel is an attack against the Jewish People. And many Jews have been attacked simply for being Jewish; the numbers and stories are undeniable\n\n3. Since there are Jewish students also protesting, this can't be antisemitism, right?\n\nJewish participation in protests does not negate antisemitism. Although some Jewish students participate in these protests, they represent a minority within the broader American Jewish community. Recent studies, including one by Pew, indicate that a significant majority of American Jews validate Israel's reasons for engaging Hamas (89%), though opinions on the conduct of operations vary. The diversity among protesters, including Jews, doesn't nullify the antisemitic elements present, particularly when Jewish organizations like Jewish Voices for Peace, which has been critiqued for antisemitic rhetoric, are involved.\n\n4. How do I know when a protest against Israel's actions becomes antisemitism?\n\nSoviet dissident and human rights advocate Natan Sharansky has defined when criticism of Israel crosses the line to antisemitism. He calls it the \"3 D's\": delegitimization, demonization, and double standards.\n\nDelegitimization: Questioning Israel's very existence or advocating to ban \"Zionists\" from campus is delegitimizing and antisemitic.\n\nDemonization: Israel is fighting against an enemy who openly calls for its destruction, attacks civilians, and then hides amongst Palestinian civilians. Accusing Israel of indiscriminately killing innocent people, committing genocide, or other war crimes when it is not factual is demonizing and antisemitic.\n\nDouble Standards: Criticizing Israel for actions that other nations are not criticized for is a double standard and antisemitic. Israel is often criticized for actions that other nations are not. While all loss of innocent life is tragic, one has to wonder why there are protests against Israel across all of these campuses when nothing was done for so many other horrible situations. There were no protests when Syria was using chemical weapons against its own people. There were no protests when Nigerian Christians were slaughtered by Islamists. There were no protests standing up for the brave Muslim women marching in the streets against the Iranian regime. There were no protests to stand up for the Kurds or the Yazidi women and children who were used as sex slaves by ISIS. Why not?\n\n5. What do these protestors want and how can we end this?\n\nHearing from the protestors themselves, it seems like they have many conflicting agendas, including calls for a ceasefire, cessation of US support for Israel, or even the destruction of Israel. Some also express animosity towards Western values and are also expressing hatred toward America and Western culture, while some have no idea why they are protesting in the first place. This may explain the support they are receiving from Hamas and Iran, as the protesters are aligning with groups hostile to liberal democracies. Universities must formulate responses that reject hate and promote a safe academic environment without compromising free speech.\n\nSo how do we end this? Certainly not by giving in to haters and those intimidating, harassing, and threatening others. All university leaders must stand strong against this hatred and make it loud and clear that these hate tactics will not succeed", "source": {"uri": "algemeiner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities - that deal with that problem.\"\n\nWhen asked by Spectrum News North Carolina political anchor Tim Boyum about Biden's comments and if he would have a red line in Israel's war with Hamas, Trump replied: \"Well, I wouldn't do what Biden did. He just abandoned Israel. I've never seen anything like it.\"\n\nTrump then criticized why Jewish people -- who typically overwhelmingly back Democrats -- vote the way they do. A Pew Research Center survey from last month showed that 69% of Jewish voters align with the Democratic Party, while 29% back Republicans. Since 2020, Jewish voter share among Democrats increased 8%.\n\n\"Why Jewish people vote for Democrats is beyond me,\" Trump said. \"I think maybe they'll change their mind, but they've been wedded to Democrats for you know, for 50 years, probably more than that. And there's been no president has ever done anything close to what I've done for Israel.\"\n\nAs president, Trump in 2020 oversaw bilateral agreements between Israel and Arab nations known as the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between the Jewish state, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. That year, he also announced an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan alongside Netanyahu that was criticized by Palestinian leaders and the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. Biden at the time called it a \"political stunt\" that could \"set back peace even more.\" In 2017, Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and oversaw the opening of a U.S. embassy in the holy city, a move that enraged Palestinians.\n\nBut Biden has been steadfast in his support for Israel, particularly in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 -- the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust -- and sparked the war in Gaza. Biden just last month signed into law a foreign aid bill providing billions in aid for Israel in its war against Hamas, as well as humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza.\n\nTrump on Thursday charged that Biden has \"totally gone on the other side\" and \"dropped Israel.\"\n\n\"If you're Jewish and you vote for him, I say shame on you,\" Trump added.\n\nIt's not the first time Trump has used such rhetoric to condemn Jewish voters who pick Democrats. On Rosh Hashanah last year -- one of the holiest days on the Jewish calendar -- Trump shared a post on his Truth Social platform accusing those who did not support him in 2020 of voting \"to destroy America and Israel.\"\n\n\"Just a quick reminder for liberal Jews who voted to destroy America & Israel because you believed false narratives!\" the image read. \"Let's hope you learned from your mistake & make better choices moving forward! Happy New Year!\"\n\nIn March of this year, Trump said in an interview that Jewish people who vote for Democrats \"hate Israel\" and hate \"their religion,\" and last month said that \"any Jewish person who votes for a Democrat or votes for Biden should have their head examined.\" His remarks were condemned by the White House, Biden's reelection campaign and other advocates.\n\nBiden, who has deep ties to the Jewish community dating back to his time representing Delaware in the Senate, visited Israel's Holocaust museum, Yad Vashem, in 2022, where he met with survivors and took part in a wreath laying ceremony. He has also condemned some of the protests at college campuses across the country and just this week offered a forceful condemnation of a rise in antisemitism at a Holocaust remembrance ceremony.\n\nTrump has accused Biden of being weak on antisemitism, though just last week said that the Democratic president is running a \"Gestapo administration,\" his latest reference to Nazi Germany.\n\nWhen it comes to Israel's potential invasion of Rafah, a city in southern Gaza where more than 1 million civilians are sheltering, Trump said that they \"have to get the job done,\" citing the atrocities of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack.\n\n\"They've done things that nobody thought - nobody's ever seen anything like it,\" Trump added.\n\nIsrael has said that Rafah is Hamas' last stronghold in Gaza, but several countries, including the U.S., have expressed alarm about the prospect of a full-scale ground invasion.\n\nTrump was asked how he reckons his condemnation of the college protests against the Israel-Hamas war with his support for individuals who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to try and disrupt the certification of his loss to Biden in the 2020 election.\n\nThe ex-president -- who has frequently said he would pardon some, if not all, of those rioters, has called them \"unbelievable patriots\" and has even taken to playing a recording of jailed Jan. 6 defendants singing the National Anthem at his rallies -- contended that \"we don't have a problem from the right we have a problem from the left,\" blasting what he called the \"far left\" as \"fascist,\" \"communist\" and \"a danger to our country.\"\n\n\"We don't have that problem with the right,\" Trump said, before baselessly contending that rioters who stormed the building \"were largely invited in.\"\n\nTrump went on to bash the House Select Committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack, repeating a false claim that the bipartisan panel deleted or destroyed evidence, and said that the so-called \"radical left\" is \"more dangerous to our country than China and Russia and others.\"\n\nMore than 1,300 people have been charged in connection with the attack, with 950 convictions so far. While some low-level offenders were granted probations, hundreds have been jailed, some for sentences as long as 22 years behind bars.\n\nTrump, who spoke to Spectrum News from New York ahead of his hush money trial, continued to rail against the prosecution against him, calling it an \"absolute sham.\"\n\n\"It's an absolute sham,\" Trump said, before calling Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg \"corrupt\" and attacking him for being backed by Democratic megadonor George Soros, a frequent right-wing target. (In truth, Soros donated to a group that seeks to elect progressive prosecutors, which backed Bragg's 2021 campaign. A spokesperson for Soros told The New York Times that they've never met and he has never directly donated to Bragg.)\n\n\"It's a Democrat witch hunt,\" Trump said after listing a group of legal scholars sympathetic to his plight. \"This is a disgrace that this case should even be brought forward. There was no crime. There's no there should be no charge. There's no crime whatsoever.\"\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts in the case, which accuses him of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels to cover up an alleged sexual affair. Trump has pleaded not guilty and denied the affair, as well as any wrongdoing.\n\nThe ex-president blamed the case for not allowing him the freedom to campaign in key swing states -- as a criminal defendant, Trump must be present for trial days under New York law -- though despite his complaints, he has not taken advantage of off days in the trial to campaign. Aside from a planned rally in North Carolina that was canceled due to inclement weather (he told Spectrum News on Thursday that he'll be \"going back\" to the Tar Heel State), Trump spent just one day on the campaign trail, hitting battleground states Wisconsin and Michigan in a one-day swing earlier this month. He has two other rallies scheduled for the coming weeks -- one in Ohio and one in New Jersey.\n\n\"I think that it's a shame that it's being done, that these people are corrupt,\" Trump said of the trial. \"We have a very conflicted judge, a corrupted, conflicted judge on the case. So we have some bad things going ,the good thing is that didn't do anything wrong, that's the positive.", "source": {"uri": "mynews13.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News 13"}, "authors": [],

Here's why they're not hearing him", "body": "And because it wasn't quite right, lots of liberals and Democrats (and even some leftists) are not really hearing what the president is saying. That's too bad, because what he's saying is what they want him to say.\n\nJoe Biden gave brief remarks at a ceremony commemorating victims of the Holocaust. The AP's lede is representative of coverage elsewhere:\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday decried a 'ferocious surge' in antisemitism on college campuses and around the globe in the months since Hamas attacked Israel and triggered a war in Gaza, using a ceremony to remember victims of the Holocaust to also denounce new waves of violence and hateful rhetoric toward Jews.\n\nIt's right in that's what the president said. It's also right in that's the immediate context for understanding his remarks. In recent weeks, there have been scores of demonstrations on college campuses protesting Israel's killing of about 35,000 Palestinians. Some of the protesters have expressed what looks like - or, in fact, is - antisemitism. Protests have emerged amid a rise in antisemitism worldwide, though they play a tiny part in the global phenomenon.\n\nBut it's wrong, too, in that the context is larger than that. It's wrong in that Biden himself outlined that larger context. He was very clear that hatreds, all hatreds, are bad for everyone, and that if they are allowed to fester, as they have been allowed, bad things can happen, for instance, the catastrophe (or shoah) whose victims he commemorated.\n\n\"We have an obligation, an obligation to learn the lessons of history so we don't surrender our future to the horrors of the past,\" Biden said. \"We must give hate no safe harbor against anyone. Anyone. From the very founding, our very founding, Jewish Americans represented only about 2 percent of the US population and helped lead the cause of freedom for everyone in our nation. From that experience, we know scapegoating and demonizing any minority is a threat to every minority and the very foundation of our democracy(all italics mine).\n\nLater, he said: \"I'm calling on all Americans to stand united against antisemitism and hate in all its forms. My dear friend, he became a friend, the late Elie Wiesel said, quote: 'One person of integrity can make a difference.'\"\n\nIn another passage, he addressed American Jews speficially: \"I see your fear, your hurt, your pain. Let me reassure you, as your president, you're not alone. You belong. You always have and you always will.\"\n\nIn this, he was echoing past remarks to other minorities.\n\nJust days after the Hamas massacre, on October 7, 2023, Biden said the exact same thing to Arab-Americans and Muslims in the US. \"We must, without equivocation, denounce antisemitism. We must also, without equivocation, denounce Islamophobia. To all of you hurting -- those of you who are hurting, I want you to know: I see you. You belong.And I want to say this to you: You're all America. You're all America.\"\n\nLast month, on Transgender Day of Visibility, which happened to fall on Easter Sunday, the president said: \"Today, we show millions of transgender and nonbinary Americans that we see them, they belong, and they should be treated with dignity and respect. Their courage has given countless others strength, but no one should have to be brave just to be themselves. Every American deserves that freedom.\"\n\nTo trans people, he said: You belong. You are America.\n\nThis is the full story behind Tuesday's news. Whenever Biden talks about one kind of hatred toward one kind of group, he's never only talking about that one hatred or that one group. He's talking about all the groups and all the hatreds toward them, because, while the details are consequential in ways peculiar to each group, the evil is the same.\n\nThis is what liberal and Democrats (and even some leftists) want from Joe Biden. They want him to recognize the perils facing each minority group, even if, or especially if, the perils come from another minority group. And they want him to offer assurances that he, as the president, is going to defend them using the force of law. They want the leader of a democratic community of equals to treat everyone equally. They want him to honor and practice the idea of the universal human family.\n\nIn an American* context, they are getting what they want.\n\nBut I'm afraid they are not hearing it. And I'm afraid they are not hearing it, because they are not listening to what Biden is saying. Instead, they are listening to what someone else said Biden said.\n\nIf someone is against college campus protestors, because they believe college campus protests are the same thing as antisemitism, then they will find what they are looking for in Biden's speech. That person can point, for instance, to the Associated Press report and say, look - the president denounced college campus protests. See? I was right.\n\nBiden did not denounce campus protests. He denounced hate speech against Jews credibly reported on college campuses. (He very clearly defended the right to \"peaceful protest.\") Moreover, he denounce all hate speech against all minority groups. He even elevated it as one of the biggest threats not only to democracy but to civilization itself.\n\nBut if you're only hearing what this person said Biden said, then you might not know any of that. You might even conclude that Biden is somehow sanctioning one kind of hate by way of whitewashing another. Liberal and Democrats (and even some leftists) want don't want that. Happily, Biden isn't doing what they don't want him to do.\n\n*I'm talking about politics in America. While Israel is an ally, Biden can't force its leader to quit looking like a war criminal. He can stop sending arms, though. We shall see.

Hatred towards Jews didn't end with the Holocaust, he said - it was \"brought to life on October 7 2023\" when Hamas unleashed its attack on Israel killing 1,200 people.\n\n\"Now here we are not 75 years later, but just seven-and-a-half months later, people are already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror ... I have not forgotten, and we will not forget.\"\n\nBiden's forceful evocation of the shadows of the Holocaust and the scourge of antisemitism was made at a volatile moment when Israel's retaliatory military operation in Gaza has killed more than 34,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, and brought 2.3 million people to the edge of starvation. Demonstrations against the war and calls for a ceasefire has led to turmoil at scores of US universities and colleges - and opened fissures within Biden's Democratic party that could imperil his re-election hopes in November.\n\nRelated: Police let violent mobs attack UCLA students. This is what lawlessness looks like | Judith Levine\n\nThe president, who has generally avoided commenting on the campus protests since they erupted at Columbia University in New York three weeks earlier, acknowledged that his remembrance speech fell \"on difficult times\". He also said that he understood that \"people have strong beliefs and deep convictions\", adding that the US respected free speech.\n\nBut he went on to decry antisemitic posters and \"slogans calling for the annihilation of Israel\" on college campuses. \"Jewish students [have been] blocked, harassed, attacked while walking to class,\" Biden said.\n\nHe concluded that there is \"no place on any campus in America or any place in America for antisemitism or hate speech or threats of violence of any kind.\n\n\"Violent attacks destroying property is not peaceful protest - it's against the law,\" he said.\n\nStudent protesters strongly pushed back at the implication that hatred motivated the pro-Palestinian encampments. A group of more than 750 Jewish students from 140 campuses issued a joint letter on Tuesday calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and rejecting Biden's equation of the protests with antisemitism.\n\n\"As Jewish students, we wholeheartedly reject the claim that these encampments are antisemitic and that they are an inherent threat to Jewish student safety,\" the letter said.\n\nHours before the president delivered his speech, police in riot gear cleared a protest encampment at the University of Chicago. The action began at about 4.30am in the Quad where hundreds of students had been living in tents for more than a week.\n\nThe encampment was completely dismantled within about three hours, but about 400 protesters later reassembled outside the university's administrative building. They chanted \"Free, free, Palestine\", and they staged a standoff with police.\n\nIn a statement, the university's president, Paul Alivisatos, said that protesters had been given a chance to voluntarily dismantle the encampment, and he stressed there had been no arrests. But he said negotiations with encampment representatives had broken down because of the \"intractable and inflexible aspects of their demands\".\n\nAt the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, protesters regained access to the encampment there after police had removed them and erected fencing around the area on Monday. Dozens of protesters remained at the site, the Associated Press reported, as they continued to press demands that MIT breaks its research ties to the Israeli military.\n\nTensions are rising on campuses as institutions approach their traditional graduation ceremonies, with many school governments attempting to clear the encampments to make way for the celebrations. On Monday, Columbia University announced that it was cancelling its campus-wide commencement ceremony, following the example of the University of Southern California.\n\nAt Harvard university, the interim president Alan Garber threatened those participating in the pro-Palestinian encampment with \"involuntary leave\". He said such a move could jeopardize the students' access to housing, campus buildings and exams.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [],

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Tuesday forcefully condemned antisemitic demonstrations and downplaying of the 7 October terror attacks as echoes of Nazism as he assured Jewish Americans of their place in the country amid the continuing protests over Israel's seven-month-old war against Hamas, telling them: \"You're not alone, you belong. You always have and you always will\".\n\nIn fiery remarks delivered at the United States Capitol to an audience which included multiple Holocaust survivors, Mr Biden recalled how his father had taught him and his siblings about \"the horrors of the Shoa\" around the dinner table as they grew up in Delaware, and said he has looked to impart the same lessons on his children and grandchildren, including by taking them to the site of the Dachau concentration camp \"so they could see and bear witness to the perils of indifference, the complicity of silence in the face of evil\".\n\nRecalling how president explicitly compared the motivations of the Nazis who perpetrated the mass murder of Europe's Jews with the Hamas militants who committed the October 2023 attacks which constituted the worst slaughter of Jews since 1945.\n\nHe warned that the \"ancient hatred of Jews\" did not end with the fall of Nazi Germany, but \"continues to lie deep in the hearts of too many people in the world\".\n\n\"That hatred was brought to life on October 7, 2023,\" he said \"Now here we are, not 75 years later, but just seven and a half months later. And people are already forgetting or already forgetting that Hamas unleashed this terror\".\n\n\"It was Hamas that brutalised Israelis, it was Hamas that took and continues to hold hostages,\" he continued. \"I have not forgotten nor have you, and we will not forget!\"\n\nThe president also warned of a \"ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world\" since that day, including on some college campuses where Jewish students, he said, have been kept from attending class by protesters. And he denounced the antisemitic slogans and chants used by some of the protesters, including those \"calling for the annihilation of Israel, the world's own Jewish state\" or \"denying, downplaying, rationalising, ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7\".\n\n\"It's absolutely despicable and it must stop,\" he said.\n\nMr Biden's remarks came just hours after the White House announced a series of new actions to combat the rising antisemitism he spoke of at the Capitol.\n\nRepublicans have accused the president of failing to denounce campus protests across the country that have, in some cases, involved police action and violence. His critics say that elements of the Democratic voter base are themselves antisemitic and that Mr Biden fears their reaction.\n\nBut Mr Biden came out forcefully against the violent and antisemitic elements of the pro-Palestinian protests in remarks from the White House last week. At the time, he said peaceful protest was \"in the best tradition of how Americans respond to consequential issues\" while stressing that the US is not a \"lawless country\".\n\n\"We're a civil society, and order must prevail,\" he said. \"Destroying property is not a peaceful protest - it's against the law. Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancellation of classes and graduations -- none of this is a peaceful protest; threatening people, intimidating people, instilling fear in people is not peaceful protest. It's against the law.\"\n\nThe president reiterated his call for protests to remain within the law at the Capitol on Tuesday, yet as the protests have persisted, so have accusations that the pro-Palestinian demonstrations are per se antisemitic. Concerns have also been raised over whether Jewish students are being denied the right to an education by the actions of some protesters -- and the inaction of campus authorities.\n\nTo that end, the Department of Education has sent a \"Dear Colleague\" letter to higher education institutions to lay out guidance on what constitutes antisemitic discrimination that could lead to consequences. The letter uses as its guidance the portions of the Civil Rights Act which prohibit discrimination \"based on actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics\" in the form of a \"hostile environment\" or \"different treatment\".\n\nIn addition, eight Biden administration cabinet departments have issued written guidance which makes clear that the Civil Rights Act \"prohibits certain forms of antisemitic, Islamophobic, and related forms of discrimination in federally funded programs and activities\".\n\nAccording to the White House, these policy rollouts are meant to build on the National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism which the Biden administration rolled out one year ago this month.\n\nA fact sheet distributed to reporters ahead of the president's remarks stated that the Biden administration's strategy \"includes over 100 actions the Biden-Harris Administration has taken, and continues to take, to address the rise of antisemitism in the United States, as well as over 100 calls to action for Congress, state and local governments, companies, technology platforms, students, educators, civil society, faith leaders, and others\".", "source": {"uri":

University students continue their protests in support of the Palestinian people causing some schools to cancel graduation.\n\nAll this... with Presidential elections just 6 months away.\n\nWelcome to The Inside Story, I'm VOA White House correspondent, Anita Powell.\n\nThe search for an elusive ceasefire continues in Gaza.\n\nThere are signs of progress in ceasefire talks between Hamas and Israel.\n\nBut even as both sides look for solutions, Israel continues its military march into Gaza... and the White House walks a political tight rope urging Israeli restraint while voicing unequivocal support for the Jewish State.\n\nPalestinians mourn over loved ones killed in Israeli airstrikes on Rafah Tuesday while thousands continue to flee following a limited Israeli ground operation overnight in the eastern part of Gaza's most southern city.\n\nThis operation will continue until we eliminate Hamas in the Rafah area and in the entire (Gaza) Strip's area, or until the return of the first hostage.\n\nIsrael's operation in Rafah is intended to pressure Hamas. The militant group agreed to a cease-fire proposal on Monday. But Israel said the plan did not meet its demands to eliminate Hamas from post-war Gaza.\n\nBecause Israel's war objective was to make sure that Hamas doesn't control anything, any longer, anymore, the meaning is that Israel is going to basically to lose the war in that sense.\n\nAs Palestinians seek safety, negotiations between Israel and Hamas continue in Cairo. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby on Tuesday expressed optimism.\n\nJohn Kirby, White House National Security Spokesperson:\n\nA close assessment of the two sides' positions suggests that they should be able to close the remaining gaps, and we're going to do everything we can to support that process and achieve that outcome.\n\nNot many analysts share that optimism. Beyond swapping hostages for peace, both Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar are looking toward their own political survival, said former U.S. negotiator for the Middle East Aaron David Miller.\n\nAaron David Miller, Carnegie Endowment for Peace:\n\nIn a conflict, where two combatants believe that the stakes are existential, that vital national interest or in the case of [Yahya] Sinwar, his personal survival is at stake, the influence of external parties is limited.\n\nThe stakes are also high for President Joe Biden, whose electoral success in November is in part tied to reaching a cease-fire.\n\nMy commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad. Even when we disagree.\"\n\nHamas has warned Israel there will be no cease-fire if military action continues in Rafah.\n\nWhile ceasefire talks continue so does the Israeli offensive in Gaza and the mounting human toll. According to the Gaza Health Ministry the offensive has resulted in more than 33,000 Palestinian deaths.\n\nWhat many people see as Israel's indiscriminate use of force in Gaza has been the catalyst for ongoing pro Palestine student protests across the nation.\n\nBut US officials say there is also a worrying rise anti-Semitic incidents across the country.\n\nThis ancient hatred of Jews didn't begin with the Holocaust -- didn't end with the Holocaust either.\n\nAt the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's annual remembrance ceremony at the U.S. Capitol, President Joe Biden had a message for American Jews and the state of Israel.\n\nLet me reassure you, as your president, you're not alone. You belong. You always have and you always will. My commitment to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist as an independent Jewish state is ironclad, even when we disagree.\n\nThe Antisemitism Worldwide Report for 2023 published Sunday by the Anti-Defamation League and Tel Aviv University revealed a 103% increase over the previous year in acts of violence, vandalism and harassment targeting American Jews.\n\nJonathan Greenblatt, Anti-Defamation League CEO:\n\nUnprecedented levels of antisemitism engulfed Jewish communities in capitals all over the planet. It was the worst year for anti-Jewish hate in America that we've ever seen since we started doing this work 45 years ago.\n\nAccording to the report, nearly three-quarters of American university students have witnessed an antisemitic incident in some form since the beginning of the academic year. Many pro-Palestinian protesters, however, insist they are not antisemites.\n\nZho Ragen is a pro-Palestinian protester at the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\nWe have a lot of Jewish students amongst us, amongst the organizers here. This isn't about antisemitism. This is about being staunchly anti-Zionist because there are people who are being displaced from their land and exterminated with U.S. taxpayer dollars.\n\nNoa Tishby, co-author of the new book \"Uncomfortable Conversations with a Jew,\" says the term \"Zionism,\" which simply indicates Jews' right to their own home in the land of Israel, has been hijacked and demonized.\n\nNoa Tishby, \"Uncomfortable Conversations with a Jew\":\n\nThere's nothing wrong with criticizing Israeli government policies. That is not what is happening on campuses in America right now. They literally say, 'Resistance by all means necessary.' They are praising October 7th. These people are calling to take down the single Jewish state in the world.\n\nTishby says while Biden's staunch support does make the community feel safer, it doesn't take away her conviction that another Holocaust could happen again if hateful trends are left unchecked.\n\nNoa Tishby, \"Uncomfortable Conversations with a Jew\":\n\nOctober 7th felt to the Jewish community like a repeat of the Holocaust, when we heard the same stories of mothers hugging their children while they're being burnt alive, and children and teens and kids hiding in cabinets and decapitation and mutilation and rapes. I call it the atrocities of October 7th and the atrocities of October 8th, because October 7th happened, and it took a little less than two hours for the anti-Zionist, anti-Israel, antisemitic organizations to start praising it.\n\nShe says that antisemitism is also often an indicator of the presence of deeper problems in a society, and that seeking a scapegoat rarely stops with one group only.\n\nThe world is watching closely the protests on college campuses across the United States against Israel's conduct of the war in Gaza. Reactions to both the protests and the arrests of some students vary widely, from pride and solidarity to alarm and condemnation. VOA's Senior Diplomatic Correspondent Cindy Saine reports from the State Department.\n\nColombia University in New York City has been the epicenter of pro-Palestinian protests that have spread across America.\n\nStudents are calling on their universities to disclose and then divest all their funds related to Israel and to end all academic partnerships with Israel. They are also calling on the United States to stop sending military aid to Israel.\n\nThe protests are now spreading elsewhere in the world, including demonstrations Tuesday at Berlin's Free University in Germany.\n\nStudents in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, as well as in Gaza, have praised the American protests.\n\nIran has criticized the police crackdown on some campuses, with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei tweeting out his support for U.S. students.\n\nSome of the key adversaries of the United States around the world, the likes of Russia, China, Iran, are trying to use this protest movement to really raise more fundamental question about the health of the American democracy and such issues as, as whether America is what it claims to be.\n\nOne university in Iran even offered to take in expelled American students or any fired professors, though the Middle East Institute's Alex Vatanka told VOA he does not expect there to be a rush of U.S. colleges students buying plane tickets to Tehran.\n\nAnother expert at the University of Chicago says he does not believe the protests will have the staying power of the massive U.S. student demonstrations against the Vietnam War in the late 1960s.\n\nPaul Poast, Associate Professor, University of Chicago:\n\nEven though these are organic, and even though these are people who care deeply about this issue, by and large, this is not as salient of an issue for large segments of the U.S. population, in the same way that the Vietnam War with the draft, for example.\n\nChinese leaders have been largely silent on the protests. On a recent visit to China, where anti-government protests are strictly banned, Secretary of State Antony Blinken praised the campus protests.\n\nAnd in our own country, it's a hallmark of our democracy that our citizens make known their views, their concerns, their anger at any given time.\n\nBut Blinken again criticized the silence of protesters about the militant group Hamas, saying they should stop hiding behind civilians, release the hostages they are holding and lay down their arms to save Palestinian civilians.\n\nMajor news organizations have brought coverage of the protests on U.S. campuses to audiences around the world, but as Robin Guess reports, some of the best reporting of the unrest has originated close to home, led by student journalists.\n\nNew York City police arrested protesters this week [April 30] at Columbia University. But before they took action, they attempted to clear the campus of student journalists.\n\nBy the time police stormed and cleared Hamilton Hall of the occupying protesters, student journalists told VOA, there weren't many of them left to report on events.\n\nMeghnad Bose, Columbia University Student Journalist:\n\nThe NYPD severely restricted the actions of the press, including several members of the student press who were on campus. Some who were outside Hamilton Hall and were removed from campus entirely. Now this is very troubling because they weren't there to document and bear witness to a police action.\n\nBose and Columbia's other student journalists say press freedoms were violated.\n\nFranziska Wild, Georgetown University Student Editor:\n\nEspecially listening to the Columbia radio broadcasts. I think that that is a pretty helpful lesson for all student journalists to know that official narratives exist, but our reporting is allowed to challenge them.\n\nOn the West Coast, riot police cracked down on a pro-Palestinian encampment Thursday at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nStudent journalists were on the front line when police moved in to tear down the encampment and arrest protesters. Their newspaper said at least four of their reporters were attacked by unknown assailants.\n\nI do think what they are doing speaks to the clear and profound importance of student journalists at academic institutions to provide regular updates to faculty and students as to what's happening on their campuses, especially under the current circumstances.\n\nStudent journalists say safety is a chief concern. Some are reporting in pairs. Others wear large press credentials.\n\nThe Pulitzer Prize Board, which presents awards for outstanding achievements in U.S. journalism, recognized the nation's student journalists for tirelessly covering the protests in the face of personal risk.\n\nLegal watchdogs are keeping an eye on events as well, noting that student journalists have been pepper sprayed, hit with rubber bullets and disciplined by universities for their reporting.\n\nWhen student journalists are lumped in together with the protesters they are trying to cover, it is a disservice to everyone.\n\nAt George Washington University, student journalists covered the lead-up to the campus conflicts for months. This encampment is a joint effort of eight schools in the Washington area.\n\nMany journalists have been here since the first tent was pitched in mid-April.\n\nEddy Binford-Ross, Georgetown University Student Journalist:\n\nThey told us, 'Hey, there's something going on. You guys should get ready. So with the rest of the news team, we sat down and put together a coverage plan.\n\nSome student journalists told VOA they simply continue doing what they did before their campuses became international stories and their work garnered recognition: report the campus news.\n\nThis week, Israel ordered the Qatar-based Al Jazeera news channel to cease all operations... Israeli police raided their offices and confiscated their equipment.\n\nAl Jazeera officials blasted the move by Israel calling it a \"criminal act\" and the Foreign Press Association called it a \"dark day for democracy.\n\nThe action came after the Netanyahu government passed a law passed in early April allowing the government to shut down media networks it deems a national security threat.\n\nThe Netanyahu government has been critical of Al Jazeera for years, accusing the Qatari network of inciting violence against Israel in its reporting. Al Jazeera officials say they will pursue legal options to allow its journalists to continue to work in Israel and Gaza.\n\nSince April 18, over 2-thousand people have been arrested for taking part in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses across the country.\n\nTo get a feel for what they want and what's motivating them, I spoke with Denora Getachew, the CEO of Dosomething.org. Its website calls it one of the country's largest nonprofits devoted exclusively to helping young people make social change.\n\nI began by asking Denora what impact she believes these nationwide protests are having on Capitol Hill and at the White House.\n\nThese protests are really going to have an impact on the 2024 election cycle both at the top of the ticket as it relates to the presidential election, but also all the way down the ballot. What we know to be true is that young people's distrust in government and major US institutions has been building and has contributed to this new age of activism activation on college campuses. Do something members who range in age from 13 to 25 years old, have told us that they don't believe that lawmakers consider their voices a national policy looks like an overwhelming majority of them. So only 17% of young people actually believe that lawmakers are hearing their voices.\n\nThough the generation that witnessed World War 2 dwindles with each passing year, the relevance of what they saw resonates with the history made today.\n\nAs Kane Farabaugh reports from Skokie, Illinois, a Japanese diplomat's act of defiance during World War 2 saved thousands of lives. It is the theme of an ongoing effort by an American musician to pay tribute to the man known as \"Japanese Schindler.\"\n\nWorld renowned cellist and musician Kristina Reiko Cooper weaves a multi-cultural narrative in many of her performances around the globe.\n\nAnd her husband is Jewish. Through him, Cooper learned of the story of Chiune Sugihara, a Japanese diplomat stationed in Kaunus, Lithuania during World War 2 who issued visas to Jews fleeing the advancing Nazi army, defying the Japanese government he served.\n\nI know what it means to go against authority in the Japanese culture, that just doesn't happen.\n\nOver a two-month period in 1940, Sugihara issued more than 2000 visas to Jewish families enabling them to travel through the Soviet Union to Japan with transit to another country. Chaya Small was among them, a 6-year-old who escaped Hitler's genocide in Europe in 1940.\n\nHe saved my life. He saved my home. He saved everything.\n\nSmall and her immediate family spent the war in a ghetto in Shanghai, China. They were the only members of their once large extended family to survive the Holocaust. Small's says her parents spent much of their life afterwards seeking ways to express their thanks to Sugihara.\n\nIn post-war Japan, Sugihara lived in relative obscurity until his death in 1986. Cooper learned while his act of mercy might have barely registered in history books and was overlooked by his own country during his life, it was never forgotten by those he saved.\n\nKristina Reiko Cooper, Musician:\n\nIt wasn't until the end of his life that he knew he even saved one person much less thousands.\n\nI am grateful to god every day for all the miracles he has done for us, because Sugihara was not normal... it was a miracle.\n\nSugihara earned the honor of \"Righteous Among the Nations,\" one of Israel's highest honors.Leah Rauch, Director of Education, Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center:\n\nSomething Leah Rauch says the Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center tries to correct through its exhibits honoring Sugihara, and through public engagements like a performance by Kristina Cooper.\n\nToday I'm playing a program with a solo cello and a shakuhachi, which is a traditional Japanese instrument.\n\nCooper's performance is an extension of a larger project honoring Sugihara, incorporating choir and symphony in a grand concert that premiered at Carnegie Hall in New York City in 2023. Whether a massive concert, or a scaled down duet, Cooper seeks to keep Sugihara's legacy alive through music.\n\nIt's the universal language. You don't need words. You don't need visuals you don't need an understanding of another language - you listen, and you absorb, and it goes straight to the soul. So, we are hoping that we can bring the story of Sugihara and what he stood for through our music.\n\nFor Cooper, who now lives in Israel and is a convert to Judaism, Sugihara's gesture isn't just a history lesson.\n\nThis quiet modest Japanese man was responsible for the existence of my husband and my three children and life as I know it.\n\nCooper's father-in-law also received a \"Sugihara visa.\" Her three children are among tens of thousands of descendants alive today because of Sugihara's actions, which is why, to Cooper, the music is more than a tribute - something survivors like Chaya Small understand while watching her perform.\n\nIt's a different way of saying thank you. It was her way of expressing her gratitude.\n\nThank you for my beautiful children, thank you for my amazing husband. Thank you for my amazing life. Thank you for everything you did.\n\nChiune Sugihara is now a household name in Japan. While some historians have raised doubts about the significance of him issuing the visas ....\n\n... survivor Chaya Small says she owes her life to the man she wishes she could have met in person.\n\nI would be so in awe... I would be so in awe for saving us, for giving us back a country, a world, a people.\n\nSix months remain in the U.S. presidential race between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. In the latest installment of our series USA Votes 20-24, correspondent Scott Stearns looks at what is ahead for the campaigns in the run up to Election Day.\n\nJoe Biden and Donald Trump have six months left to convince American voters to give them a second term.\n\nTrump will spend some of that time in state or federal court answering four separate indictments including charges of unlawful retention of national defense information and falsifying business records.\n\nHe says prosecutors are interfering in the election.\n\nDonald Trump, Republican Presidential Candidate:\n\nEverything was legal. And they're doing this because it's politics. They want to get Biden elected. That's the only reason.\n\nThe court appearances are reducing Trump's time campaigning, but he says what he calls a \"political hoax\" is only making him more popular with voters.\n\nDonald Trump, Republican Presidential Candidate:\n\nIt's a, it's a terrible, terrible thing happening in our country. And hopefully November 5th, the most important day in the history of our country. In my opinion, that's called Election Day. Hopefully it's going to change because these people are destroying our country.\n\nThe Republican Party last nominated Trump for president at its semi-virtual 2020 convention in North Carolina.\n\nThis year's Republican convention is in the state of Wisconsin in July. Before then, Trump will need to choose a new running mate. Among those he is believed to be considering for vice president are Florida Senator Marco Rubio, Ohio Senator J.D. Vance, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, and New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.\n\nAs the incumbent president, Biden has the advantage of White House events to keep voters' attention.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Biden is becoming more pointed in his attacks on Trump while claiming credit for a stronger economy.\n\nConstruction of new factories has more than doubled in our administration. Meanwhile, meanwhile, Donald Trump still thinks windmills cause cancer. That's what he said. By the way, remember when he was trying to deal with Covid? He said just inject a little bleach into your veins. He missed - it all went to his hair.\n\nThe Democratic Party last nominated Biden for president at its semi-virtual 2020 convention in Wisconsin. This year's Democratic convention is in the state of Illinois in August.\n\nBiden is running again with Vice President Kamala Harris, who has been active in campaigning for restoring federal abortion protections overturned in the case Roe v. Wade.\n\nDonald Trump was the president who took away the protections of Roe. Joe Biden will be the president who puts the protections of Roe back in place.\"\n\nBefore November's Election Day, Biden and Trump are expected to debate. Both men say they are ready. No date has been set.\n\nThat's all for this week. Thanks for watching I'm Anita Powell at the White House.\n\nStay up to date with all the latest news at VOANews.com.\n\nCatch up on past episodes at our free streaming service, VOA Plus.", "source":

The White House has posted the text of his remarks here.\n\nThe speech seems to me late and wanting. Revisiting the history of the Holocaust, Biden referred to \"the perils of indifference, the complicity of silence in the face of evil that they knew was happening.\" He did not identify who \"they\" were. To adapt the old joke about the Lone Ranger and Tonto, what you mean \"they\" Kemo Sabe?\n\nBiden comes to the return of Hitler's project with the Hamas's 10/7 attack and the supporters of Hamas on American college campuses:\n\nWe've seen a ferocious surge of antisemitism in America and around the world: vicious propaganda on social media, Jews forced to keep their -- hide their kippahs under baseball hats, tuck their Jewish stars into their shirts.\n\nOn college campuses, Jewish students blocked, harassed, attacked while walking to class.\n\nAntisemitism -- antisemitic posters, slogans calling for the annihilation of Israel, the world's only Jewish State.\n\nToo many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing, ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7th, including Hamas's appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize Jews.\n\nIt's absolutely despicable, and it must stop.\n\nIf you have been paying attention you might find Biden himself \"downplaying\" the eruption of support for Hamas and its works in his party and in Democratic strongholds around the United States. Again, Biden does not identify the people \"denying, downplaying, [and] ignoring the horrors.\" Despite the worthy sentiments expressed, this seems to me a telling omission. One may deduce that Biden is jumping through a hoop.\n\nIndeed, Biden is working at present to preserve the Islamic heirs of the Nazi project in Rafah. He is working to undermine the efforts of the Jewish state to preserve itself from its mortal enemies. In a midnight story Steven Erlanger reports in the New York Times that Biden administration is \"pushing [Israel] to agree on a cease-fire, and skip Rafah and the potential civilian casualties a large-scale operation would cause.\" Biden seeks to pressure Israel to conform by withholding shipment of precision-guided missiles to the IDF.\n\nJonathan Tobin considers the contradictions between Biden's words and action in his JNS column \"Biden's double game on Hamas should fool no one.\" Tobin observes:\n\n[O]nce the IDF had backed Hamas into the last enclave it held in Gaza, Biden stopped talking out of both sides of his mouth and made it clear that he opposed Israel going into Rafah and destroying the last operational Hamas military forces that had retreated there.\n\nHe's gone to great lengths and expense to support humanitarian aid for civilians in Hamas-held portions of the Strip and blamed Israel for interrupting the flow of supplies there, including the building of a U.S. floating harbor to assist in the distribution of food and fuel. That has happened even though it's long been obvious that if there is any real privation there, it is solely because Hamas is stealing the aid that arrives and reserving it for its own use.\n\nJust as troubling, he's put the full force of American influence behind an effort to broker a ceasefire deal with Hamas that will essentially hand the terror group a victory in the war it started.\n\nThe terms of the proposed deals that Washington has backed are appalling. They call for the release of some hostages, but only a percentage of those Hamas is still holding under who knows what horrible conditions. And the pressure that Washington has exerted on Netanyahu to take a deal on virtually any terms and conditions -- along with the way it has coordinated this with Hamas's ally, Qatar -- has given the terrorists all the leverage. That's why Hamas continues to turn down even the most lopsided of agreements; its leaders are convinced that Biden will not let them be defeated. That means they think they can hold out for a deal that will end the war and return the situation to the pre-Oct. 7 status quo in Gaza and still not give up all the hostages, let alone be held accountable for mass murder.\n\nTobin reasonably concludes that Biden's actions speak louder than his words. I would add that his words seek to provide cover for his actions. In short, Biden's condemnation of those who downplayed evil in the face of what \"they\" knew was happening indicts himself.", "source": {"uri": "powerlineblog.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

That pluralism and tolerance are part of America's DNA and I hope in so doing that he explicitly refutes the left of his party for their role in fomenting this antisemitism,\" Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., told CNN's Kasie Hunt on Tuesday morning.\n\nHe added, \"That will be a marker of leadership that he is willing to not just say, as he did after Charlottesville, that that type of hate is unacceptable, but it's also unacceptable when it happens within his own party, as regrettably it is right now, in the United States.\"\n\nDuring a speech on Capitol Hill Tuesday, at a Holocaust remembrance ceremony, Biden denounced antisemitism and called out anyone attempting to minimize the Oct. 7 attacks carried out by Hamas.\n\nBIDEN, AT HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE CEREMONY, SAYS HATRED AGAINST JEWS BROUGHT TO LIFE BY HAMAS ATTACK\n\n\"On college campuses, Jewish students blocked, harassed and attacked while walking to class. Antisemitism, antisemitic posters, slogans, calling for the annihilation of Israel, the world's only Jewish state. Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing, ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and on Oct. 7, including Hamas' appalling use of sexual violence to torture and terrorize Jews,\" Biden said. \"It's absolutely despicable and it must stop.\"\n\nWhile Biden didn't directly call out the left-wing, during CNN special coverage immediately following his remarks, Hunt questioned how members of the Democratic Party would receive the president's remarks, adding that he clearly didn't \"both sides\" the issue.\n\nRep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., also recently suggested some members of his party have not been quick to condemn antisemitism coming from the left, Politico reported.\n\n\"There are lessons from Charlottesville. It was more comfortable for Democrats when they saw the antisemitism of the right -- Aryan men with Tiki torches,\" Moskowitz said. \"Now that it's on our side it's not as comfortable, is it? We're watching the tribalness and the partisanship of today play into this.\"\n\nHunt also asked Auchincloss during the Tuesday morning interview if his fellow Democratic lawmakers in the House have impacted the antisemitism debate.\n\n\"It's a question of double standards. The kinds of speech and conduct that feel acceptable when it's targeted towards Jews or Israelis, it doesn't feel acceptable against other protected classes in the United States. And it's also a question of insufficiently separating criticism of the Israeli government with criticism of the Jewish people, or of all Zionists, period. And then the third element is, we have to fully condemn Oct. 7 and put the culpability where it belongs, which is with Hamas,\" Auchincloss responded.\n\nBIDEN RIPPED FOR DECRYING 'ISLAMOPHOBIA' AMID ANTISEMITIC CAMPUS PROTESTS: 'YET ANOTHER EQUIVOCATION'\n\nAsked specifically if he believed there were members of his party who are antisemitic, he said, \"members of the party who encourage and egg on protesters, who have taken on an antisemitic bent, are making the environment on these campuses worse for Jewish students.\"\n\nAuchincloss, who has spoken to Harvard University students, said Jewish and Israeli students on campus have experienced antisemitism in different ways.\n\n\"The Jewish students have to code their Zionism to work in progressive spaces. If you're a Jewish student and you want to be active in LGBT issues, if you want to be active in democracy issues, you can't also be Zionists. They have to now suppress that element of their identity. Israeli students are just downright harassed on campus. For them, they cannot participate in most of the academic and social settings on many of these universities,\" he said.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAuchincloss also called on the Department of Education to investigate colleges and universities for \"failing to uphold their Title IV responsibilities.\" Title VI of the Civil Rights \"prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in programs or activities that receive federal financial assistance,\" according to the department.\n\nBiden previously spoke out against antisemitism and campus anti-Israel protests that turned violent in a brief speech on Thursday.\n\n\"So let me be clear ... Violent protest is not protected. Peaceful protest is. It's against the law when violence occurs. Destroying property is not a peaceful protest. It's against the law. Vandalism. Trespassing. Breaking windows. Shutting down campuses. Forcing the cancellation of classes and graduations. None of this is a peaceful protest,\" Biden said. \"Threatening people. Intimidating people. Instilling fear in people is not peaceful protest. It's against the law.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hanna_panreck@foxnews.com", "name": "Hanna Panreck", "type": "author",

Dina Titus, D-Nev., said. \"I've taught on the U.N.L.V. campus for a long time so I know that universities are a place to express opinions, to demonstrate, to peacefully show different positions but once that moves from being free speech into being violent or harmful to somebody else's rights or destruction of property, then that's a different story.\"", "source": {"uri": "bakersfieldnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KBAK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_Frankel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lois Frankel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yom HaShoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dina_Titus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dina Titus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_McClintock", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom McClintock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://bakersfieldnow.com/resources/media/e6aaac9d-508d-4160-b83e-9e17bc070372-large16x9_AP24121665384461.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545587", "eventUri": "eng-9545587", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-17", "dateEnd": "-01-01", "textStart": 238, "textEnd": 258}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 152, "textEnd": 161, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

We have also watched as these protesters have been met with repression, arrests, violence, and false claims of antisemitism,\" states the letter -- which as of Tuesday afternoon had been signed by more than 750 students.\n\n\"We demand that academic and political leaders stop misrepresenting and demonizing protests and their organizers.\"\n\nWhile the letter's signers are \"deeply disturbed by the small number of individuals who have attempted to co-opt these encampments to spread violent, hateful, and antisemitic messages,\" they \"wholeheartedly reject the claim that these encampments are antisemitic and that they are an inherent threat to Jewish student safety.\"\n\nThe letter continues:\n\nThe narrative that the Gaza solidarity encampments are inherently antisemitic is part of a decadeslong effort to blur the lines between criticism of Israel and antisemitism. It is a narrative that ignores the large populations of Jewish students participating and helping to lead the encampments as a true expression of our Jewish values. The beautiful interfaith solidarity by Jewish students observing Passover seders and Shabbat at encampments across the country show that the rich Jewish tradition of justice is on full display inside the encampments. The denial of Jewish participation in this movement is not only incorrect, but it is an insidious attempt to justify unfounded claims of antisemitism. As neo-Nazis are marching in the streets and fascist politicians are campaigning on the antisemitic Great Replacement theory, we wholeheartedly reject the lie that these student activists are targeting Jewish students in their protest.\n\nThe letter came as Biden blasted the \"ferocious\" surge in antisemitism around the world since October 7 during a Capitol Hill speech marking Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n\n\"On college campuses, Jewish students blocked, harassed, attacked, while walking to class,\" Biden said. \"Antisemitic posters, slogans calling for the annihilation of Israel, the world's only Jewish state. Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing, ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust and October 7... It is absolutely despicable, and it must stop.\"\n\nBiden faced backlash last week for falsely characterizing the campus encampments as lawless and violent while ignoring police brutality and physical attacks against protesters, including a mob assault at the University of California, Los Angeles. Critics also pointed out the president's ahistorical admonition that \"dissent must never lead to disorder\" -- a statement that ignores how the United States was founded via violent revolution.\n\nThe Jewish students' letter stresses that \"while the world's focus is on students, we cannot forget that Israel is continuing its genocidal assault on Gaza.\"\n\n\"More than 34,000 Palestinians and 1,200 Israelis have been killed since October 7,\" the document notes. \"Israel has killed more than 14,000 children and destroyed schools, hospitals, and all institutions of higher learning in Gaza. The Israeli government has done nothing to return the remaining 133 hostages to their families as they continue to hold thousands of Palestinian prisoners without charge.\"\n\n\"We as Jewish students demand divestment from Israel and an academic boycott of all Israeli educational institutions contributing to the Israeli military assault on Gaza or protection of settlers in the West Bank.\"\n\n\"The devastation is unfathomable, and it is truly heinous to see individuals attempting to demonize student peace activists in our name as Israel continues to massacre Gazans, massacres that our educational institutions are complicit in through their investments and repression,\" the signers said.\n\n\"We as Jewish students demand divestment from Israel and an academic boycott of all Israeli educational institutions contributing to the Israeli military assault on Gaza or protection of settlers in the West Bank,\" the letter states. \"We also demand amnesty for all nonviolent student protesters and an end to the brutal repression by academic institutions and law enforcement.\"\n\n\"Finally,\" the signers concluded, \"we demand that academic and political leaders stop misrepresenting and demonizing protests and their organizers, protect the voices of student activists, and take immediate action to stop Israel's genocidal acts before more Palestinians are killed.\"\n\nJonathan Mendoza, a graduate student at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. who signed the letter, said in a statement that \"while the Israeli military begins its assault on Rafah, college campuses continue to protest the ongoing genocide of Palestinians.\"\n\n\"Journalists and public officials are falsely labeling these campus protests as antisemitic and dangerous to Jewish students, silencing demands to end complicity with Israel's actions, despite consistent evidence of Jewish students participating in and organizing these protests,\" Mendoza added. \"With this open letter, we demonstrate our support, as over 700 Jewish students and counting, for protests to end our universities' and country's complicity with Israel's mass killing of Palestinians.\"", "source":

Students have called for a ceasefire in Gaza and have demanded their schools divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden welcomed peaceful protests on campuses and elsewhere, but would continue to condemn hate speech, antisemitism or violence.\n\n\"It doesn't matter where he is, where he's speaking.

Instead, it was a siren of remembrance, to commemorate Yom Hashoah -- Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n\nAs the sirens blared, everyone stopped, fell silent, and mourned.\n\nIt happens every year in Israel, a moment for people across the country to remember the six million Jews, and millions of others, killed during the Holocaust. But this year, Yom Hashoah struck a different tone, as Israelis and Jews around the world also recalled those killed during Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, and worried about the hostages still held in Gaza, whose fates remain unknown.\n\nAs day turned to night, quiet mourning morphed into angry protest. Thousands of Israelis took to the streets in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, waving Israeli flags while calling for the hostages' release, for a cease fire, for an agreement with Hamas.\n\n\"It's time to accept the deal. It's time for a cease fire,\" the mother of one hostage yelled in Hebrew, standing on top of a car. \"Bring them home.\"\n\nThe anger was palpable, the stakes high, the goals unambiguous. The protests were every bit as passionate as protests against the war in Gaza in this country, but with one significant difference: The obvious absence of the antisemitism seen and heard in protests here.\n\nHere, protests have included abhorrent justifications for the events of Oct. 7, along with calls for intifada, the end of the Jewish state and the elimination of Zionists, Zionism and Jews. Here, the rhetoric, posters and actions, often guided by outsiders' playbooks, have led to a hostile environment for many Jewish students.\n\nHere, even talk of \"Never Again\" has been exploited.\n\nWhen I was an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, I spent much of Yom Hashoah outside, often with just one other fellow Jewish student, reading the names of Holocaust victims for 24 hours. Some would take turns with us, others would ask questions, some would just sit and listen. Now, just steps from where we stood 30 years ago, protesters are maintaining an encampment that's hostile to Jewish students who've tried to pass through.\n\nI'm not sure we could do that reading now.\n\nBut now is when we need that opportunity to remember, to teach and to learn. We need to figure out how to move forward from such a dangerous moment, how to allow the space to protest -- while shutting down the space to hate.\n\nThere's a way to do both. There's plenty of room for legitimate criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli government's handling of the war in Gaza. And there's room to voice that criticism while rejecting the antisemitism that has pervaded it. President Joe Biden did that in his own way, delaying an arms shipment to Israel even as he forcefully condemned a \"ferocious surge of antisemitism\" and promised his \"commitment to the safety of the Jewish people\" during a Yom Hashoah commemoration Tuesday. And he reiterated support for Israel as a Jewish state, a call seemingly reinforced by the very antisemitism he denounced.\n\nBut in a week bookended by the silence of Yom Hashoah and the celebration of Israeli Independence Day, that same wave of antisemitism underscores how even remembering the past may not be enough to protect our fragile present -- or future.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yom HaShoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jewish state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second Intifada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hebrew language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Pennsylvania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:YTNlZDliNjAtOWY0Ni00:NWFkZDZk/landscape/1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545587", "eventUri": "eng-9545587", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 509, "textEnd": 515, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

The commitment was as good as the one that Biden had made to rescue Americans from Afghanistan and to bring all our soldiers home.\n\nBiden had leveraged aid to Israel to extract an aid package for Ukraine even while he knew that he not only never intended to provide that aid to Israel, but that he was going to block pre-existing military supplies that Congress had already approved in the past.\n\nWhat was behind the timing of Biden's announcement to CNN that he was embargoing arms to Israel?\n\n\"The White House National Security Council sought to keep the decision out of the public eye for several days until it had a better understanding of the scope of Israel's intensified military operations in Rafah and until Biden could deliver a long-planned speech on Tuesday to mark Holocaust Remembrance Day.\"\n\nBiden wanted to cash in on the applause of American Jews by delivering a passionate pro-Israel speech right before giving the Hamas supporters in Dearborn and the Marxist campus rioters what they wanted.\n\nAdministration officials rushed to explain that the arms embargo only applied to offensive weapons, not defensive ones. Biden would go on helping Israel shoot down missiles but would block weapons that might be used to finish off Hamas in Rafah, particularly bombs.\n\nThe ironclad commitment was conditioned on Israel endlessly allowing itself to be attacked at while playing defense.\n\nSome may accuse Biden of antisemitism, but to be fair to the senile old crook, this is the same deal that the US Navy got in Yemen and that American soldiers got in Afghanistan. It's not that Biden hates Jews, it's that he loves or lives in fear of Islamic terrorist supporters and their leftist allies.\n\nBiden didn't just betray Israel, he betrayed America.\n\nThe message has once again gone out to our allies that we cannot be trusted and we will not stand behind them. Biden didn't just betray the promises he made after Oct 7, he betrayed the promise he made days before.\n\nIf the president's \"ironclad commitment\" is worthless when it comes to Israel, what's it worth to Taiwan, Europe and the rest of the world?\n\nNothing.\n\nBiden has decided to save Hamas, which props up Iran and allows it to continue expand across the region. And Iran isn't just coming after Israel. Its motto was \"Death to America\". And anyone who thinks the Houthis controlling who can pass near Yemen is purely about Israel will quickly find out that it's about Iran.\n\nAmerican shipping will be blocked. Islamic terrorism will increase as Jihadis see evidence that even in the face of the worst atrocities, western resolve to stand up to Islamic terrorism will eventually crumble.\n\nThere will be a price and it will be a high one.\n\nIsrael has been isolated. Its government is weak. Nevertheless, its soldiers carry our hopes, the way that American soldiers did after 9/11 and the way that British and French soldiers did in 1939, for the triumph of good over evil, freedom over slavery, and human civilization over an ideology so dread that it will plunge the world into a darkness that may not be lifted for thousands of years.", "source": {"uri": "frontpagemag.com",

Students have called for a ceasefire in Gaza and have demanded their schools divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden welcomed peaceful protests on campuses and elsewhere, but would continue to condemn hate speech, antisemitism or violence.\n\n\"It doesn't matter where he is, where he's speaking. It doesn't matter if it's a commencement or one of his events. He welcomes peaceful protests,\" she said.\n\n\"We have been very clear. We believe all Americans should have the right to peacefully protest,\" she added. \"What we don't want to see is hate speech, violence.\"\n\nBiden is due to give a commencement speech at Morehouse College in Atlanta on May 19.\n\nBiden warned on Tuesday that the threat of antisemitism is growing in the United States, including on college campuses, joining a heated American debate about Jewish security, Zionism, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel.\n\nBiden last week address the campus unrest, saying Americans have the right to protest \"but not a right to cause chaos\" through vandalism, breaking windows or shutting down campuses.\n\nJean-Pierre reiterated the White House position that it should be up the universities to decide how to respond.\n\nShe condemned behavior captured in a video at the University of Mississippi over the weekend as \"undignified and racist\", after a student was accused of mocking a Black protester by making monkey noises during an anti-war demonstration.\n\n\"The actions in the video are beneath any American,\" Jean-Pierre told reporters.\n\nThe Democratic president, seeking re-election in November, has walked a careful line of denouncing antisemitism while supporting young Americans' right to protest and trying to limit longer-term political damage.\n\n(Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt and Andrea Shalal; writing by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Alistair Bell)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Against a backdrop of violent demonstrations of antisemitism raging across American college campuses - under the guise of \"antiwar\" protests - the timing was most appropriate. However, the one thing that stood out from Biden's address was his failure to directly call out the anti-Jewish agitators and the organizations behind the campus mayhem.\n\nAs he does in almost every public appearance these days, Biden looked frail and unsteady as he made his way to the podium, and his words were at times barely decipherable. During past speeches on various topics, the current White House occupant has not shied away from condemning specific individuals or groups when it suited him politically. Donald Trump has been his favorite target, of course - along with the former president's supporters and those whom Biden likes to call \"MAGA Republicans.\"\n\nNow, things are different. Trump and those aligned with him cannot be blamed this time - not even by stretching the truth or ignoring the facts. It is abundantly clear that the wave of rabid antisemitism spreading through the nation's universities has been entirely planned, incited, and orchestrated by socialist and progressive groups.\n\nOne can only assume, then, that Biden deliberately chose to keep his condemnation of antisemitism very generic and unfocused. He could not - or would not - criticize the very people upon whom he will be relying, if he is to win a second White House term in November.\n\nAfter rightfully pinning on the terrorist group Hamas full responsibility for the horrors perpetrated against Israeli civilians during the terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023, Biden couldn't manage to find anyone to blame for antisemitism. He railed against antisemitic propaganda on social media, anti-Jewish posters appearing on college campuses, and the harassment of Jewish students. And yet, he apparently has no idea who is responsible for it all.\n\n\"Too many people denying, downplaying, rationalizing, ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust,\" Biden observed. But who are these people? Perhaps we may never know. It is one thing to take an unequivocal stand against antisemitism, but when one refuses to condemn the people and groups fueling it - even while knowing full well who they are - the bluster and the indignation ring hollow.\n\nAnother disturbing feature of almost every speech or interview Biden gives is his tendency, sooner or later, to make it about himself. True to form, he did the same thing at the Holocaust Museum. He told the story of Tom Lantos, a Hungarian Jew, born in 1928. After the Nazis invaded Hungary, Lantos, then 16 years old, was arrested and sent to a labor camp. After escaping the camp for the second time, Lantos began to work with Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who saved tens of thousands of Jews from the Nazis. After the war, he came to study in the United States, becoming a respected economist. Ironically a progressive Democrat, Lantos eventually got elected to Congress as a representative from California. He served 13 terms and died in 2008.\n\nWhat's the connection to Biden? \"He came to New York City penniless - but determined to turn his pain into purpose - along with his wife, also a Holocaust survivor,\" Biden recounted of Lantos. \"He became a renowned economist and foreign policy thinker - eventually making his way to this very capital, on the staff of a first-term senator. That Jewish refugee was Tom Lantos, and that senator was me.\"\n\nJust like that - in an oblique and self-indulgent sort of way -- Biden managed to insert himself into the story of the Holocaust. The inference was obvious: that he, Biden, had somehow made Lantos, the poor Jewish refugee, into the man he became. The true story is somewhat different. Though Biden deceptively implied that he brought Lantos to Washington, DC, the latter was a member of the Presidential Task Force on Defense and Foreign Policy a year before he became an aide to then-Sen. Biden, a position Lantos occupied for only one year.\n\nThe very fact that Biden will not name and shame those directly responsible for the raging antisemitism currently paralyzing the country's most prominent - and, supposedly, most respected - educational institutions is another stain on his already tarnished presidency. It seems that America's political left needs an intervention, or perhaps some kind of 12-step program. It is said that the first step in dealing with a problem is recognizing that one has a problem and taking ownership of it. The folks on the left do not appear willing to do that. Judging by his speech on the Holocaust and antisemitism, neither is Joe Biden.", "source": {"uri": "libertynation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liberty Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Students have called for a ceasefire in Gaza and have demanded their schools divest from companies with ties to Israel.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden welcomed peaceful protests on campuses and elsewhere, but would continue to condemn hate speech, antisemitism or violence.\n\n\"It doesn't matter where he is, where he's speaking. It doesn't matter if it's a commencement or one of his events. He welcomes peaceful protests,\" she said.\n\n\"We have been very clear. We believe all Americans should have the right to peacefully protest,\" she added. \"What we don't want to see is hate speech, violence.\"\n\nBiden is due to give a commencement speech at Morehouse College in Atlanta on May 19.\n\nBiden warned on Tuesday that the threat of antisemitism is growing in the United States, including on college campuses, joining a heated American debate about Jewish security, Zionism, free speech and support for Israel, in the country with the largest Jewish population after Israel.\n\nBiden last week address the campus unrest, saying Americans have the right to protest \"but not a right to cause chaos\" through vandalism, breaking windows or shutting down campuses.\n\nJean-Pierre reiterated the White House position that it should be up the universities to decide how to respond.\n\nShe condemned behavior captured in a video at the University of Mississippi over the weekend as \"undignified and racist\", after a student was accused of mocking a Black protester by making monkey noises during an anti-war demonstration.\n\n\"The actions in the video are beneath any American,\" Jean-Pierre told reporters.\n\nThe Democratic president, seeking re-election in November, has walked a careful line of denouncing antisemitism while supporting young Americans' right to protest and trying to limit longer-term political damage.

It pits an actual terrorist group that just engaged in the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust against a democratic country that protects citizens Jewish, Muslim and Christian. It pits a monstrously evil tentacle of Iran - handed control of the Gaza Strip by Israel in 2005, when Israel pulled out of that area and forced 8,000 Jews out of their homes - against a democratic ally of the United States. It pits an army of atrocity-seeking villains - who are attempting to maximize Palestinian casualties by locating themselves among civilians, stealing humanitarian aid and literally murdering anyone who gets in their way - against an actual professional army risking the lives of its own soldiers in order to protect Palestinian civilians.\n\nAnd yet Joe Biden can't quite make up his mind.\n\nOn the one hand, Biden mouths platitudinous support for Israel in its battle against Hamas. On the other, he continues to grant the central premise Hamas promotes, which is that Israel is a human-rights violator and indiscriminate killer of Palestinians - even as Hamas holds Americans hostage in Gaza. Biden has spent the last several weeks pressuring Israel not to go into Rafah, the sole major repository of the Hamas terror apparatus, where some four brigades of terrorists are digging in. Instead, he has deployed his head of the CIA, his secretary of state and a wide variety of other officials to promote \"negotiations\" between Israel and Hamas.\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\n\nIn fact, he's done more than that for Hamas. While fully articulating his understanding that Hamas seeks a permanent end to the conflict in Gaza, which would leave them in control and hand them a victory they could never earn on the battlefield, Biden has pushed just that: a permanent end to the conflict leaving Hamas in place. Biden has not explained just how this would benefit the United States, Israel, the Palestinians themselves or the region more broadly. He has simply calculated that an end to conflict is an end in and of itself.\n\nTo that end, Biden has been slow-walking aid to the Israelis - including ammunition that allows for better targeting, which would minimize civilian casualties. He has deployed his negotiators to play both sides of the table, even going so far as to allow his CIA head, William Burns, to negotiate with Egypt and Qatar a series of terms without submitting them to the Israelis - and then allowing Hamas itself to declare its acceptance of such nonsensical and irrelevant terms, presumably in an effort to humiliate the Israelis into accepting their own quasi-surrender. Biden has trotted out spokespeople to claim that America continues to back Israel, while simultaneously claiming - falsely - that Israel is engaging in human rights abuses.\n\nThe result is the worst of all possible worlds for Biden: a dissatisfied radical base convinced that Biden is behind the war in Gaza; an angry pro-Israel citizenry bewildered by Biden's inability to call evil by its name; and a stalemate in Gaza, which means that radical protesters will undoubtedly descend on the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in order to harass Biden as he receives his renomination.\n\nWhy is this so seemingly tough for Joe Biden? Is it all just a misread of the political moment - adherence to a stunningly imbecilic belief that if Biden appeases extremists within his party, he'll be able to win the 2024 election? Or is it something deeper - a moral malaise that has taken root in the upper echelons of our politics, in which Western powers, including Israel, are seen as inherently problematic while the West's enemies, including Hamas, are seen as inherently victimized? If the tens of thousands of protesters on America's streets are any indicator, the latter seems more likely than the former.

University of Southern California (USC) also cancelled its main ceremony amid criticism over its decision to nix its pro-Palestinian's valedictorian speech.\n\nIn both cases, the decision to cancel was made by the schools' leadership, not Biden or his administration.\n\nTrump, the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee, has repeatedly called out what he believes to be weakness from Biden on the campaign trail as the two prepare for a match-up in November's general election.\n\nThe former president lamented that students and parents will be \"robbed\" of an important milestone.\n\n\"So now young people, who have worked very hard, and their parents, who have paid thousands of dollars to send their kids to school, are being robbed of one of the most important moments of their lives.

More than 1,000 protestors -- students, faculty and others -- have been arrested since the first major encampment started at Columbia last month.\n\nMany of the protests have been reported to be peaceful, though escalating tensions and the continuation of encampments and building takeovers have prompted several colleges to call in law enforcement. School administrators have argued the encampments and building takeovers are a disruption to campus activities and spark safety concerns for students, especially those who are Jewish.\n\nBiden last week defended the right to peacefully protest, while also criticizing the vandalism and trespassing taking place at some demonstrations.\n\n\"In moments like this, there are always those who rush in to score political points. But this isn't a moment for politics,\" Biden said in prepared remarks from the White House last week. \"It's a moment for clarity. So let me be clear ... Violent protest is not protected. Peaceful protest is.\"\n\nBiden also called out the antisemitism that has been reported in the midst of the protests, though many protest groups reject the characterizations of their demonstrations as antisemitic.\n\n\"There should be no place on any campus, no place in America for antisemitism or threats of violence against Jewish students,\" he said. \"There is no place for hate speech or violence of any kind, whether it's antisemitism, Islamophobia, or discrimination against Arab Americans or Palestinian Americans.

It pits an actual terrorist group that just engaged in the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust against a democratic country that protects citizens Jewish, Muslim, and Christian. It pits a monstrously evil tentacle of Iran -- handed control of the Gaza Strip by Israel in 2005 when Israel pulled out of that area and forced 8,000 Jews out of their homes -- against a democratic ally of the United States. It pits an army of atrocity-seeking villains -- who are attempting to maximize Palestinian casualties by locating themselves among civilians, stealing humanitarian aid, and literally murdering anyone who gets in their way -- against an actual professional army risking the lives of its own soldiers in order to protect Palestinian civilians.\n\nAnd yet Joe Biden can't quite make up his mind.\n\nOn the one hand, Biden mouths platitudinous support for Israel in its battle against Hamas. On the other, he continues to grant the central premise Hamas promotes, which is that Israel is a human rights violator and indiscriminate killer of Palestinians -- even as Hamas holds Americans hostage in Gaza. Biden has spent the last several weeks pressuring Israel not to go into Rafah, the sole major repository of the Hamas terror apparatus, where some four brigades of terrorists are digging in. Instead, he has deployed his head of the CIA, his secretary of state, and a wide variety of other officials to promote \"negotiations\" between Israel and Hamas.\n\nIn fact, he's done more than that for Hamas. While fully articulating his understanding that Hamas seeks a permanent end to the conflict in Gaza, which would leave them in control and hand them a victory they could never earn on the battlefield, Biden has pushed just that: a permanent end to the conflict leaving Hamas in place. Biden has not explained just how this would benefit the United States, Israel, the Palestinians themselves, or the region more broadly. He has simply calculated that an end to conflict is an end in and of itself.\n\nTo that end, Biden has been slow-walking aid to the Israelis -- including ammunition that allows for better targeting, which would minimize civilian casualties. He has deployed his negotiators to play both sides of the table, even going so far as to allow his CIA head, William Burns, to negotiate with Egypt and Qatar a series of terms without submitting them to the Israelis -- and then allowing Hamas itself to declare its acceptance of such nonsensical and irrelevant terms, presumably in an effort to humiliate the Israelis into accepting their own quasi-surrender. Biden has trotted out spokespeople to claim that America continues to back Israel, while simultaneously claiming -- falsely -- that Israel is engaging in human rights abuses.\n\nThe result is the worst of all possible worlds for Biden: a dissatisfied radical base convinced that Biden is behind the war in Gaza; an angry pro-Israel citizenry bewildered by Biden's inability to call evil by its name; and a stalemate in Gaza, which means that radical protesters will undoubtedly descend on the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in order to harass Biden as he receives his renomination.\n\nWhy is this so seemingly tough for Joe Biden? Is it all just a misread of the political moment -- adherence to a stunningly imbecilic belief that if Biden appeases extremists within his party, he'll be able to win the 2024 election? Or is it something deeper -- a moral malaise that has taken root in the upper echelons of our politics, in which Western powers, including Israel, are seen as inherently problematic while the West's enemies, including Hamas, are seen as inherently victimized? If the tens of thousands of protesters on America's streets are any indicator, the latter seems more likely than the former.

Does it look like antisemitism? And is it really antisemitism?\n\nIt can seem that what is happening, in campus protests and on city streets, depends on who is looking.\n\nAs we all know by now, some see a demonstration to draw attention to civilian lives lost in the Israel-Hamas war; others see a call for the elimination of the state of Israel.\n\nSome insist that these are peaceful protests with no connection to terror; others hear violent rhetoric and see violent slogans and actions, along with support for terror organizations, down to their flags.\n\nBut there is also something quieter, something behind the scenes. It is a relentless campaign that insists that the look of the situation -- specifically, how it might look to you as an individual with eyes and a personal history -- is not valid.\n\nThat intellectual bullying is what I thought of when I heard the word \"ferocious.\"\n\nAs a professor, I have been bombarded with emailed missives from the literary and academic community, insisting that whatever statement they are making is \"not antisemitism.\" I see statements insisting that thinking that Israel's war on Hamas is not \"genocide\" -- is \"illogical.\" Yet at the same time, I have a stream of Jewish students -- most of whom I do not directly teach and who sought me out because of my name and identity -- coming to my office to express their fears from statements and actions of fellow students, and occasionally, faculty.\n\nThese students have eyes and ears too.\n\nI have also been receiving anguished emails from young writers around the country who insist that they support Palestinian rights, yet despair because they have been explicitly told by their mentors that there is, as one graduate student wrote me, \"no place for me in the poetry world if I believe Israel has a right to exist.\"\n\nThat must fall under the category of \"ferocious\" discrimination.\n\nBeyond the etymology, the multiple meanings of \"ferocious\" are striking.\n\nOxford Languages -- the recently renamed umbrella for the Oxford English Dictionary -- has this for \"ferocious\": \"savagely fierce, cruel, or violent,\" with the following illustrative example -- \"the wolverine is nature's most ferocious and violent animal.\"\n\nOther similar words for \"ferocious\" are: \"savage, wild, feral, untamed, and predatory.\"\n\nWhen I hear \"savagely fierce,\" I think of the attitude that young poet -- an entirely secular person who identifies as left-wing -- encountered from his rather well-known teachers, who all see themselves as antiracist educators. When I hear synonyms like \"savage, wild, feral, untamed, predatory,\" I think of a direct call for violence and murder, something like the memorable statement of Khymani James, a leader of the Columbia University student protests, who became instantly famous for saying in a video recording, \"Zionists, they shouldn't live in this world,\" and comparing Zionists to others \"who don't deserve to live\" such as Nazis, fascists and racists. \"I feel very comfortable -- very comfortable -- calling for those people to die.\"\n\nThe White House specifically condemned James's comments.\n\n\"These dangerous, appalling statements turn the stomach and should serve as a wakeup call,\" Andrew Bates, deputy White House press secretary, said in a statement. \"It is hideous to advocate for the murder of Jews.\"\n\nJames apologized. But not every comment from a college student gets a call-out from the White House, as I learn each week, listening to stories in my office.\n\nBack to the dictionary.\n\nThere is the concept of a \"ferocious conflict,\" which, the Oxford points out, is \"characterized by or involving aggression, bitterness and determination.\"\n\nThat also sounds relevant. The dictionary even offers the example of \"a ferocious argument\" and a final definition, \"extreme and unpleasant,\" with the example of \"a ferocious headache.\"\n\nTo be clear, Biden was in no way saying that the protesters are animalistic; nor was he saying that they were a headache. Rather, he was calling the increase in antisemitism a \"ferocious surge.\"\n\nBut \"ferocious\" and its many layers of meaning, from \"extreme and unpleasant\" to \"savage\" is an interesting word to consider when it comes to the increase -- and tone -- of recent rhetoric on Israel and Jews, and to the debate about what, exactly, is off-limits.\n\nI would argue that the \"surge\" has encompassed all these meanings.\n\nAnd I think the phrase \"ferocious surge\" also highlights how much the president's words matter -- and in its power, focuses attention on what the president's job really is.\n\n\"I'm a believer as a former chief of staff that the president has to make clear to the American people exactly what's going on,\" Leon Panetta, former head of the CIA and former White House Chief of Staff, told Bloomberg News shortly after Biden's speech.\n\n\"And the president did speak to the demonstrations. I think the President probably needs to speak more clearly to the American people about what the future path of this war is.\"\n\n\"Because if it's just, you know the United States putting pressure on Israel not to do certain things, frankly I think that just creates a lot of confusion about just where the United States stands on this issue.\"\n\nThat seemed to be something that might be useful to discuss in a campus context. What exactly is America's position, and why?\n\n\"I think the United States understands that Israel has the right to defend itself, that it has the right to go after Hamas' leadership, that it has the right to make sure that what happened on Oct. 7 never happens again,\" Panetta continued. \"At the same time, it is important to recognize that we have to get the hostages back and we have to provide humanitarian aid. I don't think those goals are necessarily in conflict.\"\n\nWhile Panetta may have a point on clarity, Biden's speech at the museum was primarily about antisemitism and the Holocaust -- not the path of this war.\n\nBiden outlined what he sees in our current moment in America.\n\n\"Vicious propaganda on social media. Jews forced to keep their -- hide their kippahs under baseball hats, tuck their Jewish stars into their shirts. On college campuses, Jewish students blocked, harassed, attacked while walking to class,\" Biden said. \"Antisemitism, antisemitic posters, slogans, calling for the annihilation of Israel, the world's only Jewish state.\"\n\nThe president emphasized that in the past, exclusion from cultural life -- like university life and schools -- foreshadowed worse things ahead. So too, did \"antisemitic demonstrations.\"\n\n\"Germany 1933, Hitler and his Nazi Party's rise to power by rekindling one of the oldest forms of prejudice and hate: antisemitism. His role didn't begin with mass murder; it started slowly across economic, political, social and cultural life. Propaganda demonizing Jews. Boycotts of Jewish businesses. Synagogues defaced with swastikas. Harassment of Jews in the street and the schools, antisemitic demonstrations, pogroms, organized riots,\" Biden said.\n\nLast but certainly not least, Biden called out indifference.\n\n\"With the indifference of the world, Hitler knew he could expand his reign of terror by eliminating Jews from Germany, to annihilate Jews across Europe through genocide, the Nazis called the final solution,\" Biden continued. \"Concentration camps, gas chambers, mass shootings. By the time the war ended, six million Jews -- one of every three Jews in the entire world -- were murdered.\"\n\nBy the end of October, federal officials were sounding the alarm on antisemitism.\n\n\"This is a threat that is reaching, in some way, sort of historic levels,\" FBI director Christopher Wray said in a Senate hearing in late October 2023.\n\n\"In fact, our statistics would indicate that for a group that represents only about 2.4% of the American public, they account for something like 60% of all religious-based hate crimes.\"\n\n\"In the 2023 Audit, ADL tabulated 8,873 antisemitic incidents across the United States. This represents a remarkable reversal from the early 2010s, when antisemitic incidents were at some of the lowest levels in the history of the Audit.\"\n\nI hear Wray's warning and the numbers from the FBI and ADL in Biden's \"ferocious surge\" phrase.\n\nAs Panetta pointed out, the President's job is to let people know what's going on. To let them see what he sees. When it comes to antisemitism, in Biden's eyes, it doesn't look good.", "source": {"uri": "forward.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Forward"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aviya_kushner@forward.com", "name": "Aviya Kushner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_resistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolent resistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriam-Webster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merriam-Webster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slogan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Latin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greek language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Chief of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxford English Dictionary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Etymology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Panetta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leon Panetta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

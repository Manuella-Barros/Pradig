The ARCSIX, or Arctic Radiation Cloud Aerosol Surface Interaction Experiment, airborne campaign will fly out of Pituffik Space Force Base in Greenland for seven weeks this summer to gather measurements of the sea ice, clouds, radiation and aerosols that are affecting the ice melt. \u201cThe reason that we need this mission is because there are a lot of things that we don\u2019t know about how the Arctic climate system functions and operates,\u201d said Patrick Taylor, deputy mission science leader. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in our projections of how fast they warm. We know that it\u2019s going to warm fast, but it can go really fast. \u201cThe idea of these observations is to understand how the sea ice is changing, so that we can use that data to improve our tests and hypotheses and improve our theories about how the sea ice is evolving. We can then put those ideas and our knowledge to improve our forecast models.\u201d Ice in the arctic has a pivotal role in cooling the earth, and it\u2019s not every day that scientists are able to take detailed snapshots of the region. Taylor and Ewan Crosbie, platform scientist, said it\u2019s pivotal to learn about the Earth\u2019s warming climate now, and the data could be used to form strategies on how to reduce the effects of climate change. \u201cHaving boots on the ground (and) people out in this region of the Arctic only happens once or twice every five years,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s not even that we get out there every year. We get these very periodic snapshots of what\u2019s happening there. We\u2019re going to have an unprecedented kind of dataset of it with all the different instruments.\u201d The mission is split into two. The group will go out to see how the ice is melting in late spring and early summer, and in July, a second part will collect data for the later parts of summer. Each flight will have two pilots, a fight scientist coordinating with researchers on the ground, a scientist for each of the three instruments collecting data and an extra seat for an additional scientist or operator. The aircraft is equipped with three components. The first are dropsondes, designed to be dropped from an aircraft at altitude and measure characteristics such as temperature, humidity and winds. Another is the AVIRIS, or Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer. AVIRIS is used as a very powerful camera, and will collect useful information about the sea ice clouds and aerosols. The third is HALO, or High Altitude Lidar Observatory. It uses a very short pulse of light to collect images, but where the AVIRIS takes images of what\u2019s happening horizontally, HALO collects data on what\u2019s happening vertically. \u201cWhen the ice starts to melt, we get liquid forming on the surface. We can see what that looks like (with the instruments), even though you couldn\u2019t see with the naked eye,\u201d Crosbie said. \u201cAlso for clouds, an interesting science question that we\u2019ll go after is to try to understand the lifecycle of Arctic clouds. \u201cSo understanding the distinction between clouds that contain predominantly liquid droplets versus ice particles is is a critical piece to understanding the behavior of Arctic clouds, their lifecycle and the radiation impacts.\u201d Crosbie said this could be one of the last times to observe \u201cold ice,\u201d or ice that was able to survive the summer melt season and regrow during the polar night. He said the ice seen in the mission will be between 3-4 four years old, and this could be one of the last chances to measure and collect data on it. \u201cWe\u2019re really excited about the science,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe don\u2019t get a data set like this in this region of the Arctic \u2014 or the Arctic at all \u2014 very often so really, some things we think we\u2019ll learn will probably surprise us. There\u2019s probably some things we\u2019re not expecting will pop out of the data.\u201d Eliza Noe, eliza.noe@virginiamedia.com", "summary": "NASA Langley researchers are heading to the Arctic Ocean to study the habitat's impact on climate worldwide.", "url": "https://www.pilotonline.com/2024/05/26/nasa-langley-researchers-are-heading-to-the-arctic-heres-why-that-matters/", "image": "https://www.pilotonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TVP-L-NW-NASA-ARCSIX-0523-SMK-001.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:28:14", "author": "Eliza Noe", "authors": ["Eliza Noe"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.333}

She reportedly used to rub the victim's legs.\n\nBergmann, 24, was charged with first-degree sexual assault of a child under 13 after the victim's father reported her to both River Crest Elementary School administrators and the police. According to a criminal complaint filed on Thursday in St. Croix District Court, the fifth-grader informed investigators that Bergmann would rub his thigh and calves in the classroom during independent reading time.\n\nSexually Starved Teacher\n\n\"My daughter thought he was a problem kid,\" another student's mom told The New York Post. \"She said that his desk got moved next to [Bergmann's] a couple of months ago, and she just assumed that he was in trouble.\n\n\"When it was time for lunch, she'd ask him to stay after class,\" the mother said, adding, \"so that just fed into the idea that he was constantly getting into trouble.\"\n\nDue to the position of his desk in her classroom, the boy \"did not believe any of the other kids would see it happening,\" according to the complaint.\n\nThe pre-teen told police that Bergmann kissed him multiple times in her classroom, either after school or while the other students were at lunch.\n\nThe boy also confirmed to police that Bergmann would have him stay after class.\n\nThe boy's family had developed a friendship with Bergmann, to the extent of accompanying her on a ski trip to Afton Alps, a nearby resort.\n\nBergmann told authorities that she obtained the boy's number during that weekend.\n\nGetting Caught\n\nAlarm was raised on April 29 when the boy's mother overheard a phone call between Bergmann and the victim. Subsequently, his father confiscated his phone and discovered sexually charged text messages.\n\nAccording to the complaint, in one text, Bergmann told the boy that she \"wanted to just grab your face and push you to the floor and make out with you.\"\n\nIn another text, she allegedly told him, \"I almost kissed you when you were on the ground today, but I got distracted by your stomach.\"\n\nThe boy's furious father printed out the text messages and brought them to the school, prompting authorities to launch an immediate investigation. During this process, police searched Bergmann's backpack and allegedly found a folder labeled with the victim's name. Inside the folder were several handwritten letters.\n\n\"In her notes she tells him that she loves him, wants to kiss him, he turns her on, and that she is obsessed with him,\" the complaint says.\n\nBergmann is currently out on a $25,000 bond. She has disabled her social media accounts and is banned from being on school property or attending school events.\n\nIt's unclear whether she has retained legal representation authorized to speak on her behalf.\n\nMoreover, Bergmann, who was engaged to Sam Hickman, will no longer be getting married in July.\n\n\"It's been indefinitely postponed,\" a pal of her fiance told The Post Saturday.\n\n\"And it probably won't happen.

She is accused of abusing a student in her fifth-grade class\n\nBergmann, pictured with her fianc\u00e9, would allegedly rub the victim's thigh and calves during independent reading time\n\nThe boy told police that due to the position of his desk in Bergmann's classroom at River Crest Elementary School, he did not believe other students could see the abuse\n\nAlarm was raised on April 29, when the boy's mother overheard a phone call between Bergmann and the victim. His father confiscated his phone and discovered sexually charged text messages.\n\nIn one text, Bergmann told the boy that she 'wanted to just grab (his) face and push (him) to the floor and make out with (him),' the complaint states.\n\nIn another text, she allegedly wrote, 'I almost kissed you when you were on the ground today, but I got distracted by your stomach.'\n\nThe complaint shows the child's father met with police and handed over copies of the text messages.\n\nBergmann was no stranger to the victim's family, as they had gone on a ski trip together over winter break in 2023.\n\nShe told police that she got the boy's cell phone number at the time 'in case they somehow got separated in the ski hills,' and alleged he called her several times 'for no particular reason.'\n\nWhen police asked about the text messages, Bergmann 'asserted her right to counsel and the interview stopped,' according to the complaint. She was then arrested.\n\nThe 11-year-old's father uncovered text messages between the teacher and his son, in which Bergmann said she 'wanted to just grab (his) face and push (him) to the floor and make out with (him)'\n\nThe 24-year-old obtained the boy's cellphone number when she accompanied his family on a ski trip over winter break 2023\n\nBergmann was set to marry her fianc\u00e9 Sam Hickman in July, but the wedding has been postponed and their registry taken offline\n\nInvestigators searched her backpack and discovered a folder emblazoned with the victim's name that contained several handwritten letters.\n\n'In her notes she tells him that she loves him, wants to kiss him, he turns her on, and that she is obsessed with him,' the complaint states.\n\nIn one letter, Bergmann allegedly wrote, 'One of my cousins is in the 5th grade and I can't imagine a man talking to her how we talk. I know we have a special relationship and I do love you more than anyone in the world but I have to be the adult here and stop.'\n\nPolice also spoke to the little boy, who 'made comments about really liking her, trusting her, feeling weird but also liking it,' according to the complaint.\n\nFollowing Bergmann's arrest, Hudson School District Superintendent Nick Oullette issued a statement to families.\n\n'No Superintendent ever imagines standing before a group of parents with this news. As a leader of this school community, as a parent, this is gut-wrenching,' he wrote. 'I want you to know the School District is taking this very seriously. We care about each of you and your children.'\n\nRead More Married teacher caught naked in car with male student, 17, is the wife of a Harvard-educated Department of Defense deputy director and they have a daughter the same age as her victim\n\nHe urged parents to be patient and 'please understand that there are things we simply cannot say given that the investigation is still ongoing'.\n\nThe district also shared a timeline with the parents of fifth-grade students detailing how the administration responded once informed of the allegations on May 1.\n\nAround noon that day, the district learned that a parent was concerned about Bergmann's conduct. She was removed from the classroom at 12:37 pm, with the district contacting law enforcement roughly 10 minutes later.\n\nBergmann was taken into custody the same day. By the end of the week she had been placed on unpaid administrative leave.\n\nThe 24-year-old appeared in court and was released on an unsecured $25,000 bond ahead of a May 30 court date.\n\nUnder the terms of her release, Bergmann can have no contact with anyone under 18 years of age. She is barred from school property and must wear an electronic monitoring device.\n\nBergmann, originally from St. Paul, Minnesota, had been teaching at River View since August 2022 following her graduation from the University of Wisconsin River Falls.\n\nThe 24-year-old was set to marry her fianc\u00e9, Sam Hickman, in July, but the wedding has been indefinitely postponed. The couple's registry was also taken offline.\n\nHickman works in operations at Little Free Library, a Minnesota-based nonprofit that manages volunteer-led book exchange boxes. His LinkedIn page was removed amid the fallout surrounding his soon-to-be bride.\n\nTwo 'veteran substitute teachers' will manage Bergmann's classroom for the remainder of the school year, according to the district.\n\nHudson Schools is also conducting its own investigation to determine whether actions should be taken involving employee discipline and whether district policies should be evaluated

The victim then told investigators that he spoke with Bergmann \"almost daily.\"\n\nWhen the child's father found out about the alleged relationship, he marched to River Crest Elementary with the printed conversations from his son's phone, leading to police being called \"regarding inappropriate conduct between a current teacher and a 5th grade student.\"\n\nAdditionally, court documents indicate that Bergmann's bag had a folder in it with handwritten notes from the victim.

Bergmann, 24, is charged with first-degree child sexual assault of a child under age 13.\n\nBergmann was arrested at the school Wednesday and released from St. Croix County Jail on a $25,000 bond the next day following her initial court appearance. She is due back in court May 30.\n\nBergmann's attorney, Joe Tamburino, declined to comment Monday on the allegations.\n\nThe Hudson school district said Bergmann was put on unpaid administrative leave Thursday.\n\nThe illicit conduct was first discovered last week through several text messages between Bergmann and the boy. In a letter police then found in the boy's desk, Bergmann told him, \"I love you so much it hurts,\" the complaint says.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Principal Kim Osterhues called the school's resource officer Wednesday about alleged inappropriate conduct between a teacher and a student. The officer met with Osterhues, the Hudson school district's human resources director and the boy's father.\n\nSeveral printed screenshots of text messages between the boy and Bergmann were given to the officer. In one text, Bergmann wrote that she \"wanted to just grab your face and push you to the floor and make out with you.\" In another text, the teacher told the boy how she \"almost kissed you when you were on the ground today but I got distracted by your stomach,\" the complaint says.\n\nThe boy's mother discovered Bergmann talking to her son on the phone on April 29, then emailed the teacher, telling her to stop contacting the boy outside of school. The mother took the boy's phone and gave it to his father, who found the text messages Wednesday and notified the school, the complaint says.\n\nIn an interview Wednesday at the school, Bergmann said she spoke with the boy over the phone four or five times. She said that she had been invited to go snowboarding at Afton Alps with the boy and his family and she exchanged phone numbers with him in case they became separated.\n\nWhen Bergmann was asked if there had been any text messages exchanged between her and the boy, she requested a lawyer.\n\nPolice found in Bergmann's backpack a folder with the boy's name on it and several handwritten notes. \"In her notes she tells him that she loves him, wants to kiss him, he turns her on, and that she is obsessed with him,\" the complaint says.\n\nThe boy told police he got Bergmann's phone number when they were snowboarding at Afton Alps with his mom. He said they communicate almost daily.\n\nThe boy said Bergmann had touched his hand, shin and thigh while he sat next to her desk during independent reading time and that \"he did not believe any of the other kids would see it happening,\" the complaint says.\n\nThe boy then told police Bergmann told him to stay after class and that she approached him and kissed him on the mouth. He said that Bergmann had kissed him several times in the classroom after school or during lunch since March, according to the complaint.\n\n\"As a leader of this school community, as a parent, this is gut wrenching,\" Superintendent Nick Ouellette said in a Sunday statement to families. \"I want you to know the School District is taking this very seriously.\"", "source": {"uri": "twincities.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Twin Cities"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_ferraro@twincities.com", "name": "Nick Ferraro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Croix_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Croix County, Wisconsin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hudson, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hudson, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_delta", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "River delta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "School district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madison, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Paul,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint Paul, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint Paul, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afton_Alps", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Afton Alps"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_resource_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "School resource officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowboarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Snowboarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintendent_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superintendent (education)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/thinkstockphotos-95403440.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544512", "eventUri": "eng-9544512", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-30", "textStart": 630, "textEnd": 636}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 1776, "textEnd": 1784}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

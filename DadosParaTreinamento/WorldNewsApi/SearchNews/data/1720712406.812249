An alert Friday warned of a G2 geomagnetic storm which, combined with moderate solar activity, could mean a chance to see the Northern Lights. Scientists expect the lights to be visible Sunday and Monday nights along the Canadian border and in parts of Montana, Washington, Idaho, Minnesota, Michigan and the Dakotas, dipping the furthest south in the center of the country. The northernmost parts of Maine and New York could also catch a glimpse of the aurora borealis, according to NOAA, but the Northern Lights are notoriously unpredictable. The brightest lights are usually visible within an hour or two of midnight, between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., and are best seen away from city lights.

Key Background The Northern Lights put on a dazzling display last month after a historic geomagnetic storm made them visible in all 50 states. The storm, the result of an eruption of plasma from the sun\u2019s atmosphere, was rated \"severe\" by NOAA and was warned to be capable of damaging satellites, causing \u201cwidespread voltage problems\u201d and potentially causing communications disruptions, though significant problems were not reported. The storm last month was the first watch alert for a geomagnetic storm of that magnitude since January 2005. NASA predicts that such geomagnetic storms will continue on into next year as Solar Cycle 25\u2014the cycle the sun goes through around every 11 years\u2014continues toward its anticipated July 2025 peak.

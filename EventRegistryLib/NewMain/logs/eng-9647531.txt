But he also hit far too many wayward iron shots on a course that demands accuracy, and his deft touch around the greens abandoned him more than once on the way to a 4-over 74 in the opening round.\n\nIt was his 12th consecutive round without breaking par in a major, one derailed by five bogeys in a seven-hole stretch.\n\n\"I was somewhat conservative in some of my end points. Then again, I didn't hit the ball very well either,\" explained Woods, who found 12 of 14 fairways in regulation but hit just half the greens. \"It's not where I wanted to be on a lot of holes.\"\n\nTo be fair, the famed Donald Ross layout can at times be borderline unfair.\n\nWoods hit several shots that would have produced good birdie chances most anywhere else, but instead they rolled off the wildly contoured greens and came to rest in collection areas. That was the case at the par-3 ninth, his final hole of the day, when his approach appeared to be so safely aboard that he plucked his tee and began heading toward the green.\n\nThat's when a groan began rising from the crowd. Woods looked up to see his ball starting to trickle, pick up speed, and come to rest 30 yards down the fairway. His birdie chance had become a testy pitch-and-putt par save to finish the round.\n\n\"It's hard to get the ball close,\" Woods said. \"In most golf courses you play, you hit shots into where it's feeding off of slopes into flags, where it's collecting. Here, everything is repelling. It's just hard to get the ball on top of the shelves.\n\n\"You know if you miss it short side, it's an auto bogey, or higher.\"\n\nWoods at least avoided the big numbers Thursday, and while his round easily could have been even par or better, it at least kept the three-time U.S. Open champ in the mix to make the cut. That alone was an improvement over his last time out in the PGA Championship at Valhalla, where two triple bogeys during a second-round 77 kept him from playing the weekend.\n\nMore good news: The battered body that has so often betrayed Woods in recent years seemed to be up to the task.\n\nWoods, who missed the last U.S. Open at Pinehurst in 2014 while recovering from the first of four back surgeries, rarely grimaced on his morning march. The relatively flat layout, at least compared to places like Augusta National, helped his cause, as did the weather, which was hot and humid and kept those aching joints from locking up.\n\nHe also benefited from an early tee time, giving him almost 24 hours exactly to recover for Friday's round.\n\n\"I'm hoping I don't get too tight in the car ride back. I can get tight in air conditioning,\" said Woods, who in fact went straight to the driving range after his round, and began working on those inconsistent irons.\n\nHe should have had a suspicion they might be a problem.\n\n\"I was pretty one-dimensional early in the week, which is interesting. I was drawing the ball a lot. Now I'm cutting the ball a lot,\" Woods said, before flashing a wry smile. \"Welcome to golf.\"\n\nWelcome to inconsistency. And that may be the product of infrequency.\n\nWoods had not played a U.S. Open round since Winged Foot in 2020, thanks mostly to all those injuries -- five back surgeries, four knee surgeries and the procedure to piece together a shattered right leg and ankle from his 2021 car crash.\n\n\"I'm physically getting better as the year has gone on. I just haven't been able to play as much because I just don't want to hurt myself pre, then I won't be able to play in the major championships,\" Woods said. \"It's pick your poison, right? Play a lot with the potential of not playing, or not playing and fight being not as sharp.\"\n\nWoods admitted he hopes his body will allow him to begin playing more often.\n\nPlaying this weekend would be a good start.", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Ross_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Ross (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winged_Foot_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winged Foot Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Driving range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_National_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augusta National Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iron (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/2d/b2d2d343-fce3-5fc4-9083-2f515650df41/666b4bd6a2b46.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Follow that? No thanks, said Woods' confidantes. So Steinberg tapped Tirico, who, from his perch in 18th-hole towers from California to Carnoustie, has helped chronicle much of Woods' prolific career.\n\nAfter opening remarks from Tirico, who touched not only on Woods' dominance as a player but also his charitable contributions through his TGR Foundation, USGA CEO Mike Whan took the podium to present Woods with the physical manifestation of the award, a bronze figurine of Bob Jones.\n\nWoods looks at ease in front of crowds, and not just the kind that gather at golf courses. Reporters might gripe about Woods' unwillingness to open up in press conferences, but in packed event spaces, with admiring audiences looking on, he'll speak warmly and colorfully and without notes or prompters. That's what he did at his Hall of Fame induction, and he did it again Tuesday night, when he cracked up attendees -- among them: Sam; his son, Charlie; and his mother, Kultida -- with the opening line of his six-minute acceptance:\n\n\"Charlie just said, don't let my head get too big.\"\n\nWoods spoke of the impact Bob Jones (\"the greatest amateur that ever lived\") made on the game, and of how young Tiger used to build his calendar year around the U.S. Junior Amateur and, a few years later, the U.S. Amateur. \"All I wanted to do was win that one big event,\" Woods said.\n\nBut Woods saved his most poignant and heartfelt comments for the end of his speech, when he turned his attention to the essential role his mother, Tida, had played in his rise.\n\n\"My mom doesn't get enough credit,\" Woods said, speaking directly to his mother, who was seated at a table with Sam and Charlie. \"Everyone thought that it was my dad when I went on the road, which it was, but Mom was at home. If you don't know, Mom has been there my entire life.\"\n\nIndeed, it was Tida who shuttled Woods to all those SoCal junior events in her Plymouth Duster. It was Tida who instilled in her son toughness and drive. It was Tida who was there for her son's majors wins, if in a less prominent role than Earl, peering out from under one of her trademark wide-brim hats. When Woods won the 2019 Masters in stirring fashion, my colleague Michael Bamberger wrote a couple of years later: \"Tiger's mom was watching in the clubhouse with her two grandchildren and others. Suddenly, they were all escorted out and to the home green. To get there, Tida Woods -- in her mid-70s, a little over five feet tall -- had to negotiate a yard-high black braided chain. She went over it like a high hurdler.\"\n\nNone of that guidance and support has been lost on Woods.\n\n\"I look back at the stopwatch that started back in 1990, and especially in '96,\" Woods said Tuesday evening, \"because there's no other time that I had ever felt so much pressure to win one event as the last U.S. Amateur that I was ever going to play in, and the reason is Mom never came to any of my Juniors. Mom never came to one of my Amateurs. She was wearing her Stanford shirt there at Pumpkin Ridge, and she was there for the first time. Now imagine if I had lost the damn thing, right? But when I made that winning putt, who was the first person that I hugged? Right, Mommy? It was you.\n\n\"This award, I accept it in humbleness and just unbelievable regard for the past recipients, but I also accept it for my mommy, too. She allowed me to get here. She allowed me to do these things, chase my dreams, and the support and love -- I didn't do this alone. I had the greatest rock that any child could possibly have: my mom.

But, after starting well, the 15-time major champion unravelled to finish his opening round four-over par on Thursday.\n\nWoods, a three-time US Open champion who last won the major 16 years ago at Torrey Pines, got off to a good start when he birdied the first. But after he started on the back nine, the 16th and 17th holes took the steam out of Woods' opening round as he missed par putts at both to slip to one-over through eight holes.\n\nREAD MORE: U.S. Open 2024 predictions: Can anyone stop Scottie Scheffler? Is it Rory McIlroy's time again?\n\nREAD MORE: US Open official gives verdict on Tiger Woods after watching him prepare for major\n\nWoods opened the back-nine with another bogey before he lipped out on a par effort to slip to three-over. The fourth hole at Pinehurst, renowned for its brutality, lived up to the billing as the 48-year-old drilled his tee shot into the bunker before missing a par putt within five feet.\n\nHaving bogeyed five of his previous seven holes, Woods tallied a birdie before continuing with his struggles and closing out a four-over round with a par at the 18th. He was ultimately let down by his iron play, hitting just 10 greens in regulation, but Woods also acknowledged his putting must also improve.\n\n\"My speed was not quite there,\" Woods told reporters after finishing his first round. \"I think I 3-putted, what, two or three times today. If I clean that up, if I get a couple [of] iron shots not as loose as I did, I'm right there at even par.\n\n\"It can go so far the other way here, the wrong way. It's just so hard to get back. This is a golf course that doesn't give up a whole lot of birdies. It gives up a lot of bogeys and higher. I thought I did the one thing I needed to do today, which is drive the ball well. I did that, I just didn't capitalise on any of it.\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .\n\nWoods certainly did drive well, hitting 12 fairways in regulation. But he was undone by the greens, which were a major topic of conversation building up to the U.S. Open this week.\n\n\"This golf course is all about the greens,\" Woods added. \"The complexes are just so difficult and so severe.... there aren't that many scores that are low. It's hard to get the ball close. In most golf courses you play, you hit shots into where it's feeding off of slopes into flags. Here everything is repelling.\"\n\nEntering the back end of 2024, Woods is still looking to win another major championship as he continues to pursue Jack Nicklaus ' record 18 major titles. Five years have passed since his iconic triumph at the 2019 Masters, while his last US Open win came in 2008.\n\nThere's still a lot of golf to play.

(AP) - Tiger Woods started off the U.S. Open with a birdie on Thursday, putting him into the red and atop the leaderboard, and turning back the clock 25 years to when a phenom still on the rise first played the national championship at Pinehurst No. 2.\n\nThe next 17 holes contrasted the player he once was with the player he is now.\n\nWoods drove the ball exceptionally well, threading narrow fairways flanked on each side by native grasses, and he made a couple of long putts to save pars. But he also hit far too many wayward iron shots on a course that demands accuracy, and his deft touch around the greens abandoned him more than once on the way to a 4-over 74 in the opening round.\n\nIt was his 12th consecutive round without breaking par in a major, one derailed by five bogeys in a seven-hole stretch.\n\n\"I was somewhat conservative in some of my end points. Then again, I didn't hit the ball very well either,\" explained Woods, who found 12 of 14 fairways in regulation but hit just half the greens. \"It's not where I wanted to be on a lot of holes.\"\n\nTo be fair, the famed Donald Ross layout can at times be borderline unfair.\n\nTiger Woods lines up a putt on the 16th hole during the first round of the U.S. Open golf tournament Thursday, June 13, 2024, in Pinehurst, N.C. (AP Photo/Mike Stewart)\n\nWoods hit several shots that would have produced good birdie chances most anywhere else, but instead they rolled off the wildly contoured greens and came to rest in collection areas. That was the case at the par-3 ninth, his final hole of the day, when his approach appeared to be so safely aboard that he plucked his tee and began heading toward the green.\n\nThat's when a groan began rising from the crowd. Woods looked up to see his ball starting to trickle, pick up speed, and come to rest 30 yards down the fairway. His birdie chance had become a testy pitch-and-putt par save to finish the round.\n\n\"It's hard to get the ball close,\" Woods said. \"In most golf courses you play, you hit shots into where it's feeding off of slopes into flags, where it's collecting. Here, everything is repelling. It's just hard to get the ball on top of the shelves.\n\n\"You know if you miss it short side, it's an auto bogey, or higher.\"\n\nWoods at least avoided the big numbers Thursday, and while his round easily could have been even par or better, it at least kept the three-time U.S. Open champ in the mix to make the cut. That alone was an improvement over his last time out in the PGA Championship at Valhalla, where two triple bogeys during a second-round 77 kept him from playing the weekend.\n\nMore good news: The battered body that has so often betrayed Woods in recent years seemed to be up to the task.\n\nWoods, who missed the last U.S. Open at Pinehurst in 2014 while recovering from the first of four back surgeries, rarely grimaced on his morning march. The relatively flat layout, at least compared to places like Augusta National, helped his cause, as did the weather, which was hot and humid and kept those aching joints from locking up.\n\nHe also benefited from an early tee time, giving him almost 24 hours exactly to recover for Friday's round.\n\n\"I'm hoping I don't get too tight in the car ride back. I can get tight in air conditioning,\" said Woods, who in fact went straight to the driving range after his round, and began working on those inconsistent irons.\n\nHe should have had a suspicion they might be a problem.\n\n\"I was pretty one-dimensional early in the week, which is interesting. I was drawing the ball a lot. Now I'm cutting the ball a lot,\" Woods said, before flashing a wry smile. \"Welcome to golf.\"\n\nWelcome to inconsistency. And that may be the product of infrequency.\n\nWoods had not played a U.S. Open round since Winged Foot in 2020, thanks mostly to all those injuries - five back surgeries, four knee surgeries and the procedure to piece together a shattered right leg and ankle from his 2021 car crash.\n\n\"I\u00b4m physically getting better as the year has gone on. I just haven\u00b4t been able to play as much because I just don\u00b4t want to hurt myself pre, then I won\u00b4t be able to play in the major championships,\" Woods said. \"It\u00b4s pick your poison, right? Play a lot with the potential of not playing, or not playing and fight being not as sharp.\"\n\nWoods admitted he hopes his body will allow him to begin playing more often.\n\nPlaying this weekend would be a good start.\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf\n\nTiger Woods hits his tee shot on the 15th hole during the first round of the U.S. Open golf tournament Thursday, June 13, 2024, in Pinehurst, N.C.

But Woods' irons weren't dialed in on a course that demands accuracy because of its complex greens and dramatic runoffs, and he missed 9 of 18 greens en route to a 4-over 74.\n\n\"I didn't hit my irons particularly well,\" Woods said. \"Didn't putt that great. Drove it on the string all day. Unfortunately, I just didn't capitalize on it.\"\n\nWoods, a three-time U.S. Open champion, was tied for 54th when he walked off the course, 9 strokes behind leader Patrick Cantlay, who opened with a 5-under 65.\n\n\"I was somewhat conservative in some of my end points,\" Woods said. \"Then again, I didn't hit the ball very well either. It added up to quite a bit of distance away from the flag. It's not where I wanted to be on a lot of the holes. It just ended up being that far away because I wasn't as sharp as I needed to be.\"\n\nWoods gave his fans a promising start when he made a 12-foot birdie putt on No. 10, his first hole of the round, to move to 1 under. On the par-4 12th, he made a 10-footer to save par, followed by an 8\u00bd-footer on the 13th to remain 1 under.\n\nThings fell apart once he reached the par-4 16th. Woods missed the fairway for the first time off the tee, then had to punch out short of the green. He barely missed a 20-footer and made bogey to fall to even par.\n\nOn the par-3 17th, Woods three-putted from 47\u00bd feet for a bogey. After making the turn at 1 over, Woods three-putted from 38 feet on No. 1. After another bogey on the second and a par on the third, Woods had a spectacular chip out of a greenside bunker but missed a 4\u00bd-footer for par for a bogey on No. 4.\n\nWoods was 5 over from No. 16 to No. 4. He bounced back to pick up a birdie on the par-5 fifth, barely missing a 30-footer for eagle.\n\n\"This golf course is all about the greens,\" Woods said. \"The complexes are just so difficult and so severe that, I mean, I think 1-under par is only in fifth [place]. There aren't that many scores that are low.\n\n\"It's hard to get the ball close. In most golf courses you play, you hit shots into where it's feeding off of slopes into flags, whereas collecting. Here everything is repelling. It's just hard to get the ball on top of the shelves.\"\n\nWoods, 48, hasn't broken par in a round in a major since carding a 1-under 69 in the second round of the 2022 PGA Championship at Southern Hills Golf & Country Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma. His 11 straight rounds in majors without breaking par is the longest streak of his career, according to data from ESPN Stats & Information.\n\nWoods has work to do Friday if he's going to avoid missing the cut for the second straight major.

But he also hit far too many wayward iron shots on a course that demands accuracy, and his deft touch around the greens abandoned him more than once on the way to a 4-over 74 in the opening round.\n\nIt was his 12th consecutive round without breaking par in a major, one derailed by five bogeys in a seven-hole stretch.\n\n\"I was somewhat conservative in some of my end points. Then again, I didn't hit the ball very well either,\" explained Woods, who found 12 of 14 fairways in regulation but hit just half the greens. \"It's not where I wanted to be on a lot of holes.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nTo be fair, the famed Donald Ross layout can at times be borderline unfair.\n\nWoods hit several shots that would have produced good birdie chances most anywhere else, but instead they rolled off the wildly contoured greens and came to rest in collection areas. That was the case at the par-3 ninth, his final hole of the day, when his approach appeared to be so safely aboard that he plucked his tee and began heading toward the green.\n\nThat's when a groan began rising from the crowd. Woods looked up to see his ball starting to trickle, pick up speed, and come to rest 30 yards down the fairway. His birdie chance had become a testy pitch-and-putt par save to finish the round.\n\n\"It's hard to get the ball close,\" Woods said. \"In most golf courses you play, you hit shots into where it's feeding off of slopes into flags, where it's collecting. Here, everything is repelling. It's just hard to get the ball on top of the shelves.\n\n\"You know if you miss it short side, it's an auto bogey, or higher.\"\n\nWoods at least avoided the big numbers Thursday, and while his round easily could have been even par or better, it at least kept the three-time U.S. Open champ in the mix to make the cut. That alone was an improvement over his last time out in the PGA Championship at Valhalla, where two triple bogeys during a second-round 77 kept him from playing the weekend.\n\nMore good news: The battered body that has so often betrayed Woods in recent years seemed to be up to the task.\n\nWoods, who missed the last U.S. Open at Pinehurst in 2014 while recovering from the first of four back surgeries, rarely grimaced on his morning march. The relatively flat layout, at least compared to places like Augusta National, helped his cause, as did the weather, which was hot and humid and kept those aching joints from locking up.\n\nHe also benefited from an early tee time, giving him almost 24 hours exactly to recover for Friday's round.\n\n\"I'm hoping I don't get too tight in the car ride back. I can get tight in air conditioning,\" said Woods, who in fact went straight to the driving range after his round, and began working on those inconsistent irons.\n\nHe should have had a suspicion they might be a problem.\n\n\"I was pretty one-dimensional early in the week, which is interesting. I was drawing the ball a lot. Now I'm cutting the ball a lot,\" Woods said, before flashing a wry smile. \"Welcome to golf.\"\n\nWelcome to inconsistency. And that may be the product of infrequency.\n\nWoods had not played a U.S. Open round since Winged Foot in 2020, thanks mostly to all those injuries -- five back surgeries, four knee surgeries and the procedure to piece together a shattered right leg and ankle from his 2021 car crash.\n\n\"I'm physically getting better as the year has gone on. I just haven't been able to play as much because I just don't want to hurt myself pre, then I won't be able to play in the major championships,\" Woods said. \"It's pick your poison, right? Play a lot with the potential of not playing, or not playing and fight being not as sharp.\"\n\nWoods admitted he hopes his body will allow him to begin playing more often.\n\nPlaying this weekend would be a good start.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0 Tags Dcc Wire Lee-national * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "nwitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "nwi.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Ross_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Ross (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winged_Foot_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winged Foot Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Driving range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_National_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augusta National Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iron (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/nwitimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/5a/85a9d510-8e17-5c2e-ae69-4d855a0e0b30/666b4bd65e34b.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

He hasn't been particularly close in the last decade or so, either. Woods has advanced into the weekend on one occasion since 2014, finishing tied for 21st in the 2019 iteration of the competition.\n\nAt this point in Woods' career, the 48-year-old is most focused on making it under the cut line. His return to the event, hosted at Pinehurst in North Carolina, offers him another chance to showcase his dwindling skillset, even if only for fleeting moments.\n\nWoods has some prior history with Pinehurst, having trotted onto the surface 19 years ago and raced to a second-place finish in the 2005 U.S. Open. Still, this is not the same landscape that greeted him all those years ago. Rather, it's a mire -- one that will become all the more challenging once Bermuda grass is placed on its outer reaches.\n\n\"This golf course is going to test every single aspect of your game, especially mentally, and just the mental discipline that it takes to play this particular golf course. It's going to take a lot,\" Woods said on Tuesday, per the Associated Press.\n\nWoods will have his work cut out for him. All those who take the course on Thursday will.\n\nNevertheless, if Woods -- arguably golf's greatest talent -- were to reach the latter stages of this year's tournament, it would represent an incredible result, even if it doesn't pay off in any silverware.\n\nThe Sporting News is tracking live updates from Woods' display at the 2024 U.S. Open.

On the par-4 12th, he made a 10-footer to save par, followed by an 8 \u00bd-footer on the 13th to remain 1 under.\n\nThings fell apart once he reached the par-4 16th. Woods missed the fairway for the first time off the tee, then had to punch out short of the green. He barely missed a 20-footer and made bogey to fall to even par.\n\nOn the par-3 17th, Woods three-putted from 47 \u00bd feet for a bogey. After making the turn at 1 over, Woods three-putted from 38 feet on No. 1. After another bogey on the second and a par on the third, Woods had a spectacular chip out of a greenside bunker, but missed a 4 \u00bd-footer for par for a bogey on No. 4.\n\nWoods was 5 over from No. 16 to No. 4. He bounced back to pick up a birdie on the par-5 fifth, barely missing a 30-footer for eagle.\n\n\"This golf course is all about the greens,\" Woods said. \"The complexes are just so difficult and so severe that, I mean, I think 1-under par is only in fifth [place]. There aren't that many scores that are low.\n\n\"It's hard to get the ball close. In most golf courses you play, you hit shots into where it's feeding off of slopes into flags, whereas collecting. Here everything is repelling. It's just hard to get the ball on top of the shelves.\"\n\nWoods, 48, hasn't broken par in a round in a major since carding a 1-under 69 in the second round of the 2022 PGA Championship at Southern Hills Golf & Country Club in Tulsa, Oklahoma. His 11 straight rounds in majors without breaking par is the longest streak of his career, according to data from ESPN Stats & Information.\n\nWoods is going to have work to do on Friday if he's going to avoid missing the cut for the second straight majors. He knows it won't be easy, given the conditions at Pinehurst No. 2.\n\n\"It can go so far the other way here, the wrong way,\" Woods said. \"It's just so hard to get back. This is a golf course that doesn't give up a whole lot of birdies. It gives up a lot of bogeys and higher. I thought I did the one thing I needed to do today, which is drive the ball well. I did that, I just didn't capitalize on any of it.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iron (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hills_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern Hills Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa,_Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tulsa, Oklahoma"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0613%2Fr1345455_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

But he also hit far too many wayward iron shots on a course that demands accuracy, and his deft touch around the greens abandoned him more than once on the way to a 4-over 74 in the opening round.\n\nIt was his 12th consecutive round without breaking par in a major, one derailed by five bogeys in a seven-hole stretch.\n\n\"I was somewhat conservative in some of my end points. Then again, I didn't hit the ball very well either,\" explained Woods, who found 12 of 14 fairways in regulation but hit just half the greens. \"It's not where I wanted to be on a lot of holes.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nAfter smallest Saturday crowd in decades, Cardinals attendance lows piling up Missouri teacher 'wouldn't recommend' OnlyFans career, says she's a 'total outcast' Kansas City home built by Whitey Herzog is for sale, complete with bat banister Mothers allege Kirkwood Schools withheld yearbook sex survey records St. Louis Public Schools asks teachers to drive buses this fall 2 truths and an underlying question: Revealing trends in Cardinals' riveting loss to Bucs Teen driver gets 4 months in deaths of 3 Lincoln County teens.

Here's why it keeps happening. Renovated Kirkwood home includes rentable outdoor oasis\n\nTo be fair, the famed Donald Ross layout can at times be borderline unfair.\n\nWoods hit several shots that would have produced good birdie chances most anywhere else, but instead they rolled off the wildly contoured greens and came to rest in collection areas. That was the case at the par-3 ninth, his final hole of the day, when his approach appeared to be so safely aboard that he plucked his tee and began heading toward the green.\n\nThat's when a groan began rising from the crowd. Woods looked up to see his ball starting to trickle, pick up speed, and come to rest 30 yards down the fairway. His birdie chance had become a testy pitch-and-putt par save to finish the round.\n\n\"It's hard to get the ball close,\" Woods said. \"In most golf courses you play, you hit shots into where it's feeding off of slopes into flags, where it's collecting. Here, everything is repelling. It's just hard to get the ball on top of the shelves.\n\n\"You know if you miss it short side, it's an auto bogey, or higher.\"\n\nWoods at least avoided the big numbers Thursday, and while his round easily could have been even par or better, it at least kept the three-time U.S. Open champ in the mix to make the cut. That alone was an improvement over his last time out in the PGA Championship at Valhalla, where two triple bogeys during a second-round 77 kept him from playing the weekend.\n\nMore good news: The battered body that has so often betrayed Woods in recent years seemed to be up to the task.\n\nWoods, who missed the last U.S. Open at Pinehurst in 2014 while recovering from the first of four back surgeries, rarely grimaced on his morning march. The relatively flat layout, at least compared to places like Augusta National, helped his cause, as did the weather, which was hot and humid and kept those aching joints from locking up.\n\nHe also benefited from an early tee time, giving him almost 24 hours exactly to recover for Friday's round.\n\n\"I'm hoping I don't get too tight in the car ride back. I can get tight in air conditioning,\" said Woods, who in fact went straight to the driving range after his round, and began working on those inconsistent irons.\n\nHe should have had a suspicion they might be a problem.\n\n\"I was pretty one-dimensional early in the week, which is interesting. I was drawing the ball a lot. Now I'm cutting the ball a lot,\" Woods said, before flashing a wry smile. \"Welcome to golf.\"\n\nWelcome to inconsistency. And that may be the product of infrequency.\n\nWoods had not played a U.S. Open round since Winged Foot in 2020, thanks mostly to all those injuries -- five back surgeries, four knee surgeries and the procedure to piece together a shattered right leg and ankle from his 2021 car crash.\n\n\"I'm physically getting better as the year has gone on. I just haven't been able to play as much because I just don't want to hurt myself pre, then I won't be able to play in the major championships,\" Woods said. \"It's pick your poison, right? Play a lot with the potential of not playing, or not playing and fight being not as sharp.\"\n\nWoods admitted he hopes his body will allow him to begin playing more often.\n\nPlaying this weekend would be a good start.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site

Even so, the way that Woods mastered that hole -- the 10th -- it's understandable to think that maybe there was something to all that \"he's looking good!\" pre-tourney chatter.\n\nUnfortunately for Woods, tournaments are longer than one hole, and it didn't take long for the cracks in Woods' game to appear. Woods' drives were straight, and his putting game oscillated between cringeworthy and special. He struggled with his iron play and his approaches, all too often leaving himself out of position and struggling to hold onto par.\n\n\"I thought I did the one thing I needed to do today, which is drive the ball well,\" Woods said after the round. \"I did that, I just didn't capitalize on any of it.\"\n\nWoods finished the day at 4-over, nine strokes behind the clubhouse lead, carding two birdies against six bogeys.\n\nWoods' card suffered during a seven-hole stretch around the turn where he carded five bogeys, falling far off the pace before a birdie on the 5th, his 14th hole of the day, halted the carnage.\n\nIf there's a salvation for Woods, it's this -- he wasn't alone in struggling to reach and hold Pinehurst's slippery greens. Playing partners Matthew Fitzpatrick (+3) and Will Zalatoris (+5) couldn't get going either. Many current established stars of the game, like Justin Thomas and Sahith Theegala (both +7), finished their days deep in the black numbers.\n\nWoods will have a long time to regroup, heal up and rethink his approach to Pinehurst; his Friday tee time isn't until 1:14 p.m. But Woods won't be able to flatten the greens of Pinehurst in that time, and he won't be able to give himself a few more rounds' worth of reps, either, both of which he could use this week.\n\n\"My speed was not quite there. I think I three-putted, what, two or three times today. If I clean that up, if I get a couple iron shots not as loose as I did, I'm right there at even par,\" Woods said. \"It can go so far the other way here, the wrong way. It's just so hard to get back.

His birdie chance had become a testy pitch-and-putt par save to finish the round.\n\n\"It's hard to get the ball close,\" Woods said. \"In most golf courses you play, you hit shots into where it's feeding off of slopes into flags, where it's collecting. Here, everything is repelling. It's just hard to get the ball on top of the shelves.\n\n\"You know if you miss it short side, it's an auto bogey, or higher.\"\n\nWoods at least avoided the big numbers Thursday, and while his round easily could have been even par or better, it at least kept the three-time U.S. Open champ in the mix to make the cut. That alone was an improvement over his last time out in the PGA Championship at Valhalla, where two triple bogeys during a second-round 77 kept him from playing the weekend.\n\nMore good news: The battered body that has so often betrayed Woods in recent years seemed to be up to the task.\n\nWoods, who missed the last U.S. Open at Pinehurst in 2014 while recovering from the first of four back surgeries, rarely grimaced on his morning march. The relatively flat layout, at least compared to places like Augusta National, helped his cause, as did the weather, which was hot and humid and kept those aching joints from locking up.\n\nHe also benefited from an early tee time, giving him almost 24 hours exactly to recover for Friday's round.\n\n\"I'm hoping I don't get too tight in the car ride back. I can get tight in air conditioning,\" said Woods, who in fact went straight to the driving range after his round, and began working on those inconsistent irons.\n\nHe should have had a suspicion they might be a problem.\n\n\"I was pretty one-dimensional early in the week, which is interesting. I was drawing the ball a lot. Now I'm cutting the ball a lot,\" Woods said, before flashing a wry smile. \"Welcome to golf.\"\n\nWelcome to inconsistency. And that may be the product of infrequency.\n\nWoods had not played a U.S. Open round since Winged Foot in 2020, thanks mostly to all those injuries -- five back surgeries, four knee surgeries and the procedure to piece together a shattered right leg and ankle from his 2021 car crash.\n\n\"I'm physically getting better as the year has gone on. I just haven't been able to play as much because I just don't want to hurt myself pre, then I won't be able to play in the major championships,\" Woods said. \"It's pick your poison, right? Play a lot with the potential of not playing, or not playing and fight being not as sharp.\"\n\nWoods admitted he hopes his body will allow him to begin playing more often.\n\nPlaying this weekend would be a good start.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign

Named in honor of Bobby Jones, the Bob Jones Award is the highest award presented by the United States Golf Association, recognizing remarkable sportsmanship in golf.\n\nTiger Woods is set to compete in another Major, much to the delight of his fans. Although expectations are tempered due to his injuries, the award has brought joy to many, including Woods himself.\n\nThroughout his career, Woods has always strived to remain a true sportsman, respecting others and upholding fair play. Upon receiving the award, Woods particularly highlighted the support of his mother, who has been his greatest supporter throughout his career. He recalled the early days of his career, especially his victory at the US Junior.\n\n\"I look back on those times, those memories, Mom knows this as well as anyone, that I built my whole calendar year around one golf tournament, right, around winning the U.S. Junior,\" -Woods said, as quoted by Golf Monthly.\n\nTiger Woods demonstrated early in his career that he would become a major star and a golfer whose name would be etched in the history of the sport. The 48-year-old golfer won three consecutive US Amateur titles as an 18-year-old. After his junior career, Woods aimed to make a breakthrough in amateur golf, showing everyone that he was a golfer worth paying attention to.\n\nIn a humorous tone, Woods recalled moments when he trained and dreamed of playing on the big stage. He experimented with many things, sometimes worrying his mother, who wasn't always happy with his antics. From today's perspective, his mother can be proud of the man Woods has become. Receiving such an award speaks volumes.\n\n\"Once I had moved past the U.S. Junior days, it was the U.S. Amateur. All I wanted to do was win that one big event,\" Woods said.\n\n\"I would experiment, try different things throughout the year, and Mom knew when I was hitting wiffle balls and rolled-up toilet paper against the mirror and chipping golf balls over furniture, then she always threatened to break something more than the furniture.\"- he continued.\n\nTiger Woods explained that becoming a USGA champion was always his aspiration due to its importance. Over the years, he managed to win several U.S. Opens, eventually matching the legendary Bobby Jones with nine titles.\n\nThe 48-year-old golfer managed to win the US Open on three occasions: in 2000, 2002, and most recently in 2008. It has been 16 years since his last victory, a significant amount of time. The beginnings of Woods' career were not easy, just as they aren't for any golfer. Stepping onto the big stage all of a sudden is no simple task. It requires a period of adjustment, but Woods, even as a young player, knew how to handle it and quickly showed signs that he would become a top golfer. Woods looks back on that period with nostalgia.\n\nWoods reflects on the immense pressure he felt during his early career, particularly in 1996 during his final U.S. Amateur event. This was especially important because his mother, who had never attended any of his junior or amateur tournaments, was present for the first time. Wearing her Stanford shirt at Pumpkin Ridge, her presence added to the pressure Woods felt to win.\n\nThis great golfer reflects on the crucial moment of making the winning putt, stressing the emotional value of hugging his mother first. He acknowledges that while his father accompanied him on the road, his mother was a constant support at home. She has been there for him throughout his entire life, providing support through the toughest times.\n\nWoods accepted the award, happy that his qualities were recognized. However, Woods believes that his mother deserves the most credit for this award, as he wouldn't have reached the top without her. He emphasizes that she was the one who supported his dreams, believed in him, and provided the necessary support when it was most needed. Woods didn't forget to thank his mother, acknowledging that such success wouldn't have been possible without her.\n\n\"This award, I accept it in humbleness and just unbelievable regard for the past recipients, but I also accept it for my mommy, too. She allowed me to get here.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sead_dedovic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Sead Dedovic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Jones_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Jones Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Golf_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Golf Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsmanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sportsmanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Jones_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Jones (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Amateur_Championship_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Amateur Championship (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiffle_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wiffle ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amateur sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amateur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image150079.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6549019607843136, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The 15-time major champion is in North Carolina this week for the 2024 U.S. Open, looking to win for the fourth time at the prestigious event.\n\nThe 2024 season has been a tough go for Woods. He was forced to withdraw from the Genesis Invitational in February, with injuries keeping him out from playing for another two months. Woods performed fairly well at the Masters, making the cut and finishing 60th in the field, but then failed to make it to the weekend at the PGA Championship.\n\nWoods is going to be competing at the U.S. Open for the first time in four years, and he's bringing special company with him. His son, Charlie, is at the tournament alongside the legend, and he has a specific purpose for being there.\n\nHere's more on why Woods has his son with him for the U.S. Open.\n\nMORE: Who will win the U.S. Open? Odds, predictions, more\n\nWoods isn't just bringing his son to North Carolina for leisure. The golf sensation is putting his kin to work on the course.\n\nTiger said that Charlie will be acting as a sort of swing consultant for him while competing at Pinehurst. He said that his son has \"seen me hit more golf balls than anyone,\" and no one will have as much knowledge on his swing as him.\n\n\"It's great for us to be able to share these moments together,\" Woods said. \"As for what his responsibilities are, it's the same. I trust him with my swing and my game. He's seen it more than anybody else in the world. He's seen me hit more golf balls than anyone.\"\n\nCharlie has received a specific credential that allows for instructors, interpreters, or trainers/medical support to be with a player for a tournament. He was seen with Woods for his practice round ahead of Thursday's opening round, playing alongside Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth, and Rickie Fowler on Monday.\n\nThe father-son duo have frequented the golf course before. The two have competed together at four PNC Championships, as the young Woods gears up for a potential future on the PGA Tour.\n\nThis time, the pair are aiming to win a major together, which would be Woods' first since 2019.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Thomas_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Thomas (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickie_Fowler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rickie Fowler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2023-12/tiger%20woods%2C%20charlie%20woods.jpg?itok=32fPTqtk", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Woods hit his next shot onto the green, running it about 12 feet from the hole.\n\nHe then stepped up and sank a left-to-right birdie putt to jump into a tie for the early lead with Seamus Power and amateur golfer Omar Morales.\n\nWoods, who now plays a limited schedule due to injuries to his back, leg and foot, said he expects a test this week from Pinehurst Resort & Country Club's Course No. 2, but expects his body to hold up.\n\n\"I feel like I have the strength to be able to do it,\" Woods told reporters Tuesday at his pre-tournament news conference. \"Its just a matter of doing it.

It's the rest of his game that let him down.\n\nA 4-over-par 74 at Pinehurst No. 2 saw the three-time U.S. Open champion make just two birdies and hit only nine greens in regulation. Too many unforced errors left him having to try and play catch-up on a course that doesn't yield many opportunities.\n\n\"It's not where I wanted to be on a lot of the holes,\" Woods said. \"It just ended up being that far away because I wasn't as sharp as I needed to be.\"\n\nThis has been a common issue for Woods, 48, who is playing just his fourth tournament of the year and only his third round since he made the cut at the Masters, where he shot 82-77 on the weekend.\n\nAt the PGA Championship last month, Woods shot 72-77 to miss the cut.\n\nThe lack of competitive golf has him in a quandary as he noted the balance between doing too much and not enough.\n\nWoods, whose five-year exemption for winning the U.S. Open expired after last year, is in the field on a special exemption given by the United States Golf Association. This is the first time he has played the tournament since 2020.\n\n\"I'm physically getting better as the year has gone on,\" he said. \"I just haven't been able to play as much because I just don't want to hurt myself pre (tournament), then I won't be able to play in the major championships.\n\n\"It's pick your poison, right? Play a lot with the potential of not playing, or not playing and fight being not as sharp.\"\n\nWoods chose the latter and that's where he is coming up short.\n\nDespite hitting 12 of 14 fairways, Woods rarely gave himself good birdie chances.\n\nHe birdied the par-5 10th -- his first hole -- when he hit a nice pitch from a scruffy lie at the 610-yard hole. He also birdied the other par-5, the 5th, after hitting the green in two from 260 yards and two-putting.\n\nBut other than the par-4 15th where he had a 15-footer for birdie that he missed, Woods had few other chances. He was mostly trying to scramble after missing a green or putting from long distance.\n\nHe ranked outside the top 130 in the 156-man field in strokes-gained approach to the green, typically the hallmark of his game.\n\n\"I didn't hit my irons particularly well,\" he said. \"Didn't putt that great. Drove it on a string all day. Unfortunately I just didn't capitalize on it. I was somewhat conservative in some of my end points. Then again, I didn't hit the ball very well, either. It added up to quite a bit of distance away from that flag.\"\n\nWoods said that aspect of his game was a work in progress. He came to Pinehurst for a practice round last week and then played nine holes each day on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.\n\n\"It wasn't as good as I'd like,\" he said. \"I was pretty one-dimensional early in the week, which is interesting. I was drawing the ball a lot. Now I'm cutting the ball a lot. Welcome to golf.\"\n\nAnd that can cause problems at Pinehurst, which presents some very challenging and sloping greens. Woods, who teed off at 7:29 a.m., noted the challenge -- which resulted in a round that took more than 5 and a half hours.\n\n\"This golf course is all about the greens,\" said Woods, who trailed leader Patrick Cantlay by nine shots. Cantlay shot 65, 5 under par. \"The complexes are just so difficult and so severe that, I think 1 under par is only in fifth. There aren't that many scores that are low.\n\n\"It's hard to get the ball close. In most golf courses you play, you hit shots into where it's feeding off of slopes into flags ... collecting. Here everything is repelling. It's just hard to get the ball on top of the shelves.\n\n\"You know if you miss it short side, it's an auto bogey or higher. Being aggressive to a conservative line is I think how you need to play this particular golf course.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Golf_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Golf Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iron (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3394,h_1909,x_0,y_311/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j09enynn8agvstp4c9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Woods described his driving prowess as hitting the ball on a string: He hit 12 of 14 fairways at Pinehurst No. 2.\n\nBut disappointment came when both his irons and putter misbehaved.\n\nRELATED: Complete coverage of the 2024 U.S. Open\n\nWoods hit only 50% of the greens, which means he missed numerous greens from the fairway. He also had 32 putts, ranking him 77th in the field after his round.\n\n\"I was somewhat conservative in some of my end points. Then again, I didn't hit the ball very well either,\" Woods said of his putting issues. \"It added up to quite a bit of distance away from the flag. It's not where I wanted to be on a lot of the holes.

If I clean that up, if I get a couple iron shots not as loose as I did, I'm right there at even par,\" Woods said. \"It can go so far the other way here, the wrong way. It's just so hard to get back.

Yet one bullet point on Woods' lengthy r\u00e9sum\u00e9 stands out: his historically dominant performance at the 2000 U.S. Open.\n\nHeading into the tournament, it had been three decades since the event was decided by more than 3 strokes. It hadn't been decided by double-digit strokes since the 19th century.\n\nAt Pebble Beach in California, Woods won by 15 strokes, a record-shattering margin that no has come close to matching in any major.\n\nHere's a look back at some of the highlights from Woods' 2000 master class.\n\nWoods being in excellent form at Pebble Beach was far from a shock -- he was in the midst of what would become one of the most remarkable stretches of his career. Having just posted a 5-stroke victory at the Memorial Tournament in late May, Woods wasted no time in moving in front of the pack at the U.S. Open.\n\nHe shot 6-under in the first round, good for first. Though Woods led the field, his first-round margins weren't indicative of the historic pace he would reach. Miguel Angel Jim\u00e9nez of Spain trailed by just 1 stroke at the round's conclusion, with John Huston 2 strokes back.\n\nThough Woods was exceptional in just about every aspect of the game that June, his putting in particular wowed onlookers.\n\nDespite subpar weather conditions, Woods would one-putt on 20 of his first 38 greens. He didn't three-putt once during the entire U.S. Open. Spectators and competitors had no choice but to marvel at Woods' precision.\n\n\"He had some Jedi powers; he could pretty much will the ball in the hole,\" said Jesper Parnevik, who played with Woods. \"And sometimes I could swear he did because I would think the ball was going to miss or already had missed, and it would go in sideways. That's some strong-ass, Obi-Wan Kenobi/Jedi stuff going on.\"\n\nAs if to persuade those around him that he was not supplementing his performance with earth-bending mind control powers, Woods did struggle on one hole in the third round.\n\nHis triple bogey on the round's third hole added a 7 to an otherwise exemplary scorecard. It marked the first time in the Masters era that a player won a major championship with a triple bogey on his card.\n\nDespite his third round triple bogey, Woods managed to finish even stronger than he started at Pebble Beach. He finished Round 2 with an already-sizable 6-stroke lead, but left Round 3 ahead by a remarkable 10 strokes. His buffer at the end of the third round was the largest 54-hole lead in U.S. Open history.\n\nBut even Woods' stellar Round 3 paled in comparison to his final round. He fired his way through his last 18 holes, steadily dropping from 8-under par to 12-under. Woods became the first person to finish the competition under par by double digits, expanding his lead on the field even further as he powered his way to the final green.

That was the case at the par-3 ninth, his final hole of the day, when his approach appeared to be so safely aboard that he plucked his tee and began heading toward the green.\n\nThat's when a groan began rising from the crowd. Woods looked up to see his ball starting to trickle, pick up speed, and come to rest 30 yards down the fairway. His birdie chance had become a testy pitch-and-putt par save to finish the round.\n\n\"It's hard to get the ball close,\" Woods said. \"In most golf courses you play, you hit shots into where it's feeding off of slopes into flags, where it's collecting. Here, everything is repelling. It's just hard to get the ball on top of the shelves.\n\n\"You know if you miss it short side, it's an auto bogey, or higher.\"\n\nWoods at least avoided the big numbers Thursday, and while his round easily could have been even par or better, it at least kept the three-time U.S. Open champ in the mix to make the cut. That alone was an improvement over his last time out in the PGA Championship at Valhalla, where two triple bogeys during a second-round 77 kept him from playing the weekend.\n\nMore good news: The battered body that has so often betrayed Woods in recent years seemed to be up to the task.\n\nWoods, who missed the last U.S. Open at Pinehurst in 2014 while recovering from the first of four back surgeries, rarely grimaced on his morning march. The relatively flat layout, at least compared to places like Augusta National, helped his cause, as did the weather, which was hot and humid and kept those aching joints from locking up.\n\nHe also benefited from an early tee time, giving him almost 24 hours exactly to recover for Friday's round.\n\n\"I'm hoping I don't get too tight in the car ride back. I can get tight in air conditioning,\" said Woods, who in fact went straight to the driving range after his round, and began working on those inconsistent irons.\n\nHe should have had a suspicion they might be a problem.\n\n\"I was pretty one-dimensional early in the week, which is interesting. I was drawing the ball a lot. Now I'm cutting the ball a lot,\" Woods said, before flashing a wry smile. \"Welcome to golf.\"\n\nWelcome to inconsistency. And that may be the product of infrequency.\n\nWoods had not played a U.S. Open round since Winged Foot in 2020, thanks mostly to all those injuries -- five back surgeries, four knee surgeries and the procedure to piece together a shattered right leg and ankle from his 2021 car crash.\n\n\"I'm physically getting better as the year has gone on. I just haven't been able to play as much because I just don't want to hurt myself pre, then I won't be able to play in the major championships,\" Woods said. \"It's pick your poison, right? Play a lot with the potential of not playing, or not playing and fight being not as sharp.\"\n\nWoods admitted he hopes his body will allow him to begin playing more often.\n\nPlaying this weekend would be a good start.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and

More remarkable, his nine victories in USGA championships is a record he shares with Jones.\n\nWoods, now 48, competed in his first US Junior Amateur when he was 14 and went on to claim three in a row from 1991.\n\nBut none if it would have been possible without the support of his mother. A mother who never sought the spotlight but who was a constant rock in the early life of a future megastar.\n\n\"I look back on those times, those memories, Mom knows this as well as anyone, that I built my whole calendar year around one golf tournament, right, around winning the U.S. Junior,\" Woods said.\n\nAt 18, Woods then won the first of three US Amateur titles in 1994. He would then defend in 1995 and then again in 1996, becoming the only player in history to do the three-peat.\n\n\"Once I had moved past the U.S. Junior days, it was the U.S. Amateur. All I wanted to do was win that one big event,\" Woods added.\n\n\"I would experiment, try different things throughout the year, and Mom knew when I was hitting wiffle balls and rolled-up toilet paper against the mirror and chipping golf balls over furniture, then she always threatened to break something more than the furniture.\n\n\"These are things that I had aspired to be. I had aspired to be a USGA champion because of what that meant, and through the years I've been able to win a few more U.S. Opens and to be able to tie the great Bobby Jones in that number, being nine.\"\n\nHis maiden US Open arrived in peerless fashion as he dominated Pebble Beach and his competitors to win by 15 shots. A second followed in 2002 and six years later he displayed all the grit and determination instilled in him by his mother to defy a broken leg to win at Torrey Pines.\n\nIt's been a remarkable 34 years (and counting) of USGA tournament golf. And while a lot has changed in Woods' life during that time, the one constant throughout has been his mother.\n\n\"I look back at the stopwatch that started back in 1990, and especially in '96, because there's no other time that I had ever felt so much pressure to win one event as the last U.S. Amateur that I was ever going to play in, and the reason is Mom never came to any of my Juniors,\" he continued.\n\n\"Mom never came to one of my Amateurs. She was wearing her Stanford shirt there at Pumpkin Ridge, and she was there for the first time.\n\n\"Now imagine if I had lost the damn thing, right? But when I made that winning putt, who was the first person that I hugged. Right, Mommy? It was you. My mom doesn't get enough credit.\n\n\"Everyone thought that it was my dad when I went on the road, which it was, but Mom was at home. If you don't know, Mom has been there my entire life. She's always been there through thick and thin.\n\n\"This award, I accept it in humbleness and just unbelievable regard for the past recipients, but I also accept it for my mommy, too. She allowed me to get here.\n\n\"She allowed me to do these things, chase my dreams, and the support and love -- I didn't do this alone. I had the greatest rock that any child could possibly have, my mom.

That was the case at the par-3 ninth, his final hole of the day, when his approach appeared to be so safely aboard that he plucked his tee and began heading toward the green.\n\nThat's when a groan began rising from the crowd. Woods looked up to see his ball starting to trickle, pick up speed, and come to rest 30 yards down the fairway. His birdie chance had become a testy pitch-and-putt par save to finish the round.\n\n\"It's hard to get the ball close,\" Woods said. \"In most golf courses you play, you hit shots into where it's feeding off of slopes into flags, where it's collecting. Here, everything is repelling. It's just hard to get the ball on top of the shelves.\n\n\"You know if you miss it short side, it's an auto bogey, or higher.\"\n\nWoods at least avoided the big numbers Thursday, and while his round easily could have been even par or better, it at least kept the three-time U.S. Open champ in the mix to make the cut. That alone was an improvement over his last time out in the PGA Championship at Valhalla, where two triple bogeys during a second-round 77 kept him from playing the weekend.\n\nMore good news: The battered body that has so often betrayed Woods in recent years seemed to be up to the task.\n\nWoods, who missed the last U.S. Open at Pinehurst in 2014 while recovering from the first of four back surgeries, rarely grimaced on his morning march. The relatively flat layout, at least compared to places like Augusta National, helped his cause, as did the weather, which was hot and humid and kept those aching joints from locking up.\n\nHe also benefited from an early tee time, giving him almost 24 hours exactly to recover for Friday's round.\n\n\"I'm hoping I don't get too tight in the car ride back. I can get tight in air conditioning,\" said Woods, who in fact went straight to the driving range after his round, and began working on those inconsistent irons.\n\nHe should have had a suspicion they might be a problem.\n\n\"I was pretty one-dimensional early in the week, which is interesting. I was drawing the ball a lot. Now I'm cutting the ball a lot,\" Woods said, before flashing a wry smile. \"Welcome to golf.\"\n\nWelcome to inconsistency. And that may be the product of infrequency.\n\nWoods had not played a U.S. Open round since Winged Foot in 2020, thanks mostly to all those injuries -- five back surgeries, four knee surgeries and the procedure to piece together a shattered right leg and ankle from his 2021 car crash.\n\n\"I'm physically getting better as the year has gone on. I just haven't been able to play as much because I just don't want to hurt myself pre, then I won't be able to play in the major championships,\" Woods said. \"It's pick your poison, right? Play a lot with the potential of not playing, or not playing and fight being not as sharp.\"\n\nWoods admitted he hopes his body will allow him to begin playing more often.\n\nPlaying this weekend would be a good start.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and

He has yet to record a hole-in-one, but he did secure an M.A. in Sports Journalism from St. Bonaventure University.\n\nTiger Woods got off to a roaring start on Thursday at Pinehurst No. 2, making birdie to begin the championship at the par-5 10th. He briefly held a share of the lead.\n\nSome clutch par putts followed at the 12th and 13th holes, but then the train began to veer off the tracks at the challenging par-4 16th.\n\nFour bogies over the next five holes followed, and suddenly, Woods went from 1-under to 3-over at the drop of the dime. He ultimately carded a 4-over 74.\n\nThe 15-time major winner blamed it on his poor ball striking and putting afterward.\n\n\"I didn't hit my irons particularly well. Didn't putt that great,\" Woods assessed.\n\n\"Drove it on the string all day. Unfortunately, I just didn't capitalize on it.\"\n\nWoods hit 12 of 14 fairways but only nine greens in regulation. He lost more than two strokes on approach, as he missed plenty of irons to the right. But he did not try to play aggressively and attack flag sticks, which is a necessity for success at Pinehurst No. 2.\n\n\"I was somewhat conservative in some of my endpoints,\" Woods said.\n\n\"Then again, I didn't hit the ball very well either. It added up to quite a bit of distance away from the flag. It's not where I wanted to be on a lot of the holes. It just ended up being that far away because I wasn't as sharp as I needed to be.\"\n\nBecause Woods left himself plenty of real estate between his ball and the hole, he three-putted on a few occasions -- an easy way to drop strokes.\n\n\"This golf course is all about the greens. The complexes are just so difficult and so severe that, I think 1-under par is only in fifth [right now]. There aren't that many scores that are low. It's hard to get the ball close,\" Woods explained.\n\n\"In most golf courses you play, you hit shots into where it's feeding off of slopes into flags, whereas collecting. Here everything is repelling. It's just hard to get the ball on top of the shelves. If you miss it short side, it's an auto bogey or higher. Being aggressive to a conservative line is I think how you need to play this particular golf course.\"\n\nWoods did get cheeky on the dogleg right par-4 7th but wound up short-siding himself into the greenside bunker. He then hit his third shot 18 feet past the hole, as another bogey stared him right in the face. But he drained the comebacker to save par.\n\nYet, he dropped another shot on the challenging par-4 8th, his 17th hole of the day.\n\nAs for how he feels after the round, Woods says he is getting better.\n\n\"I'm physically getting better as the year has gone on,\" Woods said.\n\n\"I just haven't been able to play as much because I just don't want to hurt myself, then I won't be able to play in the major championships. It's pick your poison, right? Play a lot with the potential of not playing, or not playing, and fight being not as sharp.\"\n\nHe now has 24 hours to get ready for his second round, which will begin at 1:14 p.m. ET on Friday. But instead of heading to the recovery room, Woods said that he would like to go to the putting green to work on some things. Perhaps his son Charlie can lend a helping hand.\n\n\"I'd like to hit a few putts. My speed was not quite there,\" Woods said.\n\n\"If I clean that up, if I get a couple of iron shots not as loose as I did, I'm right there at even par. It can go so far the other way here, the wrong way. It's just so hard to get back. This is a golf course that doesn't give up a whole lot of birdies. It gives up a lot of bogeys and higher.\"\n\nIf he can clean up those mistakes, Woods will play the weekend. But if he fails to figure out the pace of Pinehurst's famed 'Turtleback Greens,' Woods will miss the cut, just as he did in his last U.S. Open appearance at Winged Foot in 2020.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_milko@sbnation.com", "name": "Jack Milko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iron (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bonaventure_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Bonaventure University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_in_one", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hole in one"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winged_Foot_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winged Foot Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iron"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TM1zMWvKj-KntAg32wkLGpME3TY=/0x298:1512x1054/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25490214/2157465694.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Carding a 4-over 74 to open play at Pinehurst No. 2, Woods was unable to parlay his early momentum into a round to remember as inconsistencies throughout the bag hampered a strong start.\n\nAlongside Will Zalatoris and Matt Fitzpatrick, Woods made birdie on his opening hole, the par-5 10th, to immediately jump into red figures. He remained there for most of his opening nine as the 15-time major champion leaned heavily on the flat stick. After an 11-foot conversion on the 10th, Woods knocked in par saves from similar distances on Nos. 12-13.\n\nA missed opportunity came on the short par-4 14th when Woods' birdie bid from 11 feet failed to threaten the hole. It would be his last scoring chance for some time as he soon began to take on water. Tiger's first missed fairway on No. 16 led to his first dropped shot, and when his second putt on the par-3 17th fell by the wayside, Woods put his second square on the scorecard.\n\nMaking the turn on the par 70 in 36, Woods remained within earshot of the lead. It did not last for long as the 48-year-old's putter betrayed him on the front nine. A 3-putt bogey on No. 1 was followed by short par misses on Nos. 2 and 4. Over the course of a seven-hole stretch, Woods carded five bogeys and drifted as high as 4 over for the championship.\n\nAs he has done in this newest chapter of his career, Woods continued to hang tough as the putter became an ally again. A birdie on the par-5 5th came courtesy of a towering 4 iron from the middle of the fairway and preceded ticklish par saves from 8 feet on the difficult par-3 6th and from 17 feet on No. 7.\n\nThe pressure on the putter cost Woods one last shot on the par-4 8th as his iron play continued to disappoint. Hitting 12 of 14 fairways and holing enough putts to post a solid score, Woods gave himself just one birdie chance across the par 4s and hit a total of 10 greens in regulation. He bogeyed six of his last 12 holes overall.\n\nIf Tiger is to claw his way back into this tournament and earn himself a weekend tee time, he will need his irons, in particular, to start cooperating. Playing conservatively and to the fat side of greens often, Woods employed a tactical approach around Pinehurst No. 2, but those tactics now require better approach shots if he is to see the second half of this championship.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_mcdonald@cbssports.com", "name": "Patrick McDonald", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Fitzpatrick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Zalatoris", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Zalatoris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iron (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Furniture", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Furniture", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/06/13/ae70baad-f3f7-4937-94c4-e8bb93e8d3ca/thumbnail/1200x675/21ef597762929d8fe4c0dfff0f7f2d08/getty-tiger-woods-us-open-thursday-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

With the participation of the planet's strongest golfer and 48 of the top 50 players worldwide, along with three Italian representatives and the return of Tiger Woods, fans have no excuse to miss out on the tournament.\n\nThis year marks the one-thousandth event organized by the USGA, the most influential golf association in the United States. However, the most intriguing stories go beyond mere numbers. Scottie Scheffler, who has amassed five victories and $24 million in the preceding three months, is considered one of the absolute favorites, with record-breaking odds for a golfer since 2009.\n\nNot only does Scheffler draw attention, but also the return of Matteo Manassero, who after an eight-year absence from Major tournaments, joins the Molinari brothers for a nostalgic and unique experience. Tiger Woods' return after four years away from the US Open adds an extra allure to the event.\n\nAwarded the prestigious \"Bob Jones Award,\" Woods is ready to challenge the best, despite the time elapsed since his last triumph in this tournament. The Arabian Super League makes its appearance with twelve players, including some past winners like DeChambeau, Koepka, Johnson, and Kaymer.\n\nHowever, Jon Rahm, last year's winner, will be absent due to a foot injury. Lastly, Adam Scott will participate in his 92nd consecutive Major, showcasing his consistency and commitment in the world of golf. Tiger Woods, born Eldrick Tont Woods on December 30, 1975, in Cypress, California, is one of the most iconic and successful professional golfers in history.\n\nHe is renowned for his exceptional talent, dominance on the golf course, and profound impact on the sport. Woods began playing golf at a very young age, displaying remarkable skill and determination from the outset. He quickly rose through the ranks of junior and amateur golf, capturing numerous titles and gaining widespread attention for his prodigious abilities.\n\nIn 1997, Woods turned professional at the age of 21 and immediately made waves in the golfing world. His breakthrough victory at the Masters Tournament that year, where he won by a record margin of 12 strokes, marked the beginning of a historic career.\n\nOver the following years, Woods continued to dominate professional golf, winning a staggering number of tournaments, including 15 major championships. His major victories include multiple Masters titles, multiple U.S. Open titles, multiple Open Championships, and multiple PGA Championships.\n\nHe holds numerous records in golf, including the lowest career scoring average and the most consecutive weeks ranked as the world's number one golfer. Woods' impact extends beyond his on-course achievements. He revolutionized the game with his athleticism, power, and mental toughness, inspiring a new generation of golfers.\n\nHis influence on popular culture and sports marketing is also immense, making him one of the most recognizable and marketable athletes of all time. Throughout his career, Woods has faced personal and professional challenges, including injuries and off-course controversies.\n\nHowever, his resilience and determination have enabled him to overcome adversity and continue competing at the highest level. Off the course, Woods is involved in various philanthropic endeavors, including the Tiger Woods Foundation, which focuses on empowering underserved youth through education and mentorship programs.\n\nTiger Woods' impact on golf and sports as a whole is undeniable, cementing his legacy as one of the greatest athletes of all time.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrea_gussoni@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Andrea Gussoni", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matteo_Manassero", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matteo Manassero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Golf_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Golf Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Jones_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob Jones Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Scott_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Scott (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amateur sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_golfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional golfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypress,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cypress, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cypress, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image150051.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Even so, the way that Woods mastered that hole -- the 10th -- it's understandable to think that maybe there was something to all that \"he's looking good!\" pre-tourney chatter.\n\nUnfortunately for Woods, tournaments are longer than one hole, and it didn't take long for the cracks in Woods' game to appear. Woods' drives were straight, and his putting game oscillated between cringeworthy and special. He struggled with his iron play and his approaches, all too often leaving himself out of position and struggling to hold onto par.\n\nWoods finished the day at +4, eight strokes behind the leaders, carding two birdies against six bogeys.\n\nWoods' card suffered during a seven-hole stretch around the turn where he carded five bogeys, falling far off the pace before a birdie on the 5th, his 14th hole of the day, halted the carnage.\n\nIf there's a salvation for Woods, it's this -- he wasn't alone in struggling to reach and hold Pinehurst's slippery greens. Playing partners Matthew Fitzpatrick (+3) and Will Zalatoris (+5) couldn't get going either. Many current established stars of the game, like Justin Thomas and Sahith Theegala, finished their days deep in the black numbers.\n\nWoods will have a long time to regroup, heal up and rethink his approach to Pinehurst; his Friday tee time isn't until 1:14 p.m. But Woods won't be able to flatten the greens of Pinehurst in that time, and he won't be able to give himself a few more rounds' worth of reps, either, both of which he could use this week.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Thomas_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Thomas (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Fitzpatrick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Zalatoris", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Zalatoris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahith_Theegala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sahith Theegala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Furniture", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Furniture", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Guides", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UsSPAWRbcQojSApkEhFYEQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-06/9e9a5cb0-299f-11ef-b9ab-cf794402e0af", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

N.C. -- Tiger Woods brings heat. He's 48, decades past his playing prime, but he still packs heat. He doesn't do casual, and neither does the USGA, which picked up the tab for his dinner Tuesday night, for Tiger and his mother, for his two kids. He got the Bob Jones Award and it comes with dinner.\n\nAt the core of Tiger's golfing life is his USGA record. His three U.S. Junior victories, followed by three U.S. Amateurs, followed by three U.S. Opens. Nine USGA titles. Nobody has more. Bobby Jones has nine, too.\n\nPhil Knight got out his Nike checkbook because of those first six wins, plus Tiger's life story. His brilliant, profane, crazy-like-a-fox father, with his degrees from Kansas State (sociology) and Vietnam (Bronze Star). His Thai mother, who wasn't going to junior tournaments to sip tea with the other moms. Tiger's two years at Stanford, his inherent shyness, his explosive fist pumps. He was brown man in a white game with a body he stole from Gumby. Good lord it was exciting.\n\nThe ink was still wet on that Swooshed check when Tiger started winning PGA Tour events. His scoreboard totals are 82 PGA Tour wins, 15 of them majors. There's not enough money in the world to make Woods go to LIV. That's why not one of Mark Steinberg's clients is a LIV golfer. Mark Steinberg owes his career to Tiger Woods. Tiger Woods owes his professional career to the PGA Tour, and his training for it came by way of a lot of things, including, at its core, the USGA.\n\nTiger could get to 10. He could still get to 10 USGA titles. He's 48 and his body has been ravaged by extreme weightlifting, extreme practicing, extreme living and an inexplicable car crash three years ago that could have killed him. But his golf skill is still remarkable and so is his will. He could get to 10.\n\nTiger will be 50 when the U.S. Senior Open goes to the Scioto Country Club in Columbus in 2026. Scioto is where Jack Nicklaus learned the game. Big Jack won two U.S. Senior Opens. No sport does generation to generation like golf. Woods's main competition has always been against Jack Nicklaus. Tiger will be tanned, rested and ready for that '26 Senior Open. You can book that. Nicklaus will be 86, and he'll still have that boyish Buckeye voice, and he'll say some version of this and mean it: \"I've said it a million times: Never bet against Tiger Woods.\" Jack Nicklaus's final U.S. Open was at Pebble Beach in 2000 when he was 60 but all these years later he remains the most important voice in golf. He's still mad about the golf ball.\n\nStealing here, because this is as good as it gets:\n\nDo not go gentle into that good night,\n\nOld age should burn and rave at close of day;\n\nRage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\nDylan Thomas was born in Wales, died in New York City at age 39, and wrote words with a shelf life of forever. You can draw a line from Dylan Thomas to Bob Dylan to Bruce Springsteen, if you feel like it.\n\nSo fast so shiny so sharp.\n\nWhen Jack made his U.S. Open farewell, Tiger Woods won, by 15 shots. The 2000 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach. Golf cannot be played at a higher level. If you still have your pencil out, you can draw a straight line from Bobby Jones to Jack Nicklaus to Tiger Woods. It says here that there will not be another Tiger Woods as there will not be another Bruce Springsteen. Tiger has Boss in his email address.\n\nDo you think anyone cares how much money Woods earned for winning that U.S. Open at Pebble? When he endorsed the check this word (you could imagine) was already stamped on it: Immortality. The costs of that win we cannot know, though we have all seen Tiger's life unfold. (Imagine having a camera pointed at you pretty much all the time.) But those four days at Pebble will live forever, to those of us who care about such things.\n\nTuesday night, in the Grand Ballroom at the Carolina Hotel, Woods received the USGA's highest honor, the Bob Jones Award. Not the Bobby Jones Award. Not the Jones Award. The Bob Jones Award. Golf, as Tiger Woods played it and as the USGA administers it, requires precision. Mike Tirico and Mike Whan talked about Tiger's nine USGA titles, noting that Jones had nine, too. \"Mr. Jones,\" as Woods referred to the great amateur at a Tuesday-morning press conference. Rickie Fowler was Rick in that same session. Donald Ross was Donald.\n\nBut Bobby Jones was \"Mr. Jones.\" He invented the Masters, golf in the South, the USGA record book. You drive in to Pinehurst on Highway 1, aka Jefferson Davis Highway. Do you think that detail was lost on Earl Woods? Impossible. He and Tiger came here in 1991, to play in a junior event called the Big I. Woods has been here a bunch since then, and Pinehurst has changed since then. Now the USGA and the World Golf Hall of Fame are in Pinehurst. You can play golf around here, this time of year, until 9 o'clock or later, in a long sunset.\n\nTuesday night, at the Carolina Hotel here, Woods stood at a podium, before a microphone, and talked without notes for about six minutes. It brought to mind his Hall of Fame induction two years ago, and his acceptance of the Presidential Medal of Freedom at the White House, a couple weeks after winning the 2019 Masters. He talked about his father, his daughter, his son, but most especially his mother. It was brief. He returned to his banquet-table seat to a standing ovation backed by a snippet of electropop called \"Don't Stop.\"\n\nIt stops. Eventually, for all of us, it all stops. Ben Hogan and Mickey Wright had their way of saying goodbye to their public golf. Sam Snead and Tom Watson had another. Arnold Palmer had another. Nicklaus. With the stature that comes from winning a record 18 majors and leading the life he has led, won his first major at age 22 and gets in front or a microphone at the Masters and at the Memorial, and Fred Ridley and Mike Whan and Jay Monahan have him on speed dial.\n\nListening to Tiger, and watching him with his son Charlie, you get the feeling that he would happily forgo a 10th USGA title if his son could contend in a USGA amateur event. Just contend! Because that alone is an accomplishment. When Woods was young and brash and callow, he used to talk all the time about \"getting the W.\" That was a lifetime ago. Or a different life for him, anyway.\n\nTiger's work in educational philanthropy is extraordinary. He could write a truthful book called Back or What It Takes or whatever, about the costs of greatness and leading such an exposed life, but it would be hard for him. Why he hasn't committed to being the next Ryder Cup captain is bizarre. How he really feels about the biggest issues facing the game is essentially unknown. He can find a meaningful path in the game, from here on out, that goes way beyond medal scores over 72 holes. In the meantime, we know this. He grew up in a small house in Southern California. Golf got him out of the house and into the world and to a riser Tuesday night in a Pinehurst ballroom.\n\n\"I aspired to be a USGA champion,\" Tiger said Tuesday night. He talked about his third and last U.S. Amateur win, the one at Pumpkin Ridge, in 1996, over Steve Scott. As good as golf gets. Tiger said he never felt more pressure. His future -- the size of the Nike check, the possibility of returning to Stanford -- rested on that outcome. Maybe a 20-year-old golfer shouldn't be under so much pressure, but as Tiger would say himself, It is what it is, or what it was. His mother was at that Amateur, the first one she had attended. She was wearing a Stanford sweatshirt in the cool of a late-summer Oregon afternoon. Tuesday night, she was wearing a black polka-dot gown, a silver-and-diamond necklace, tinted glasses with gold frames loaded with filigree.\n\n\"Mom has been there my entire life, she has been, through thick and thin,\" Woods said. \"This award, I accept it in humbleness, and just unbelievable regard for the past recipients. But I also accept it for mommy, too. She allowed me to get here, to chase my dreams.\"\n\nSon finished. Mother stood. The glasses, the gown, the necklace. The pride.", "source": {"uri": "golf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Golf_Association", "type": "wiki",

But he also hit far too many wayward iron shots on a course that demands accuracy, and his deft touch around the greens abandoned him more than once on the way to a 4-over 74 in the opening round.\n\nIt was his 12th consecutive round without breaking par in a major, one derailed by five bogeys in a seven-hole stretch.\n\n\"I was somewhat conservative in some of my end points. Then again, I didn't hit the ball very well either,\" explained Woods, who found 12 of 14 fairways in regulation but hit just half the greens. \"It's not where I wanted to be on a lot of holes.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

That was the case at the par-3 ninth, his final hole of the day, when his approach appeared to be so safely aboard that he plucked his tee and began heading toward the green.\n\nThat's when a groan began rising from the crowd. Woods looked up to see his ball starting to trickle, pick up speed, and come to rest 30 yards down the fairway. His birdie chance had become a testy pitch-and-putt par save to finish the round.\n\n\"It's hard to get the ball close,\" Woods said. \"In most golf courses you play, you hit shots into where it's feeding off of slopes into flags, where it's collecting. Here, everything is repelling. It's just hard to get the ball on top of the shelves.\n\n\"You know if you miss it short side, it's an auto bogey, or higher.\"\n\nWoods at least avoided the big numbers Thursday, and while his round easily could have been even par or better, it at least kept the three-time U.S. Open champ in the mix to make the cut. That alone was an improvement over his last time out in the PGA Championship at Valhalla, where two triple bogeys during a second-round 77 kept him from playing the weekend.\n\nMore good news: The battered body that has so often betrayed Woods in recent years seemed to be up to the task.\n\nWoods, who missed the last U.S. Open at Pinehurst in 2014 while recovering from the first of four back surgeries, rarely grimaced on his morning march. The relatively flat layout, at least compared to places like Augusta National, helped his cause, as did the weather, which was hot and humid and kept those aching joints from locking up.\n\nHe also benefited from an early tee time, giving him almost 24 hours exactly to recover for Friday's round.\n\n\"I'm hoping I don't get too tight in the car ride back. I can get tight in air conditioning,\" said Woods, who in fact went straight to the driving range after his round, and began working on those inconsistent irons.\n\nHe should have had a suspicion they might be a problem.\n\n\"I was pretty one-dimensional early in the week, which is interesting. I was drawing the ball a lot. Now I'm cutting the ball a lot,\" Woods said, before flashing a wry smile. \"Welcome to golf.\"\n\nWelcome to inconsistency. And that may be the product of infrequency.\n\nWoods had not played a U.S. Open round since Winged Foot in 2020, thanks mostly to all those injuries -- five back surgeries, four knee surgeries and the procedure to piece together a shattered right leg and ankle from his 2021 car crash.\n\n\"I'm physically getting better as the year has gone on. I just haven't been able to play as much because I just don't want to hurt myself pre, then I won't be able to play in the major championships,\" Woods said. \"It's pick your poison, right? Play a lot with the potential of not playing, or not playing and fight being not as sharp.\"\n\nWoods admitted he hopes his body will allow him to begin playing more often.\n\nPlaying this weekend would be a good start.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that

He stands as one of the most accomplished - as well as prolific - professional golfers in the world, having won 15 major championships in his near 30-year career.\n\nEven now, he is tied for the most wins on the PGA Tour and has the second-most major wins of any golfer in the history of the sport.\n\nComing into 2024, Woods is still chasing another major championship to add to his repertoire. Five years have passed since his latest major win at the 2019 Masters. His last win at the US Open came in 2008, and served as the start of his major drought that lasted for over a decade.\n\nEven though 16 years have come and gone since Woods claimed his latest US Open title at Torrey Pines, Woods is in the hunt to break that spell. As such, his performance is bound to be watched closely by any and all followers of the event through Thursday and, should the winds blow his way, into the weekend.\n\nTEE TIMES: US Open tee times, including Tiger Woods and Scottie Scheffler, for Thursday and Friday at Pinehurst No. 2\n\nU.S. Open payout, purse: What to know about prize money at Pinehurst No. 2\n\nHere's an up-to-date look at Woods and his performance thus far at the 2024 US Open:\n\nWoods' score on each hole is listed below, and his under par score for the round is listed in parentheses. Woods is starting on Hole No. 10 on Thursday.\n\nWoods is scheduled to tee off at 7:29 a.m. ET for Thursday's first round, and he will tee off at 1:14 p.m. on Friday for the second round.\n\nHe is grouped with Will Zalatoris and Matt Fitzpatrick for the first and second rounds of the US Open, and the trio will be one of the featured groups for television coverage during the first two rounds.\n\nUSA and NBC will carry broadcasts of the event, with USA covering the first round and NBC hosting the second, third and final rounds.\n\nFans can watch Woods' Thursday round on USA Network. You can can stream the golf by using your TV provider credentials or on Fubo, which carries USA Today and the NBC family of networks and offers a free trial to users.\n\nFeatured groups can also be streamed live at the US Open's website. Peacock will also host streaming of the first and second rounds.\n\nHere is the complete US Open TV schedule on a day-to-day basis:\n\nWoods has won 15 major championships throughout his career, and three of those wins have come at the US Open. His wins came in 2000, 2002 and 2008. His win on 2008 earned him the distinction of having won each major championship three times, a feat only matched by Jack Nicklaus.\n\nThis year will mark Woods' 23rd appearance in the US Open in 30 years. His first appearance came in 1995, when he withdrew during the second round due to a wrist injury. He steadily climbed the leaderboard over the next four appearances, culminating in a tie with Vijay Singh for third place at the 1999 US Open after finishing 1-over par.\n\nWoods earned his first of three first-place finishes in 2000, shooting a 12-under par 272 to claim his third ever major win. To this day, his 15-stroke margin of victory over runners-up Miguel Angel Jimenez and Ernie Els remains the largest in US Open history and made him the first player to finish the major at double digits under par.\n\nHe went on to win the US Open again in 2002 with a 3-under 277 at Bethpage Black Course, which marked the second time he was the only player under par in that year's US Open. His third and latest win at the US Open came in 2008, when he defeated Rocco Mediate on the first hole of sudden death, following an 18-hole playoff. Since then, his highest placement has been a tie for fourth in 2010, and Woods has not appeared in a US Open since 2020.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrey_Pines_Golf_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torrey Pines Golf Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_golfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional golfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Fitzpatrick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Zalatoris", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Zalatoris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_death_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sudden death (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Els", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ernie Els"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocco_Mediate", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocco Mediate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijay_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vijay Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_\u00c1ngel_Jim\u00e9nez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miguel \u00c1ngel Jim\u00e9nez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicklaus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Nicklaus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Conferences", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

He hit just nine greens in regulation and was near the bottom of the field in strokes gained: approach when he finished his round of 4-over 74 at the U.S. Open.\n\n\"I didn't hit the ball very well,\" Wood said. \"It added up to quite a bit of distance away from the flag. It's not where I wanted to be on a lot of the holes. It just ended up being that far away because I wasn't as sharp as I needed to be.\"\n\nThat's been a familiar theme for Woods, who made the cut at the Masters but tumbled down the leaderboard after a third-round 82 that left him last among those who played all four rounds. He didn't even see the weekend at the PGA Championship, where his rounds of 72-77 left him in a tie for 133.\n\nIt has led to the question: If he continues to remark about his rustiness, why doesn't Woods just play more?\n\nWoods said he's improving physically as the year has gone on. \"I just haven't been able to play as much because I just don't want to hurt myself pre(-tournament); then I won't be able to play in the major championships,\" he said.\n\n\"So, it's pick your poison, right? Play a lot with the potential of not playing. Or not playing and fight being not as sharp.\"\n\nIn his limited action this year, Woods has hit just 50% of his greens (which has long been the hallmark of his game) while scrambling at just a 50% rate. He often can't push too hard the week of the tournament, either, lest he wear himself out before the first tee shot is even struck. After a scouting trip to Pinehurst last week, he played nine holes each on Monday and Tuesday before opting just to practice on Wednesday.\n\nAfter an untidy opening round that will leave him scrambling to make the cut again, Woods said he was hoping to be able to practice after lunch - unless his back tightens up in the air-conditioned shuttle ride back to the clubhouse.\n\n\"This is a golf course that doesn't give up a whole lot of birdies; it gives up a lot of bogeys and higher,\" he said. \"I thought I did the one thing I needed to do today, which is drive the ball well.

Play a lot with the potential of not playing, or not playing and fight being not as sharp.\"\n\nBeginning on the back nine alongside Will Zalatoris and 2022 US Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick, Woods got off to the perfect start when he rolled in from 12 feet at the par-five tenth and then two-putted from distance to save par at the next.\n\nHe remained bogey free when he holed from 10 feet at the 12th and scrambled another par from a similar distance at the next, then missed a birdie chance from 10 feet at the 14th that could have moved him into a share of the lead.\n\nWoods was part of a logjam tied at the top after a par at the 15th but saw his bogey run start when he had to pitch out of the rough following a wayward drive at the 16th, and he then three-putted from long range at the par-three 17th.\n\nThe turn was reached in 36, the same total Woods recorded during the opening rounds of both previous US Opens at Pinehurst, only for him to lose further ground with a three-putt at the first and a failure to get up-and-down from off the green at the next.\n\nThings worsened when he missed from inside five feet to save par at the fourth, having produced a miraculous recovery from the rough, although he bounced back to two-putt from 30 feet at the par-five next to card a first birdie since the opening hole.\n\nWoods holed from nine feet to save par at the sixth and offered a big fist pump after rolling in from 15 feet to avoid dropping a shot at the par-four next, but he bogeyed the eighth and signed off a frustrating day by scrambling a par on his final hole.\n\n\"My speed was not quite there,\" Woods added. \"I think I three-putted - what? - two or three times today.

The former world No. 1 needed a special exemption from the USGA to feature after failing to automatically qualify for a major for the first time in his professional career.\n\nAccording to an onwatching U.S. Open official, who admitted he was 'more of a Phil Mickelson' fan, Woods appeared locked in and fully focused on the task ahead as he struck balls on the range.

Woods, whose presence commanded fanatical cheers throughout Pinehurst, has missed the U.S. Open the previous three years due to injury, with his' limited schedule in recent seasons deeply affecting his remarkable ambitious hopes of still being able to contend in majors.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .\n\nLast month, Woods missed the cut at the PGA Championship which was won by Xander Schauffele. Woods cited a lack of tournament preparation for the mistakes that led to him missing the cut at Valhalla, which followed his admirable effort at Augusta where the five-time Masters champion made the cut against all odds. He went on to finish last of those who finished the weekend.\n\nWoods has struggled with fitness for over a decade now, and he has completed all 72 holes of a tournament just three times since November 2020.

He has yet to record a hole-in-one, but he did secure an M.A. in Sports Journalism from St. Bonaventure University.\n\nSince 2011, Tiger Woods has played in only six U.S. Opens, making the cut just three times. He last teed it up in America's national championship four years ago, when he failed to make the weekend at Winged Foot during the pandemic.\n\nFive months later, he was in a motor vehicle accident in South California, which almost led to the amputation of his leg. He also sustained traumatic injuries, including a shattered ankle and compound fractures in his leg. That made many wonder if he could walk again, let alone play golf.\n\nBut in true Tiger fashion, he battled back after this accident. He inexplicably made the cut at Augusta National 14 months later and did so again in 2024.\n\nYet, he has struggled to complete 72 holes in multiple majors, as he had to withdraw from the 2022 PGA and 2023 Masters. He also missed the cut at the 2022 Open Championship and, most recently, at the 2024 PGA Championship.\n\nSo why in the world do we feel that Woods will make the cut this time around at Pinehurst No. 2? Here are three reasons why.\n\nThis week's forecast calls for temperatures in the low 90s, as heat and humidity will blanket the players all week at Pinehurst No. 2.\n\nWoods thrives in these types of conditions. Not only does he enjoy practicing in the heat, as he does at home in South Florida, but it also allows his body to warm up faster.\n\nBefore playing competitively, Woods spends hours preparing his body to perform, which often includes taking ice baths, stretching, and spending ample time on the range. Hot conditions help expedite that process.\n\nOn the other hand, cold temperatures often lead to stiffness and soreness, which partially explains why Woods withdrew from the 2023 Masters. But he will not have to deal with anything like that this week, which will bode well for him.\n\nWoods got an excellent draw this week as he will headline the Early-Late wave for the first two rounds. He will play alongside 2022 U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick and 2022 U.S. Open runner-up Will Zalatoris during rounds one and two.\n\nThis trio will begin their championship at 7:29 a.m. ET on Thursday on the 10th tee, a par-5. The 10th hole at Pinehurst No. 2 is no slouch, but it does present an opportunity right out of the gate. It played as the third easiest hole in 2014 and is a fairly easy fairway to hit. Perhaps Woods can get off on the right foot early.\n\nThen, on Friday, Woods, Zalatoris, and Fitzpatrick will begin their second rounds at 1:14 p.m. ET, giving the 15-time major champion plenty of time to rest, recover, and recuperate. He will also have all morning to loosen up for his second round.\n\nUnlike Augusta National, and to a lesser extent, Valhalla, Pinehurst No. 2 does not feature steep hills and severe undulations. Its a much easier course to traverse, which plays into Woods' hands.\n\nHe has admitted numerous times that he can hit any golf shot that he wants, but simply walking the golf course has proven difficult because of his ailments. Yet, he feels ready.\n\n\"I feel like I have the strength to be able to [win],\" Woods said Tuesday.\n\n\"It's just a matter of doing it. This golf course is going to test every single aspect of your game, especially mentally, and just the mental discipline that it takes to play this particular golf course, it's going to take a lot.\"\n\nBut at least it will not strain on him physically, or to the extent that Augusta has.\n\nNevertheless, Woods did not compete at Pinehurst No. 2 in 2014. He missed that tournament due to a back injury. But he finished runner-up at this course in 2005. Then, in 1999, he had a great chance to win it, but a late bogey on the par-3 17th sunk his hopes. He ultimately tied for 3rd.\n\nWoods has had success here, even though it came before the 2010 restoration performed by Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw.\n\n\"The look off the tees are about the same,\" Woods said.\n\n\"I know it's more native and more open looking. But from what I remember from '05 and what I saw in '14, yes, there is a bit of a change. But that's really no big deal. The surrounds are very different. Going from bent to Bermuda [grass], it is a significant change.\"\n\nDespite the changes, Woods feels confident at this course, and for these reasons, we believe he will earn a third round tee time on Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_milko@sbnation.com", "name": "Jack Milko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Bonaventure_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Bonaventure University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winged_Foot_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winged Foot Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_National_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Augusta National Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hole_in_one", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hole in one"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Fitzpatrick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Zalatoris", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Zalatoris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Crenshaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Crenshaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augusta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Augusta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bermuda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bermuda"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xo6JHXlJrPtyY2Djqp__6gRWzjE=/0x519:2112x1575/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25489081/2157323586.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Woods, a three-time U.S. Open champion, has fared well at Pinehurst No. 2, placing T-3 in 1999 and solo second in 2005, though he hasn't played the course competitively since its renovation.\n\nThis is Woods' fourth start this year.

(Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images)\n\nIt's hard to imagine what a successful Thursday will be for Tiger, considering he has played only seven full rounds through the first five-and-a-half months this year. He won't have to make a lot of birdies to keep pace like at Valhalla, but good pars and his ability to scramble around the greens at Pinehurst will be pivotal if he wants to make the cut and contend. We'll know early what to expect from Woods with how he handles the tricky greens.\n\nThe warm weather should help his body, plus Pinehurst is by far one of the easiest walks he's going to have for a major championship, and he also will have plenty of recovery time before Friday's second round, but let's not get too far ahead of ourselves. If he shows his prowess around the greens and can shoot in the 72-74 range (without knowing what other scores will be, thinking -1 or -2 will be the lead), one has to think that will be a successful opening round.\n\nWarming up Photos\n\nTiger Woods of the United States and his son, Charlie Woods, look on from the second hole during a practice round prior to the U.S. Open at Pinehurst Resort on June 11, 2024 in Pinehurst, North Carolina.

But he also hit far too many wayward iron shots on a course that demands accuracy, and his deft touch around the greens abandoned him more than once on the way to a 4-over 74 in the opening round.\n\nIt was his 12th consecutive round without breaking par in a major, one derailed by five bogeys in a seven-hole stretch.\n\n\"I was somewhat conservative in some of my end points. Then again, I didn't hit the ball very well either,\" explained Woods, who found 12 of 14 fairways in regulation but hit just half the greens. \"It's not where I wanted to be on a lot of holes.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

That was the case at the par-3 ninth, his final hole of the day, when his approach appeared to be so safely aboard that he plucked his tee and began heading toward the green.\n\nThat's when a groan began rising from the crowd. Woods looked up to see his ball starting to trickle, pick up speed, and come to rest 30 yards down the fairway. His birdie chance had become a testy pitch-and-putt par save to finish the round.\n\n\"It's hard to get the ball close,\" Woods said. \"In most golf courses you play, you hit shots into where it's feeding off of slopes into flags, where it's collecting. Here, everything is repelling. It's just hard to get the ball on top of the shelves.\n\n\"You know if you miss it short side, it's an auto bogey, or higher.\"\n\nWoods at least avoided the big numbers Thursday, and while his round easily could have been even par or better, it at least kept the three-time U.S. Open champ in the mix to make the cut. That alone was an improvement over his last time out in the PGA Championship at Valhalla, where two triple bogeys during a second-round 77 kept him from playing the weekend.\n\nMore good news: The battered body that has so often betrayed Woods in recent years seemed to be up to the task.\n\nWoods, who missed the last U.S. Open at Pinehurst in 2014 while recovering from the first of four back surgeries, rarely grimaced on his morning march. The relatively flat layout, at least compared to places like Augusta National, helped his cause, as did the weather, which was hot and humid and kept those aching joints from locking up.\n\nHe also benefited from an early tee time, giving him almost 24 hours exactly to recover for Friday's round.\n\n\"I'm hoping I don't get too tight in the car ride back. I can get tight in air conditioning,\" said Woods, who in fact went straight to the driving range after his round, and began working on those inconsistent irons.\n\nHe should have had a suspicion they might be a problem.\n\n\"I was pretty one-dimensional early in the week, which is interesting. I was drawing the ball a lot. Now I'm cutting the ball a lot,\" Woods said, before flashing a wry smile. \"Welcome to golf.\"\n\nWelcome to inconsistency. And that may be the product of infrequency.\n\nWoods had not played a U.S. Open round since Winged Foot in 2020, thanks mostly to all those injuries -- five back surgeries, four knee surgeries and the procedure to piece together a shattered right leg and ankle from his 2021 car crash.\n\n\"I'm physically getting better as the year has gone on. I just haven't been able to play as much because I just don't want to hurt myself pre, then I won't be able to play in the major championships,\" Woods said. \"It's pick your poison, right? Play a lot with the potential of not playing, or not playing and fight being not as sharp.\"\n\nWoods admitted he hopes his body will allow him to begin playing more often.\n\nPlaying this weekend would be a good start.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!

But he also hit far too many wayward iron shots on a course that demands accuracy, and his deft touch around the greens abandoned him more than once on the way to a 4-over 74 in the opening round.\n\nIt was his 12th consecutive round without breaking par in a major, one derailed by five bogeys in a seven-hole stretch.\n\n\"I was somewhat conservative in some of my end points. Then again, I didn't hit the ball very well either,\" explained Woods, who found 12 of 14 fairways in regulation but hit just half the greens. \"It's not where I wanted to be on a lot of holes.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

He's 100, she's 96\n\nTo be fair, the famed Donald Ross layout can at times be borderline unfair.\n\nWoods hit several shots that would have produced good birdie chances most anywhere else, but instead they rolled off the wildly contoured greens and came to rest in collection areas. That was the case at the par-3 ninth, his final hole of the day, when his approach appeared to be so safely aboard that he plucked his tee and began heading toward the green.\n\nThat's when a groan began rising from the crowd. Woods looked up to see his ball starting to trickle, pick up speed, and come to rest 30 yards down the fairway. His birdie chance had become a testy pitch-and-putt par save to finish the round.\n\n\"It's hard to get the ball close,\" Woods said. \"In most golf courses you play, you hit shots into where it's feeding off of slopes into flags, where it's collecting. Here, everything is repelling. It's just hard to get the ball on top of the shelves.\n\n\"You know if you miss it short side, it's an auto bogey, or higher.\"\n\nWoods at least avoided the big numbers Thursday, and while his round easily could have been even par or better, it at least kept the three-time U.S. Open champ in the mix to make the cut. That alone was an improvement over his last time out in the PGA Championship at Valhalla, where two triple bogeys during a second-round 77 kept him from playing the weekend.\n\nMore good news: The battered body that has so often betrayed Woods in recent years seemed to be up to the task.\n\nWoods, who missed the last U.S. Open at Pinehurst in 2014 while recovering from the first of four back surgeries, rarely grimaced on his morning march. The relatively flat layout, at least compared to places like Augusta National, helped his cause, as did the weather, which was hot and humid and kept those aching joints from locking up.\n\nHe also benefited from an early tee time, giving him almost 24 hours exactly to recover for Friday's round.\n\n\"I'm hoping I don't get too tight in the car ride back. I can get tight in air conditioning,\" said Woods, who in fact went straight to the driving range after his round, and began working on those inconsistent irons.\n\nHe should have had a suspicion they might be a problem.\n\n\"I was pretty one-dimensional early in the week, which is interesting. I was drawing the ball a lot. Now I'm cutting the ball a lot,\" Woods said, before flashing a wry smile. \"Welcome to golf.\"\n\nWelcome to inconsistency. And that may be the product of infrequency.\n\nWoods had not played a U.S. Open round since Winged Foot in 2020, thanks mostly to all those injuries -- five back surgeries, four knee surgeries and the procedure to piece together a shattered right leg and ankle from his 2021 car crash.\n\n\"I'm physically getting better as the year has gone on. I just haven't been able to play as much because I just don't want to hurt myself pre, then I won't be able to play in the major championships,\" Woods said. \"It's pick your poison, right? Play a lot with the potential of not playing, or not playing and fight being not as sharp.\"\n\nWoods admitted he hopes his body will allow him to begin playing more often.\n\nPlaying this weekend would be a good start.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site

Woods may be nearing 49 years old, but that didn't stop him from out driving both of his playing partners, who are still in their 20s, on the Par 5 10th hole, their first hole of the day.\n\nWhat happened next on the 10th hole was much more telling than his opening tee shot.\n\nWoods pushed his second shot well right of the green into the sandy, bush-filled area that guards every fairway at Pinehurst. He was lucky enough to draw an above-average lie, and took advantage by feathering a wedge to around 10 feet. Plenty of players will struggle with the touchy wedge shots from the native area throughout the week, but Woods made it look way too easy.\n\nHe stepped up and drained the birdie putt on his opening hole as well.\n\nThe putter stayed warm through much of his opening nine holes on Thursday as he holed a few not-so-comfortable par putts before cooling off on the greens before making the turn at 1-over. He also three-putted the first hole to move to 2-over on the day, but the pieces are still very much present that suggest he could be playing the weekend.\n\nPerhaps the most important piece is that Woods is walking around with more swagger, and less limping than we've maybe seen since his car crash in 2021.\n\nAgain, there is a long way to go, but Woods is gaining shots off the tee and around the greens thus far in his championship quest.

Play a lot with the potential of not playing, or not playing and fight being not as sharp.\"\n\nCantlay's 65 was only good enough for a one-shot lead over Sweden's Ludvig Aberg, who returned a four-under 66 on his US Open debut and just the third major championship of his career.\n\nAberg only turned professional 12 months ago, but quickly won on the DP World Tour, helped Europe regain the Ryder Cup in Rome - including a 9&7 win with Viktor Hovland over Scottie Scheffler and Brooks Koepka - and also tasted victory on the PGA Tour before the end of the season.\n\nSuch performances earned the 24-year-old a major debut the Masters and he pushed Scheffler all the way in April before the world number one pulled away to claim a second green jacket at Augusta National.\n\nFrance's Matthieu Pavon was a shot behind Aberg after becoming the first player to make multiple eagles in a US Open round at Pinehurst.\n\nPavon, who won his first PGA Tour title in January, eagled the fifth and 10th on his way to an opening 67.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Thu 13 Jun 2024, 8:26 PM Last updated: Thu 13 Jun 2024, 8:54 PM", "source": {"uri": "con-telegraph.ie", "dataType": "news", "title":

We all know that by now. But his history in U.S. Open play at Pinehurst tells us we shouldn't rule him out entirely here in 2024.\n\nTo hear Tiger talk about things out here during practice rounds, he firmly believes he can contend on a course that isn't going to have any cold or rain weather concerns.\n\n\"It's like home. Hot and humid is what we deal with every single day at home in Florida, so that's nothing new,\" Woods said during his Tuesday news conference. \"It's just making sure that I keep hydrated and the mental tax that the heat will bring. It's going to bring it to all of us, not just me. Everyone is going to be tested.\"\n\nAnd while he's never lacked for confidence, he has been more open and honest lately about the way his body is different after multiple surgeries, and a major car accident that threatened to end his career - if not his life. But Tiger thinks he's got what it takes playing in just his fourth tournament this year.\n\n\"I feel like I have the strength to be able to do it. It's just a matter of doing it,\" he said.\n\nTiger has played in two U.S. Open Championships at Pinehurst, in 1999 and 2005. And in both of those, he finished near the top of the leaderboard. He missed the 2014 Open, but knows that the course plays much different than what he saw in those first two appearances.\n\n\"Yeah, it's all different. I played it under bentgrass. So now having Bermuda, it's very different,\" he said about the changes made to return Pinehurst to its native rough roots. \"It's grainy. We had the grain on the greens during those Open Championships, and they were softer than they are now.\"\n\nWith hot temperatures in the upper 80s to mid-90s, and no rain in sight, Tiger said the first round is likely to be the best day for scoring.\n\n\"It has that look and feel that this could be one of the Opens where whatever the leading score is, that's probably as low as we'll ever go after the first day.\"\n\n1999 - Tied for 3rd - +1\n\nThe first U.S. Open for Tiger Woods at Pinehurst came on a day no golf fan will likely ever forget. But it wasn't because of Tiger.\n\nThat was the year Payne Stewart had one of the most memorable moments in U.S. Open history, with a long birdie putt on 18 and a now-iconic fist pump as he won the tournament. The moment is immortalized with the Payne Stewart statue on the grounds of Pinehurst.\n\nThat putt to win gave Stewart a one-shot edge over Phil Mickelson, who finished at even-par for the tournament. And one shot back of Phil... well that was Tiger Woods (and Vijay Singh).\n\nWoods had a solid tournament, never ending a round more than two shots back of the leader. But he had a critical bogey on the 17th hole in the final round that ended his chance at a win.\n\nIt's an afterthought in history thanks to the Payne Stewart moment, but it showed that Tiger was ready to dominate.\n\n2005 - 2nd Place - +2\n\nIf you ask someone to tell you about Tiger Woods in his prime, they are going to talk about his traditional Sunday charges. The 2005 Open was one of those moments.\n\nMichael Campbell ended up winning that tournament, after a steady 69 in the final round. It didn't have the dramatic impact of the 1999 Open, but the win was perhaps best known more for Retief Goosen's epic collapse. Goosen led by three heading into the final round, but had a disastrous 11-over round, and went from 3-under to 8-over.\n\nThat left the door open for Tiger, who started with two bogeys, and seemed out of contention. But four birdies on the back nine saw Tiger make things look inevitable. But a bogey on 16, and a three-putt bogey on 17 ended his chances. He finished two back of Campbell, who held on for dear life.\n\n2014 - Did Not Play\n\nIt wasn't long before the 2014 U.S. Open at Pinehurst that the career of Tiger Woods began to change dramatically. He had battled various injuries over the years, but his first back surgery came in the spring of 2014.\n\nThat surgery look him out of the Masters for the first time in his career, and caused him to miss the Open at Pinehurst.\n\nEven if he had played, Martin Kaymer made things laughable for everyone. He shot blistering scores of 65 in the first two rounds, and never came close to having anybody near him. He won the tournament with a 9-under final score, besting Erik Compton and Rickie Fowler by eight shots.\n\nTiger Woods Heading Into the 2024 U.S. Open\n\nTiger Woods hasn't been the vicious killer on the course the last few years. In February of 2021, he was involved in a horrific car accident that caused multiple leg injuries. There was a long period of time where it wasn't even clear if Tiger would ever step on a golf course again.\n\nBut he has battled back, playing limited schedules, and never contending much. But it's always good to see the legend on the course. His first tournament back was the 2022 Masters, and he did make the cut, but was 23 shots back of winner Scottie Scheffler.\n\nHe's played in just three tournaments this year so far. He withdrew from the Genesis Invitational during the second round. He made the cut at The Masters, but shot 82 and 77 on the weekend, and finished 60th. And he missed the cut at the PGA Championship after rounds of 72 and 77.\n\nBut he's back at Pinehurst and feeling confident. Time will tell whether Tiger has any chance of contending. But we're all hoping to see that Sunday Red this weekend on No. 2.", "source": {"uri": "wrif.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WRIF Rocks Detroit"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payne_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Payne Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijay_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vijay Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Compton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erik Compton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retief_Goosen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retief Goosen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Kaymer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martin Kaymer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickie_Fowler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rickie Fowler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wrif.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/24/2024/06/GettyImages-120945804_1718284645_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Play a lot with the potential of not playing, or not playing and fight being not as sharp.\"\n\nCantlay's 65 was only good enough for a one-shot lead over Sweden's Ludvig Aberg, who returned a four-under 66 on his US Open debut and just the third major championship of his career.\n\nAberg only turned professional 12 months ago, but quickly won on the DP World Tour, helped Europe regain the Ryder Cup in Rome - including a 9&7 win with Viktor Hovland over Scottie Scheffler and Brooks Koepka - and also tasted victory on the PGA Tour before the end of the season.\n\nSuch performances earned the 24-year-old a major debut the Masters and he pushed Scheffler all the way in April before the world number one pulled away to claim a second green jacket at Augusta National.\n\n\"It was very nice round of golf. Not a lot to complain about,\" said Aberg, who revealed the first US Open he remembers was at Pinehurst in 2014, when his caddie Joe Skovron was working for joint runner-up Rickie Fowler.\n\n\"I felt like those times where I kind of got myself out of position a little bit, you just try to get back into play as easy as you can, give yourself a chance for a par.\n\n\"I think staying very disciplined is important. There's a lot of pins you don't really think about going for. So me and Joe, my caddie, we have a lot of good conversations about certain areas that you try to hit it in.\n\nFrance's Matthieu Pavon was a shot behind Aberg after becoming the first player to make multiple eagles in a US Open round at Pinehurst.\n\nPavon, who won his first PGA Tour title in January, eagled the fifth and 10th on his way to an opening 67, a welcome return to form after a poor recent run of results.\n\n\"I've been crushed by the few last golf courses,\" Pavon admitted.\n\n\"I played terrible at Quail Hollow. I played terrible at the (US) PGA. I played terrible at Memorial, too.\n\n\"I used to play slightly easier golf courses back in Europe, so on these types of courses I kind of have to adjust my game, adjust my thinking.\n\n\"Obviously when it's really, really tough like this week, at least you know that sometimes you have to take away some pressure and some expectations and play smart to the great spots and make one or two up and downs when you need them.\"\n\nEngland's Robert Rock, who announced his retirement from professional golf in October 2022 but came through final qualifying at the age of 47, carded two birdies and two bogeys in a level-par 70.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_National_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Augusta National Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Kaymer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martin Kaymer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Golf_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Golf Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthieu_Pavon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthieu Pavon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rock", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert Rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickie_Fowler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rickie Fowler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/fjgbkfzv5x8RTHu3uQkrkQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/pa-sport.com/8c7fffa440b4c874bbe64f44440a0325", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

making his debut Feb. 22 as an individual competitor in a pre-qualifier event for The Cognizant Classic, a PGA Tour event.\n\nIn September 2023, Charlie competed in the Notah Begay III Junior Golf National Championship Last Chance Florida Regional, where he emerged as the winner of the regional qualifier in the boys 14-15 age division with final scores of 71 and 66.\n\nIn a post-competition

However, despite a promising start, the 15-time major champion ended his opening round four-over par on Thursday.\n\nWoods, who last won the US Open 16 years ago at Torrey Pines, started off well with a birdie on the first hole. But his performance dipped on the 16th and 17th holes, missing par putts on both and slipping to one-over through eight holes.\n\nThe back-nine began with another bogey for Woods, followed by a missed par effort that took him to three-over. The fourth hole at Pinehurst, known for its harshness, proved challenging as the 48-year-old's tee shot landed in a bunker and he missed a par putt within five feet.\n\nAfter bogeying five out of his previous seven holes, Woods managed a birdie before continuing his struggle and ending the round four-over with a par at the 18th. He admitted that his iron play let him down, hitting only 10 greens in regulation, but also recognised that his putting needs improvement.", "source": {"uri": "express.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "EXPRESS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_gamble@express.co.uk", "name": "Andrew Gamble", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrey_Pines_Golf_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Torrey Pines Golf Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Furniture", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Furniture", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/71/1200x630/5432869.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

For years, Woods sported the logo himself.\n\nHowever, as Woods prepares for the 2024 U.S. Open, fans will notice a new look from the legendary golfer. In January, Woods ended his 27-year partnership with Nike and teamed up with TaylorMade to launch the new Sun Day Red brand.\n\nThis partnership brings more than just a fresh line of clothing for Woods' fans; it introduces new logos and a departure from the TW emblem.\n\nThe TW logo, while synonymous with Tiger Woods, is actually owned and trademarked by Nike. This ownership means Woods cannot wear the TW logo even if he wanted to. However, Woods seems more than ready to move on.\n\n\"I don't want it back,\" Woods stated in an April press conference. \"I've moved on. This is a transition in my life. I've moved on to Sun Day Red, and we're looking forward to building a brand that elicits excitement and is transformative.\"\n\nThe new Sun Day Red brand features a tiger logo that, while lacking Woods' initials, still symbolizes his storied career.

He had a tough time at the Masters, finishing 16 over, and missed the cut at the PGA Championship.\n\nBut former caddie and ESPN pundit Michael Collins believes the conditions at Pinehurst No. 2 could favour him. Appearing on Pardon My Take, he was asked if Woods could achieve a top 20-finish this weekend.\n\nCollins replied: \"This might be the US Open course that he does - are you saying that to me like 'are you saying there's a chance'? If you're saying it in that sense, is there a chance? Yes.\n\n\"Because this is probably, of all the US Open venues, this might be the easiest of the walks. And that's what it takes for Tiger now, that's part of the issue. It ain't the course, it's the walks. And the stances.\n\n\"So when he misses a fairway at Pinehurst, he's gonna be in native area but he's not gonna have some jacked up stance like he would've at the PGA Championship, like he did at the Masters. That's the problem.\"\n\nNot only does Collins think the walks around the course could play into his hands, but he also highlighted the 30-plus degrees Celsius/circa 90 degrees Fahrenheit weather that is forecast for all four days in North Carolina as \"great news\" for his chances.\n\n\"It's also a sand-based course so if they get really bad weather and the course gets soft, then of course it's going to be an issue,\" he continued. \"But this week too, the temperature looks like it's going to be hot. Great for Tiger Woods and his back. So if he keeps it in play, fairways and greens, yeah. He can hit the shots.\"\n\nCollins quickly downplayed Woods' chances of emerging victorious, though, when that was raised as a suggestion. \"No, take it easy bro, relax,\" he replied.\n\nThe three-time US Open winner will tee off alongside Will Zalatoris and English 2022 champion Matt Fitzpatrick on Thursday morning, aiming to complete all 72 holes of a tournament for just the fourth time since November 2020.\n\nHe'll be joined by his 15-year-old son Charlie, with Woods explaining that he trusts him for advice on his swing game as he's seen him hit more balls than anyone else.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_burnham@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Dan Burnham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(Irish_leader)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Collins (Irish leader)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Fitzpatrick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Zalatoris", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Zalatoris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Furniture", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Furniture", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article33019237.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_US-Open-Preview-Day-Two.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 2209, "textEnd": 2222}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Many amateur golfers sport the logo on the course, channeling the star, while others enjoy the sleek look of the merged lettering.\n\nAlthough fans may still wear the logo, Woods himself will no longer feature the emblem. As Tiger competes in the 2024 U.S. Open, golf fans will notice a different insignia on his hats, shirts, and other branded apparel and equipment.\n\nTaylorMade sponsors Woods, and together they formed the Sun Day Red brand. This marks a significant change for Woods, who had been with Nike for the past 27 years. Woods split with Nike in January 2024. While the TW logo features Woods' initials, Nike holds the trademark and copyright for the emblem.\n\n\"I don't want it back,\" Woods said in a press conference earlier in 2024. \"I've moved on. This is a transition in my life. I've moved on to Sun Day Red, and we're looking forward to building a brand that elicits excitement and is transformative.\"\n\nWoods partnered with TaylorMade to create the brand Sun Day Red. The new logo features a striped tiger with 15 stripes, representing each of Woods' major wins. The brand, launching officially on May 1, 2024, may expand to include 16 stripes should he win another major.\n\n\"At the heart of Sun Day Red's ethos is a logo that tells a story,\" Sun Day Red said in a release. \"It's a narrative of Tiger's incredible achievements, a visual tribute to a career that has inspired millions. But the designs go further, embedding Easter eggs for the fans, including a 15-striped tiger emblem representing his 15 major wins.\"\n\nThe split with Nike wasn't entirely unexpected. Speculation about a possible separation had been circulating since December 2023, and it became official in early January 2024.\n\nApex Marketing Group president Eric Smallwood suggested that Nike's decision was likely influenced by its move to exit the golf business, rather than any belief that Woods is nearing the end of his career. \"Nike used to sell golf balls and clubs with its logo, and that ended,\" Smallwood said, per CNN.\n\nJ. Butler Golf founder Joshua Butler agreed, noting that Nike has been moving away from golf products overall. He said Woods likely saw this as an opportunity to explore other avenues. \"It's not that Nike has done anything wrong, it's not that Tiger Woods may not necessarily be happy with his relationship with Nike for the last 27 years, but this is a golden opportunity to go after a younger crowd, to go after individuals who aren't rich that want to play the game,\" Butler said, per CNN. \"Tiger understands that, the importance of what he's meant to the golf industry as well as to people of color. That's why I think this is such a monumental shift right now.\"\n\nThere's a reason the brand is called Sun Day Red. Woods has always worn red on Sundays, a tradition dating back to his college days. He started wearing red while playing at Stanford due to superstitions and his mother's belief that red is his \"power color.\"\n\n\"You know, you should always listen to your mom,\" Woods said.", "source": {"uri": "businessupturn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Upturn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaylorMade", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TaylorMade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amateur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clothing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Butler University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Easter egg (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superstition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Branding", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Branding", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://images.businessupturn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/safeimagekit-GettyImages-2148330186-1024x576.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

In the closing moments, he provided a moving tribute to his mother.\n\nWoods' award is the highest honor provided by the Professional Golfers' Association of America, and was thus an emotional moment. \"My mom doesn't get enough credit,\" Woods said nearing the end of the speech. \"They all thought that it was me and dad on the road, which it was, but mom was at home. If you don't know, mom has been there my entire life, she's always been there through thick and thin.\"\n\nWoods said that he accepted the honor \"in humbleness\" and \"unbelievable regard\" for the previous recipients. He then added, \"But I also accept it for my mommy too.\" He shared that his mother's support was one of the main forces behind all of his achievements. \"I didn't do this alone, I had the greatest rock that any child could possibly have - my mom. Thank you, mommy.\"\n\nWoods has often spoken about his family, especially the sacrifices that they made so he could pursue his career. In 2022, Woods was inducted in the World Golf Hall of Fame, where he praised his parents and thanked them for all of their hard work. \"My family made a tough decision, and at the age of 14 and a half, we took out a second mortgage so I could go out and play the AJGA Tour,\" he said.\n\n\"Mom stayed at home. Dad traveled. And I went out and played the AJGA Tour on our second mortgage.\"", "source": {"uri": "hola.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hola.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Jones_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Jones Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Junior_Golf_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Junior Golf Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Golf_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Golf Hall of Fame"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Parenting", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business/Home_Office", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business/Home Office", "wgt": 26}], "image": "https://www.hola.com/us/images/028e-1b1f8f3df33b-e79f1096a9c1-1000/horizontal-800/u-s-open-preview-day-two.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

He'll be competing against 155 other golfers this week and looking to make his first cut at the U.S. Open since 2019.

Since then, the 82-time PGA Tour winner has competed in just nine tournaments. He is making his 10th start at the U.S. Open this week.\n\nRemarkably, Woods had lost his spot to compete at this year's U.S. Open, after his five-year exemption to compete on the major stage following his victory at the Masters back in 2019 ran out.\n\nREAD MORE: Tiger Woods regrettably proves himself right with turbulent US Open first round\n\nREAD MORE: U.S. Open 2024 predictions: Can anyone stop Scottie Scheffler? Is it Rory McIlroy's time again?\n\nWoods is a three-time winner of his national Open, however the USGA only hand out 10-year exemptions to its past-champions, differentiating to the three other major championships. Fortunately for the past champion, he was offered a special exemption to compete at Pinehurst this week.\n\nMoving forward, however, the rest of Woods' playing days remain unclear, despite being the circuit's joint-most successful member. According to Golf.com, this issue is set to be ironed out next week, with the policy board voting on a lifetime spot in the Tour's Signature Events moving forward.\n\nPer the report, the idea was officially discussed by the Player Advisory Council at the recent Charles Schwab Challenge, with the vote taking place in the build-up to next week's Travelers Championship - the final Signature Event of the 2024 PGA Tour campaign.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nThe elevated events are made up of limited fields, with just four sponsor exemptions handed out to those not already qualified. Each tournament goes ahead with a \u00a315.7 million ($20m) prize purse on offer. Woods however has not requested a sponsor exemption in any event this season, as he continues his battle to return to full fitness.\n\nMoving forward, though, it is expected that the 15-time major champion will look to add more tournaments to his schedule aside from golf's four majors. Woods kicked off his week at Pinehurst on Thursday, battling in tough conditions to card a hard-fought four-over-par 74.\n\nThe 48-year-old's two birdies on day one were cancelled out by six bogeys to leave him with work to do in round two. \"I'm physically getting better as the year has gone on,\" he said post-round. \"I just haven't been able to play as much because I just don't want to hurt myself pre, then I won't be able to play in the major championships. It's pick your poison, right?

The sporadic appearances confirm what many assumed when the 15-time major winner made his return at this year's Masters: It's going to be the majors and a few events (benefitting his foundation) going forward. At this point, it's best to enjoy something instead of nothing.\n\nFewer tournament reps allow Woods to focus completely on the next task at hand, which, in this case, is Pinehurst No. 2. Asked during his pre-tournament press conference to describe his prep work leading up to this week, Woods zeroed in on the one area of the game that's sure to define the tournament come Sunday afternoon -- the short game.\n\n\"I did a little bit of work on chipping and putting,\" he said. \"But nothing can simulate what we have here this particular week, the amount of little shots and the knobs and run-offs, and either using wedges or long irons or woods around the greens or even putter. There's so many different shots that you really can't simulate unless you get on the property. That's one of the reasons I came up here last Tuesday, to be able to try and do that. Quite a bit of work. The golf course has firmed up and gotten faster since then.\"\n\nWoods used everything from wedges and fairway woods to long irons and the putter to execute different shots during his practice rounds. Creativity and a short-term memory are key if you want to succeed around the green at Pinehurst. So, too, is understanding that equipment changes are sometimes necessary to handle different grasses -- ultradwarf Bermudagrass from bentgrass, in Pinehurst's case -- and course conditions.\n\nWoods rarely makes adjustments to the scoring tools in his bag for a major championship, but he's making an exception for Pinehurst. Nestled in his staff bag this week are two TaylorMade MG4 wedges (56 and 60 degrees) with the word \"Proto\" stamped on each head. The wedges don't look all that different from the previous set he had at the PGA Championship. However, a closer look reveals a couple of interesting alterations.\n\nThe milled grind sole, at least for the moment, has been removed from each head. The same goes for the usual \"TW Grind\" Woods has used for years. These MG4 Proto wedges have a simpler sole design that's flatter along the bottom with less trailing edge relief.\n\n\"Traditionally my soles have been pretty much standard in width, a little more rounded than some guys, just because I like to use different parts of the bounce, depending on what shot I'm going to use,\" Woods told me in 2017. \"But it really hasn't changed that much in like 15 years or so. It's been pretty much the same.\"\n\nSo why would Woods change his wedge setup for a major championship? The answer can likely be found in his response to the way the \"surrounds around the greens\" have changed from his previous trips to Pinehurst in 1999 and 2005.\n\n\"I played it under bentgrass,\" Woods said. \"So now having Bermuda, it's very different. It's grainy. We had the grain on the greens during those Open Championships, and they were softer than they are now. Granted, I know the surrounds were burnt out in '05, but the greens were not like what they are right now. That's very different.\n\n\"The shot selections around the greens I think are more plentiful this year from either putting it to wedging it. As you said, 6- or 7-irons. I've used long irons and woods around the greens, and I've seen a number of guys do the same thing. There's a lot of different shot selections, and the grain is going to play a big part of it.\"\n\nAs short-game guru Parker McLachlin pointed out on social media, Woods is likely playing wedges with more bounce this week. That doesn't mean it's significantly more than the stated 11 degrees stamped on each head. Instead of adding leading and trailing edge relief to the wedges to make them play differently depending on how the head is positioned, the complex geometry appears to have been removed for a more traditional sole that could keep the leading edge height more consistent regardless of the shot.\n\nEven though the areas around the green complexes at Pinehurst are extremely tight, the \"grainy\" Bermuda -- especially if it's into the grain -- can cause the club to stick through impact.\n\nIn this case, adding forward shaft lean to the sand or lob wedge is going to lower the bounce, which can increase the potential for the dreaded chunk. Adding bounce ensures the wedge can get through the turf without issue. It's a small adjustment that could pay big dividends for Woods when he needs to execute a deft wedge shot this week.", "source": {"uri": "golf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wedge (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iron (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler_&_Koch_MG4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heckler & Koch MG4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agrostis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agrostis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TaylorMade", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TaylorMade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailing_edge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trailing edge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynodon_dactylon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cynodon dactylon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill_(grinding)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mill (grinding)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaceae", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poaceae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Taiwan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lob_wedge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lob wedge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_McLachlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parker McLachlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading_edge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leading edge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sod", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bermuda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bermuda"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://golf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/twgrind-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Or, not playing and fight being not as sharp.\"\n\nThis is the fourth time Woods has played in a tournament this year.\n\nHe withdrew after just one round from the Genesis Invitational in February, made the cut but finished in 60th place in April's Masters, and missed the cut in May's PGA Championship. The Masters was the highlight of his year to this point, as he set the record by making the cut at the sport's most famous tournament for the 24th time in a row.\n\nThat Woods said he is physically starting to feel better is a welcome sign, as he has struggled to finish tournaments since he suffered serious injuries in a February 2021 car accident.\n\nHe will have his work cut out for him to make the cut at the daunting Pinehurst No. 2 course, and it doesn't seem like he will be adding to his three career U.S. Open titles. But he is making progress physically as he works through some of the rust of not participating in non-major tournaments like he did at his peak.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_polacek@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Scott Polacek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Woodcraft", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1718302398/tnjdnx88tllmtygxpjsn.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Drove it on the string all day. Unfortunately I just didn't capitalize on it.\"\n\nTiger, who teed off at 7:29 a.m. ET with 2022 U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick (+3, 73) and Will Zalatoris (+5, 75), opened with a birdie on the par-5 10th, thanks to an impressive wedge shot out of the sand from about 50 yards away.\n\nAfter six consecutive pars -- including a nifty up-and-down out of the bunker on the par-4 12th -- he bogeyed four of five holes around the turn: the par-4 16th, first, and second, and the par-3 17th. He badly misjudged a sinkable 9-footer for par on No. 1, as he temporarily lost his putting feel.\n\nOn the par-5 fifth, Tiger landed the green in two and hit a quality uphill lag to set up a three-footer for birdie -- his smoothest putting stroke in some time. He was back at +3 with four holes to go.\n\nAfter a quality par on the par-3 sixth, Tiger piped his next drive right onto the fairway, but his approach found the bunker. He drilled a 17-footer to salvage a key par.\n\nTiger landed another fairway on the par-4 eighth , but left his approach just short and right of the green. He rolled his par putt past the cup and settled for bogey.\n\nIn general, the Big Cat's inconsistent with his irons often negated his accuracy off the tee. The three-time U.S. Open champion hit 12 of 14 fairways, but only 9 of 18 \"turtleback\" greens in regulation, leaving a handful of avoidably long putts.\n\nOn the par-3 ninth, after his tee shot rolled off the green, Tiger nimbly finessed his chip near the cup. He culminated his rickety opening round with a par. He finished with six bogeys and two birdies.\n\n\"It's not where I wanted to be on a lot of the holes. It just ended up being that far away because I wasn't as sharp as I needed to be.\"\n\nTiger hit the clubhouse tied for 51st, though a bulk of the field had plenty of golf left to play. The top 60 (plus ties) at the end of the second round will qualify for the final two rounds of the third major of the year.\n\nTiger's gait was more or less sturdy, though the 48-year-old could been seen favoring or shaking out his right leg a little bit more on his second nine. Pinehurst No. 2 is relatively flat, but its native sandiness and overall length present a misleadingly taxing walk.\n\n\"I'm physically getting better as the year has gone on. I just haven't been able to play as much because I just don't want to hurt myself pre, then I won't be able to play in the major championships,\" he said. \"It's pick your poison, right? Play a lot with the potential of not playing, or not playing and fight being not as sharp.\"\n\nThe 124th U.S. Open marks Tiger's fourth official PGA Tour start of 2024. In February, the 15-time major champion withdrew from his host tournament, the Genesis Invitational, due to illness. He made a record 24th straight cut at the Masters, then finished last. He missed the cut at the PGA Championship at Valhalla.\n\nTiger finished in the top five in each of his two prior U.S. Open starts at Pinehurst No. 2 (1999, 2005). Tiger is tied with Sam Snead for most PGA Tour victories of all-time (82).", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_corvo@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Michael Corvo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iron (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Fitzpatrick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Zalatoris", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Will Zalatoris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hazard (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Snead", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Snead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/tiger-woods-us-open.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

PGA Tour changes could be coming", "body": "Tiger Woods plays a tee shot during a practice round of this week's U.S. Open.\n\nThe question of which players get in to Signature Events -- the premier, mega-money tournaments held eight times annually on the PGA Tour -- has been controversial in the schedule's debut season. Tournament sponsors are granted four exemptions to offer to Tour members of their choosing, with many of those exemptions going to a similar list of names in 2024. Webb Simpson and Adam Scott -- two Policy Board members -- have benefitted greatly, earning the ire of some critics.\n\nWith the first year of Signature Events now nearly complete, the Tour membership is considering various tweaks to the makeup of those fields, led chiefly by a new exemption for one player in particular: Tiger Woods.\n\nAccording to a monthly newsletter of updates shared with Tour members, the Player Advisory Council (PAC) -- one of the middle-rungs of Tour governance -- supports the creation of a special exemption for Woods and Woods only, given his immense and unmatched career success. The idea was discussed officially for the first time at a meeting during the Charles Schwab Challenge on May 21, and will be voted upon during a Policy Board meeting Tuesday during next week's Travelers Championship.\n\nWith 82 career wins and more than $120 million in lifetime earnings, Woods' career speaks for itself. Any event would move mountains for him to take part. But Woods does not automatically qualify for these events. He has barely competed in recent years and hasn't fared well enough to earn his way in on his scores alone. With just four exemptions on offer in a 70-80 player field competing for $20 million, those sponsor exemptions are in high demand. Accomplished players not already in those fields have found themselves writing letters to sponsors for the first time in years. If Woods were to show interest in, say, the Arnold Palmer Invitational, he would absolutely earn one of those spots, eliminating a chance for others who, frankly, could use it more than the 48-year-old worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\n\"These exemptions are intended to capture players who are important to the tournament sponsor but who are not otherwise qualified,\" the GREENSHEET newsletter says. \"To maximize these spots for the membership and to provide optimal flexibility for the tournament sponsor, the PAC supported adding an additional sponsor exemption recognizing Tiger Woods in his own category as a player who has reached an exceptional lifetime achievement threshold of 80+ career wins.\"\n\nJust because the PAC supports the idea doesn't automatically greenlight it, though it is not expected to face any pushback. The PAC is a 16-player group that features members from various subsections of the previous season's FedEx Cup standings. It includes the high-end likes of Max Homa and Scottie Scheffler as well as players further down the list like Josh Teater and Kevin Streelman. If the PAC supports something, in general the Tour membership supports it. First comes an official recommendation, then the Policy Board votes on it. That is coming this week.\n\nThe Tour Policy Board, which has been holding various meetings to decide its future -- including some with the Saudi Public Investment fund -- will use the final Signature Event of the year, the Travelers Championship, to take a serious look at what it wants to look like in 2025. (Woods himself is a member of the Policy Board, but would be expected to abstain from the vote.) If the Lifetime Achievement category is approved, it would be implemented at the start of 2025, though it is unclear if Woods' exemption would apply to The Sentry, the annual season kickoff event held in Hawaii in January, which includes strictly the previous season's tournament winners and top 50 finishers in the FedEx Cup.\n\nAn exemption category is only meaningful in the event that Woods actually uses it. He noted in December his intentions of, if healthy, playing one tournament per month in 2024, but has failed to make that happen. Through time constraints, rustiness or health, Woods has only played in one Signature Event this season, the one he hosts at Riviera Country Club in February. (He eventually withdrew early in his first round battling flu-like symptoms.) The only other tournaments he has played in 2024 were the year's first two major championships, finishing 60th at the Masters and missing the cut at the PGA Championship. Woods has made a career out of winning numerous events he would thusly be exempt into, winning the Arnold Palmer Invitational eight times and the Memorial tournament five times.\n\nAdditional Signature Event topics will be discussed at Tuesday's meeting, notably establishing a minimum of 72 competitors moving forward and implementing a cut in every Signature Event, or eliminating a cut from all of them.\n\nAccording to the newsletter, the Signature Event System was created with an \"ideal field size of 72 players,\" and while, on average, the tournaments have seen that number qualify to play, only 68 to 70 players have been taking part. In other words, through injury or indifference or busyness, etc. a few spots in $20 million races have gone unused. On multiple occasions, the final field has included exactly 69 players, leaving one pro to compete by himself during tournament rounds. The PAC is looking to avoid that as it has supported the creation of an alternate list (via that season's FedEx Cup standings) that would fill the field to a 72-player minimum (with the exception of The Sentry) whenever qualified players are unable to play. That will also be voted upon during Tuesday's meeting, and with approval would be implemented in 2025.\n\nAs for a cut at Signature Events? The conversation is ongoing, and there won't be a conclusion until at least next week. Three of this year's Signature Events -- the Genesis Invitational, the Arnold Palmer Invitational and the Memorial -- trimmed the field after 36 holes. The other five did not. Players on the Advisory Council, according to the newsletter, agreed it should be consistent -- either a cut at all or a cut at none -- to make following the tour easier for fans. Signature Event cuts is also expected to be discussed during Tuesday's meeting but not voted on in any official capacity.", "source": {"uri": "golf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_National_Invitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colonial National Invitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Scott_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Scott (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Teater", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Teater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Homa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Homa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Streelman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Streelman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Palmer_Invitational", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arnold Palmer Invitational"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riviera_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riviera Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Organizations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://golf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/woods.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647531", "eventUri": "eng-9647531", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 1153, "textEnd": 1159}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

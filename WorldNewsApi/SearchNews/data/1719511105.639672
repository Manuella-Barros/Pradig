{"id": 223731798, "title": "My mum shuns me and my children - but is falling over herself to look after brother's son", "text": "Dear Coleen I\u2019m a woman in my 30s and feeling really angry towards my mum, who doesn\u2019t seem to give a damn about me or my two kids. My children are both under five, I work full time and my husband works away two days a week, yet my mum never offers to help out and doesn\u2019t even ask how I\u2019m getting on! On the other hand, my older brother has an eight-year-old son, who my mum adores and she\u2019s literally falling over herself to look after him and be involved in their lives. I know this sounds very \u201cpoor me\u201d, but I\u2019ve cried myself to sleep sometimes over my mum\u2019s lack of interest in me and my kids. In my opinion, she should want to be involved and it\u2019s not up to me to force her. It\u2019s hurtful and it\u2019s started to cause a problem between me and my brother because I resent him for getting all of her attention. My mum, who\u2019s been on her own for a few years since my dad passed away, is going on holiday with my brother and his family this summer, despite me asking her months ago if she\u2019d like to come with us to Devon. Honestly, I don\u2019t know why I keep bothering to try with her. What do you think? Coleen says I\u2019m going to try to look at this from a mum\u2019s point of view and as someone who has two sons and a daughter, all in their 20s and 30s. I\u2019m very close to them all but, for some reason, because Ciara is such a strong and capable woman, I -sometimes take advantage of that. It\u2019s unconscious, but somewhere deep down, I expect her to be able to handle things. So, it could be there\u2019s a bit of that going on with your mum. But also, she might be just assuming things about your life that aren\u2019t true. She\u2019s not a mind reader and if you haven\u2019t been clear about the things you\u2019re struggling with, then she might assume you\u2019re doing fine and don\u2019t need any of that support. My main message is, don\u2019t take it out on your brother because it\u2019s not his fault. However, you could confide in him and tell him you feel upset that your mum doesn\u2019t seem to want to be as much a part of your lives, and maybe he could speak to her. If you don\u2019t want to do that and can\u2019t speak to your mum face to face, write her a letter that comes from the heart. Tell her you\u2019d love her to be more involved in your lives, but don\u2019t accuse her of anything because she might get defensive and it\u2019ll all blow up. If you try and nothing changes, at least you know you\u2019ve reached out and made the effort and, to be honest, it\u2019s her hard luck because she\u2019s missing out on her grandkids.", "summary": "Mirror agony aunt Coleen Nolan advises a daughter who feels her mum doesn't care about her or her children despite showing a major interest in her older brother and his family", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/sex-relationships/my-mum-shuns-children-falling-32896788", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32896806.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_USA-New-Jersey-Jersey-City-Mother-holding-daughters-2-3-and-making-facial-expression.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:06:39", "author": "Coleen Nolan,Coleennolanofficial", "authors": ["Coleen Nolan", "Coleennolanofficial"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.159}

Take a closer look at this May 27 matchup with my Blue Jays vs. White Sox predictions and MLB picks below.\n\nMy best bet\n\nUnder 8.5 (+105 at PROLINE+)\n\nMy analysis\n\nIf Toronto Blue Jays supporters are frustrated with their team's erratic offense, the Chicago White Sox fanbase can sympathize. The White Sox have scored by far the fewest runs in the majors this season -- 157 through 54 games (the next lowest is 200) -- and their bats were quiet again this weekend against the Orioles.\n\nWith two offenses that are this tough to trust, the Under on a line of 8.5 is an attractive play here. It's 7-3 in the last 10 meetings between these teams and I see that trend continuing today.\n\nChris Bassitt gets the ball for the Blue Jays and he flummoxed this Chicago lineup last week, throwing seven scoreless innings in a 9-2 win. The Toronto veteran has posted a 3.00 ERA across his past five starts, with 4+ strikeouts in each.\n\nI'm counting on his array of pitches to keep the Chicago hitters off balance again this afternoon and take some of the heat off a wobbling bullpen.\n\nThe visitors' offense has been only marginally more convincing. Though the Blue Jays rallied with 11 runs yesterday, it's no secret the visitors' bats have blown hot and cold at the plate this season -- and mostly cold.\n\nDespite good at-bats from Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Bo Bichette, and Isiah Kiner-Falefa, they only managed a combined three runs across the first two games of the weekend series in Detroit.\n\nThe wildcard with this pick is Nick Nastrini, the rookie White Sox starter. He was roughed up by the Blue Jays last time out, getting hooked after allowing eight runs in 3 1/3 innings.\n\nHowever, this is a payback opportunity for the righty and Toronto has struggled to sustain good offense from one game to the next. Even if his control wavers, I see Nastrini providing a solid enough start to cash in the Under.\n\nThe idea of Danny Jansen hitting in the 2-hole likely didn't feature much in the Blue Jays' offseason planning, but the Toronto catcher has been in red-hot form since returning from the IL and he's picked up the slack for some of his misfiring team-mates.\n\nHe's hitting .314 with a whopping .999 OPS through 27 games, and he's coming off a two-hit outing yesterday against the Tigers.\n\nThe White Sox have only cashed the Over in 11 of their past 27 games.

Home runs from Cavan Biggio, Isiah Kiner-Falefa and Varsho helped the Blue Jays regroup. A three-run blast from Varsho punctuated a five-run Blue Jays' outburst in the eighth and provided an 11-9 lead.\n\nHowever, Toronto proved susceptible to the long ball, too, as Matt Vierling hit a walk-off three-run blast in the ninth to end the game.\n\n\"Today was a very tough game to lose,\" Biggio said, \"but I loved the way they fought. Their bats never seemed to stop, but we had an answer every inning, it seemed like ... I think this is a very positive game for us to build off.\"\n\nThe White Sox aren't feeling that way about their most recent game, a 4-1 loss that capped a four-game sweep for the Baltimore Orioles. Chicago finished with just one hit, a pinch-hit solo home run from Danny Mendick leading off the eighth inning.\n\nMonday's pitching matchup is a rematch of the Blue Jays' 9-2 home win against the White Sox on Wednesday.\n\nToronto right-hander Chris Bassitt (4-6, 4.39 ERA) stymied Chicago over seven shutout innings, scattering five hits and two walks and striking out four.\n\nWhite Sox counterpart Nick Nastrini (0-3, 11.91) struggled Wednesday in his only career appearance against the Blue Jays. The right-hander allowed nine runs (eight earned) and seven hits in 3 1/3 innings. He walked six with no strikeouts.\n\nChicago has endured unevenness from its starting rotation while scuffling to the worst record in the majors, but the organization has shown it believes in Nastrini.\n\n\"One start is not going to make or break his future,\" White Sox manager Pedro Grifol.\n\nNastrini appreciates the opportunity to channel his resilience.\n\n\"If you play this game long enough ... you're going to face adversity,\" Nastrini said. \"I don't want to have a loser's mentality about this -- it kind of comes off that way -- but you have to accept failure. You can't really run from it, because it's gonna happen. You're gonna get punched in the face, and it's really just how you respond from it.\"\n\nBassitt is 4-2 with a 3.27 ERA in eight career starts against the White Sox, with 35 strikeouts in 44 innings.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sacramento Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@sacbee.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daulton_Varsho", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daulton Varsho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Vierling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Vierling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isiah_Kiner-Falefa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isiah Kiner-Falefa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavan_Biggio", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cavan Biggio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walk-off home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bassitt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Bassitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Jai_Alai", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Jai Alai", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/hheg2e/picture288771440/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/d57bfcf5-3f71-4acd-b2fb-8166b6c2edf5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601296", "eventUri": "eng-9601296", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

The 35-year-old right-hander allowed five hits and walked none against his first major league team.\n\nBassitt (5-6) has been dealing with neck spasms that put his start in jeopardy.\n\n\"I was kind of able to figure out where I needed to go mechanically, just throw my strikes,\" he said. \"I didn't think I was going to go five innings, I'll tell you that.\"\n\nSpringer connected in the second inning after Daulton Varsho reached on a two-out walk against Nick Nastrini. It was Springer's fourth homer of the season.\n\nBichette led off the fourth with his fourth homer, a 419-foot drive to center.\n\n\"They were swinging the bat real well,\" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said. \"Through tough times, guys tend to get a little bit closer, good teams do at least, and I think they're doing that.\"\n\nNastrini (0-4) allowed three hits in five innings. He struck out five and walked four.\n\nLast-place Chicago lost its sixth consecutive game. It dropped to 15-40 for the worst 55-game start in franchise history.\n\nGavin Sheets homered in the eighth against Erik Swanson for the only run for the White Sox, who went 1 for 7 with runners in scoring position and left 11 runners on base.\n\nChicago trailed 3-1 before Schneider hit a two-run shot off John Brebbia with two out in the ninth. Schneider's drive to left drove in Springer, who led off with a single.\n\nBlue Jays: RHP Chad Green (right teres major strain) joined the team in Chicago on Monday following his rehab assignment with Triple-A Buffalo. John Schneider said he could be activated as early as Tuesday. ... RHP Bowden Francis (right forearm) will pitch Tuesday for Buffalo in what likely will be his final rehab appearance before he is activated from the injured list.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nToronto's Kevin Gausman (3-3, 4.47 ERA) will face fellow right-hander Mike Clevinger (0-3, 6.75 ERA) on Tuesday. Gausman struck out 10 in six innings in a 9-1 win at Detroit on Thursday.

We didn't cash in. Losing stinks. I think that's the biggest thing. No one in here wants to lose, from the top down.\"\n\nNo White Sox player, manager, coach or executive wants to compare defeats, either, especially when Chicago has a major league-worst 40 of them.\n\nStill, Chicago looked less feeble at the plate Monday than it did the previous afternoon in the opener of a three-game series against the Blue Jays. One day after getting one-hit by the Baltimore Orioles, the White Sox out-hit Toronto 10-6 in a 5-1 loss.\n\nAndrew Benintendi led the attack with three hits, while Sheets and Corey Julks added two apiece.\n\nMore hits, however, equated to more missed opportunities, as Chicago went 1-for-7 with runners in scoring position while stranding 11.\n\n\"We just need to have good at-bats,\" White Sox manager Pedro Grifol said. \"Today our at-bats were a (heck) of a lot better. Our guys competed.\"\n\nToronto thrived on the long ball Monday to stop a three-game losing streak and improve to 3-1 against Chicago this season. George Springer, Bo Bichette and Davis Schneider all homered for the Blue Jays.\n\nSpringer went deep for the first time since April 24 as Toronto fights to stay afloat in the tough American League East amid a subpar first third of the season.\n\n\"When things don't go your way, individually or as a team, it can seem to spiral and things can seem like a big, jumbled mess,\" Springer said. \"I think guys have done a really good job of not really looking forward to what's ahead or dwelling on the past.\n\n\"Guys have been doing a much better job, especially the last month, I would say, of just playing the day out.\"\n\nRight-hander Kevin Gausman (3-3, 4.47 ERA) is set to get the call for the Blue Jays. Gausman will try for his third straight quality start after defeating the host Detroit Tigers on Thursday behind six innings of one-run, three-hit ball with two walks and a season-high 10 strikeouts.\n\nGausman is 1-0 with a 2.49 ERA in six appearances against Chicago, including four starts.\n\nWhite Sox right-hander Mike Clevinger (0-3, 6.75) remains in search of his first victory since rejoining the club in May. His defeats have come against Toronto's counterparts in the AL East -- the Tampa Bay Rays, New York Yankees and Orioles.\n\nLast Thursday, the Orioles reached Clevinger for five runs and seven hits, including two homers, in 4 2/3 innings. Clevinger surrendered a season high in hits (seven) and has not struck out more than five in any of his four starts.\n\nClevinger is 3-2 with a 5.08 ERA in six career appearances against the Blue Jays, including five starts.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Springer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Springer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Benintendi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Benintendi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Bichette", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bo Bichette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Gausman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Gausman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Clevinger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Clevinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Jai_Alai/Frontons", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Jai Alai/Frontons", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Jai_Alai", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Jai Alai", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601296", "eventUri": "eng-9601296", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 1689, "textEnd": 1697}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

The seven hole might be his permanent home", "body": "Springer hit his first home run in more than a month in Monday's win over the White Sox, from the lowest spot in the batting order of his career.\n\nBo Bichette and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. started turning their seasons around earlier this month. If the Blue Jays have any hope of overcoming their slow start, George Springer will have to do the same.\n\nSpringer arrived at Guaranteed Rate Field in Chicago on Monday morning to find himself hitting seventh in the lineup against the White Sox. That's the lowest he had ever been in the batting order across an 11-year career in the major leagues.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nOnce known as one of the premier leadoff hitters in the game, Springer has seen his value plummet over the last two seasons. He might never regain his spot at the top of the order, but with an annual $25-million (U.S.) salary through 2026, the four-time all-star needs to at least contribute.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe managed to do that on Monday afternoon, when he responded to another demotion by slugging a two-run homer in the Jays' 5-1 victory over the White Sox. Davis Schneider also hit a two-run shot, while Chris Bassitt battled through an injury to toss five scoreless in the rare win.\n\nEntering Monday, Springer had a .537 on-base plus slugging percentage. Among qualified big leaguers, only Chicago White Sox outfielder Andrew Benintendi and Detroit Tigers infielder Javier B\u00e1ez had performed worse.\n\nThat the Jays were so slow to move Springer down in the order shows just how desperate they are for him to produce. While Bichette and Guerrero got shuffled during their struggles, the former Houston Astro remained in the top spot for 38 games.\n\nThose days are over. Schneider was promoted to leadoff and has spent 12 games there, with a .661 OPS. The performance hasn't been great, but it still counts as a significant upgrade over the .554 Springer was providing. Anything is better than nothing.\n\nThe controversy over where Springer should be batting mercifully went away after he was dropped to sixth (and now seventh) in the order, but it didn't solve the problem. The Jays aren't getting enough offence from too many players. The guy signed to be a star had become a liability.\n\nIt's going to take more than a two-run homer against the last-place White Sox to change that narrative. At 34, Springer isn't just attempting to break out of a two-month slump; he's trying to regain the form that has been missing for the better part of two years.\n\nSince the start of 2023, Springer's .688 OPS ranks 12th-worst among all qualified big-league hitters. He's batting .242 with just 25 homers over his last 201 games. Even the plus defence he provides in right field comes with an asterisk, because he was originally signed to play a more physically demanding position in centre.\n\nThe struggles have gone on long enough that there's reason to believe this is the type of player to expect in the future. Just don't count on the Jays agreeing publicly. With more than $60 million remaining on his contract, they have no choice but to cross their fingers for a late-career renaissance.\n\nThere was a positive development on that front when Springer homered Monday. The two-run shot in the second inning off Nick Nastrini -- a right-hander with an unseemly 9.92 ERA -- gave the Jays the only offence they would need against a weak opponent. Bichette added a solo homer in the fourth, while Schneider's sixth of the year came in the ninth.\n\nThat was enough for Bassitt to earn the win even as he pitched through injury. He admitted to reporters after the game that he woke up with a stiff neck and initially didn't know if he'd be able to play. The 35-year-old right-hander gutted through five scoreless, scattering five hits while striking out seven.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nNobody should be getting too excited about this victory. One day before the series began, the White Sox were called out by their manager in a closed-door meeting. Their 15 wins are the fewest in the majors and they have the worst record after 55 games in franchise history.\n\nThe White Sox are so bad that at least a handful of minor-league teams would have a shot at winning a series against them, so seeing the Jays do the same with another victory on Tuesday or Wednesday won't mean much.\n\nBut for an organization grasping for positives in a season that has been going off the rails, the Jays will take it. Just like they'll take Springer's first home run in more than a month. It has to start somewhere, right?\n\nIn a week or two, when the schedule becomes more difficult, Monday's positives probably won't matter much. The fact that they might, though, at least gives the Jays hope in what is quickly becoming a lost year for the team and its $150-million man.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gregor_chisholm@thestar.com", "name": "Gregor Chisholm", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Springer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Springer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bassitt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Bassitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Guerrero_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Guerrero Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Bichette", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bo Bichette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_Rate_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guaranteed Rate Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Benintendi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Benintendi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_B\u00e1ez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Javier B\u00e1ez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Jai_Alai/Frontons", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Jai Alai/Frontons", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Jai_Alai", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Jai Alai", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/04/b046633e-ea74-59c4-84f5-eb0ca655dda3/66551fb75ce25.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601296", "eventUri": "eng-9601296", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

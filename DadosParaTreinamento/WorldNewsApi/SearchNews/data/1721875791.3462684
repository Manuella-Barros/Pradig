Born in Los Angeles but living with his adopted family in Oregon, Wild Thang has competed for five years in the annual contest, with Friday's big win being his first after finishing second three times. VIRAL 'PAWS IN' CHALLENGE EXPLODES AMONG DOG OWNERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA: 'ALL PAWS ON DECK!' One \"World's Ugliest Dog\" judge said, \"It's kind of like the bridesmaid and never the bride.\" Wild Thang loves to be \"held and cuddled\" as well as \"sleep on ice packs.\" Wild Thang narrowly survived distemper while with a foster family in Southern California as a puppy and has a waddling right leg and improperly growing teeth. The Pekingese and its owner, Ann Lewis, compete in support of vaccinations for dogs. The competitors shared their stories and strutted their stuff to win over the judges, as well as the sponsor, Mug Root Beer.

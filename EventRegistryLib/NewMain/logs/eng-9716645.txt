It could point to the birth of fashion", "body": "The eyed needle -- a sewing tool made of bones, antlers or ivory that first appeared around 40,000 years ago in southern Siberia -- might be hiding important clues about the beginnings of fashion, a new study has found.\n\nResearchers looked at existing archaeological evidence from dozens of sites across Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, southern Africa and Australia, where ancient tools used to make clothes had been discovered, according to the research published June 28 in the journal Science Advances. The circumstances surrounding eyed needles raised a number of questions.\n\n\"Eyed needles made sewing more efficient and reflected the advent of fitted or tailored clothing,\" said lead study author Ian Gilligan, honorary associate in the discipline of archaeology at the University of Sydney in Australia.\n\nHowever, historical evidence exists for earlier tools that were used for making clothes, albeit with less precision. \"So why did eyed needles start to appear in the colder parts of Eurasia as the climate was getting colder, from around 40,000 years ago and leading into the peak of the last glacial period, around 22,000 years ago?\"\n\nAccording to Gilligan, this enhanced precision might have served a purpose beyond tailoring for prehistoric humans: self-expression.\n\n\"During the colder parts of the last ice age, people needed to cover their bodies more or less continuously,\" he said, adding that clothing would have nullified some traditional ways of decorating the body for social purposes seen in many hunter-gatherer societies, such as body painting, tattooing and scarification.\n\n\"Once people need to wear clothes all the time because of the cold, then how do you decorate yourself? How do you alter your appearance for social purposes? And the answer is that you shift the decoration from the surface of the skin onto the surface of the clothes,\" Gilligan said.\n\nAccording to this interpretation, eyed needles, one of the symbols of the Paleolithic age, were not simple tailoring tools but also instruments for the social and cultural development of prehistoric humans.\n\nA marker of change\n\nEyed needles were not exclusively used for decorative purposes, the new study noted. They could also have been used to create more tight-fitting clothing or tailor layers such as underwear.\n\nArchaeological discoveries have unearthed older tools for tailoring, such as bone awls -- which are simply sharpened animal bones found to have been used for cutting animal hides.\n\n\"We don't need to have eyed needles to manufacture clothing,\" he said. \"We now know that other technologies already existed before them, which raises the question of why eyed needles were invented.\"\n\nThere is evidence for the decoration of clothing during the last glacial cycle, Gilligan added, citing the discovery of a burial site near Moscow where skeletons believed to be 30,000 years old were adorned with thousands of pierced ivory beads and shells. \"In all likelihood, they were sewn onto the outer surface of clothing for decoration,\" he said.\n\nThis evidence would support the theory that eyed needles played a role in decoration, without ruling out their use for tailoring. \"Those two purposes, they're not mutually exclusive at all. And in fact, they go together,\" Gilligan said. \"Once you're covering a body more completely, then you need to transfer decoration onto the clothing, and eyed needles would be useful for both.\"\n\nIt's likely that the hypothesis will never find a material confirmation, because the oldest clothes ever found are about 5,000 years old -- textile materials and leather can't be preserved for much longer. However, the practice would suggest a much earlier cultural and social use of garments than previously believed.\n\n\"Clothing didn't acquire its social purpose until towards the end of the last glacial cycle -- that's why we think clothing, for the first time, has continued to be used by humans when it wasn't needed for thermal insulation, around 12,000 years ago,\" Gilligan said.\n\n\"Our study shows that eyed needles are a marker for this change in the function of clothing, from thermal to social necessity,\" he added.\n\nConnecting to the past\n\nThis study is important not only because it reinforces the significance of clothing and dress in understanding the development of human cultures, but also because it brings differing perspectives in art and science closer together, said Liza Foley, an assistant professor at Ghent University and a curator of fashion and textiles at the Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels, Belgium. Foley was not involved with the research.\n\nApril Nowell, a professor and Distinguished Lansdowne Fellow at the department of anthropology of the University of Victoria in Canada, said it can sometimes be difficult for scientists to help people connect to such a remote past as the Paleolithic, and archaeologists have the added challenge of having to make the most of every artifact they find.\n\n\"Objects like clothing do not preserve over thousands of years, but bone and mammoth ivory needles do, and they can tell us about our ancestors' technological knowledge and the ways they adapted to both their physical and cultural environments,\" said Nowell, who was also not involved with the study.\n\nIt's these kinds of objects we can all relate to that help to humanize the past, she added.\n\n\"Other than material, the eyed needle really hasn't changed in any practical sense for millennia,\" she said via email.\n\nThere is evidence for loom-woven and even dyed textiles beginning roughly 30,000 years ago, she concluded. As a result, scientists can infer the kinds of decision-making people would have to go through to make a spun, dyed garment -- which plants to use, the manner of spinning, how to decorate the item of clothing and ultimately how to protect it from the elements when living outside most of the time.\n\n\"And all of this knowledge would be passed from generation to generation,\" Nowell said, \"so something as simple and seemingly insignificant as a needle opens up a window onto the unexpected richness of the lives of Ice Age peoples.\"", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news",

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nThe eyed needle -- a sewing tool made of bones, antlers or ivory that first appeared around 40,000 years ago in southern Siberia -- might be hiding important clues about the beginnings of fashion, a new study has found.\n\nResearchers looked at existing archaeological evidence from dozens of sites across Europe, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, southern Africa and Australia, where ancient tools used to make clothes had been discovered, according to the research published June 28 in the journal Science Advances. The circumstances surrounding eyed needles raised a number of questions.\n\n\"Eyed needles made sewing more efficient and reflected the advent of fitted or tailored clothing,\" said lead study author Ian Gilligan, honorary associate in the discipline of archaeology at the University of Sydney in Australia.\n\nHowever, historical evidence exists for earlier tools that were used for making clothes, albeit with less precision. \"So why did eyed needles start to appear in the colder parts of Eurasia as the climate was getting colder, from around 40,000 years ago and leading into the peak of the last glacial period, around 22,000 years ago?\"\n\nAccording to Gilligan, this enhanced precision might have served a purpose beyond tailoring for prehistoric humans: self-expression.\n\n\"During the colder parts of the last ice age, people needed to cover their bodies more or less continuously,\" he said, adding that clothing would have nullified some traditional ways of decorating the body for social purposes seen in many hunter-gatherer societies, such as body painting, tattooing and scarification.\n\n\"Once people need to wear clothes all the time because of the cold, then how do you decorate yourself? How do you alter your appearance for social purposes? And the answer is that you shift the decoration from the surface of the skin onto the surface of the clothes,\" Gilligan said.\n\nAccording to this interpretation, eyed needles, one of the symbols of the Paleolithic age, were not simple tailoring tools but also instruments for the social and cultural development of prehistoric humans.\n\nA marker of change\n\nEyed needles were not exclusively used for decorative purposes, the new study noted. They could also have been used to create more tight-fitting clothing or tailor layers such as underwear.\n\nArchaeological discoveries have unearthed older tools for tailoring, such as bone awls -- which are simply sharpened animal bones found to have been used for cutting animal hides.\n\n\"We don't need to have eyed needles to manufacture clothing,\" he said. \"We now know that other technologies already existed before them, which raises the question of why eyed needles were invented.\"\n\nAn artist's illustration shows how prehistoric humans could have used tailored clothing for decorative purposes.\n\nMariana Ariza\n\nThere is evidence for the decoration of clothing during the last glacial cycle, Gilligan added, citing the discovery of a burial site near Moscow where skeletons believed to be 30,000 years old were adorned with thousands of pierced ivory beads and shells. \"In all likelihood, they were sewn onto the outer surface of clothing for decoration,\" he said.\n\nThis evidence would support the theory that eyed needles played a role in decoration, without ruling out their use for tailoring. \"Those two purposes, they're not mutually exclusive at all. And in fact, they go together,\" Gilligan said. \"Once you're covering a body more completely, then you need to transfer decoration onto the clothing, and eyed needles would be useful for both.\"\n\nIt's likely that the hypothesis will never find a material confirmation, because the oldest clothes ever found are about 5,000 years old -- textile materials and leather can't be preserved for much longer. However, the practice would suggest a much earlier cultural and social use of garments than previously believed.\n\n\"Clothing didn't acquire its social purpose until towards the end of the last glacial cycle -- that's why we think clothing, for the first time, has continued to be used by humans when it wasn't needed for thermal insulation, around 12,000 years ago,\" Gilligan said.\n\n\"Our study shows that eyed needles are a marker for this change in the function of clothing, from thermal to social necessity,\" he added.\n\nConnecting to the past\n\nThis study is important not only because it reinforces the significance of clothing and dress in understanding the development of human cultures, but also because it brings differing perspectives in art and science closer together, said Liza Foley, an assistant professor at Ghent University and a curator of fashion and textiles at the Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels, Belgium. Foley was not involved with the research.\n\nApril Nowell, a professor and Distinguished Lansdowne Fellow at the department of anthropology of the University of Victoria in Canada, said it can sometimes be difficult for scientists to help people connect to such a remote past as the Paleolithic, and archaeologists have the added challenge of having to make the most of every artifact they find.\n\n\"Objects like clothing do not preserve over thousands of years, but bone and mammoth ivory needles do, and they can tell us about our ancestors' technological knowledge and the ways they adapted to both their physical and cultural environments,\" said Nowell, who was also not involved with the study.\n\nIt's these kinds of objects we can all relate to that help to humanize the past, she added.\n\n\"Other than material, the eyed needle really hasn't changed in any practical sense for millennia,\" she said via email.\n\nThere is evidence for loom-woven and even dyed textiles beginning roughly 30,000 years ago, she concluded. As a result, scientists can infer the kinds of decision-making people would have to go through to make a spun, dyed garment -- which plants to use, the manner of spinning, how to decorate the item of clothing and ultimately how to protect it from the elements when living outside most of the time.\n\n\"And all of this knowledge would be passed from generation to generation,\" Nowell said, \"so something as simple and seemingly insignificant as a needle opens up a window onto the unexpected richness of the lives of Ice Age peoples.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news",

How do you alter your appearance for social purposes? And the answer is that you shift the decoration from the surface of the skin onto the surface of the clothes,\" Gilligan said.\n\nAccording to this interpretation, eyed needles, one of the symbols of the Paleolithic age, were not simple tailoring tools but also instruments for the social and cultural development of prehistoric humans.\n\nA marker of change\n\nEyed needles were not exclusively used for decorative purposes, the new study noted. They could also have been used to create more tight-fitting clothing or tailor layers such as underwear.\n\nArcheological discoveries have unearthed older tools for tailoring, such as bone awls -- which are simply sharpened animal bones found to have been used for cutting animal hides.\n\nEyed needles, which began appearing around 40,000 years ago, served a purpose beyond tailoring for prehistoric humans, a new study has found. (Gilligan et al via CNN Newsource)\n\n\"We don't need to have eyed needles to manufacture clothing,\" he said. \"We now know that other technologies already existed before them, which raises the question of why eyed needles were invented.\"\n\nThere is evidence for the decoration of clothing during the last glacial cycle, Gilligan added, citing the discovery of a burial site near Moscow where skeletons believed to be 30,000 years old were adorned with thousands of pierced ivory beads and shells. \"In all likelihood, they were sewn onto the outer surface of clothing for decoration,\" he said.\n\nThis evidence would support the theory that eyed needles played a role in decoration, without ruling out their use for tailoring. \"Those two purposes, they're not mutually exclusive at all. And in fact, they go together,\" Gilligan said. \"Once you're covering a body more completely, then you need to transfer decoration onto the clothing, and eyed needles would be useful for both.\"\n\nIt's likely that the hypothesis will never find a material confirmation, because the oldest clothes ever found are about 5,000 years old -- textile materials and leather can't be preserved for much longer. However, the practice would suggest a much earlier cultural and social use of garments than previously believed.\n\n\"Clothing didn't acquire its social purpose until towards the end of the last glacial cycle -- that's why we think clothing, for the first time, has continued to be used by humans when it wasn't needed for thermal insulation, around 12,000 years ago,\" Gilligan said.\n\n\"Our study shows that eyed needles are a marker for this change in the function of clothing, from thermal to social necessity,\" he added.\n\nConnecting to the past\n\nThis study is important not only because it reinforces the significance of clothing and dress in understanding the development of human cultures, but also because it brings differing perspectives in art and science closer together, said Liza Foley, an assistant professor at Ghent University and a curator of fashion and textiles at the Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels, Belgium. Foley was not involved with the research.\n\nApril Nowell, a professor and Distinguished Lansdowne Fellow at the department of anthropology of the University of Victoria in Canada, said it can sometimes be difficult for scientists to help people connect to such a remote past as the Paleolithic, and archeologists have the added challenge of having to make the most of every artifact they find.\n\n\"Objects like clothing do not preserve over thousands of years, but bone and mammoth ivory needles do, and they can tell us about our ancestors' technological knowledge and the ways they adapted to both their physical and cultural environments,\" said Nowell, who was also not involved with the study.\n\nIt's these kinds of objects we can all relate to that help to humanize the past, she added.\n\n\"Other than material, the eyed needle really hasn't changed in any practical sense for millennia,\" she said via email.\n\nThere is evidence for loom-woven and even dyed textiles beginning roughly 30,000 years ago, she concluded. As a result, scientists can infer the kinds of decision-making people would have to go through to make a spun, dyed garment -- which plants to use, the manner of spinning, how to decorate the item of clothing and ultimately how to protect it from the elements when living outside most of the time.\n\n\"And all of this knowledge would be passed from generation to generation,\" Nowell said, \"so something as simple and seemingly insignificant as a needle opens up a window onto the unexpected richness of the lives of Ice Age peoples.\"", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news",

And the answer is that you shift the decoration from the surface of the skin onto the surface of the clothes,\" Gilligan said.\n\nAccording to this interpretation, eyed needles, one of the symbols of the Paleolithic age, were not simple tailoring tools but also instruments for the social and cultural development of prehistoric humans.\n\nA marker of change\n\nEyed needles were not exclusively used for decorative purposes, the new study noted. They could also have been used to create more tight-fitting clothing or tailor layers such as underwear.\n\nArchaeological discoveries have unearthed older tools for tailoring, such as bone awls -- which are simply sharpened animal bones found to have been used for cutting animal hides.\n\n\"We don't need to have eyed needles to manufacture clothing,\" he said. \"We now know that other technologies already existed before them, which raises the question of why eyed needles were invented.\"\n\nThere is evidence for the decoration of clothing during the last glacial cycle, Gilligan added, citing the discovery of a burial site near Moscow where skeletons believed to be 30,000 years old were adorned with thousands of pierced ivory beads and shells. \"In all likelihood, they were sewn onto the outer surface of clothing for decoration,\" he said.\n\nThis evidence would support the theory that eyed needles played a role in decoration, without ruling out their use for tailoring. \"Those two purposes, they're not mutually exclusive at all. And in fact, they go together,\" Gilligan said. \"Once you're covering a body more completely, then you need to transfer decoration onto the clothing, and eyed needles would be useful for both.\"\n\nIt's likely that the hypothesis will never find a material confirmation, because the oldest clothes ever found are about 5,000 years old -- textile materials and leather can't be preserved for much longer. However, the practice would suggest a much earlier cultural and social use of garments than previously believed.\n\n\"Clothing didn't acquire its social purpose until towards the end of the last glacial cycle -- that's why we think clothing, for the first time, has continued to be used by humans when it wasn't needed for thermal insulation, around 12,000 years ago,\" Gilligan said.\n\n\"Our study shows that eyed needles are a marker for this change in the function of clothing, from thermal to social necessity,\" he added.\n\nConnecting to the past\n\nThis study is important not only because it reinforces the significance of clothing and dress in understanding the development of human cultures, but also because it brings differing perspectives in art and science closer together, said Liza Foley, an assistant professor at Ghent University and a curator of fashion and textiles at the Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels, Belgium. Foley was not involved with the research.\n\nApril Nowell, a professor and Distinguished Lansdowne Fellow at the department of anthropology of the University of Victoria in Canada, said it can sometimes be difficult for scientists to help people connect to such a remote past as the Paleolithic, and archaeologists have the added challenge of having to make the most of every artifact they find.\n\n\"Objects like clothing do not preserve over thousands of years, but bone and mammoth ivory needles do, and they can tell us about our ancestors' technological knowledge and the ways they adapted to both their physical and cultural environments,\" said Nowell, who was also not involved with the study.\n\nIt's these kinds of objects we can all relate to that help to humanize the past, she added.\n\n\"Other than material, the eyed needle really hasn't changed in any practical sense for millennia,\" she said via email.\n\nThere is evidence for loom-woven and even dyed textiles beginning roughly 30,000 years ago, she concluded. As a result, scientists can infer the kinds of decision-making people would have to go through to make a spun, dyed garment -- which plants to use, the manner of spinning, how to decorate the item of clothing and ultimately how to protect it from the elements when living outside most of the time.\n\n\"And all of this knowledge would be passed from generation to generation,\" Nowell said, \"so something as simple and seemingly insignificant as a needle opens up a window onto the unexpected richness of the lives of Ice Age peoples.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The circumstances surrounding eyed needles raised a number of questions.\n\n\"Eyed needles made sewing more efficient and reflected the advent of fitted or tailored clothing,\" said lead study author Ian Gilligan, honorary associate in the discipline of archaeology at the University of Sydney in Australia.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Here are some games with intriguing storylines Scientists say they've confirmed a slowdown in Earth's inner core rotation. Now what?\n\nHowever, historical evidence exists for earlier tools that were used for making clothes, albeit with less precision. \"So why did eyed needles start to appear in the colder parts of Eurasia as the climate was getting colder, from around 40,000 years ago and leading into the peak of the last glacial period, around 22,000 years ago?\"\n\nAccording to Gilligan, this enhanced precision might have served a purpose beyond tailoring for prehistoric humans: self-expression.\n\n\"During the colder parts of the last ice age, people needed to cover their bodies more or less continuously,\" he said, adding that clothing would have nullified some traditional ways of decorating the body for social purposes seen in many hunter-gatherer societies, such as body painting, tattooing and scarification.\n\n\"Once people need to wear clothes all the time because of the cold, then how do you decorate yourself? How do you alter your appearance for social purposes? And the answer is that you shift the decoration from the surface of the skin onto the surface of the clothes,\" Gilligan said.\n\nAccording to this interpretation, eyed needles, one of the symbols of the Paleolithic age, were not simple tailoring tools but also instruments for the social and cultural development of prehistoric humans.\n\nA marker of change\n\nEyed needles were not exclusively used for decorative purposes, the new study noted. They could also have been used to create more tight-fitting clothing or tailor layers such as underwear.\n\nArchaeological discoveries have unearthed older tools for tailoring, such as bone awls -- which are simply sharpened animal bones found to have been used for cutting animal hides.\n\n\"We don't need to have eyed needles to manufacture clothing,\" he said. \"We now know that other technologies already existed before them, which raises the question of why eyed needles were invented.\"\n\nThere is evidence for the decoration of clothing during the last glacial cycle, Gilligan added, citing the discovery of a burial site near Moscow where skeletons believed to be 30,000 years old were adorned with thousands of pierced ivory beads and shells. \"In all likelihood, they were sewn onto the outer surface of clothing for decoration,\" he said.\n\nThis evidence would support the theory that eyed needles played a role in decoration, without ruling out their use for tailoring. \"Those two purposes, they're not mutually exclusive at all. And in fact, they go together,\" Gilligan said. \"Once you're covering a body more completely, then you need to transfer decoration onto the clothing, and eyed needles would be useful for both.\"\n\nIt's likely that the hypothesis will never find a material confirmation, because the oldest clothes ever found are about 5,000 years old -- textile materials and leather can't be preserved for much longer. However, the practice would suggest a much earlier cultural and social use of garments than previously believed.\n\n\"Clothing didn't acquire its social purpose until towards the end of the last glacial cycle -- that's why we think clothing, for the first time, has continued to be used by humans when it wasn't needed for thermal insulation, around 12,000 years ago,\" Gilligan said.\n\n\"Our study shows that eyed needles are a marker for this change in the function of clothing, from thermal to social necessity,\" he added.\n\nConnecting to the past\n\nThis study is important not only because it reinforces the significance of clothing and dress in understanding the development of human cultures, but also because it brings differing perspectives in art and science closer together, said Liza Foley, an assistant professor at Ghent University and a curator of fashion and textiles at the Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels, Belgium. Foley was not involved with the research.\n\nApril Nowell, a professor and Distinguished Lansdowne Fellow at the department of anthropology of the University of Victoria in Canada, said it can sometimes be difficult for scientists to help people connect to such a remote past as the Paleolithic, and archaeologists have the added challenge of having to make the most of every artifact they find.\n\n\"Objects like clothing do not preserve over thousands of years, but bone and mammoth ivory needles do, and they can tell us about our ancestors' technological knowledge and the ways they adapted to both their physical and cultural environments,\" said Nowell, who was also not involved with the study.\n\nIt's these kinds of objects we can all relate to that help to humanize the past, she added.\n\n\"Other than material, the eyed needle really hasn't changed in any practical sense for millennia,\" she said via email.\n\nThere is evidence for loom-woven and even dyed textiles beginning roughly 30,000 years ago, she concluded. As a result, scientists can infer the kinds of decision-making people would have to go through to make a spun, dyed garment -- which plants to use, the manner of spinning, how to decorate the item of clothing and ultimately how to protect it from the elements when living outside most of the time.\n\n\"And all of this knowledge would be passed from generation to generation,\" Nowell said, \"so something as simple and seemingly insignificant as a needle opens up a window onto the unexpected richness of the lives of Ice Age peoples.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

How do you alter your appearance for social purposes? And the answer is that you shift the decoration from the surface of the skin onto the surface of the clothes,\" Gilligan said.\n\nAccording to this interpretation, eyed needles, one of the symbols of the Paleolithic age, were not simple tailoring tools but also instruments for the social and cultural development of prehistoric humans.\n\nA marker of change\n\nEyed needles were not exclusively used for decorative purposes, the new study noted. They could also have been used to create more tight-fitting clothing or tailor layers such as underwear.\n\nArchaeological discoveries have unearthed older tools for tailoring, such as bone awls -- which are simply sharpened animal bones found to have been used for cutting animal hides.\n\n\"We don't need to have eyed needles to manufacture clothing,\" he said. \"We now know that other technologies already existed before them, which raises the question of why eyed needles were invented.\"\n\nThere is evidence for the decoration of clothing during the last glacial cycle, Gilligan added, citing the discovery of a burial site near Moscow where skeletons believed to be 30,000 years old were adorned with thousands of pierced ivory beads and shells. \"In all likelihood, they were sewn onto the outer surface of clothing for decoration,\" he said.\n\nThis evidence would support the theory that eyed needles played a role in decoration, without ruling out their use for tailoring. \"Those two purposes, they're not mutually exclusive at all. And in fact, they go together,\" Gilligan said. \"Once you're covering a body more completely, then you need to transfer decoration onto the clothing, and eyed needles would be useful for both.\"\n\nIt's likely that the hypothesis will never find a material confirmation, because the oldest clothes ever found are about 5,000 years old -- textile materials and leather can't be preserved for much longer. However, the practice would suggest a much earlier cultural and social use of garments than previously believed.\n\n\"Clothing didn't acquire its social purpose until towards the end of the last glacial cycle -- that's why we think clothing, for the first time, has continued to be used by humans when it wasn't needed for thermal insulation, around 12,000 years ago,\" Gilligan said.\n\n\"Our study shows that eyed needles are a marker for this change in the function of clothing, from thermal to social necessity,\" he added.\n\nConnecting to the past\n\nThis study is important not only because it reinforces the significance of clothing and dress in understanding the development of human cultures, but also because it brings differing perspectives in art and science closer together, said Liza Foley, an assistant professor at Ghent University and a curator of fashion and textiles at the Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels, Belgium. Foley was not involved with the research.\n\nApril Nowell, a professor and Distinguished Lansdowne Fellow at the department of anthropology of the University of Victoria in Canada, said it can sometimes be difficult for scientists to help people connect to such a remote past as the Paleolithic, and archaeologists have the added challenge of having to make the most of every artifact they find.\n\n\"Objects like clothing do not preserve over thousands of years, but bone and mammoth ivory needles do, and they can tell us about our ancestors' technological knowledge and the ways they adapted to both their physical and cultural environments,\" said Nowell, who was also not involved with the study.\n\nIt's these kinds of objects we can all relate to that help to humanize the past, she added.\n\n\"Other than material, the eyed needle really hasn't changed in any practical sense for millennia,\" she said via email.\n\nThere is evidence for loom-woven and even dyed textiles beginning roughly 30,000 years ago, she concluded. As a result, scientists can infer the kinds of decision-making people would have to go through to make a spun, dyed garment -- which plants to use, the manner of spinning, how to decorate the item of clothing and ultimately how to protect it from the elements when living outside most of the time.\n\n\"And all of this knowledge would be passed from generation to generation,\" Nowell said, \"so something as simple and seemingly insignificant as a needle opens up a window onto the unexpected richness of the lives of Ice Age peoples.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The circumstances surrounding the eyed needles have raised a number of questions.\n\nEyed needles made sewing more efficient and reflected the advent of tailored or fitted clothing, said the study's lead author, Ian Gilligan, an honorary associate in the discipline of archaeology at the University of Sydney in Australia.\n\nThere is, however, historical evidence of older tools used for making clothes, albeit with less precision. So why did needles with eyes begin to appear in the colder regions of Eurasia as the climate cooled, starting around 40,000 years ago and continuing until the peak of the last ice age around 22,000 years ago?\n\nAccording to Gilligan, this increased precision may have served a purpose beyond sewing for prehistoric humans: self-expression.\n\nDuring the coldest periods of the last ice age, people had to cover their bodies more or less constantly, he said, adding that clothing would have negated some traditional ways of decorating the body for social purposes seen in many hunter-gatherer societies, such as body painting, tattooing and scarification.\n\nIf people have to wear clothes all the time because of the cold, how do you decorate yourself? How do you change your appearance for social purposes? And the answer is that you move decoration from the surface of the skin to the surface of the clothing, Gilligan explained.\n\nAccording to this interpretation, needles with eyes, one of the symbols of the Paleolithic age, were not simple sewing tools but also instruments of social and cultural development of prehistoric man.\n\nEyed needles weren't just used for decorative purposes, the new study says. They could also have been used to create more fitted garments or to create tailored layers of clothing, such as underwear.\n\nArchaeological discoveries have uncovered older sewing tools, such as bone awls, which are simply sharpened animal bones that would have been used to cut animal hides.\n\n\"We don't need needles with eyes to make clothes,\" he said. \"We now know that other technologies existed before them, which raises the question of why needles with eyes were invented.\"\n\nThere is evidence of clothing decoration during the last ice age, Gilligan added, citing the discovery of a burial site near Moscow where 30,000-year-old skeletons were adorned with thousands of ivory beads and pierced shells. In all likelihood, these were sewn onto the outer surface of the garments for decorative purposes, he added.\n\nThis evidence would support the theory that eyed needles played a role in decoration, without precluding their use for sewing. These two functions are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they go hand in hand, Gilligan said. Once you cover a body more completely, you need to transfer the decoration to the garment, and eyed needles would be useful for both.\n\nIt is likely that this hypothesis will never find material confirmation, since the oldest clothing ever discovered is textiles that are about 5,000 years old, and leather cannot be preserved much longer. However, this practice suggests a cultural and social use of clothing that is much older than previously thought.\n\nClothing only acquired its social function toward the end of the last ice age, which is why we think that clothing, for the first time, continued to be used by humans when it was not needed for thermal insulation, about 12,000 years ago, Gilligan said.\n\nOur study shows that needles with eyes are a marker of this shift in the function of clothing, from a thermal necessity to a social necessity, he added.\n\nThis study is important not only because it reinforces the importance of clothing and attire in understanding the development of human cultures, but also because it brings together the different perspectives of art and science, said Liza Foley, an assistant professor at Ghent University and curator of fashion and textiles at the Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels, Belgium. Foley was not involved in the research.\n\nApril Nowell, a professor and Lansdowne Distinguished Fellow in the department of anthropology at the University of Victoria in Canada, said it can sometimes be difficult for scientists to help people connect to a past as distant as the Paleolithic, and archaeologists have the added challenge of having to make the most of every artifact they find.\n\nObjects like clothing don't last for thousands of years, but mammoth bone and ivory needles do, and they can tell us about our ancestors' technological knowledge and how they adapted to their physical and cultural environments, said Nowell, who also was not involved in the study.\n\nIt's these kinds of objects that we can all relate to that help humanize the past, she added.\n\n\"Apart from the material, the needle hasn't really changed from a practical standpoint in millennia,\" she said via email.\n\nThere is evidence She concluded that loom-woven and even dyed textiles began about 30,000 years ago. Scientists can now infer the kinds of decisions people had to make to make a spun and dyed garment, including what plants to use, how to spin it, how to decorate the garment, and how to protect it from the elements when they lived outdoors most of the time.\n\nAnd all of this knowledge would be passed down from generation to generation, Nowell said, so something as simple and seemingly insignificant as a needle opens a window into the unexpected richness of life for Ice Age peoples.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [],

The circumstances surrounding eyed needles raised a number of questions.\n\n\"Eyed needles made sewing more efficient and reflected the advent of fitted or tailored clothing,\" said lead study author Ian Gilligan, honorary associate in the discipline of archaeology at the University of Sydney in Australia.\n\nPeople are also reading...

How do you alter your appearance for social purposes? And the answer is that you shift the decoration from the surface of the skin onto the surface of the clothes,\" Gilligan said.\n\nAccording to this interpretation, eyed needles, one of the symbols of the Paleolithic age, were not simple tailoring tools but also instruments for the social and cultural development of prehistoric humans.\n\nA marker of change\n\nEyed needles were not exclusively used for decorative purposes, the new study noted. They could also have been used to create more tight-fitting clothing or tailor layers such as underwear.\n\nArchaeological discoveries have unearthed older tools for tailoring, such as bone awls -- which are simply sharpened animal bones found to have been used for cutting animal hides.\n\n\"We don't need to have eyed needles to manufacture clothing,\" he said. \"We now know that other technologies already existed before them, which raises the question of why eyed needles were invented.\"\n\nThere is evidence for the decoration of clothing during the last glacial cycle, Gilligan added, citing the discovery of a burial site near Moscow where skeletons believed to be 30,000 years old were adorned with thousands of pierced ivory beads and shells. \"In all likelihood, they were sewn onto the outer surface of clothing for decoration,\" he said.\n\nThis evidence would support the theory that eyed needles played a role in decoration, without ruling out their use for tailoring. \"Those two purposes, they're not mutually exclusive at all. And in fact, they go together,\" Gilligan said. \"Once you're covering a body more completely, then you need to transfer decoration onto the clothing, and eyed needles would be useful for both.\"\n\nIt's likely that the hypothesis will never find a material confirmation, because the oldest clothes ever found are about 5,000 years old -- textile materials and leather can't be preserved for much longer. However, the practice would suggest a much earlier cultural and social use of garments than previously believed.\n\n\"Clothing didn't acquire its social purpose until towards the end of the last glacial cycle -- that's why we think clothing, for the first time, has continued to be used by humans when it wasn't needed for thermal insulation, around 12,000 years ago,\" Gilligan said.\n\n\"Our study shows that eyed needles are a marker for this change in the function of clothing, from thermal to social necessity,\" he added.\n\nConnecting to the past\n\nThis study is important not only because it reinforces the significance of clothing and dress in understanding the development of human cultures, but also because it brings differing perspectives in art and science closer together, said Liza Foley, an assistant professor at Ghent University and a curator of fashion and textiles at the Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels, Belgium. Foley was not involved with the research.\n\nApril Nowell, a professor and Distinguished Lansdowne Fellow at the department of anthropology of the University of Victoria in Canada, said it can sometimes be difficult for scientists to help people connect to such a remote past as the Paleolithic, and archaeologists have the added challenge of having to make the most of every artifact they find.\n\n\"Objects like clothing do not preserve over thousands of years, but bone and mammoth ivory needles do, and they can tell us about our ancestors' technological knowledge and the ways they adapted to both their physical and cultural environments,\" said Nowell, who was also not involved with the study.\n\nIt's these kinds of objects we can all relate to that help to humanize the past, she added.\n\n\"Other than material, the eyed needle really hasn't changed in any practical sense for millennia,\" she said via email.\n\nThere is evidence for loom-woven and even dyed textiles beginning roughly 30,000 years ago, she concluded. As a result, scientists can infer the kinds of decision-making people would have to go through to make a spun, dyed garment -- which plants to use, the manner of spinning, how to decorate the item of clothing and ultimately how to protect it from the elements when living outside most of the time.\n\n\"And all of this knowledge would be passed from generation to generation,\" Nowell said, \"so something as simple and seemingly insignificant as a needle opens up a window onto the unexpected richness of the lives of Ice Age peoples.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

How do you alter your appearance for social purposes? And the answer is that you shift the decoration from the surface of the skin onto the surface of the clothes,\" Gilligan said.\n\nAccording to this interpretation, eyed needles, one of the symbols of the Paleolithic age, were not simple tailoring tools but also instruments for the social and cultural development of prehistoric humans.\n\nA marker of change\n\nEyed needles were not exclusively used for decorative purposes, the new study noted. They could also have been used to create more tight-fitting clothing or tailor layers such as underwear.\n\nArchaeological discoveries have unearthed older tools for tailoring, such as bone awls -- which are simply sharpened animal bones found to have been used for cutting animal hides.\n\n\"We don't need to have eyed needles to manufacture clothing,\" he said. \"We now know that other technologies already existed before them, which raises the question of why eyed needles were invented.\"\n\nThere is evidence for the decoration of clothing during the last glacial cycle, Gilligan added, citing the discovery of a burial site near Moscow where skeletons believed to be 30,000 years old were adorned with thousands of pierced ivory beads and shells. \"In all likelihood, they were sewn onto the outer surface of clothing for decoration,\" he said.\n\nThis evidence would support the theory that eyed needles played a role in decoration, without ruling out their use for tailoring. \"Those two purposes, they're not mutually exclusive at all. And in fact, they go together,\" Gilligan said. \"Once you're covering a body more completely, then you need to transfer decoration onto the clothing, and eyed needles would be useful for both.\"\n\nIt's likely that the hypothesis will never find a material confirmation, because the oldest clothes ever found are about 5,000 years old -- textile materials and leather can't be preserved for much longer. However, the practice would suggest a much earlier cultural and social use of garments than previously believed.\n\n\"Clothing didn't acquire its social purpose until towards the end of the last glacial cycle -- that's why we think clothing, for the first time, has continued to be used by humans when it wasn't needed for thermal insulation, around 12,000 years ago,\" Gilligan said.\n\n\"Our study shows that eyed needles are a marker for this change in the function of clothing, from thermal to social necessity,\" he added.\n\nConnecting to the past\n\nThis study is important not only because it reinforces the significance of clothing and dress in understanding the development of human cultures, but also because it brings differing perspectives in art and science closer together, said Liza Foley, an assistant professor at Ghent University and a curator of fashion and textiles at the Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels, Belgium. Foley was not involved with the research.\n\nApril Nowell, a professor and Distinguished Lansdowne Fellow at the department of anthropology of the University of Victoria in Canada, said it can sometimes be difficult for scientists to help people connect to such a remote past as the Paleolithic, and archaeologists have the added challenge of having to make the most of every artifact they find.\n\n\"Objects like clothing do not preserve over thousands of years, but bone and mammoth ivory needles do, and they can tell us about our ancestors' technological knowledge and the ways they adapted to both their physical and cultural environments,\" said Nowell, who was also not involved with the study.\n\nIt's these kinds of objects we can all relate to that help to humanize the past, she added.\n\n\"Other than material, the eyed needle really hasn't changed in any practical sense for millennia,\" she said via email.\n\nThere is evidence for loom-woven and even dyed textiles beginning roughly 30,000 years ago, she concluded.

How do you alter your appearance for social purposes? And the answer is that you shift the decoration from the surface of the skin onto the surface of the clothes,\" Gilligan said.\n\nAccording to this interpretation, eyed needles, one of the symbols of the Paleolithic age, were not simple tailoring tools but also instruments for the social and cultural development of prehistoric humans.\n\nA marker of change\n\nEyed needles were not exclusively used for decorative purposes, the new study noted. They could also have been used to create more tight-fitting clothing or tailor layers such as underwear.\n\nArchaeological discoveries have unearthed older tools for tailoring, such as bone awls -- which are simply sharpened animal bones found to have been used for cutting animal hides.\n\n\"We don't need to have eyed needles to manufacture clothing,\" he said. \"We now know that other technologies already existed before them, which raises the question of why eyed needles were invented.\"\n\nThere is evidence for the decoration of clothing during the last glacial cycle, Gilligan added, citing the discovery of a burial site near Moscow where skeletons believed to be 30,000 years old were adorned with thousands of pierced ivory beads and shells. \"In all likelihood, they were sewn onto the outer surface of clothing for decoration,\" he said.\n\nThis evidence would support the theory that eyed needles played a role in decoration, without ruling out their use for tailoring. \"Those two purposes, they're not mutually exclusive at all. And in fact, they go together,\" Gilligan said. \"Once you're covering a body more completely, then you need to transfer decoration onto the clothing, and eyed needles would be useful for both.\"\n\nIt's likely that the hypothesis will never find a material confirmation, because the oldest clothes ever found are about 5,000 years old -- textile materials and leather can't be preserved for much longer. However, the practice would suggest a much earlier cultural and social use of garments than previously believed.\n\n\"Clothing didn't acquire its social purpose until towards the end of the last glacial cycle -- that's why we think clothing, for the first time, has continued to be used by humans when it wasn't needed for thermal insulation, around 12,000 years ago,\" Gilligan said.\n\n\"Our study shows that eyed needles are a marker for this change in the function of clothing, from thermal to social necessity,\" he added.\n\nConnecting to the past\n\nThis study is important not only because it reinforces the significance of clothing and dress in understanding the development of human cultures, but also because it brings differing perspectives in art and science closer together, said Liza Foley, an assistant professor at Ghent University and a curator of fashion and textiles at the Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels, Belgium. Foley was not involved with the research.\n\nApril Nowell, a professor and Distinguished Lansdowne Fellow at the department of anthropology of the University of Victoria in Canada, said it can sometimes be difficult for scientists to help people connect to such a remote past as the Paleolithic, and archaeologists have the added challenge of having to make the most of every artifact they find.\n\n\"Objects like clothing do not preserve over thousands of years, but bone and mammoth ivory needles do, and they can tell us about our ancestors' technological knowledge and the ways they adapted to both their physical and cultural environments,\" said Nowell, who was also not involved with the study.\n\nIt's these kinds of objects we can all relate to that help to humanize the past, she added.\n\n\"Other than material, the eyed needle really hasn't changed in any practical sense for millennia,\" she said via email.\n\nThere is evidence for loom-woven and even dyed textiles beginning roughly 30,000 years ago, she concluded. As a result, scientists can infer the kinds of decision-making people would have to go through to make a spun, dyed garment -- which plants to use, the manner of spinning, how to decorate the item of clothing and ultimately how to protect it from the elements when living outside most of the time.\n\n\"And all of this knowledge would be passed from generation to generation,\" Nowell said, \"so something as simple and seemingly insignificant as a needle opens up a window onto the unexpected richness of the lives of Ice Age peoples.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

How do you alter your appearance for social purposes? And the answer is that you shift the decoration from the surface of the skin onto the surface of the clothes,\" Gilligan said.\n\nAccording to this interpretation, eyed needles, one of the symbols of the Paleolithic age, were not simple tailoring tools but also instruments for the social and cultural development of prehistoric humans.\n\nA marker of change\n\nEyed needles were not exclusively used for decorative purposes, the new study noted. They could also have been used to create more tight-fitting clothing or tailor layers such as underwear.\n\nArchaeological discoveries have unearthed older tools for tailoring, such as bone awls -- which are simply sharpened animal bones found to have been used for cutting animal hides.\n\n\"We don't need to have eyed needles to manufacture clothing,\" he said. \"We now know that other technologies already existed before them, which raises the question of why eyed needles were invented.\"\n\nThere is evidence for the decoration of clothing during the last glacial cycle, Gilligan added, citing the discovery of a burial site near Moscow where skeletons believed to be 30,000 years old were adorned with thousands of pierced ivory beads and shells. \"In all likelihood, they were sewn onto the outer surface of clothing for decoration,\" he said.\n\nThis evidence would support the theory that eyed needles played a role in decoration, without ruling out their use for tailoring. \"Those two purposes, they're not mutually exclusive at all. And in fact, they go together,\" Gilligan said. \"Once you're covering a body more completely, then you need to transfer decoration onto the clothing, and eyed needles would be useful for both.\"\n\nIt's likely that the hypothesis will never find a material confirmation, because the oldest clothes ever found are about 5,000 years old -- textile materials and leather can't be preserved for much longer. However, the practice would suggest a much earlier cultural and social use of garments than previously believed.\n\n\"Clothing didn't acquire its social purpose until towards the end of the last glacial cycle -- that's why we think clothing, for the first time, has continued to be used by humans when it wasn't needed for thermal insulation, around 12,000 years ago,\" Gilligan said.\n\n\"Our study shows that eyed needles are a marker for this change in the function of clothing, from thermal to social necessity,\" he added.\n\nConnecting to the past\n\nThis study is important not only because it reinforces the significance of clothing and dress in understanding the development of human cultures, but also because it brings differing perspectives in art and science closer together, said Liza Foley, an assistant professor at Ghent University and a curator of fashion and textiles at the Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels, Belgium. Foley was not involved with the research.\n\nApril Nowell, a professor and Distinguished Lansdowne Fellow at the department of anthropology of the University of Victoria in Canada, said it can sometimes be difficult for scientists to help people connect to such a remote past as the Paleolithic, and archaeologists have the added challenge of having to make the most of every artifact they find.\n\n\"Objects like clothing do not preserve over thousands of years, but bone and mammoth ivory needles do, and they can tell us about our ancestors' technological knowledge and the ways they adapted to both their physical and cultural environments,\" said Nowell, who was also not involved with the study.\n\nIt's these kinds of objects we can all relate to that help to humanize the past, she added.\n\n\"Other than material, the eyed needle really hasn't changed in any practical sense for millennia,\" she said via email.\n\nThere is evidence for loom-woven and even dyed textiles beginning roughly 30,000 years ago, she concluded.

However, the practice would suggest a much earlier cultural and social use of garments than previously believed.\n\n\"Clothing didn't acquire its social purpose until towards the end of the last glacial cycle -- that's why we think clothing, for the first time, has continued to be used by humans when it wasn't needed for thermal insulation, around 12,000 years ago,\" Gilligan said.\n\n\"Our study shows that eyed needles are a marker for this change in the function of clothing, from thermal to social necessity,\" he added.\n\nConnecting to the past\n\nThis study is important not only because it reinforces the significance of clothing and dress in understanding the development of human cultures, but also because it brings differing perspectives in art and science closer together, said Liza Foley, an assistant professor at Ghent University and a curator of fashion and textiles at the Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels, Belgium.

The circumstances surrounding the eyed needles have raised a number of questions.\n\nEyed needles made sewing more efficient and reflected the advent of tailored or fitted clothing, said the study's lead author, Ian Gilligan, an honorary associate in the discipline of archaeology at the University of Sydney in Australia.\n\nThere is, however, historical evidence of older tools used for making clothes, albeit with less precision. So why did needles with eyes begin to appear in the colder regions of Eurasia as the climate cooled, starting around 40,000 years ago and continuing until the peak of the last ice age around 22,000 years ago?\n\nAccording to Gilligan, this increased precision may have served a purpose beyond sewing for prehistoric humans: self-expression.\n\nDuring the coldest periods of the last ice age, people had to cover their bodies more or less constantly, he said, adding that clothing would have negated some traditional ways of decorating the body for social purposes seen in many hunter-gatherer societies, such as body painting, tattooing and scarification.\n\nIf people have to wear clothes all the time because of the cold, how do you decorate yourself? How do you change your appearance for social purposes? And the answer is that you move decoration from the surface of the skin to the surface of the clothing, Gilligan explained.\n\nAccording to this interpretation, needles with eyes, one of the symbols of the Paleolithic age, were not simple sewing tools but also instruments of social and cultural development of prehistoric man.\n\nEyed needles weren't just used for decorative purposes, the new study says. They could also have been used to create more fitted garments or to create tailored layers of clothing, such as underwear.\n\nArchaeological discoveries have uncovered older sewing tools, such as bone awls, which are simply sharpened animal bones that would have been used to cut animal hides.\n\n\"We don't need needles with eyes to make clothes,\" he said. \"We now know that other technologies existed before them, which raises the question of why needles with eyes were invented.\"\n\nThere is evidence of clothing decoration during the last ice age, Gilligan added, citing the discovery of a burial site near Moscow where 30,000-year-old skeletons were adorned with thousands of ivory beads and pierced shells. In all likelihood, these were sewn onto the outer surface of the garments for decorative purposes, he added.\n\nThis evidence would support the theory that eyed needles played a role in decoration, without precluding their use for sewing. These two functions are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they go hand in hand, Gilligan said. Once you cover a body more completely, you need to transfer the decoration to the garment, and eyed needles would be useful for both.\n\nIt is likely that this hypothesis will never find material confirmation, since the oldest clothing ever discovered is textiles that are about 5,000 years old, and leather cannot be preserved much longer. However, this practice suggests a cultural and social use of clothing that is much older than previously thought.\n\nClothing only acquired its social function toward the end of the last ice age, which is why we think that clothing, for the first time, continued to be used by humans when it was not needed for thermal insulation, about 12,000 years ago, Gilligan said.\n\nOur study shows that needles with eyes are a marker of this shift in the function of clothing, from a thermal necessity to a social necessity, he added.\n\nThis study is important not only because it reinforces the importance of clothing and attire in understanding the development of human cultures, but also because it brings together the different perspectives of art and science, said Liza Foley, an assistant professor at Ghent University and curator of fashion and textiles at the Royal Museums of Art and History in Brussels, Belgium. Foley was not involved in the research.\n\nApril Nowell, a professor and Lansdowne Distinguished Fellow in the department of anthropology at the University of Victoria in Canada, said it can sometimes be difficult for scientists to help people connect to a past as distant as the Paleolithic, and archaeologists have the added challenge of having to make the most of every artifact they find.\n\nObjects like clothing don't last for thousands of years, but mammoth bone and ivory needles do, and they can tell us about our ancestors' technological knowledge and how they adapted to their physical and cultural environments, said Nowell, who also was not involved in the study.\n\nIt's these kinds of objects that we can all relate to that help humanize the past, she added.\n\n\"Apart from the material, the needle eye hasn't really changed from a practical standpoint in millennia,\" she said via email.\n\nThere is evidence She concluded that loom-woven and even dyed textiles began about 30,000 years ago. Scientists can now infer the kinds of decisions people had to make to make a spun and dyed garment, including what plants to use, how to spin it, how to decorate the garment, and how to protect it from the elements when they lived outdoors most of the time.\n\nAnd all of this knowledge would be passed down from generation to generation, Nowell said, so something as simple and seemingly insignificant as a needle opens a window into the unexpected richness of life for Ice Age peoples.\n\nCNN's feed\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

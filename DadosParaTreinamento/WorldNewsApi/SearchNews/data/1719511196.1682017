On Friday, 40-year-old Efrain Quezada, of La Puente, led authorities on a chase from Corona to Anaheim. He stopped his car in a westbound lane of the 91 Freeway in Anaheim, forcing both sides of the freeway to shut down. Quezada remained inside a blue sedan for several hours. The car was boxed in by two armored vehicles from the Anaheim and Corona police departments. A few hours after the freeway was shut down, authorities approached the suspect's vehicle and dragged a person out from the driver's seat. According to authorities, the suspect died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. According to the Corona Police Department, Quezada had been wanted on suspicion of stalking, criminal threats and violation of a restraining order for domestic violence.", "summary": "The man at the center of an hourslong standoff on a Southern California freeway has been identified.", "url": "https://abc13.com/post/91-freeway-standoff-anaheim-california-suspect-idd-efrain-quezada-la-puente-car-chase-closure/14874082/", "image": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/14873804_052624-kabc-sat-4pm-oc-freeway-standoff-vid.jpg?w=1600", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:52:48", "author": "KABC", "authors": ["KABC"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.749}

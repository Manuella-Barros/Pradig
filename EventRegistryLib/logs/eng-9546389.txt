They claim it violates Columbia's own policies, as well as the Civil Rights Act, which bars discrimination in federally funded activities.\n\nIt's not just Columbia. Across the country, universities are set to face both legal and political struggles ahead as Congress pledges to hold them accountable for the anti-Israel protests on campuses in recent months. Leaders have been called to testify before the House education committee later this month. House Republicans contend that Columbia and other schools are violating students' civil rights protections, and the secretary of education, Miguel Cardona, suggests that this could jeopardize their federal funding.\n\nColumbia faces at least three lawsuits. To a degree the cases overlap, but each offers a different legal take on the crisis gripping the Ivy League campus. The most recent lawsuit is by an unnamed female student in her second year at Columbia, C.S., who demands that Columbia uphold its own policies and promise to establish an educational environment free of harassment and discrimination.\n\nThat suit, in federal court at the Southern District of New York, is seeking monetary compensation from Columbia and ultimately, a change in its conduct. \"We have one goal,\" attorney Jay Edelson, whose law firm is representing the student, tells the Sun, \"to ensure that the campus is safe for all of its students.\" His firm specializes in class action suits.\n\nAsked why the Columbia student in that lawsuit, C.S. v. The Trustees of Columbia University, requested anonymity, Mr. Edelson said, \"There's a violent element in these protests on and off campus that's so significant that Columbia conceded that it couldn't keep students safe. The student reasonably thought that she might be subject to harassment, threats or worse if she proceeded publicly.\"\n\nThe total number of students who will be participating in the lawsuit is not yet clear, but the complaint filed in federal court says that, during the litigation, more potential student plaintiffs will be identified.\n\nThe student leading the suit is doing so on behalf of \"all current students at Columbia University who have switched to online learning on or around April 24, 2024.\" That is when protests sent the campus into near-total lockdown, the complaint notes. More than 36,000 students are enrolled at Columbia.\n\n\"Columbia has admitted that its students are violating school policies and the world has seen the unfathomable calls for violence by the extremists currently holding the campus hostage,\" Mr. Edelson says. \"It has spent months trying to appease these radical elements and it has only emboldened them.\" The case is due for a hearing on Tuesday.\n\nAn example of what's been shouted by protestors on campus in the last couple of weeks is cited in the suit: \"Never forget the 7th of October. That will happen not one more time, not five more times, not 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000. The 7th of October is going to be every day for you.\"\n\nThe lawsuit is one of several against the Ivy League institution, which has been struggling to manage a wave of protests, including an unsanctioned encampment that surfaced on campus two weeks ago, in the aftermath of Hamas' attack on Israel and the Jewish state's war of self-defense.\n\nColumbia's leadership called upon the New York Police Department to intervene on Tuesday night, leading to the arrests of more than 280 people who had broken into and occupied a university building.\n\n\"We have made it clear that the life of campus cannot be endlessly interrupted by protesters who violate the rules and the law,\" Columbia said in a statement Tuesday night. A spokesman for the university, Ben Chang, declined the Sun's request for comment on the lawsuit.\n\nThe chaos on campus has prompted at least two other cases against the university's leaders. A student at the School of Social Work, Mackenzie Forrest, who is an Orthodox Jew and Sabbath observer, claims in a suit filed in February that the campus turned \"virulently hostile\" after October 7 and that she \"was forced out of a specialized academic program simply because she is Jewish.\"\n\nThat case, Forrest v. Trustees of Columbia University, and another filed in February, Students Against Antisemitism, Inc. v. Trustees of Columbia University, say the university is failing to meet its obligations under the Civil Rights Act. They are seeking to require Columbia to change its policies and to compel the university to pay compensation to the students.\n\n\"The university's behavior has been absolutely shameful in not reigning in this horrendous discriminatory and harassing behavior by protestors,\" the attorney who represents the plaintiffs in the Students Against Antisemitism case, Mark Kasowitz, tells the Sun.\n\n\"We're seeking court orders that require the university to protect their Jewish students the same way they protect other groups of students, consistent with the university's own code of conduct,\" Mr. Kasowitz says.\n\n\"The result of that will be to provide an environment, an educational social environment for Jews where they can participate freely without fear of intimidation or harassment and enjoy the kind of college experience that every other student gets to enjoy. We're asking for nothing more than that.\"\n\nTwo attorneys representing Columbia in the Students Against Antisemitism case did not respond to the Sun's requests for comment. Columbia, in any event, has asked twice to combine the separate cases into one court matter.\n\nAttorney Roberta Kaplan, on behalf of the Columbia trustees in February, said that allowing the Forrest and Students Against Antisemitism cases to proceed separately \"would almost certainly result in a substantial duplication of effort and expense for the Court, the parties, and any witnesses, and would likewise raise a serious risk of subjecting Columbia to conflicting orders.\"\n\nThe court denied that request in February. Mr. Kasowitz asked the court this week to deny a similar request, arguing that his case is based on alleged civil rights violations. The C.S. case, he argued in a letter to the court, is \"a putative class action asserting a breach of contract claim on behalf of a purported class consisting of 'all students.'\"\n\nAs for the C.S. case, if the court grants the plaintiff's requests after the Tuesday hearing, it would then consider whether to require the university to fulfill the demands laid out in the lawsuit, like providing security escorts for Jewish students to get to class safely.\n\n\"If there are students who've been forced to get a hotel room for the last number of months or last few weeks or something,\" Mr. Kasowitz says, \"that's a cost that is directly attributable to what the university has done in breaching its obligations to these Jewish students.\"", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "m_j_koch@nysun.com", "name": "M.J.

Not all Jewish students agree.", "body": "College campuses across the country are bringing in police as pro-Palestine protesters remain at encampments.\n\nHundreds of Jewish Zionist students at Columbia University signed a letter calling for peace amid on-campus antisemitism they said arose in recent pro-Palestinian protests and asserting that \"Judaism cannot be separated from Israel\" - a message that some other Jewish Columbia students reject.\n\n\"We proudly believe in the Jewish People's right to self-determination in our historic homeland as a fundamental tenet of our Jewish identity,\" the students wrote. \"Contrary to what many have tried to sell you - no, Judaism cannot be separated from Israel.\"\n\nThe more than 500 students who signed, as of Thursday, all listed their full names, school affiliation, and year in school.\n\nThe letter says that Jewish students at Columbia have been targeted with threats of violence and antisemitic language since the recent eruption of protests on the Manhattan campus against U.S. support for Israel's invasion of Gaza and urging the university to pull its investments from Israel. The authors write that Jewish students were subjected to comments from protesters such as, \"we don't want no Zionists here,\" \"death to the Zionist State,\" and \"go back to Poland.\"\n\nThe students also say that some Jewish students were blocked from entering shared parts of campus.\n\nColumbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), an on-campus group involved with organizing the protests, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJewish Zionist students say they are the 'majority of Jews on campus'\n\nEliana Goldin, a junior at Columbia's School of General Studies who helped pen the letter, said its purpose was to \"let the world know what Columbia Jewish students actually think and feel.\"\n\n\"There's such a spotlight on Columbia's campus right now, and a lot of anti-Zionist Jewish voices are being amplified, whereas the pro-Israel Jewish voices are kind of getting left behind,\" said Goldin, president of Aryeh, a pro-Israel student organazation. \"We wanted to make sure that our voice was out there as well.\"\n\nBut not everyone agrees with the letter. Aharon Dardik, a sophomore at the School of General Studies and lead organizer of Columbia University Jews for Ceasefire, says the letter shut down the opportunity for a broader conversation presented by the recent protests.\n\n\"It is relying on a sort of assumption that they are already right,\" Dardik said of the letter and its writers. \"And therefore, everything going on, that any disruption to their life, to the war efforts, is unjustified.\"\n\nWith around 5,000 Jewish students, according to Hillel, an on-campus Jewish organization, Columbia's student population is just over 20% Jewish, meaning around 11% of Jewish students signed the letter.\n\nGoldin said she and the other writers wanted to assert that most Jewish students at Columbia are Zionist, a statement Dardik vehemently disagreed with.\n\n\"It's important that we would be able to speak in our own name, and having people sign it, only students, would show that we are a significant, a significant majority,\" Goldin said. \"We're more quiet about it, but we are here and we don't want to stay silent any longer.\"\n\nDardik said stating that any Jewish student critical of Israel's actions towards Palestinians and in Gaza \"is a fake Jew, is not Jewish, doesn't have authentic connections to Judaism or the Jewish community, is deeply offensive and antisemitic.\"\n\n\"We want to say that there is a diversity of voices in the Jewish community, and they hear that as us saying that their voice is illegitimate,\" he added. \"I think that says a lot about how they think.\"\n\nGoldin said she wished \"the entire world would stop getting involved\" in events on Columbia's campus. \"The goal of protests is to have all this media attention, and they're achieving it really well. So I wish they weren't getting as much attention as they are,\" she added.\n\nDardik, who led several protest activities in the encampment, said Zionist students are able to broadly condemn pro-Palestinian demonstrations as \"too disruptive\" because their position already holds \"institutional power.\"\n\n\"If nothing changed, Columbia would still continue to fund the Israeli army indirectly through their investments and the Israeli war effort would continue on,\" he said. \"The question here is, how are we going to change the status quo? And their answer is no, and we shouldn't even talk about it.\"\n\nGoldin said many Zionist students felt uncomfortable and unsafe appearing in protests. \"They don't want to feel like they have to take a side because they want to be able to criticize the Israeli government while also being a Zionist and still pro-Israel to a large degree.\"\n\n\"I think it merits exploration of why,\" Dardik said of feelings expressed by some Jewish students of being unsafe amid campus protests.\n\nHe compared those concerns to those of fellow student protesters who told him they feel uneasy with the continued police presence on campus, which the university has said will extend through commencement.\n\n\"When other communities say that they feel unsafe... it literally is due to a very intimate sense that violence could happen,\" Dardik said. \"A lot of my peers feel unsafe when there's incredible cop presence on campus.\"\n\nThe university's administration first called outside police into the campus in late April when President Minouche Shafik asked the NYPD to clear Hamilton Hall, a building on campus, of protesters in a decision that sparked criticism and controversy. The protesters had barricaded themselves inside the building and renamed it \"Hind's Hall\" after a six-year-old Palestinian girl killed in the conflict in Gaza.\n\nThe White House condemned the protesters' takeover of the campus building and criticized the protests for \"antisemitic smears and violent rhetoric.\" Andrew Bates, a White House assistant press secretary, condemned the term \"intifada\" and \"other tragic and dangerous hate speech displayed in recent days.\"\n\nAs the president of two major on-campus Zionist organizations, Goldin said her groups have been holding smaller talks, as opposed to protests.

Not all Jewish students agree.", "body": "Hundreds of Jewish Zionist students at Columbia University signed a letter calling for peace amid on-campus antisemitism they said arose in recent pro-Palestinian protests and asserting that \"Judaism cannot be separated from Israel\" - a message that some other Jewish Columbia students reject.\n\n\"We proudly believe in the Jewish People's right to self-determination in our historic homeland as a fundamental tenet of our Jewish identity,\" the students wrote. \"Contrary to what many have tried to sell you - no, Judaism cannot be separated from Israel.\"\n\nThe more than 500 students who signed, as of Thursday, all listed their full names, school affiliation, and year in school.\n\nThe letter says that Jewish students at Columbia have been targeted with threats of violence and antisemitic language since the recent eruption of protests on the Manhattan campus against U.S. support for Israel's invasion of Gaza and urging the university to pull its investments from Israel. The authors write that Jewish students were subjected to comments from protesters such as, \"we don't want no Zionists here,\" \"death to the Zionist State,\" and \"go back to Poland.\"\n\nThe students also say that some Jewish students were blocked from entering shared parts of campus.\n\nColumbia University Apartheid Divest (CUAD), an on-campus group involved with organizing the protests, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nEliana Goldin, a junior at Columbia's School of General Studies who helped pen the letter, said its purpose was to \"let the world know what Columbia Jewish students actually think and feel.\"\n\n\"There's such a spotlight on Columbia's campus right now, and a lot of anti-Zionist Jewish voices are being amplified, whereas the pro-Israel Jewish voices are kind of getting left behind,\" said Goldin, president of Aryeh, a pro-Israel student organazation. \"We wanted to make sure that our voice was out there as well.\"\n\nBut not everyone agrees with the letter. Aharon Dardik, a sophomore at the School of General Studies and lead organizer of Columbia University Jews for Ceasefire, says the letter shut down the opportunity for a broader conversation presented by the recent protests.\n\n\"It is relying on a sort of assumption that they are already right,\" Dardik said of the letter and its writers. \"And therefore, everything going on, that any disruption to their life, to the war efforts, is unjustified.\"\n\nWith around 5,000 Jewish students, according to Hillel, an on-campus Jewish organization, Columbia's student population is just over 20% Jewish, meaning around 11% of Jewish students signed the letter.\n\nGoldin said she and the other writers wanted to assert that most Jewish students at Columbia are Zionist, a statement Dardik vehemently disagreed with.\n\n\"It's important that we would be able to speak in our own name, and having people sign it, only students, would show that we are a significant, a significant majority,\" Goldin said. \"We're more quiet about it, but we are here and we don't want to stay silent any longer.\"\n\nDardik said stating that any Jewish student critical of Israel's actions towards Palestinians and in Gaza \"is a fake Jew, is not Jewish, doesn't have authentic connections to Judaism or the Jewish community, is deeply offensive and antisemitic.\"\n\n\"We want to say that there is a diversity of voices in the Jewish community, and they hear that as us saying that their voice is illegitimate,\" he added. \"I think that says a lot about how they think.\"\n\nGoldin said she wished \"the entire world would stop getting involved\" in events on Columbia's campus. \"The goal of protests is to have all this media attention, and they're achieving it really well. So I wish they weren't getting as much attention as they are,\" she added.\n\nDardik, who led several protest activities in the encampment, said Zionist students are able to broadly condemn pro-Palestinian demonstrations as \"too disruptive\" because their position already holds \"institutional power.\"\n\n\"If nothing changed, Columbia would still continue to fund the Israeli army indirectly through their investments and the Israeli war effort would continue on,\" he said. \"The question here is, how are we going to change the status quo? And their answer is no, and we shouldn't even talk about it.\"\n\nGoldin said many Zionist students felt uncomfortable and unsafe appearing in protests. \"They don't want to feel like they have to take a side because they want to be able to criticize the Israeli government while also being a Zionist and still pro-Israel to a large degree.\"\n\n\"I think it merits exploration of why,\" Dardik said of feelings expressed by some Jewish students of being unsafe amid campus protests.\n\nHe compared those concerns to those of fellow student protesters who told him they feel uneasy with the continued police presence on campus, which the university has said will extend through commencement.\n\n\"When other communities say that they feel unsafe... it literally is due to a very intimate sense that violence could happen,\" Dardik said. \"A lot of my peers feel unsafe when there's incredible cop presence on campus.\"\n\nThe university's administration first called outside police into the campus in late April when President Minouche Shafik asked the NYPD to clear Hamilton Hall, a building on campus, of protesters in a decision that sparked criticism and controversy. The protesters had barricaded themselves inside the building and renamed it \"Hind's Hall\" after a six-year-old Palestinian girl killed in the conflict in Gaza.\n\nThe White House condemned the protesters' takeover of the campus building and criticized the protests for \"antisemitic smears and violent rhetoric.\" Andrew Bates, a White House assistant press secretary, condemned the term \"intifada\" and \"other tragic and dangerous hate speech displayed in recent days.\"\n\nAs the president of two major on-campus Zionist organizations, Goldin said her groups have been holding smaller talks, as opposed to protests. Holding a \"massive protest,\" she said, \"quashes difference and complexity.\"\n\n\"The kind of activism we tried to do is more educational, more nuanced, more one on one,\" she said.\n\nDardik said pro-Israel and Zionist groups on Columbia's campus simply didn't have enough supporters to put up a protest of a similar size. \"They don't have the numbers, size, or energy to engage in those protests,\" he said.\n\nColumbia students received word this week that the main commencement ceremony scheduled for May 15 was canceled.

(Kena Betancur/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nAs the devastating Israel-Gaza war wages on, American universities have seen escalating protests, growing tensions, and heightened safety concerns envelop their campuses over the last week. The demonstrations have spread to universities across America, leading to arrests, closures, and walk-outs.\n\nAs former President Donald Trump told reporters recently, \"What's going on at the college level and the colleges - Columbia, NYU and others - is a disgrace,\" and added \"It's really on Biden.\n\n\"He has the wrong signal. He's got the wrong tone. He's got the wrong words. He doesn't know who he's backing and it's a mess.\"\n\nAt the epicenter of the recent intensifying anti-Israel protests is Columbia University.\n\nAs Columbia University President Nemat \"Minouche\" Shafik testified on Capitol Hill on April 17, students set up a \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" on Columbia's campus to demand the university divest its financial ties to Israel.\n\nThe demonstrations have continued to stoke tensions, leading to the arrest of more than 100 students, the walkout of hundreds of faculty members, and the move of in-person classes online.\n\nAmidst the ongoing protests, many Jewish students on campus fear for their safety.\n\nRabbi Elie Buechler, who is associated with Columbia University's Jewish Learning Initiative on Campus, \"strongly\" advised Jewish students to go home due to safety concerns.\n\nFor those celebrating Passover, Rabbi Yehuda Drizin meanwhile delivered matzo to Jewish students and remarked, \"This is a formative moment and none of them deserve to be in this.\"\n\nLet me be clear, there is no place in classrooms or campuses for antisemitism, violence, or discrimination.\n\nAny Columbia student or faculty member who perpetrates such hatred should be held accountable by the University and strongly condemned by members of the university's community.\n\nOur Constitution makes clear that you can't infringe on the right to free speech of the whole because of the indefensible actions of some, and by the same token, you can't permit harassment and fear to overtake the right to religious freedom, safety, and liberty -- one First Amendment liberty does not usurp the other.\n\nStudents have a duty to abide by the rules and treat their peers with dignity and respect; failure to do so hinders others' learning, and such impudent students have no business being a part of a campus community.\n\nThe chaos that has engulfed campuses in recent days demands more than a break from campus and a reset.\n\nDisagreements, disputes, and dissent have existed at Columbia since it was founded as King's College in 1754.\n\nUsed by American, and later British, troops as a military hospital during the Revolutionary War, Columbia University was once the academic home of Alexander Hamilton, the first U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, John Jay, the first Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Gouverneur Morris, a lead author of the U.S. Constitution, and Robert L. Livingston, one of the drafters of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nUnfortunately for students today, numerous professors at Columbia and other universities are not fostering the type of dialogue and encouraging the sort of critical thinking that is essential for institutions of higher education.\n\nAt Columbia, for example, several Arab studies professors have come under fire for openly supporting Hamas and calling the Oct. 7 attacks \"incredible.\"\n\nFurther, consider Shai Davidai, a pro-Israel Columbia assistant professor, who sent an email to Columbia's administration officials saying he planned to physically place himself \"right in the center of the illegal encampment.\"\n\nProvocative statements and actions lead to division, not solutions. Order, reason, and learning must be restored on America's college campuses.\n\nFmr. Ambassador Callista L.

(Jackie Hajdenberg)\n\n(New York Jewish Week) -- More than 400 Jewish students at Columbia University have signed an open letter defending their support for Israel and decrying harassment they've faced surrounding the school's pro-Palestinian encampment.\n\nThe letter also addresses two groups that, signatories say, have purported to speak for them: their anti-Zionist Jewish peers, and pro-Israel alumni who have come to the school to protest.\n\n\"We are here, writing to you as Jewish students at Columbia University, who are connected to our community and deeply engaged with our culture and history,\" the letter says. \"We would like to speak in our name.\"\n\nThe 1,200-word letter began making the rounds Wednesday, three weeks after pro-Palestinian students set up an encampment at the school, sparking a controversial nationwide movement calling for divestment from Israel. The encampments have spread to dozens of other campuses and led to the arrests of thousands of students, violent clashes and -- Jewish groups say -- a rash of harassment and hostility toward Jews. Last week, protesters at Columbia occupied a campus building before being arrested.\n\nAt Columbia and other campuses, outside groups on both sides of the debate have come to the protests, in some cases instigating physical fights or making inflammatory statements.\n\nNational politicians, including Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, have also come to Columbia to denounce the protests.\n\n\"It's nice that they've been supportive but it's only further polarized campus,\" one of the four co-authors of the letter, junior Eliana Goldin, told the New York Jewish Week about pro-Israel protesters unaffiliated with the school. \"I wish the entire world stayed out of campus politics so that we could figure out our problems on our own. But since that's not the reality, we wanted to get our voice out there.\"\n\nGoldin said that the four co-authors were inspired to write the letter when one of them said, \"People have been speaking in our name to the news and saying, 'This is what the Jews on campus believe,' and it's really not the case.\" It was published on Saturday night.\n\n\"So we should put out a statement and show the world what we actually stand for and combat false narratives,\" added Goldin, a student in Columbia's joint undergraduate program with the Jewish Theological Seminary who is also co-chair of Columbia's pro-Israel group.\n\nThe letter has circulated widely in the days since it was published and gained hundreds of signatories, reaching more than 450 by Wednesday afternoon. Some of the people who shared it are among the most prominent non-student activists campaigning against antisemitism at universities, such as investor Bill Ackman, who wrote on X that the letter \"provides helpful perspective on how it is to be a Jewish student on campus today.\"\n\nA post sharing the letter by Israeli Columbia professor Shai Davidai, who has publicly lambasted the school for what he says is its failure to protect Jewish students, has been viewed more than a million times. \"Their letter tells the story of what's it like being a Jewish student right now better than any professor like myself could ever do,\" Davidai wrote.\n\nThe letter does not focus on the encampment itself but does cites several examples of antisemitic and anti-Zionist speech surrounding the protest, from a student leader saying \"the Holocaust wasn't special\" to chants of \"We don't want no Zionists here.\"\n\nMuch of the letter is an explanation of why the students view support for a Jewish state as an integral part of their Judaism.\n\n\"We proudly believe in the Jewish People's right to self-determination in our historic homeland as a fundamental tenet of our Jewish identity,\" it continues. \"Contrary to what many have tried to sell you - no, Judaism cannot be separated from Israel. Zionism is, simply put, the manifestation of that belief.\"\n\nIt adds, \"We are targeted for our belief that Israel, our ancestral and religious homeland, has a right to exist. We are targeted by those who misuse the word Zionist as a sanitized slur for Jew, synonymous with racist, oppressive, or genocidal. We know all too well that antisemitism is shapeshifting.\"\n\nGoldin said the core of the letter is its defense of Zionism.\n\n\"The most important part is that people understand why we're Zionist,\" Goldin told JTA. \"There's just a gross misunderstanding of what it means to be a Zionist.\"\n\nThe letter primarily focuses on rebutting the claims of anti-Zionists, but signatories said they were concerned about external interference in the protests from across the ideological spectrum. Ezra Dayanim, a Columbia-JTS senior, said he is \"not such a fan of outsiders interfering with campus affairs.\"\n\nThe letter comes shortly after a statement by Jewish student leaders at UCLA sent a similar message. The UCLA letter was posted after pro-Israel activists unaffiliated with the school attacked its encampment and a pro-Palestinian activist.\n\n\"We cannot have a clearer ask for the off-campus Jewish community: stay off our campus,\" the UCLA students wrote. \"Do not fund any actions on campus. Do not protest on campus. Your actions are harming Jewish students.\"\n\nDayanim specifically took issue with a Holocaust Remembrance Day event held Monday two blocks away from the university that was hosted by the Israeli-American Council and a variety of centrist and right-leaning Jewish groups.\n\nThe event was attended mostly by Israeli adults with no affiliation with Columbia. In addition to testimony from Holocaust survivor Tova Friedman, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan addressed the crowd, saying, \"The events we are witnessing today on college campuses are reminiscent of Kristallnacht in Nazi Germany.\"\n\nDayanim attended part of the rally, which he called a \"worthy cause.\" But he objected to calls from non-student speakers to divest from Columbia. \"I thought that the message was totally co-opted,\" he said.\n\n\"We want to speak for ourselves,\" he added. \"We don't appreciate when outsiders come in and totally distort our message. It cheapens our credibility.\"\n\nIn an email addressed to the Columbia and Barnard community, Hillel executive director Brian Cohen wrote that the letter \"clearly articulates what so many of us feel -- makes me prouder than ever of the student leaders finding their voices and community during this complicated time. These students are the best of us: resilient, thoughtful, and deeply committed to the Jewish people and Israel.\"\n\nHe goes on to list actions that people unaffiliated with the university can take: reaching out to the university administration and encouraging them to follow through on disciplinary actions against those involved in the Hamilton Hall takeover.\n\nGoldin said she hopes students on opposite ends of the spectrum become more open to talking with each other. In recent years, many pro-Palestinian groups have adopted a policy of \"anti-normalization\" that bars them from interacting with pro-Israel groups. Hillel International also bars partnerships with anti-Zionist groups.\n\n\"We need to facilitate dialogue,\" Goldin said. \"We're on a college campus, we're at a university for a reason.\"\n\nShe added. \"Screaming past each other at protests is not productive.\"", "source": {"uri": "jta.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish Telegraphic Agency"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Manage alert preferences on your profile page\n\nAs pro-Palestinian protests roil university campuses across the US, activists at Columbia University have targeted a relatively new dual-degree BA program with Tel Aviv University, demanding the school shutter the program amid a comprehensive divestment from Israel or anyone doing business with the Jewish state.\n\nWhile figures on both sides of the Atlantic say there is little danger of the program actually being shut down, the threats and wider protests have deeply unnerved Israeli students and staff in both New York and Tel Aviv.\n\n\"I won't pretend this doesn't have ramifications for us... It's a very fragile and nervous application market this year for international schools,\" said Prof. Milette Shamir, VP International of Tel Aviv University, who in her position both oversees the dual-degree program and helped design it.\n\nThe dual-degree program with TAU is only four years old, and the first graduating class is set to finish at the end of the current academic year. Enrolled students spend two years in Tel Aviv and two in New York, and receive BA degrees from both institutions.\n\nThe competitive program accepts about 30-40 new students each year, Shamir said, mostly Jewish or Israeli-Americans. She noted that a new batch of prospective students, already notified of their acceptance for next year against the background of the campus protests, will have to decide soon whether they will enter the program at all.\n\n\"Our students who are there now, some of them are fearful, or not at ease. Many of them are shaken,\" she said of the environment on the Columbia campus, a focal point of the anti-Israel university protest movement. On Monday, due to the ongoing unrest on campus, Columbia announced that the main May 15 graduation ceremony would be canceled.\n\nThe Columbia administration has maintained that the program with TAU won't be halted, and Shamir also said there was little chance that the campus protests will actually close down the partnership.\n\nShe described the New York school as a diverse, vibrant campus with \"pockets of radical pro-Palestinian activities... Imagine if you had to judge all universities based on a few very radical outspoken people.\"\n\nIsraelis at General Studies\n\nThe protests at Columbia University, which have included attempts to create pro-Palestinian encampments and the takeover of a building, leading to hundreds of arrests, have left many Jewish and Zionist students on campus deeply unsettled due to what they say is antisemitic rhetoric and an atmosphere of hate. The school's Israeli students, including those in the dual-degree program and those attending the school independently or as part of other programs, have reported feeling particularly threatened.\n\nThe TAU students at Columbia feel \"the same pressure as all the other Israeli students,\" no more and no less, said Inbar Brand, a dual-degree student who has \"taken more of an active role\" in pro-Israel activities on the New York campus.\n\n\"The protest groups on campus are specifically targeting Israeli students and the dual-degree students at the same level. Jewish students feel lots of pressure, but it varies depending on their levels of association with Israel and sensitivity to the anti-Zionist rhetoric on campus,\" she explained.\n\nMany of the protests have targeted Columbia University's School of General Studies, a separate college at Columbia designed for \"returning and nontraditional students seeking a rigorous, traditional, Ivy League undergraduate degree,\" according to its website. The school, which makes up some 30 percent of Columbia's total undergrad population, houses the TAU dual-degree program, but is also where many other Israelis who attend Columbia end up.\n\nGeneral Studies \"has always attracted Israelis because after the army they are a little older\" and fit in better there, Shamir said.\n\n\"That's why it's become such a focus of the demonstrators -- they see it as being welcoming to Israelis,\" she added.\n\nAmong the Israelis in the School of General Studies is Maya Platek, an Israeli who did her army service in the IDF Spokesperson's Office who was elected as the school's student body president last week. Platek is an undergraduate student but not enrolled in the dual-degree program with TAU.\n\nBrand called the election \"an encouraging sign,\" attributing it to Israeli and Jewish students coming out to vote in greater numbers in reaction to the situation. But she said she was \"frustrated\" by the Columbia administration, accusing it of not doing enough to \"give a voice\" to Israeli and Jewish perspectives, especially in regard to Middle Eastern studies, a field that attracts a large number of the dual-degree students.\n\nIn a statement to The Times of Israel, Columbia said that the university \"welcomes and embraces the Israeli students, faculty, and staff on our campus and is proud of their accomplishments on behalf of the greater Columbia community.\"\n\n\"We also benefit greatly from our dual-degree program with Tel Aviv University, a program that the University will continue to wholeheartedly support,\" the university said.\n\nTAU official Shamir stressed that the dean of the School of General Studies, Dr. Lisa Rosen-Metsch, is \"a super-committed, wonderful partner\" who is involved with the campus antisemitism task force, and that Columbia University president Minouche Shafik recently made a point of visiting the dual studies program, to \"express her support and her commitment to continuing this degree and the relations with Tel Aviv University.\"\n\nStudent Brand said the Tel Aviv students were \"a well-knit group that interacts well with the broader Columbia community.\"\n\n\"Many of us are putting in a lot of work right now... Israeli and Jewish students, we have become full-time documenters and recorders of what is happening,\" she said. \"I have been increasingly prouder of my program and its students.\"\n\nStudents, determined\n\nIn Tel Aviv, 21-year-old Ezra Horton, a first-year student in the program, has been watching the protest on at Columbia with intense interest, even though he is not scheduled to leave for New York for over a year.\n\n\"Even as a student in Tel Aviv we are feeling the impact,\" he said. \"The protests there are concerning and contribute to a general sense of not feeling safe as a Jew, particularly as a person on this program.\"\n\nWatching the Columbia protests, he said, \"One of the things that really stuck out were the calls for intifada. I feel that is a call for war... it's a direct call for violence on all my friends in Israel. How am I going to go and sit in a class with people who are calling for [my] death... it's scary.\"\n\nAs a self-defined \"queer Jew,\" Horton said that the prominent LGBTQ representation among the protesters is \"particularly offensive,\" since by essentially supporting Hamas, such protesters are \"calling for the destruction of queer rights in Israel.\"\n\nBut though he feels trepidation about his upcoming two years at Columbia, he also feels that \"I need to go anyway... I need to be stronger than what is going on there.\"\n\nIssy Lyons, 21, also a first-year student, noted that TAU has given students the option of finishing their degree in Tel Aviv instead of going on to New York.\n\n\"It's one of the main conversations we are having as students right now: Is it our job to go there and to fight and be a part, or to stay in Tel Aviv? Everyone is very concerned,\" she said.\n\n\"There is one student who came back to Tel Aviv, saying Columbia was too much for him, too much antisemitism around campus,\" Lyons added. \"A lot of the students there, they have to defend themselves every day. It really affects them.\"", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of Israel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Security concerns in the wake of raucous anti-Israel protests were top of mind in making the decision, a university official told Fox News.\n\nOne graduating senior, who also testified before the House Education & Workforce Committee about the antisemitic agitators, said she did so in order to give voice to those in the community who all have the same concerns as well as a way to urge Columbia administrators to act.\n\n\"I think that [Columbia] has the potential to be the amazing institution that I know that it is,\" Yola Ashkenazie told Fox News Digital.\n\nAshkenazie said she was disappointed that the main commencement ceremony was canceled, saying graduation festivities are as much for the students as they are for the parents and families who work hard to ensure their children can attend a venerated institution like Columbia.\n\nANTI-ISRAEL UNREST FORCES COLUMBIA TO CANCEL LARGE COMMENCEMENT AS PROTESTS CONTINUE\n\n\"So, it's really sad that we don't get to properly mark this moment with them and with all of our friends across all the different schools,\" she said.\n\nAshkenazie said administrators had at first acted like the anti-Israel protests were peaceful demonstrations, but she added that if that were true, she still would be attending graduation.\n\n\"[W]hy would they cancel commencement if they thought that they were entirely peaceful? It doesn't really make sense. And the administration can't keep their story straight.\"\n\nAshkenazie also told Fox News she had been affected by antisemitic sentiment on campus long before the protests began in April.\n\n\"So, I have been vocal [in] speaking out against antisemitism on campus since Oct. 7th, and the students sort of pegged me as that,\" she said.\n\nTRUMP DECRIES COLUMBIA AGITATORS, CALLS CHARLOTTESVILLE 'PEANUTS' COMPARED TO CAMPUS ANTI-ISRAEL UNREST\n\n\"So a couple of months ago, a cyberbullying Instagram account posted a photo of me holding Israeli flags, and that caused students to post horrible things about me on anonymous campus forums. I had people there, even an instance in which someone came up to me in the middle of campus and confronted me about my support for Israel. So yeah, it's been an incredibly, incredibly frightening couple of months on campus.\"\n\nSophomore Elisha Baker isn't graduating this year, but he told Fox News Digital the ceremony's cancelation still affected him.\n\n\"Here's the thing about commencement. This movement that has been on campus has been advocating to 'shut it down' and to cancel joy. And by canceling commencement, it seems that the university has caved to both of those demands and basically allowed the mob to win,\" he said.\n\n\"And to me, that's really sad. And my heart goes out to the seniors who lost high school graduation due to COVID, lost freshman year of college to COVID and now lost their senior springs and their graduations to a violent mob,\" he said.\n\nBaker said he watched protesters unfurl a 20-foot pro-intifada banner from a major academic building in the wee hours of one recent morning.\n\nCOLUMBIA LAW STUDENT GROUP REPORTEDLY DECLARES NO JEW IS SAFE UNTIL 'EVERYONE IS SAFE'\n\n\"To me, that was just really sad - really shocking; violent and totally emblematic of exactly what this movement has been calling for this entire time, which is violence against Jews, which is a prolonged state of war rather than peace,\" said Baker, who is Jewish.\n\nHe told Fox News Digital that Jewish students have been subjected to hate speech and violence since the protests began.\n\nOne of Baker's friends had an Israeli flag ripped out of his hands by protesters, who purportedly tried to set it ablaze and later pelted him with projectiles.\n\n\"Columbia has completely abdicated leadership to a mob that is a small but rageful and vocal minority.\"\n\n\"That's full-blown assault inside the campus gates,\" Baker said.\n\nWhen asked about the prospect of not returning to campus because of the protests, Baker said the decision is difficult because to stay away might appear as \"let[ting] the bully win.\"\n\n\"So, to me, to leave campus right now as a Jewish student is almost to give in to the mob. And yes, we have to be concerned for our safety. But also, there's something about staying and about making very clear that these people can say, 'We don't want no Zionists here.' But guess what? We're still here. And you cannot bully Jewish students off of this campus.\"\n\n\"It's up to the university to decide if wearing a kippah and a hostage dog tag ... if that's going to make me a target or if I'm safe here. Right. Because I deserve to be safe here.\"\n\nHARVARD STUDENT SAYS 'PRO-TERRORISM HATE FEST' IS HAPPENING IN ENCAMPMENT BEYOND SCHOOL'S LOCKED GATES\n\nMeanwhile, Columbia junior Eden Yadegar told Fox News Digital the cancellation of commencement proves \"the inmates are running the asylum.\"\n\n\"Columbia has completely abdicated leadership to a mob that is a small but rageful and vocal minority. And it's really unfortunate that now, as a result, all students ... are now having to face the consequences that this mob kind of forced everyone else to deal with and also that the Columbia administration put everyone in a situation to deal with,\" she said.\n\nYadegar said the school drew multiple proverbial \"red lines\" but then did not enforce the promised repercussions.\n\n\"And so it's no wonder that students think there are no consequences for their actions and think that they can get away with wreaking havoc on campus and doing essentially whatever they want.\"\n\nBIDEN DONORS FUNDING GROUPS BEHIND ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES: REPORT\n\nAnother Columbia student, Batya Tropper, told Fox News Digital that although she appreciates much of what Columbia has offered her during her academic career, she now finds it harder to encourage fellow Jewish students to attend college there.\n\n\"I cannot guarantee that this will be a safe or comfortable environment for them,\" she said. \"And I never thought that I would be in a position to say that.\"\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"And the reason that is so upsetting is because I love this university, and I love the normalcy that I've had here and the experiences that I've had. But I think it's very unfortunate that a lot of Jewish students looking to come to colleges might not choose Ivy League universities because they are concerned for their safety, or they might not want to come to college and have to advocate for their identity every day.\"\n\n\"They might just want to come and get an education, which they should be entitled to, just like everyone else.\"\n\nFox News Digital's Aubrie Spady contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "1010wcsi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "1010 WCSI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kippah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kippah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://1010wcsi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WCSI-header.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546389", "eventUri": "eng-9546389", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1818, "textEnd": 1826}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

These include mass suspensions, evictions from university housing, and arrests of students, faculty, legal observers, and journalists covering these events.\n\nColumbia University students set up tents on campus on April 17 to express solidarity with the Palestinian people. Student groups said they were protesting Israel's military campaign in Gaza, which has killed over 34,000 people and left well over a million displaced and starving. Protesters also demanded that the university divest holdings in companies profiting from the assault on Gaza and Israel's unlawful settlements in the occupied West Bank.\n\nAlso on April 17, Columbia's President Minouche Shafik testified at a congressional hearing on antisemitism. On April 18, she suspended the protesters, revoking their access to campus. In a letter to the New York Police Department, Shafik said Columbia \"provided multiple notices and warnings and informed the encampment participants that they must disperse or face immediate discipline.\" Shafik said the protesters were violating Columbia's rules and policies, and raised safety concerns. She said the encampment posed a \"clear and present danger\" and asked the police to help remove the protesters.\n\nThe Columbia Law School Human Rights Institute, 54 members of Columbia Law School's permanent faculty, and the Knight First Amendment Institute, among others, criticized Shafik's decisions, with the Knight Institute condemning the \"alarming decision to call on the NYPD to dismantle a student encampment.\"\n\nThe university previously suspended Columbia's chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace, after administrators claimed the groups \"repeatedly violated University policies related to holding campus events.\" In response, the New York Civil Liberties Union and the organization Palestine Legal filed a lawsuit in March against the university for its \"unlawful suspension\" of these groups for \"engaging in peaceful protest.\"\n\nShafik told the US Congress that Columbia updated policies and procedures to address rising antisemitism on campus. She described as a central challenge \"[t]rying to reconcile the free speech rights of those who want to protest and the rights of Jewish students to be in an environment free of harassment or discrimination.\"\n\nThere have been troubling reports of antisemitic incidents in and around Columbia University's campus. Allegations of antisemitic acts and speech by individuals, as well as acts of Islamophobia and other forms of discrimination, should be investigated and addressed on the merits in a case-by-case basis, through fair and transparent processes.\n\nAs protests spread to campuses across the country, university administrations should be careful not to mislabel criticism of Israeli government policies or advocacy for Palestinian rights as inherently antisemitic or to misuse university authority to quash peaceful protest.

The encampments have spread to dozens of other campuses and led to the arrests of thousands of students, violent clashes and -- Jewish groups say -- a rash of harassment and hostility toward Jews. Last week, protesters at Columbia occupied a campus building before being arrested.\n\nAt Columbia and other campuses, outside groups on both sides of the debate have come to the protests, in some cases instigating physical fights or making inflammatory statements.\n\nNational politicians, including Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, have also come to Columbia to denounce the protests.\n\n\"It's nice that they've been supportive but it's only further polarized campus,\" one of the four co-authors of the letter, junior Eliana Goldin, told the New York Jewish Week about pro-Israel protesters unaffiliated with the school. \"I wish the entire world stayed out of campus politics so that we could figure out our problems on our own. But since that's not the reality, we wanted to get our voice out there.\"\n\nGoldin said that the four co-authors were inspired to write the letter when one of them said, \"People have been speaking in our name to the news and saying, 'This is what the Jews on campus believe,' and it's really not the case.\" It was published on Saturday night.\n\n\"So we should put out a statement and show the world what we actually stand for and combat false narratives,\" added Goldin, a student in Columbia's joint undergraduate program with the Jewish Theological Seminary who is also co-chair of Columbia's pro-Israel group.\n\nThe letter has circulated widely in the days since it was published and gained hundreds of signatories, reaching more than 450 by Wednesday afternoon. Some of the people who shared it are among the most prominent non-student activists campaigning against antisemitism at universities, such as investor Bill Ackman, who wrote on X that the letter \"provides helpful perspective on how it is to be a Jewish student on campus today.\"\n\nA post sharing the letter by Israeli Columbia professor Shai Davidai, who has publicly lambasted the school for what he says is its failure to protect Jewish students, has been viewed more than a million times. \"Their letter tells the story of what's it like being a Jewish student right now better than any professor like myself could ever do,\" Davidai wrote.\n\nThe letter does not focus on the encampment itself but does cites several examples of antisemitic and anti-Zionist speech surrounding the protest, from a student leader saying \"the Holocaust wasn't special\" to chants of \"We don't want no Zionists here.\"\n\nMuch of the letter is an explanation of why the students view support for a Jewish state as an integral part of their Judaism.\n\n\"We proudly believe in the Jewish People's right to self-determination in our historic homeland as a fundamental tenet of our Jewish identity,\" it continues. \"Contrary to what many have tried to sell you - no, Judaism cannot be separated from Israel. Zionism is, simply put, the manifestation of that belief.\"\n\nIt adds, \"We are targeted for our belief that Israel, our ancestral and religious homeland, has a right to exist. We are targeted by those who misuse the word Zionist as a sanitized slur for Jew, synonymous with racist, oppressive, or genocidal. We know all too well that antisemitism is shapeshifting.\"\n\nGoldin said the core of the letter is its defense of Zionism.\n\n\"The most important part is that people understand why we're Zionist,\" Goldin told JTA. \"There's just a gross misunderstanding of what it means to be a Zionist.\"\n\nThe letter primarily focuses on rebutting the claims of anti-Zionists, but signatories said they were concerned about external interference in the protests from across the ideological spectrum. Ezra Dayanim, a Columbia-JTS senior, said he is \"not such a fan of outsiders interfering with campus affairs.\"\n\nThe letter comes shortly after a statement by Jewish student leaders at UCLA sent a similar message. The UCLA letter was posted after pro-Israel activists unaffiliated with the school attacked its encampment and a pro-Palestinian activist.\n\n\"We cannot have a clearer ask for the off-campus Jewish community: stay off our campus,\" the UCLA students wrote. \"Do not fund any actions on campus. Do not protest on campus. Your actions are harming Jewish students.\"\n\nDayanim specifically took issue with a Holocaust Remembrance Day event held Monday two blocks away from the university that was hosted by the Israeli-American Council and a variety of centrist and right-leaning Jewish groups.\n\nThe event was attended mostly by Israeli adults with no affiliation with Columbia. In addition to testimony from Holocaust survivor Tova Friedman, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan addressed the crowd, saying, \"The events we are witnessing today on college campuses are reminiscent of Kristallnacht in Nazi Germany.\"\n\nDayanim attended part of the rally, which he called a \"worthy cause.\" But he objected to calls from non-student speakers to divest from Columbia. \"I thought that the message was totally co-opted,\" he said.\n\n\"We want to speak for ourselves,\" he added. \"We don't appreciate when outsiders come in and totally distort our message. It cheapens our credibility.\"\n\nIn an email addressed to the Columbia and Barnard community, Hillel executive director Brian Cohen wrote that the letter \"clearly articulates what so many of us feel -- makes me prouder than ever of the student leaders finding their voices and community during this complicated time. These students are the best of us: resilient, thoughtful, and deeply committed to the Jewish people and Israel.\"\n\nHe goes on to list actions that people unaffiliated with the university can take: reaching out to the university administration and encouraging them to follow through on disciplinary actions against those involved in the Hamilton Hall takeover.\n\nGoldin said she hopes students on opposite ends of the spectrum become more open to talking with each other. In recent years, many pro-Palestinian groups have adopted a policy of \"anti-normalization\" that bars them from interacting with pro-Israel groups. Hillel International also bars partnerships with anti-Zionist groups.\n\n\"We need to facilitate dialogue,\" Goldin said. \"We're on a college campus, we're at a university for a reason.\"\n\nShe added. \"Screaming past each other at protests is not productive.\"", "source": {"uri": "forward.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Forward"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jackie_hajdenberg@forward.com",

Don't fall for that claim. It's a scam. These protesters don't represent most students or the American public.\n\nYet Monday, Columbia University canceled graduation ceremonies, kowtowing to the radical fringe, with whom they largely agree. Students and their families be damned.\n\nHere are the facts: A miniscule 2 percent of people ages 18 to 29 polled by Harvard's Kennedy School named the Israel-Hamas conflict as their top political concern, compared with double digits who were concerned about the economy. Students couldn't care less about this issue.\n\nClaims that today's campus riots are reminiscent of 1968, when students closed down campuses to protest the Vietnam War, are nonsense. Back then, Gallup found 46 percent of respondents in that age group considered the Vietnam War the nation's biggest problem. Not 2 percent.\n\nThe former New York Police commissioner, Ray Kelly, nailed it Sunday when he said the nationwide turmoil \"looks like a conspiracy. ... We need the federal government's investigative capacity to look at this whole situation.\"\n\nOrganized outside groups are behind much of the campus violence. Hours before the storming of Columbia's Hamilton Hall, an outside organization called the People's Forum -- known for its anti-Israel activities and links to the Chinese Communist Party -- started gearing up for its Hamilton Hall invasion. In a meeting, TPF's leader spewed invectives against Columbia.\n\nHours later, protesters smashed the glass doors of Hamilton Hall, vandalizing and seizing the building. When the university president, Nemat \"Minouche\" Shafik, finally called in police, 13 of the 44 arrested in the building had no affiliation with the university.\n\nReflecting on the incidents at Columbia and other New York campuses, Mayor Adams said after the arrests, \"Individuals unaffiliated with these schools had entered these different campuses and, in some cases, were even training students in unlawful protest tactics.\"\n\nNew York University's board vice chairman, Bill Berkley, says these occupations appear to have been orchestrated by external groups. He wants the FBI to investigate.\n\nAs these groups seize control of our universities, where is the FBI? Director Christopher Wray says the bureau does not directly track college protests but will provide information to campuses if the agency becomes aware of a specific threat.\n\nHuh? The FBI should be proactively identifying and heading off campus terrorists.\n\nWhere is the Department of Justice? Two weeks ago, 27 Republican Senators sent a letter to Attorney General Garland asking for the DOJ to investigate how students' rights are being violated on campus. Radio silence.\n\nWhere is President Biden? When the president was asked if he would use the National Guard to restore order, he emphatically said, \"No.\"\n\nWhy not? The National Guard were deployed in 1962 to protect the right of Black students to attend the newly integrated University of Mississippi. Students of all races and religions who want to go to class or attend their graduation deserve protection.\n\nThe Biden administration is missing in action. Is it because the same big Dem donors supporting Biden -- the Pritzker family, George Soros, David Rockefeller Jr. -- also support pro-Palestine groups orchestrating campus protests?\n\nMeanwhile, images of campus invaders in headscarves are not winning over Americans. The latest Harvard CAPS-Harris survey shows that 61 percent of Americans polled want a cease-fire only after Hamas is removed from power and the hostages captured on October 7 are released.\n\nThe public also knows what they are seeing on campuses is not freedom of expression -- a sacred American right -- but lawlessness and dangerous disorder. Universities need to be evenhanded, guaranteeing that all sides get to speak and students can attend class.\n\nColumbia's students were heckled and threatened, had their classes canceled and now are robbed of the grandeur of a university graduation. It's a slap in the face to them, and to their families who sacrificed to make college possible.\n\nColumbia's motto is, \"In thy light shall we see light.\" Truth is, darkness has descended on Columbia and most elite college campuses.\n\nAlumni and taxpayers alike should withhold their support until these institutions see the light and prioritize their students.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "betsy_mccaughey@nysun.com", "name": "Betsy McCAUGHEY", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Raymond Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Kennedy_School", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard Kennedy School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_United_States_involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irreligion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vandalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berkeley, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkeley, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pritzker_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pritzker family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rockefeller family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

We do not bang on drums and chant catchy slogans. We are average students, just trying to make it through finals much like the rest of you. Those who demonize us under the cloak of anti-Zionism forced us into our activism and forced us to publicly defend our Jewish identities.\"\n\nThe letter argued that Jewish self-determination in their historic homeland was an integral part of Jewish identity.\n\n\"Judaism cannot be separated from Israel. Zionism is, simply put, the manifestation of that belief,\" the students contended, dismissing the idea to the contrary. \"We connect to Israel not only as our ancestral homeland but as the only place in the modern world where Jews can safely take ownership of their own destiny. Our experiences at Columbia in the last six months are a poignant reminder of just that.\"\n\nThe letter listed instances of aggressive and dehumanizing rhetoric leveled at the Jewish students not just since the April 17 encampment that was expelled last Wednesday, but in response to Hamas's October 7 Massacre. The students said that there were protests against Israel \"while our friends' and families' dead bodies were still warm.\"\n\nPro-Hamas sentiment on Columbia campus\n\nPro-October 7 sentiment was expressed when on April 20 a student showed held a sign next to pro-Israel students declaring them to be \"[Izz ad-Din] Al-Qassam [Brigades]'s next targets.\" The students said it was unsurprising that Columbia University Apartheid Divest leader Khymani James told Columbia administrators in a January meeting that \"Zionists don't deserve to live,\" and \"Be grateful that I'm not just going out and murdering Zionists.\"\n\nMuch of the antisemitism encountered by the students was an inversion of the \"Holocaust legacy,\" said the students. They recalled an October Black Lesbian student film event which barred Zionists because \"white Jewish people\" have always \"been the oppressors of all brown people\" and dismissed the Holocaust as not \"special.\" Students leaving the campus on April 20 were heckled with calls of \"go back to Poland,\" where \"our relatives lie in mass graves.\"\n\nThe situation became so tense with the establishment of the tent settlement aimed at forcing the administration to adopt anti-Israel policies, that Orthodox Union Jewish Learning Initiative on Campus director rabbi Elie Buechler warned Jewish students to leave campus for the Passover holiday.\n\nThe students argued that in the same way that Jews had been scapegoated historically and globally for supposed societal evils, be it for capitalism, communism, or not being European enough, now they were being cast as \"colonizers and oppressors.\"\n\n\"We are targeted by those who misuse the word Zionist as a sanitized slur for Jew, synonymous with racist, oppressive, or genocidal. We know all too well that antisemitism is shapeshifting,\" said the students. \"If the last six months on campus have taught us anything, it is that a large and vocal population of the Columbia community does not understand the meaning of Zionism, and subsequently does not understand the essence of the Jewish People. Yet despite the fact that we have been calling out the antisemitism we've been experiencing for months, our concerns have been brushed off and invalidated.\"\n\nThe students said that they would not forget the students and faculty who prevented Jews from entering parts of the campus, or those who chose to be silent.\n\n\"While campus may be riddled with hateful rhetoric and simplistic binaries now, it is never too late to start repairing the fractures and begin developing meaningful relationships across political and religious divides. Our tradition tells us, 'Love peace and pursue peace,' said the students. \"We hope you will join us in earnestly pursuing peace, truth, and empathy. Together we can repair our campus.\"", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Self-determination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jewish identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jewish ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnard_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barnard College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slogan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Culture of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehumanization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dehumanization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodox_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orthodox Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synonym", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Synonym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scapegoat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pejorative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_407,w_690/594963", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546389", "eventUri": "eng-9546389", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-17", "textStart": 1706, "textEnd": 1714}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1787, "textEnd": 1796, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-20", "textStart": 2016, "textEnd": 2024, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

So yeah, it's been an incredibly, incredibly frightening couple of months on campus.\"\n\nSophomore Elisha Baker isn't graduating this year, but he told Fox News Digital the ceremony's cancelation still affected him.\n\n\"Here's the thing about commencement.

And by canceling commencement, it seems that the university has caved to both of those demands and basically allowed the mob to win,\" he said.\n\n\"And to me, that's really sad. And my heart goes out to the seniors who lost high school graduation due to COVID, lost freshman year of college to COVID and now lost their senior springs and their graduations to a violent mob,\" he said.\n\nBaker said he watched protesters unfurl a 20-foot pro-intifada banner from a major academic building in the wee hours of one recent morning.\n\nCOLUMBIA LAW STUDENT GROUP REPORTEDLY DECLARES NO JEW IS SAFE UNTIL 'EVERYONE IS SAFE'\n\n\"To me, that was just really sad - really shocking; violent and totally emblematic of exactly what this movement has been calling for this entire time, which is violence against Jews, which is a prolonged state of war rather than peace,\" said Baker, who is Jewish.\n\nHe told Fox News Digital that Jewish students have been subjected to hate speech and violence since the protests began.\n\nOne of Baker's friends had an Israeli flag ripped out of his hands by protesters, who purportedly tried to set it ablaze and later pelted him with projectiles.\n\n\"Columbia has completely abdicated leadership to a mob that is a small but rageful and vocal minority.\"\n\n\"That's full-blown assault inside the campus gates,\" Baker said.\n\nWhen asked about the prospect of not returning to campus because of the protests, Baker said the decision is difficult because to stay away might appear as \"let[ting] the bully win.\"\n\n\"So, to me, to leave campus right now as a Jewish student is almost to give in to the mob. And yes, we have to be concerned for our safety. But also, there's something about staying and about making very clear that these people can say, 'We don't want no Zionists here.' But guess what? We're still here. And you cannot bully Jewish students off of this campus.\"\n\n\"It's up to the university to decide if wearing a kippah and a hostage dog tag ... if that's going to make me a target or if I'm safe here. Right. Because I deserve to be safe here.\"\n\nHARVARD STUDENT SAYS 'PRO-TERRORISM HATE FEST' IS HAPPENING IN ENCAMPMENT BEYOND SCHOOL'S LOCKED GATES\n\nMeanwhile, Columbia junior Eden Yadegar told Fox News Digital the cancellation of commencement proves \"the inmates are running the asylum.\"\n\n\"Columbia has completely abdicated leadership to a mob that is a small but rageful and vocal minority. And it's really unfortunate that now, as a result, all students ... are now having to face the consequences that this mob kind of forced everyone else to deal with and also that the Columbia administration put everyone in a situation to deal with,\" she said.\n\nYadegar said the school drew multiple proverbial \"red lines\" but then did not enforce the promised repercussions.\n\n\"And so it's no wonder that students think there are no consequences for their actions and think that they can get away with wreaking havoc on campus and doing essentially whatever they want.\"\n\nBIDEN DONORS FUNDING GROUPS BEHIND ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES: REPORT\n\nAnother Columbia student, Batya Tropper, told Fox News Digital that although she appreciates much of what Columbia has offered her during her academic career, she now finds it harder to encourage fellow Jewish students to attend college there.\n\n\"I cannot guarantee that this will be a safe or comfortable environment for them,\" she said. \"And I never thought that I would be in a position to say that.\"\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"And the reason that is so upsetting is because I love this university, and I love the normalcy that I've had here and the experiences that I've had. But I think it's very unfortunate that a lot of Jewish students looking to come to colleges might not choose Ivy League universities because they are concerned for their safety, or they might not want to come to college and have to advocate for their identity every day.\"\n\n\"They might just want to come and get an education, which they should be entitled to, just like everyone else.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charles_creitz@foxnews.com", "name": "Charles Creitz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kippah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kippah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvard University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/04/1024/512/Columbia-University-Palestine-Protests-NYC_08.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546389", "eventUri": "eng-9546389", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1947, "textEnd": 1955}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The encampments have spread to dozens of other campuses and led to the arrests of thousands of students, violent clashes and a rash of harassment and hostility toward Jews. Last week, protesters at Columbia occupied a campus building before being arrested.\n\nAt Columbia and other campuses, outside groups on both sides of the debate have come to the protests, in some cases instigating physical fights or making inflammatory statements.\n\nNational politicians, including Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, have also come to Columbia to denounce the protests.\n\n\"It's nice that they've been supportive but it's only further polarized campus,\" one of the four co-authors of the letter, junior Eliana Goldin, told the New York Jewish Week about pro-Israel protesters unaffiliated with the school. \"I wish the entire world stayed out of campus politics so that we could figure out our problems on our own. But since that's not the reality, we wanted to get our voice out there.\"\n\nGoldin said that the four co-authors were inspired to write the letter when one of them said, \"People have been speaking in our name to the news and saying, 'This is what the Jews on campus believe,' and it's really not the case.\" It was published on Saturday night.\n\n\"So we should put out a statement and show the world what we actually stand for and combat false narratives,\" added Goldin, a student in Columbia's joint undergraduate program with the Jewish Theological Seminary who is also co-chair of Columbia's pro-Israel group.\n\nThe letter has circulated widely in the days since it was published and gained hundreds of signatories, reaching more than 450 by Wednesday afternoon. Some of the people who shared it are among the most prominent non-student activists campaigning against antisemitism at universities, such as investor Bill Ackman, who wrote on X that the letter \"provides helpful perspective on how it is to be a Jewish student on campus today.\"\n\nA post sharing the letter by Israeli Columbia professor Shai Davidai, who has publicly lambasted the school for what he says is its failure to protect Jewish students, has been viewed more than a million times.\n\n\"Their letter tells the story of what's it like being a Jewish student right now better than any professor like myself could ever do,\" Davidai wrote.\n\nThe letter does not focus on the encampment itself but does cite several examples of antisemitic and anti-Zionist speech surrounding the protest, from a student leader saying \"the Holocaust wasn't special\" to chants of \"We don't want no Zionists here.\"\n\nMuch of the letter is an explanation of why the students view support for a Jewish state as an integral part of their Judaism.\n\n\"We proudly believe in the Jewish People's right to self-determination in our historic homeland as a fundamental tenet of our Jewish identity,\" it continues. \"Contrary to what many have tried to sell you - no, Judaism cannot be separated from Israel. Zionism is, simply put, the manifestation of that belief.\"\n\nIt adds, \"We are targeted for our belief that Israel, our ancestral and religious homeland, has a right to exist. We are targeted by those who misuse the word Zionist as a sanitized slur for Jew, synonymous with racist, oppressive, or genocidal. We know all too well that antisemitism is shapeshifting.\"\n\nGoldin said the core of the letter is its defense of Zionism.\n\n\"The most important part is that people understand why we're Zionist,\" Goldin told JTA. \"There's just a gross misunderstanding of what it means to be a Zionist.\"\n\nThe letter primarily focuses on rebutting the claims of anti-Zionists, but signatories said they were concerned about external interference in the protests from across the ideological spectrum. Ezra Dayanim, a Columbia-JTS senior, said he is \"not such a fan of outsiders interfering with campus affairs.\"\n\nThe letter comes shortly after a statement by Jewish student leaders at UCLA sent a similar message. The UCLA letter was posted after pro-Israel activists unaffiliated with the school attacked its encampment and a pro-Palestinian activist.\n\n\"We cannot have a clearer ask for the off-campus Jewish community: stay off our campus,\" the UCLA students wrote. \"Do not fund any actions on campus. Do not protest on campus. Your actions are harming Jewish students.\"\n\nDayanim specifically took issue with a Holocaust Remembrance Day event held Monday two blocks away from the university that was hosted by the Israeli-American Council and a variety of centrist and right-leaning Jewish groups.\n\nThe event was attended mostly by Israeli adults with no affiliation with Columbia. In addition to testimony from Holocaust survivor Tova Friedman, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan addressed the crowd, saying, \"The events we are witnessing today on college campuses are reminiscent of Kristallnacht in Nazi Germany.\"\n\nDayanim attended part of the rally, which he called a \"worthy cause.\" But he objected to calls from non-student speakers to divest from Columbia. \"I thought that the message was totally co-opted,\" he said.\n\n\"We want to speak for ourselves,\" he added. \"We don't appreciate when outsiders come in and totally distort our message. It cheapens our credibility.\"\n\nIn an email addressed to the Columbia and Barnard community, Hillel executive director Brian Cohen wrote that the letter \"clearly articulates what so many of us feel -- makes me prouder than ever of the student leaders finding their voices and community during this complicated time. These students are the best of us: resilient, thoughtful, and deeply committed to the Jewish people and Israel.\"\n\nHe goes on to list actions that people unaffiliated with the university can take: reaching out to the university administration and encouraging them to follow through on disciplinary actions against those involved in the Hamilton Hall takeover.\n\nGoldin said she hopes students on opposite ends of the spectrum become more open to talking with each other. In recent years, many pro-Palestinian groups have adopted a policy of \"anti-normalization\" that bars them from interacting with pro-Israel groups. Hillel International also bars partnerships with anti-Zionist groups.\n\n\"We need to facilitate dialogue,\" Goldin said. \"We're on a college campus, we're at a university for a reason.\"\n\nShe added. \"Screaming past each other at protests is not productive.\"", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of Israel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Nights, too. Police are swarming the streets of Broadway, many in riot gear. Police vans, some as big as a city bus, are lined up along side streets and Broadway.\n\nOutside the gates of the Columbia University campus, a penned-in group of pro-Israel demonstrators has faced off against a penned-in group of anti-genocide and pro-Palestinian protesters. These groups are usually small, often vastly outnumbered by the police around them, but they are loud and they are not Columbia students. They've been coming every day this April to shout, chant, and hold up signs, some of which are filled with hateful speech directed at the other side, equating protests against the slaughter in Gaza with being pro-Hamas, and calls to bring home the hostages with being pro-genocide.\n\nInside the locked gates of the campus, the atmosphere is entirely different. Even as the now-notorious student tent encampment there stretches through its second week, all is calm. Inside the camp, students sleep, eat, and sit on bedspreads studying together and making signs saying, \"Nerds for Palestine,\" \"Passover is for Liberation,\" and \"Stop the Genocide.\" The Jewish students there held a seder on Passover. The protesters even asked faculty to come into the encampment and teach because they miss their classes. Indeed, it's so quiet on campus that you can hear birds singing in the background. The camp, if anything, is hushed.\n\nThe Real Story on Campus\n\nThose protesters who have been so demonized, for whom the riot police are waiting outside -- the same kinds of students Columbia University's president, Minouche Shafik, invited the police to arrest, zip-tie, and cart away on April 18th -- are mostly undergraduate women, along with a smaller number of undergraduate men, 18 to 20 years old, standing up for what they have a right to stand up for: their beliefs. Furthermore, for those who don't know the Columbia campus, the encampment is blocking nobody's way and presents a danger to no one. It is on a patch of lawn inside a little fence buffered by hedges. As I write, those students are not preventing anyone from walking anywhere, nor occupying any buildings, perpetrating any violence, or even making much noise. (In the early hours of April 30th, however, student protesters did occupy Hamilton Hall in reaction to a sweep of suspensions the day before.)\n\nAs a tenured professor at Columbia's Journalism School, I've been watching the student protests ever since the brutal Hamas attack of October 7th, and I've been struck by the decorum of the protesting students, as angry and upset as they are on both sides. This has particularly impressed me knowing that several students are directly affected by the ongoing war. I have a Jewish student who has lost family and friends to the attack by Hamas, and a Palestinian student who learned of the deaths of her family and friends in Gaza while she was sitting in my class.\n\nGiven how horrific this war is, it's not surprising that there have been a few protesters who lose control and shout hideous things, but for the most part, such people have been quietly walked away by other students or campus security guards. All along, the main messages from the students have been \"Bring back our hostages\" on the Israeli side and \"Stop slaughtering Gazan civilians\" on the antiwar and pro-Palestinian-rights side. Curiously enough, those messages are not so far apart, for almost everyone wants the hostages safe and almost everyone is calling for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to take a different direction and protect the innocent.\n\nUnfortunately, instead of allowing students to have their say and disciplining those who overstep boundaries, Columbia President Shafik and her administration suspended two of the most vocal groups protesting Israel's war on Gaza: the student chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace and Students for Justice in Palestine. This only enraged and galvanized students and some faculty more.\n\nThe Right Seizes and Distorts the Narrative\n\nThen the right got involved, using accusations of widespread antisemitism to take eyes off the astronomical death toll in Gaza -- more than 34,000 reportedly dead as I write this, more than 14,500 of them children -- while fretting about the safety of Jewish students instead.\n\nThe faculty of Columbia takes antisemitism seriously and we have methods in place to deal with it. We also recognize that some of the chants of the protesters do make certain Jewish students and faculty uncomfortable. But as a group of Jewish faculty pointed out in an op-ed for the student newspaper, the Columbia Daily Spectator, it's absurd to claim that antisemitism, which is defined by the Jerusalem Declaration as \"discrimination, prejudice, hostility or violence against Jews as Jews,\" is rampant on our campus. \"To argue that taking a stand against Israel's war on Gaza is antisemitic is to pervert the meaning of the term,\" we wrote. \"Labeling pro-Palestinian expression as anti-Jewish hate speech requires a dangerous and false conflation of Zionism with Jewishness.\"\n\nSadly, that's exactly what the right has succeeded in doing. Not only is the slaughter in Gaza getting lost in the growing fog of hysterical speech about antisemitism on American college campuses, but so is the fact that Arab and Muslim students are being targeted, too. Some students even reported they were sprayed with a mace-like material, possibly manufactured by the Israeli military, and that, as a result, several protesters had to go to the hospital. My own students told me they have been targeted with hate mail and threats over social media. I even saw a doxxing truck sponsored by the far-right group Accuracy in Media driving around the Columbia neighborhood bearing photographs of Muslim students, naming them and calling them terrorists. Again, it's important to note that most of the harassers have been outsiders, not students.\n\nNo, the real threat to American Jews comes not from students but from the very white nationalist MAGA Republicans who are shouting about antisemitism the loudest.\n\nHaving watched the presidents of Harvard, MIT, and the University of Pennsylvania stumble and fall in the face of MAGA Representative Elise Stefanik's bullying accusations of antisemitism in December, Columbia President Shafik did all she could to avoid a similar fate when it was her turn. But when she submitted to four hours of McCarthyite-style questioning in Congress on April 17th -- one Republican even asked if there were Republicans among the faculty -- Shafik cringed, evaded, and caved.\n\n\"I agree with you\" was her most frequent phrase. She never pushed back against the characterization of the Columbia campus by Republican Representatives Virginia Foxx and Stefanik as riddled with antisemitism. She never stood up for the integrity of our faculty and students or for the fact that we're a campus full of remarkable scholars and artists perfectly capable of governing ourselves. She never even pointed out that who we suspend, fire, or hire is none of Congress's business. Instead, she broke all our university rules by agreeing to investigate and fire members of our own faculty and to call in the police when she deemed it necessary.\n\nThe very day after the hearings, that's exactly what she did.\n\nMeanwhile, the death toll in Gaza was never even mentioned.\n\nA Pandora's Box\n\nShafik's craven performance in front of Republican lawmakers opened a Pandora's box of troubles. The student protesters swelled in numbers and erected their encampment. Faculty members wrote outraged opinion pieces condemning Shafik's behavior. And when she called in the police to arrest students, more students than ever joined the protests all over the country.\n\nThen, on April 24th, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson visited Columbia with Republicans Mike Lawler, Nicole Malliotakis, and Anthony D'Esposito (and even Foxx from North Carolina), acting as if some kind of terrible riot had gone on here. Standing at the top of the steps in front of the grand facade of Low Library, a century-old building meant to symbolize learning and reason, and surrounded by heckling students, Johnson declared that some Jewish students had told him of \"heinous acts of bigotry,\" characterized the protesters as \"endorsed by Hamas,\" and called for Shafik to resign \"if she cannot immediately bring order to the chaos.\"\n\n\"What chaos?\" said an undergraduate standing next to me on the steps as we listened.\n\n\"He's saying a bunch of 20-year-old American college students are in cahoots with Hamas?\" another asked incredulously.\n\nJohnson then escalated the threats, claiming the National Guard might be called in and that Congress might even revoke federal funding if universities couldn't keep such protests under control.\n\nI looked behind me at the encampment on the other side of campus. In front of the tents on the grass, the students had erected a sign listing what they called \"Gaza Encampment Community Guidelines.\" These included: \"No desecration of the land. No drug/alcohol consumption. Respect personal boundaries.\" And most significantly, \"We commit to assuming the best intentions, granting ourselves and others grace when mistakes are made, and approaching conflict with the goal of addressing and repairing.\" Designated faculty and students stood at the entrance to make sure no outsiders got in, and that nobody entered the encampment unless they had read and agreed to that list of commitments. The noisiest people on campus were the thronging media. But nobody and nothing was out of control.\n\nThe Weaponization of Antisemitism\n\nSadly, despite the reality on the ground at Columbia, the right's wild narrative of virulent antisemitism here has been swallowed whole, not just by Republicans but by a long list of Democrats, too, including President Biden and Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer, not to speak of New York Representatives Hakeem Jeffries, Jerry Nadler, Dan Goldman, and Adriano Espaillat. They have all publicly condemned the supposedly rampant antisemitism on campus without, it seems, bothering to check their facts.\n\nMeanwhile, MAGA Christian Nationalist Sean Feucht posted on X that \"Columbia has been taken over by radical Pro-Hamas protesters.\"\n\nBack in the real world, the right's hysteria over such supposed antisemitism hasn't really been about protecting Jews at all, as many faculty members (including us Jewish ones) have written and spoken about. Rather, the right is weaponizing antisemitism as a way of furthering its campaign to suppress the kind of freedom of thought and speech on campus that threatens its authoritarian goals of turning this country Christian, conservative, straight, and white -- not to mention their urge to suppress support of Palestinian autonomy.\n\nWhen Students Don't Feel Safe\n\nMy students tell me they feel perfectly safe on campus. They may not like some of the chants they sometimes hear. I myself have caught a few that chilled me as a Jew. I've also heard chants that sicken me on behalf of my Muslim friends. But those have been rare. And campus is a place where everyone should be free to debate, disagree, express their opinions, listen, and learn. We have to remember that free speech does not mean speech we agree with.\n\nNo, where my students do not feel safe is out on Broadway, where extremists on both sides gather. They don't feel safe when the false narratives of Republican politicians draw far-right angry mobs to the campus gates, something that is happening just as I'm writing this piece. Most of all, they don't feel safe when police arrive on campus with guns in their holsters and zip-ties hanging from their belts.\n\nI stood and watched that day the police came. Four huge drones hovered overhead, along with those eternally buzzing helicopters. Dozens of police buses were lined up on West 114th Street on the south side of campus as if prepared to deal with some massive, violent riot. Then, in came the police, some in riot gear, to tie the hands of more than 100 students behind their backs and march them onto police buses.\n\nNot a single student resisted. Even the police were quoted as saying they presented no danger to anyone. As NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell said, \"To put this in perspective, the students that were arrested were peaceful, offered no resistance whatsoever, and were saying what they wanted to say in a peaceful manner.\"\n\nNot long later, those arrested students were suspended and the ones who attend Barnard were locked out of their dorms. Faculty and friends had to offer their couches and spare beds to save those young women from being homeless on the streets of New York. One of them is in my building staying with a colleague downstairs. \"Nobody told our parents that we were being evicted,\" she told me in my lobby.\n\nFaculty Response\n\nMany faculty were so shocked by these events that on Monday, April 22nd, some 300 of us gathered on the steps of Low Library, holding up signs that said, \"Hands Off Our Students\" and \"End Student Suspensions Now.\" Several professors gave impassioned speeches praising those students for their courage, demanding that academic freedom be protected, and castigating Shafik for throwing us all under the bus.\n\nStill, Gaza was not mentioned. It seemed as if the genocide occurring there was disappearing in the fog.\n\n\"I'm worried that the message of our protest is getting lost,\" that suspended student told me as we spoke in the lobby. \"Everyone's talking about academic freedom and police repression instead.\"\n\nIndeed, not only is the protest against Israel's pathological spree of murder in Palestine and on the West Bank being drowned out in this debate, so are the student protesters' demands, so let me reiterate them here:\n\nThat Columbia divest of all investments that profit from Israel's occupation and bombing of Palestine.\n\nThat Columbia sever academic ties with its programs at Tel Aviv and other Israeli Universities.\n\nThat the policing of the campus be stopped immediately.\n\nThat the university release a statement calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nThe other day, on New York's National Public Radio station, WNYC, I heard a caller who had been a campus protester in 1968 say something like, \"It's funny how the protesters of 50 years ago are always right, but the protesters of today are always wrong.\" The people who demonstrated for civil rights then were demonized, beaten, even murdered, but they were right, he pointed out, as were the people who demonstrated against the Vietnam War. (I would say the same for those who protested against the Iraq War and for the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements.)\n\nOne day, the students who are protesting the genocide in Gaza and the persecution of Palestinians today will be seen as on the right side, too. History will prove it. Until then, let's turn the discussion back to where it belongs: an end to the war on Gaza.\n\nFinal Note: This piece was written before the president and trustees of Columbia called in the riot police on the night of April 30th, against the advice of many faculty, to arrest the students in the encampment, as well as those who had occupied Hamilton Hall. Videos show considerable police violence against the students. What happens next remains to be seen.", "source": {"uri": "counterpunch.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Counter Punch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Their Voices Have Never Been More Essential", "body": "On April 30, 56 years after Columbia sent the police in to arrest student protesters who had taken over Hamilton Hall in protest of the Vietnam War -- protests the school loves to promote -- I was walking my 12-year-old daughter home after her choir performance. We had gone an extra stop on the subway because the stop at 116th, Columbia's stop, was closed. Instead, we had to walk back to our apartment from the 125th stop. When we got within sight of Columbia, a line of dozens of police blocked our path. I asked them to let us through; I pointed to our apartment building and said we lived there. As a Columbia professor, I live in Columbia housing.\n\n\"I have my orders,\" the cop in charge said.\n\n\"I live right there,\" I said. \"It's my daughter's bedtime.\"\n\nWe were forced to walk back the way we came from and circle around from another block. Luckily, our building has an entrance through the bodega in the basement. This is how I took my daughter up to her room and sent her to bed.\n\nRead More: Columbia's Relationship With Student Protesters Has Long Been Fraught\n\nA week earlier, I had brought some food for the students camping out on Columbia's West Lawn and had met with similar resistance. Security guards asked whether I was really faculty; I had already swiped my faculty badge that should have confirmed my identity. They asked to take my badge, then they said I hadn't swiped it, which I had, two seconds earlier, as they watched. They said their professors had never brought food to them before. I didn't know what to say to this -- \"I'm sorry that your professors never brought you food?\" They called someone and told them the number on my badge. Finally, they were forced to let me through. They said again that their professors had never brought them food. \"OK,\" I said, and walked into campus. I reported their behavior and never received a reply.\n\nOn April 30, after I had got my daughter to bed, my partner and I took the dog down to pee. We watched the protesters call, \"Shame!\" as the police went in and out of the blockade that stretched 10 blocks around campus. Earlier that day, we had seen police collecting barricades -- it seemed like there would be a bit of peace. As soon as it got dark, they must have used those barricades and more to block off the 10 blocks. There were reports on campus that journalists were not allowed out of Pulitzer Hall, including Columbia's own student journalists and the dean of the School of Journalism, under threat of arrest. Faculty and students who did not live on campus had been forbidden access to campus in the morning. There was no one around to witness. My partner and I had to use social media to see the hundreds of police in full riot gear, guns out, infiltrate Columbia's Hamilton Hall, where protesters had holed up, mirroring the 1968 protests that had occupied the same building.\n\nIn the next few days, I was in meeting after meeting. Internally, we were told that the arrests had been peaceful and careful, with no student injuries. The same thing was repeated by Mayor Adams and CNN. Meanwhile, president Minouche Shafik had violated faculty governance and the university bylaws that she consult the executive committee before calling police onto campus. (The committee voted unanimously against police intervention.)\n\nRead More: Columbia Cancels Main Commencement Following Weeks of Pro-Palestinian Protests\n\nThen, Saturday morning, I got an email from a couple of writing students that they had been released from jail. I hadn't heard that any of our students had been involved. They told me they hadn't gotten food or water, or even their meds, for 24 hours. They had watched their friends bleed, kicked in the face by police. They said they had been careful not to damage university property. At least one cop busted into a locked office and fired a gun, threatened by what my students called \"unarmed students in pajamas.\"\n\nIn the mainstream media, the story was very different. The vandalism was blamed on students. Police showed off one of Oxford Press's Terrorism: A Very Short Introduction. (This series of books offers scholarly introductions that help students prepare for classes, not how-to pamphlets teaching them to do terrorism.)\n\n\"I feel like I'm being gaslit,\" one of my students said.\n\nI teach creative writing, and I am the author of a book about teaching creative writing and the origins of creative-writing programs in the early 20th century. The oldest MFA program in the country, the Iowa Writers' Workshop, was funded by special-interest groups like the Rockefeller Foundation and, famously, the CIA, and was explicitly described by director Paul Engle as a tool to spread American values.\n\nRead More: 'Why Are Police in Riot Gear?' Inside Columbia and City College's Darkest Night\n\nThe way we teach creative writing is essential because it shapes what kinds of narratives will be seen as valuable, pleasurable, and convincing. Today's writing students will record how our current events become history. One of the strategies Columbia took with its police invasion was to block access of faculty, students, and press to the truth. It didn't want any witnesses. It wanted to control the story.\n\nFor weeks, Columbia administration and the mainstream media has painted student protesters as violent and disruptive -- and though there have been incidents of antisemitism, racism, and anti-Muslim hatred, including a chemical attack on pro-Palestine protesters, I visited the encampment multiple times and saw a place of joy, love, and community that included explicit teach-ins on antisemitism and explicit rules against any hateful language and action. Students of different faiths protected each other's right to prayer. Meanwhile, wary of surveillance and the potential use of facial recognition to identify them, they covered their faces. Faculty have become afraid to use university email addresses to discuss ways to protect their students. At one point, the administration circulated documents they wanted students to sign, agreeing to self-identify their involvement and leave the encampment by a 2 p.m. deadline or face suspension or worse. In the end, student radio WKCR reported that even students who did leave the encampment were suspended.\n\nIn a recent statement in the Guardian and an oral history in New York Magazine, and through the remarkable coverage of WKCR, Columbia students have sought to take back the narrative. They have detailed the widespread support on campus for student protesters; the peaceful nature of the demonstrations; widespread student wishes to divest financially from Israel, cancel the Tel Aviv Global Center, and end Columbia's dual-degree program with Tel Aviv University; and the administration's lack of good faith in negotiations. As part of the Guardian statement, the student body says that multiple news outlets refused to print it. They emphasize their desire to tell their own story.\n\nIn a time of mass misinformation, writers who tell the truth and who are there to witness the truth firsthand are essential and must be protected.

Don't fall for that claim. It's a scam. These protesters don't represent most students or the American public.\n\nYet Monday, Columbia University canceled graduation ceremonies, kowtowing to the radical fringe, with whom they largely agree. Students and their families be damned.\n\nHere are the facts: A miniscule 2% of people ages 18 to 29 polled by Harvard's Kennedy School named the Israel-Hamas conflict as their top political concern, compared with double digits who were concerned about the economy. Students couldn't care less about this issue.\n\nClaims that today's campus riots are reminiscent of 1968, when students closed down campuses to protest the Vietnam War, are nonsense. Back then, Gallup found 46% of respondents in that age group considered the Vietnam War the nation's biggest problem. Not 2%.\n\nRay Kelly, former New York Police commissioner, nailed it Sunday when he said the nationwide turmoil \"looks like a conspiracy. ... We need the federal government's investigative capacity to look at this whole situation.\"\n\nOrganized outside groups are behind much of the campus violence. Hours before the storming of Columbia's Hamilton Hall, an outside organization called The People's Forum -- known for its anti-Israel activities and links to the Chinese Communist Party -- started gearing up for its Hamilton Hall invasion. In a meeting, TPF's leader spewed invectives against Columbia.\n\nHours later, protesters smashed the glass doors of Hamilton Hall, vandalizing and seizing the building. When Minouche Shafik, university president, finally called in police, 13 of the 44 arrested in the building had no affiliation with the university.\n\nReflecting on the incidents at Columbia and other New York campuses, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said after the arrests, \"Individuals unaffiliated with these schools had entered these different campuses and, in some cases, were even training students in unlawful protest tactics.\"\n\nNew York University Board Vice Chairman Bill Berkley says these occupations appear to have been orchestrated by external groups. He wants the FBI to investigate.\n\nAs these groups seize control of our universities, where is the FBI? Director Christopher Wray says the bureau does not directly track college protests but will provide information to campuses if the agency becomes aware of a specific threat.\n\nHuh? The FBI should be proactively identifying and heading off campus terrorists.\n\nWhere is the Department of Justice? Two weeks ago, 27 Republican Senators sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland asking for the DOJ to investigate how students' rights are being violated on campus. Radio silence.\n\nWhere is President Joe Biden? When the President was asked if he would use the National Guard to restore order, he emphatically said, \"No.\"\n\nWhy not? The National Guard were deployed in 1962 to protect the right of Black students to attend the newly integrated University of Mississippi. Students of all races and religions who want to go to class or attend their graduation deserve protection.\n\nThe Biden administration is missing in action. Is it because the same big Dem donors supporting Biden -- the Pritzker family, George Soros, David Rockefeller Jr. -- also support pro-Palestine groups orchestrating campus protests?\n\nMeanwhile, images of campus invaders in headscarves are not winning over Americans. The latest Harvard CAPS-Harris survey shows that 61% of Americans polled want a ceasefire only after Hamas is removed from power and the hostages captured on Oct. 7 are released.\n\nThe public also knows what they are seeing on campuses is not freedom of expression -- a sacred American right -- but lawlessness and dangerous disorder. Universities need to be evenhanded, guaranteeing that all sides get to speak and students can attend class.\n\nColumbia's students were heckled and threatened, had their classes canceled and now are robbed of the grandeur of a university graduation. It's a slap in the face to them, and to their families who sacrificed to make college possible.\n\nColombia's motto is, \"In thy light shall we see light.\" Truth is, darkness has descended on Columbia and most elite college campuses.\n\nAlumni and taxpayers alike should withhold their support until these institutions see the light and prioritize their students.", "source": {"uri": "realclearpolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Real Clear Politics"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Kennedy_School", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard Kennedy School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_United_States_involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raymond Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_(Germany)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Left (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irreligion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

None of them are destroying the university. Worst maybe, in some people's minds, they're doing is holding signs that say 'Free Palestine' or 'From the river to the sea.' This is the one that is constantly being thrown out there. Oh, look at this, this sign is frightening all the students, 'From the river to the sea.' And it's like, well, why don't you talk to them?\"\n\nLate-night comic Stephen Colbert said: \"The protests ramped up a couple of weeks ago, after students erected tents on Columbia University's main lawn to show solidarity with Gaza, and the university president took the controversial step of calling in the police to arrest those involved. Now, even if you don't agree with the subject of their protests, as long as they are peaceful, students should be allowed to protest.\"\n\nBut there has been violence, property damage and threats against Jewish students.\n\nAt Columbia, protesters stormed and occupied a building. Just The News reports the widespread college campus protests so far amount to \"millions of dollars in estimated damages.\" And what about obstructing students, faculty and administrators from their activity? In some cases, students could not enter the campus library. Classes have been moved online.\n\nCalifornia State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, a Northern California public university, explained that it shut down its campus \"due to ongoing occupation of Siemens Hall and Nelson Hall, as well as continued challenges with individuals breaking laws in the area surrounding the buildings and the quad.\"\n\nColumbia professor Gil Zussman, a member of the Columbia Task Force on Antisemitism, said: \"I am particularly disappointed in the small group of Columbia and Barnard faculty that are either encouraging students to break university rules or are standing by while the students are doing that. Such actions by students may have lasting impacts on their lives, while the faculty would not be affected.\"\n\nA Jewish Columbia student filed a lawsuit against the university for failing to provide \"a safe educational environment.\" The student's lawyer said: \"There are straight-out calls for the genocide of Jews.\" The lawsuit says: \"The encampment has been the center of round-the-clock harassment of Jewish students, who have been punched, shoved, spat upon, blocked from attending classes and moving freely about campus, and targeted by pro-terrorist hate speech -- both verbal and in written form on massive banners and signs -- with statements such as: 'Death to the Jews'; 'Long live Hamas'; 'Globalize the Intifada ...'\"\n\nHow out of touch are these protesters? A new Harvard-Harris survey shows 80% of registered voters support Israel over Hamas; 61% want a cease-fire only if Hamas is removed; and over 70% want the Israelis to move into Rafah and finish the job.\n\nThis is not complicated. Hamas committed the worst attack against Jews since the Holocaust. Hamas still has hostages, including five Americans. For defending itself and for going after an enemy that imbeds itself with civilians, Israel stands accused of \"genocide.\"\n\nJewish News Syndicate writes: \"The truth is, the Israel Defense Force does its utmost to avoid civilian casualties. The IDF's Code of Ethics stresses the importance of protecting civilians no matter what 'side' they are on. By contrast, Palestinian terrorists deliberately put civilians in harm's way in a cynical attempt to defame the Jewish state.\" For this reason, retired British Col. Richard Kemp called the Israeli military \"the most moral army in the history of warfare.\"\n\nWhat should happen to students who obstruct campus life, chant antisemitic slogans and refuse to comply with instructions to stand down?\n\nBy the way, do these disruptive, anti-Israel and, in many cases, anti-Jew protesters still get student debt forgiveness?", "source": {"uri": "frontpagemag.com",

I will not pretend to know the blow-by-blow of what is happening on the ground from inside my own ivory tower, but based on the communications coming out of presidents' offices, the impression many are leaving is that pockets of higher education desperately need more crisis-management training -- a surprising revelation considering a university president's top responsibility is supervising a passionate group of young adults with still-developing prefrontal cortices that make them prone to risky behavior.\n\nIt all starts with Columbia University in New York, where a jaw-dropping scene took place on Tuesday night last week as police removed students who had barricaded themselves inside a campus building. (Full disclosure: I attended the university's graduate school of journalism.)\n\nIt was the latest escalation in a protest that the university's president, Nemat Shafik, first attempted to shut down the day after her congressional testimony last month.\n\nIn her April 18 request to the New York City Police Department seeking assistance shutting down a protesters' encampment in the center of campus, Shafik justified the move by referencing safety four times and security and danger once each.\n\nThat kind of language is meant to raise alarms, but it is also vague and not once did Shafik define the terms she was using or give specific examples of what made the situation rise to the level of police action.\n\nIf safety, security and danger are your red line for calling in law enforcement, you should probably be pretty clear about what you mean when you invoke them.\n\nThe lack of clarity opened up Shafik to criticism that the decision was performative, meant to placate her critics in the US Congress. No big surprise, the police presence only inflamed the situation and was a precursor to the events of last week. It also set the tense tone for the encampments that students have since established across the US.\n\nFuzzy rhetoric and rules of engagement are pervasive in academia right now. As my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Jessica Karl said on Monday last week, her alma mater, Indiana University Bloomington, made a last-minute change to a 55-year-old campus policy around the use of \"temporary structures\" to arrest students.\n\nAt Columbia, Shafik appears to have broken protocols established in the wake of the university's 1968 student protests; she authorized the initial police sweep over the unanimous objections of the executive committee of the university's senate.\n\n\"The problem all year has been that the administrations are making up rules as they go along, often without even announcing the changes,\" Nadia Abu el-Haj, a Columbia and Barnard anthropology professor, said in a recent interview with the New York Review.\n\nThe situation at Columbia did not have to go this way. The administration at Brown University in Rhode Island for example, has come to an agreement with student demonstrators without reaching the level of turmoil we have seen on other college campuses.\n\nProtesters said they would take down their encampment, while university leadership said it would discuss and vote on divesting funds from corporations with ties to the Israeli military campaign in Gaza.\n\nThe university was willing to negotiate with its students and made real concessions, but also had its own red line.\n\nBrown president Christina Paxson made clear what conduct would not be tolerated, saying she would not drop the charges against 41 students who were arrested at a university sit-in in December last year.\n\n\"I respect the conviction and passion that prompted the students to make the informed choice to be arrested last December,\" Paxson wrote in a letter to the protesters, but \"the practice of civil disobedience means accepting the consequences of decisions on matters of conscience.\"\n\nThis might not be what the students want to hear, but she was exceedingly clear in her position and the logic underpinning it.\n\nThe University of Chicago has operated with the same kind of clarity. That might be one reason that the campus has not yet descended into chaos. After hundreds of students set up a pro-Palestinian encampment on the campus, the university's president, Paul Alivisatos, put out a message laying out the institution's values (\"the greatest leeway possible for free expression\").\n\nHe provided real-life examples that fell on both sides of the line: Gaining permission to cover part of the quad with a massive Palestinian flag, fine; occupying a building, which disrupts learning and the functioning of the university, not fine.\n\n\"When expression becomes disruption, we act decisively to protect the learning environment of students and the functioning of the university against genuinely disruptive protesters,\" Alivisatos wrote.\n\nWhat has likely helped the University of Chicago navigate this moment is its well-articulated principles, in which it operates under the position of \"viewpoint neutrality.\" The institution does not make political or social statements of any kind, believing that doing so quells free speech.\n\nI will not pass judgement on whether being neutral on everything is the right policy or approach, but I do think having a strong operating framework is. It allows for fast and clear decisionmaking when things reach a boiling point. That is what keeps everyone playing by the same rules and during a crisis that is what is really needed to keep everyone safe, secure and out of danger.", "source": {"uri": "taipeitimes.com",

By Wednesday night, it garnered more than 400 signatures.\n\n\"Over the past six months, many have spoken in our name,\" the letter opens. \"We are here, writing to you as Jewish students at Columbia University, who are connected to our community and deeply engaged with our culture and history. We would like to speak in our name.\"\n\n\"Most of us did not choose to be political activists,\" the students wrote. \"We do not bang on drums and chant catchy slogans. We are average students, just trying to make it through finals much like the rest of you.\n\n\"If the last six months on campus have taught us anything, it is that a large and vocal population of the Columbia community does not understand the meaning of Zionism, and subsequently does not understand the essence of the Jewish People,\" the letter continued. \"Yet despite the fact that we have been calling out the antisemitism we've been experiencing for months, our concerns have been brushed off and invalidated.\"\n\nThe letter goes on to reference several incidents that have occurred on campus.: \"We sounded the alarm on October 12 when many protested against Israel while our friends' and families' dead bodies were still warm. We recoiled when people screamed 'resist by any means necessary,' telling us we are \"all inbred\" and that we 'have no culture.' We shuddered when an 'activist' held up a sign telling Jewish students they were Hamas's next targets... We ultimately were not surprised when a leader of the CUAD [Columbia University Against Apartheid] encampment said publicly and proudly that 'Zionists don't deserve to live' and that we're lucky they are 'not just going out and murdering Zionists.' We felt helpless when we watched students and faculty physically block Jewish students from entering parts of the campus we share, or even when they turned their faces away in silence. This silence is familiar. We will never forget.\"\n\n\"One thing is for sure,\" the students wrote. \"We will not stop standing up for ourselves. We are proud to be Jews, and we are proud to be Zionists.\"\n\nIn an interview with Jewish Insider, Goldin, a third-year political science major pursuing a dual degree at the Jewish Theological Seminary, said that the letter's conclusion was most significant to her because it emphasizes that \"we want to sit down and have a dialogue. The point of a university is to be able to have complex conversations. We even want to sit down with people who are saying 'globalize the intifada.'\"\n\nThe concluding paragraph reads, \"We came to Columbia because we wanted to expand our minds and engage in complex conversations. While campus may be riddled with hateful rhetoric and simplistic binaries now, it is never too late to start repairing the fractures and begin developing meaningful relationships across political and religious divides. Our tradition tells us, \"Love peace and pursue peace.\" We hope you will join us in earnestly pursuing peace, truth, and empathy. Together we can repair our campus.\"\n\nGoldin told JI that \"the media is not accurately covering what the Jewish community on campus looks like and this was our way of saying what the Jewish community stands for.\" She noted that the letter took two days of \"nonstop writing and editing.\"\n\n\"It's important that the entire world sees there is a strong contingent of Jewish students on campus who are Zionists and willing to stand up and speak for that,\" Goldin said. \"The anti-Zionist Jews are speaking for all Jewish students at Columbia right now and they're getting a lot of attention, so it's important for people to see this strong majority of Jewish students who feel otherwise.\"\n\nGoldin said that the letter has caught the attention of Jewish students who hadn't been vocal about support for Israel in the past. \"I just got an email from someone Jewish who is not involved with the Jewish community,\" she said. \"He said the letter really spoke to him and signed on. So I think this has a certain impact within the pro-Israel community.\"\n\n\"In terms of the anti-Israel community, I'm not sure how much of an impact it can make,\" Goldin continued. \"But the main purpose of the letter really was to show that amid all the biased media coverage, we will actually speak for ourselves.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Garden of Eden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnard_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barnard College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jewish_Journal_of_Greater_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Theological_Seminary_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jewish Theological Seminary of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Second Intifada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Religions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/jewish_insider_articles_657/256fa42b4a1285f50774810967817e27", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546389", "eventUri": "eng-9546389", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 270, "textEnd": 276}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-12", "textStart": 1531, "textEnd": 1541}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Chamorro (Confidencial)\n\nHAVANA TIMES - On April 17, 2024, a few hours after the president of Columbia University, Minouche Shafik, testified in a hearing of the United States Congress about alleged \"antisemitic\" activities on the university campus, the first student \"encampment\" against the war in Israel in Gaza erupted, which has caused more than 30,000 deaths, mostly civilians, including thousands of women and children, following the Hamas terrorist attack against Israel that resulted in 1,400 deaths and the capture of 230 civilians as hostages.\n\nThe day after, the students were evicted by the New York Police at the request of Columbia authorities, and the pro-Palestinian student protest spread to more than 40 universities, including Texas, Michigan, UCLA in California, Yale, Brown, Northwestern, Emory, Vermont, in 25 states across the United States, where more than 2,000 students have been arrested by the police.\n\nNara Milanich, a history professor at Columbia University, supports the right to student protest and attributes the claim of some congress members about the alleged \"antisemitic threat\" in universities to a political pretext. \"It's a Trojan horse from right-wing sectors, who are more interested in being able to intervene in universities and trying to control what is taught, what is said, and what is researched,\" she states in an interview on the program Esta Semana.\n\nThe academic, a member of the Jewish community, believes that the student protest against President Joe Biden's support for Israel's policy could impact the November elections between the Democratic president and Donald Trump, and warns that \"if the war continues in Gaza, if nothing changes, the student protest will continue after September,\" when the academic year resumes at universities.\n\nWhat was the main cause of the student protest erupting at Columbia University more than two weeks ago? Who called for it, and how do you explain the fact that this protest has now been reproduced at more than 40 universities in the United States?\n\nThis famous camp that started the whole story of the last two weeks began the same day that the president of Columbia appeared before a hearing of congress members in Washington to talk about the alleged crisis of antisemitism at the university.\n\nIn reality, that hearing was a public relations disaster in which she gave in on all the university's values. That same morning of the hearing, a camp appeared, a series of tents in the middle of the university. These green tents seemed like mushrooms. This camp was organized by a group of students, unknown in number. It lasted just about 30 hours. And the next day, at one in the afternoon, the police appeared and arrested about 100 students.\n\nShortly after, another group of students took another space, right next to the first camp. A second camp was reestablished, and it lasted until Tuesday (April 30), when we saw this incredible display of police power. Hundreds of NYPD police officers arrived to dismantle the camp and to evict dozens of students who had taken over a university building.\n\nWhy is the United States Congress intervening in university environments? Some of them, like Columbia, are private universities, and they question the presidents and accuse them of allowing antisemitic expressions in their universities that threaten freedom of speech. Some have resigned, such as the presidents of Harvard and Pennsylvania universities. How does congressional intervention impact universities?\n\nThere has been a whole narrative since last fall, since the October 7 attack (by Hamas in Israel), about antisemitism on campus. And I want to describe a little what I saw as a Jewish professor at the university and in the camp. The camp was peaceful. A group of students organizing workshops on antisemitism, holding dinners, for example, for Jewish Passover. In other words, they were chatting, singing, and some students were attending classes via Zoom from the camp.\n\nThe idea that they were violent, antisemitic students seems entirely invented. Does antisemitism exist on Columbia's campus? Of course. And it is known that prejudice against Jews, but also against many other groups, Islamophobia, are on the rise. But calling the New York City police does not help suppress antisemitism. We are not safer as Jewish professors or students or members of other groups when the police occupy our campus.\n\nWhat seems to be happening is that certain elements of the right in the United States -- and this explains a little why there was a hearing in Congress -- actually have a different political agenda. I don't think they are very interested in the welfare of Jews or the politics of the Middle East. I think they are more interested in being able to intervene in the university and try to control what is taught, what is said, and what is researched.\n\nFor example, in the state of Florida. I am a native of Florida, and in the universities there, there has been an open attack by Governor DeSantis on, for example, how the history of slavery is taught, how climate change is researched, and how voting rights are investigated. In other words, this has nothing to do with the Middle East or antisemitism.\n\nBut the student protest has concrete flags. That is, it questions President Biden's policy of supporting Israel.\n\nOf course, it rejects the war of Israel in Gaza and Palestine. The students have a very clear political agenda against genocide, against the bombing of Gaza. They do have a very clear political stance, but we are talking about the response from congress members. Why do they care so much about what is said and what happens on US campuses? It seems to me that antisemitism has become a kind of Trojan horse to enter the university and influence the policies, the conversations and what is taught.\n\nHow does the Jewish community at Columbia University and other universities react? The students, professors, and other sectors that are donors to the university -- do they feel threatened by this movement?\n\nIt depends on how we define antisemitism. There is a large Jewish population, both students and professors, at Columbia University. But that doesn't mean we are all united, sharing the same political opinions, the same identities, or the same experiences. It's a very heterogeneous group with many different political opinions and relationships with Israel.\n\nAntizionism has been confused with antisemitism. If one perceives pro-Palestinian discourse as antisemitic, then the camps are antisemitic. But in reality, this is a political stance, and we are confusing political discourse with prejudice against an ethnic or religious group. And they are two different things. It is important to distinguish between criticism of Israel and causing harm or discriminating against Jews.\n\nMany of the students in the camp were Jewish; more than a quarter of the students arrested by the police, at least in the first group two weeks ago, were Jewish students. They are students from groups advocating for peace and justice in Palestine.\n\nColumbia University has been intervened twice by the police. What impact does this police intervention and others that have taken place at the University of California, at UCLA, and the possible expulsion of students have?\n\nI have been a professor for 20 years and have never seen anything like these days, the display of police power, the overwhelming show of force.\n\nSurely your audience understands authoritarian contexts. For us here, it has been a huge shock to see hundreds of police officers with helmets and firearms arriving at the university.\n\nThis movement has spread to more than 40 universities in the United States, even some in France and Great Britain. What impact can it have on government interference in universities and the freedom of public debate?\n\nThere is a lot of concern about the impact on political reality, beyond the university. We are in an election year. There is a lot of concern about whether this will be another 1968; will it divide the Democrats? Will it help Trump win the White House again, and will the students be blamed?\n\nIn reality, I believe the blame should fall on the administrators for handling the situation so poorly. If the president of Columbia had left that entirely peaceful camp alone two weeks ago and entered into negotiations with the students, I believe we would be living in a different world. The moment she called the police, everything changed.\n\nHow does the international reverberation of this movement and the different readings of it look? For example, in Nicaragua, dictator Daniel Ortega, who massacred university students who protested in 2018, expressed solidarity with the university students protesting in the United States.\n\nI think the students would not agree with Mr. Ortega's support. They are organizing against the authoritarianism of the US government, which is trying, through these far-right congress members, to intervene in the university. They are against violence and in favor of peace. So, I don't think the students would be very happy to hear Mr. Ortega's stance.\n\nWhat projections does this movement have once the university semester ends? You mentioned that it will influence the US election campaign. Will it have a lasting presence like other movements, such as Black Lives Matter in the United States?\n\nThat's a very good question. I'm a historian, so I can talk about the past, but maybe not so well about the future. From what I've seen of my students who participate, I don't think these protests will disappear. It's true that we're in May, the school year is ending, we're already entering summer, and all the students will go home. Things will likely calm down in the coming months, but September will come, and the new academic year will start. I think if the war continues in Gaza, if nothing changes, if we are still in the same situation, the students will reorganize.\n\nIf the administration has not been able to inspire confidence in the students, nor the professors, it is very possible that the president of Columbia will not last until September. There is a lot of anger with her and her policies; we'll see if there will be a different university leadership and if they can handle it better.\n\nSome universities have managed to negotiate with students, convinced them to dismantle their camps. For example, Brown University and others have managed to end these protests peacefully.\n\nCalling the police simply causes more problems. We'll see if the rectors can learn from their mistakes and follow different policies starting in September. From the students' point of view, I think they will be there with their tents, flags, beliefs, and values again in September.\n\nYou are a Jewish professor who supports this student movement. Are you an exception? What is the general reaction of academics, professors at various universities?\n\nProfessors are quite divided. Some support the students' demands, and some are against them. Some are theoretically in favor but don't like the strategies. Some were in favor of the camps but not the building takeover. We have many opinions on the subject. I am a professor of Latin American History. What I support is freedom of speech, academic freedom, and the right to protest at universities. That's what I support.", "source": {"uri": "havanatimes.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Havana Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "circles_robinson@havanatimes.org", "name": "Circles Robinson", "type":

None of them are destroying the university. Worst maybe, in some people's minds, they're doing is holding signs that say 'Free Palestine' or 'From the river to the sea.' This is the one that is constantly being thrown out there. Oh, look at this, this sign is frightening all the students, 'From the river to the sea.' And it's like, well, why don't you talk to them?\"\n\nLate-night comic Stephen Colbert said: \"The protests ramped up a couple of weeks ago, after students erected tents on Columbia University's main lawn to show solidarity with Gaza, and the university president took the controversial step of calling in the police to arrest those involved. Now, even if you don't agree with the subject of their protests, as long as they are peaceful, students should be allowed to protest.\"\n\nAt Columbia, protesters stormed and occupied a building. Just The News reports the widespread college campus protests so far amount to \"millions of dollars in estimated damages.\" And what about obstructing students, faculty and administrators from their activity? In some cases, students could not enter the campus library. Classes have been moved online.\n\nCalifornia State Polytechnic University, Humboldt, a Northern California public university, explained that it shut down its campus \"due to ongoing occupation of Siemens Hall and Nelson Hall, as well as continued challenges with individuals breaking laws in the area surrounding the buildings and the quad.\"\n\nColumbia professor Gil Zussman, a member of the Columbia Task Force on Antisemitism, said: \"I am particularly disappointed in the small group of Columbia and Barnard faculty that are either encouraging students to break university rules or are standing by while the students are doing that. Such actions by students may have lasting impacts on their lives, while the faculty would not be affected.\"\n\nA Jewish Columbia student filed a lawsuit against the university for failing to provide \"a safe educational environment.\" The student's lawyer said: \"There are straight-out calls for the genocide of Jews.\" The lawsuit says: \"The encampment has been the center of round-the-clock harassment of Jewish students, who have been punched, shoved, spat upon, blocked from attending classes and moving freely about campus, and targeted by pro-terrorist hate speech -- both verbal and in written form on massive banners and signs -- with statements such as: 'Death to the Jews'; 'Long live Hamas'; 'Globalize the Intifada ...'\"\n\nA new Harvard-Harris survey shows 80% of registered voters support Israel over Hamas; 61% want a cease-fire only if Hamas is removed; and over 70% want the Israelis to move into Rafah and finish the job.\n\nThis is not complicated. Hamas committed the worst attack against Jews since the Holocaust. Hamas still has hostages, including five Americans. For defending itself and for going after an enemy that embeds itself with civilians, Israel stands accused of \"genocide.\"\n\nJewish News Syndicate writes: \"The truth is, the Israel Defense Force does its utmost to avoid civilian casualties. The IDF's Code of Ethics stresses the importance of protecting civilians no matter what 'side' they are on. By contrast, Palestinian terrorists deliberately put civilians in harm's way in a cynical attempt to defame the Jewish state.\" For this reason, retired British Col. Richard Kemp called the Israeli military \"the most moral army in the history of warfare.\"\n\nWhat should happen to students who obstruct campus life, chant antisemitic slogans, and refuse to comply with instructions to stand down?\n\nBy the way, do these disruptive, anti-Israel and, in many cases, anti-Jew protesters still get student debt forgiveness?\n\nLarry Elder is a bestselling author and nationally syndicated radio talk-show host.

During the protests, many Jewish students on campus felt unsafe due to several antisemitic incidents in the Columbia encampment.\n\nIn the letter, the Jewish students highlight their support for Israel, and acknowledge their hope for a better future for both Israelis and Palestinians:\n\n\"Our love for Israel does not necessitate blind political conformity. It's quite the opposite. For many of us, it is our deep love for and commitment to Israel that pushes us to object when its government acts in ways we find problematic. Israeli political disagreement is an inhernetly Zionist activity; look no further than the protests against Netanyahu's judicial reforms - from New York to Tel Aviv - to understand what it means to fight for the Israel we imagine. All it takes are a couple of coffee chats with us to realize that our visions for Israel differ dramatically from one another. Yet we all come from a place of love and an aspiration for a better future for Israelis and Palestinians alike.\"", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546389", "eventUri": "eng-9546389", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Some Are Allowed. Some Are Stopped", "body": "Student protests over the Israel-Hamas war have popped up on an increasing number of college campuses following last week's arrest of more than 100 demonstrators at Columbia University.\n\nThe students are calling for universities to separate themselves from any companies that are advancing Israel's military efforts in Gaza -- and in some cases from Israel itself, The Associated Press said.\n\nProtests on many campuses have been orchestrated by coalitions of student groups. The groups largely act independently, though students say they're inspired by peers at other universities.\n\nA look at protests on campuses in recent days:\n\nCOLUMBIA UNIVERSITY Pro-Palestinian student protesters set up a tent encampment at the Ivy League university in New York last week. Police first tried to clear the encampment on April 18, when they arrested more than 100 protesters. But the move backfired, inspiring students across the country and motivating protesters at Columbia to regroup.\n\nEarlier this week, the Ivy League school, where Monday is set to be the last day of classes, switched to hybrid learning. Commencement is set for May 15.\n\nStudents said Friday afternoon that they had reached an impasse with administrators and intended to continue their encampment until their demands are met. Columbia officials had earlier said that negotiations were showing progress. Despite dozens of journalists on campus and scores of police officers outside the gates, an unassuming spring day unfolded Friday with students sitting on the library's steps or grabbing a quick bite while soon-to-be-graduates posed for photos in their powder-blue gowns.\n\nColumbia's president, Minouche Shafik, faced a significant, but largely symbolic, rebuke from faculty Friday but retains the support of trustees, who have the power to hire or fire the president. A report by the university senate's executive committee, which represents faculty, found Shafik and her administration took \"many actions and decisions that have harmed Columbia University,\" including calling in police. Following the report, the senate passed a resolution that included a task force to monitor how the administration would make changes going forward.\n\nHundreds of counterprotesters gathered on the streets outside Columbia on Friday morning, many holding Israeli flags and chanting for the hostages being held by Hamas and other militants to be released.\n\nThe university said in a statement Saturday night that students and administrators had engaged in negotiations.\n\n\"Dialogue between university officials and student organizers is ongoing. We want to be clear: There is no truth to claims of an impending lockdown or evictions on campus,\" the Columbia administration's statement said.\n\nNORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY Police in riot gear cleared an encampment on the campus of Northeastern University on Saturday. Massachusetts State Police said about 102 protesters were arrested and will be charged with trespassing and disorderly conduct. Protesters said they were given about 15 minutes to disperse before being arrested.\n\nAs workers pulled down tents and bagged up the debris from the encampment, several dozen people across from the encampment chanted, \"Let the Kids Go,\" and slogans against the war in Gaza. They also booed as police cars passed and taunted the officers who stood guard.\n\nNortheastern said in a statement that the demonstration, which began two days ago, had become \"infiltrated by professional organizers\" with no affiliation to the university and antisemitic slurs, including \"kill the Jews,\" had been used.\n\n\"We cannot tolerate this kind of hate on our campus,\" the statement posted on social media said.\n\nThe Huskies for a Free Palestine student group disputed the university's account, saying in a statement that counterprotesters were to blame for the slurs and no student protesters \"repeated the disgusting hate speech.\"\n\nStudents at the protest said a counterprotester attempted to instigate hate speech but insisted their event was peaceful and, like many across the country, was aimed at drawing attention to what they described as the \"genocide\" in Gaza and their university's complicity in the war.\n\nAbout 100 people were detained and students who produced a valid ID were released. They will face \"disciplinary action\" but not legal action, while people who refused to disclose their affiliation were arrested, the university said.\n\nUNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA The University of Southern California said on Saturday it had temporarily closed its University Park Campus to nonresidents, without providing details of the closure or possible enforcement measures.\n\nJoel Curran, senior vice president of communications, said in a statement that USC property was vandalized by members of a group \"that has continued to illegally camp on our campus,\" as well as disrupting operations and harassing students and others.\n\nStudents declined numerous attempts by university President Carol Folt to meet, and the administration hopes for \"a more reasonable response Sunday before we are forced to take further action,\" Curran said.\n\n\"While the university fully supports freedom of expression, these acts of vandalism and harassment are absolutely unacceptable and will not be tolerated,\" Curran said.\n\nThe university canceled its main stage graduation ceremony set for May 10 after its campus was roiled by protests. The university already canceled a commencement speech by the school's pro-Palestinian valedictorian, citing safety concerns.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department said more than 90 people were arrested Wednesday night on charges of trespassing during a protest at the university. One person was arrested on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon. There were no reports of injuries.\n\nThe university said Wednesday that it had closed campus and police would arrest people who did not leave.\n\nIn her first public statement in nearly two weeks, President Carol Folt in a statement late Friday -- the last day of classes -- condemned the protests while imploring the campus community to find common ground and ways to support each other.\n\nTHE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY Police clashed with protesters at Ohio State University in Columbus, just hours after they gathered Thursday evening. Those who refused to leave after warnings were arrested and charged with criminal trespass, said university spokesperson Benjamin Johnson, citing rules barring overnight events. Of 36 people arrested, Johnson said Friday that 16 were students and 20 were not affiliated with the university. The school's commencement is set for May 5.\n\nGEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY About 50 students at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., set up a tent encampment on the school's University Yard on Thursday. Later in the day, a group of Georgetown University students and professors staged their own protest walkout and marched to the George Washington campus to join them. The protesters are demanding that the university divest from Israel and lift a suspension against a prominent pro-Palestinian student group.\n\nThe university's last day of classes before final exams is set for Monday and commencement is scheduled for May 19. Because of the noise generated by the protests, the university said it would move law school finals to another building from the one where they had originally been scheduled.\n\nThe university said the protesters must remove tents and disperse by 7 p.m.\n\nCALIFORNIA STATE POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY, HUMBOLDT University officials extended the closure of the campus until May 10 -- the end of the semester -- saying instruction would continue to be remote, after protesters at the university in northern California used furniture, tents, chains and zip ties to block entrances to an academic and administrative building on Monday. Commencement is scheduled for May 11.\n\nOfficials said in a statement Tuesday that students had occupied a second building and three students had been arrested. On Wednesday, officials said some unidentified people who were not students were also inside one of the occupied buildings. On Thursday, the university said protesters continued to occupy the two buildings.\n\nA dean at the school, Jeff Crane, suggested during the meeting that the university form a committee that would include students to do a deep dive into the school's investments. Crane also suggested faculty and students continue meeting every 24 hours to keep an open line of communication. The sides have yet to announce an agreement.\n\nThe school's senate of faculty and staff demanded the university's president resign in a no-confidence vote Thursday, citing the decision to call police in to remove the barricaded students Monday.\n\nOn Friday, the university released a statement responding to questions from those occupying the buildings. The statement said there will be consequences for actions that violate policy or law, but officials would take into account actions by any students who choose to evacuate the occupied buildings and support efforts to clear them. It did not say the charges faced by those arrested would be dropped.\n\nThe administration also offered protesters a 5 p.m. deadline to leave and \"not be immediately arrested.\" But that deadline passed and local media reported that protesters remained on campus Saturday morning.\n\nOfficials on Saturday afternoon said a \"hard closure\" would be enforced going forward. \"Individuals are prohibited from entering or being on campus without permission,\" the university said in a statement.\n\nNEW YORK UNIVERSITY An encampment set up by students at NYU swelled to hundreds of protesters earlier this week. Police on Wednesday said that 133 protesters had been taken into custody. They said all were released with summonses to appear in court on disorderly conduct charges. Commencement is set for May 15.\n\nEMORY UNIVERSITY At Emory University in Atlanta, where Atlanta police and Georgia state troopers had dismantled a camp on the school's quadrangle, the school president on Friday said in an email that some of the videos of a clash between police and people on the campus \"are shocking\" and that he is \"horrified that members of our community had to experience and witness such interactions.\"\n\nSchool officials said 20 of the 28 people arrested were \"Emory community members.\"\n\nVideo circulated widely on social media shows two women who identified themselves as professors being detained, with one of them slammed to the ground by one officer as a second officer then pushes her chest and face onto a concrete sidewalk. In a separate incident Thursday evening, some protesters pinned police officers against the glass doors of the Candler School of Theology on the campus and threw objects at the officers, Emory's president said.\n\nNORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY Northwestern University changed its student code of conduct Thursday morning to bar tents on its suburban Chicago campus as student activists set up an encampment.\n\nUniversity President Michael Schill issued an email saying the university had enacted an \"interim addendum\" to its student code to bar tents, among other things, and warned of disciplinary actions including suspension, expulsion and criminal charges.\n\n\"The goal of this addendum is to balance the right to peacefully demonstrate with our goal to protect our community, to avoid disruptions to instruction and to ensure university operations can continue unabated,\" Schilling said.\n\nThe university's commencement is scheduled for June 9.\n\nFASHION INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY A few dozen protesters set up tents and occupied a building Thursday at the Fashion Institute of Technology, part of the public State University of New York system. Protesters sat on the floor or milled around, many wearing face masks and kaffiyehs. Other protesters outside the building held signs and Palestinian flags. They refused to speak to a reporter. Around a dozen protesters spent the night in tents and sleeping bags inside a campus building. The institute's museum, which is located in the building where the demonstrators set up camp, was closed Friday.\n\nThe school's commencement was still scheduled for May 22 and May 23.\n\nINDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON After an encampment was set up at Indiana University Bloomington, police with shields and batons shoved into a line of protesters linked arm-in-arm Thursday afternoon. Videos posted to social media appear to show the protest continuing after law enforcement stopped making arrests.\n\nIn an update Friday, the university police said 34 people were arrested. Public information officer Hannah Skibba said charges include trespassing, resisting law enforcement and battery on a public safety official. One officer sustained \"minor injuries.\" Protests continued Friday, one day before the last day of classes. The university's commencement is scheduled for May 4.\n\nJeffrey Kehr, chief deputy prosecutor for Monroe County, said in an email that those arrested were released on their own recognizance and the office will \"examine all the reports we receive and any relevant footage to determine what, if any, charges are appropriate.\"\n\nUNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA The University of Pennsylvania interim President J. Larry Jameson called late Friday for an encampment of protesters on the west Philadelphia campus to be disbanded, saying it violated the university's facilities policies.\n\nThe \"harassing and intimidating comments and actions\" by some protesters violate the school's open expression guidelines as well as state and federal law, Jameson said, and vandalism of a statue with antisemitic graffiti was \"especially reprehensible and will be investigated as a hate crime.\"\n\n\"I am deeply saddened and troubled that our many efforts to respectfully engage in discourse, support open expression, and create a community that is free of hate and inclusive for everyone have been ignored by those who choose to disrupt and intimidate,\" he said.\n\nFailure to disband the encampment immediately and to adhere to Penn's policies will result in sanctions consistent with our due process procedures as they apply to students, faculty, and staff, Jameson said.\n\nThe university's chapter of the American Association of University Professors responded by urging the administration not to \"escalate the situation\" or \"violate the rights of students and faculty.\"\n\nUNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA In Gainesville, Florida, home to the University of Florida, protesters were warned Friday that students could face suspension and banishment for three years, and employees could be fired, if they violated rules including camping, using bullhorns, protesting inside buildings or possessing weapons. Around 50 people have been protesting on campus since Wednesday.\n\nEarlier this year, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis directed the state's universities to make it easier for out-of-state students facing antisemitism and other religious harassment in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war to transfer to Florida campuses.\n\nThe Republican governor's administration last fall also ordered state universities to ban a pro-Palestinian student organization, Students for Justice in Palestine, from campuses, saying it illegally backs Hamas militants who attacked Israel. The group has challenged that decision in federal court.\n\nARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY Arizona State University said 69 people were arrested early Saturday on suspicion of criminal trespassing for setting up an unauthorized encampment on a lawn on its Tempe campus. The protesters were given chances to leave and those who refused were arrested.\n\n\"While the university will continue to be an environment that embraces freedom of speech, ASU's first priority is to create a safe and secure environment that supports teaching and learning,\" the university said in a statement.\n\nProtesters pitched tents, including some that police dismantled, and at least three people were arrested Friday. A television news report put the number of protesters in the dozens and video showed people waving flags and holding signs reading \"Free Palestine.\"\n\nUniversity and Tempe city police representatives did not immediately answer emails asking about arrests, injuries or the size of the crowd.\n\nA university spokesperson, Elena Bras, issued a statement that said \"unapproved encampments\" were prohibited on campus, and failure to comply would be grounds for arrest for trespassing.", "source": {"uri": "english.aawsat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asharq Al-Awsat

Clearly, the rights of many Jewish and pro-Israel students were trampled, and so it's reassuring to see the education bureaucrats acting to restore some sanity and decency at Columbia.\n\nThe only problem is that they're not doing that. Instead, the Biden regime's Department of Education is only making things worse. Its civil rights investigation is not about the mistreatment of Jewish students, but of Palestinian students.\n\nYes, we have really entered bizarro world, and everything is upside down. USA Today reported Friday that \"the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights on Thursday opened an investigation into Columbia University for how it's treated Palestinian students and allies, lawyers said.\" The Biden apparatchiks have filed a complaint that \"alleges unequal treatment by Columbia administrators, including President Minouche Shafik.\"\n\nRemember, this is the same Minouche Shafik about whom the Washington Post reported Friday that \"several Republican lawmakers have accused her of not taking rapid action against protesters and not doing enough to make Jewish students feel safe on campus.\" Yet as far as the Biden regime's Department of Education is concerned, it isn't the Jewish students who feel unsafe. USA Today continues: \"Four students and the student organization, Students for Justice in Palestine, told federal officials they experienced harassment, death threats and doxing on campus since the start of the war, according to the complaint filed by Palestine Legal, a legal aid organization.\"\n\nMeanwhile, back on planet Earth, this is what has really been happening at Columbia University. At the end of April, pro-Hamas thugs assaulted a Jewish student. This took place as pro-Hamas protestors, many from outside the university, shattered the glass of the university's main building and occupied it.\n\nAll that happened months after Columbia administrators met with a student, Khymani James, and heard him speak openly about murdering Jews. Not only did they opt not to expel him and allowed him to remain on campus, but they watched as he became the leader of the encampment protests. Then he issued a video in which he said: \"Be glad -- be grateful -- that I'm not just going out and murdering Zionists. I've never murdered anyone in my life, and I hope to keep it that way.\"\n\nBack in the Education Department's bizarro world, however, Radhika Sainath of Palestine Legal claimed that \"for months, Columbia has not only failed to take action to protect Palestinian students and their allies speaking out for Palestinian freedom from racist harassment and discrimination, but actively engaged in differential treatment. This investigation could not have come at a better time, as we just saw Columbia escalate its crackdown against Palestinian students and their allies by bringing in the NYPD to brutally arrest student protesters for the second time in less than two weeks.\"\n\nThis civil rights complaint couldn't possibly be more absurd. In pursuing it, the Biden regime once again demonstrates its true colors and deep hatred of Israel. Are Jewish students breaking into and trashing university buildings? Are Jewish students assaulting Palestinian Arab students?\n\nThere is abundant justification for a civil rights investigation of how Jewish students are being treated at Columbia, but the Students for Justice in Palestine and Palestine Legal know how to play the game: they know that victimhood is a coveted status in our sick society, and that consequently, being the first or loudest to claim that status is a quick pathway to preferential treatment and even pecuniary reward.\n\nRelated: Why Is the Pro-Palestinian Encampment Craze Sweeping Our Colleges?\n\nIt's also useful to recall that Students for Justice in Palestine is the brainchild of a professor of \"Islamophobia\" named Hatem Bazian, who has openly called for an intifada, a violent uprising, not in Israel only, but in the United States as well. And regarding supporters of Israel, he has declared, \"We need to harass them.\"\n\nYet it is his group, not the people that members of his group frequently harass on campuses, that is the object of the Department of Education's efforts. This entire ridiculous charade is a prime example of how our academic institutions have lost their way, deserve no public funding, and are in severe, crying need of reform.\n\nWhat has happened of late at Columbia illustrates that anew. But also in radical need of reform is the Washington bureaucracy. Instead of acting against the pro-Hamas thuggery at Columbia and other campuses, the Biden regime is aiding and abetting it.", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_spencer@pjmedia.com", "name": "Robert Spencer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_Justice_in_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Students for Justice in Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_threat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Death threat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Second Intifada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureaucracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/113/42fd2fe5-43d0-4bdc-bbbb-d4fde5f947fe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546389", "eventUri": "eng-9546389", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Its administration just broke them to authorize police on campus, university report concludes", "body": "Columbia University's South Lawn, where students built two \"Gaza Solidarity Encampments,\" is now empty, after police equipped with military-grade weapons and riot gear carried out the largest mass arrests of students on the campus since the school's infamous 1968 protests.\n\nMore than 200 students were arrested during two police raids on April 18 and April 30, the latter of which, coincidentally, is the same day 700 students were arrested for protesting the divisive Vietnam War and Columbia's expansion into Harlem more than 50 years ago.\n\nFollowing the protests, in 1969 Columbia restructured the way its administration makes judgments that affect students through the creation of regulatory bodies bound by policies of shared governance at the school. It created the University Senate -- a board of roughly 100 faculty, students, administrators, and alumni -- meant to be a \"policy-making body which may consider all matters of university-wide concern,\" according to the school's website.\n\nPrior to April 18, the University Senate voted unanimously to veto a decision by the administration to bring police onto campus where students were demonstrating.\n\nIn allowing the police to enter Columbia grounds anyway, the university administration contradicted policies the school itself had agreed to, according to a senate report Fortune reviewed.\n\nThat decision \"undermined shared governance, rather than adhere to the rules of university conduct adopted by our university senate and set out in the university statutes,\" states an op-ed written by the Columbia College Student Council published by the Guardian. The separate University Senate report reviewed by Fortune found that bringing the cops onto campus violated the very framework of consultation that was established in response to the prolific student protests of 1968.\n\nRoosevelt Mont\u00e1s, who has been teaching at Columbia for 30 years and has held roles on the University Senate in the past, told Fortune that to the best of his knowledge, the rules of consultation established in 1969 have never been broken before -- until now.\n\nThe most significant action in violation of these rules, he described, \"was the calling of police twice to campus over the objections of the university senate and without consultation with students and faculty membership.\"\n\nColumbia has been engulfed by student dissent following the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Southern Israel, which killed over 1,200 people, and Israel's response, a catastrophic military campaign now entering its seventh month. Along with demands for divestment and financial transparency, the encampment students also aim to show solidarity with millions of Palestinian civilians facing calamitous levels of disaster, including famine, disease outbreaks, and a children's crisis, in which at least a thousand children have lost limbs and over 19,000 children have been orphaned because of indiscriminate bombing in the war.\n\nNow in the aftershock, the university is facing a lawsuit from students in two groups, Jewish Voice for Peace and Students for Justice in Palestine, which were suspended after the administration made unclearly defined changes to the university's rules about protests without properly consulting with the University Senate, the report states. Other issues are brewing as well. Those include a potential no-confidence vote on the school's president, Minouche Shafik, from the University Senate and an \"outside academic-led\" investigation into the administration, which could undermine Shafik's future at the school.\n\nWhen asked specifically about violating the 1969 pact, a Columbia spokesperson did not respond to several of Fortune's requests for comment.\n\nFor students, as outlined in the Guardian op-ed, the administration's most serious violations of these institutional rules include what they view as the wrongful suspension of the two student Palestinian groups last fall, and authorizing the police to mass arrest students holding peaceful demonstrations.\n\nThe University Senate report states that in the fall of 2023, when student groups Jewish Voice for Peace and Students for Justice in Palestine were suspended, the administration made policy changes without consulting with the senate. The changes meant that student demonstrations would be held under the university's event policy rules, rather than the school's rules for university conduct, which includes standards like \"the right to demonstrate, to rally, to picket\" and \"to retain the freedom to express opinions on any subject whatsoever.\"\n\nA Columbia University spokesperson told Fortune the two student groups were suspended after violating the university's long-standing event policies, which require student groups to give administration advance notice of special events a group plans to hold.\n\nMont\u00e1s, a professor of American studies and citizenship at Columbia, said the groups were suspended without the traditional consultations with campus deliberative bodies. Meanwhile, the arrests at Columbia have left what Mont\u00e1s describes as a community \"broken down.\"\n\n\"There's a sense of alienation and violation by students that is unlike anything I've ever seen in over 30 years at Columbia,\" he said.\n\nThe university spokesperson declined to comment on the pending litigation.\n\nThe encampments, which first cropped up at the prestigious Ivy League school, launched a wave of more than 80 solidarity student encampments across the country and the globe -- many of which have also been met with police response and upwards of 1,000 arrests.\n\nAnother professor, Archon Fung, who teaches political science and citizenship at the Harvard Kennedy School, told Fortune it's important to consider exactly what the students were doing and asking their university for -- in relation to the level of aggressive force they are met with.\n\n\"We do know that a firearm was discharged,\" Fung told Fortune, as well as several flash-bang grenades, of which he said, \"To be clear, that weapon was developed as a hostage rescue military device.\"\n\nCivil disobedience, which Columbia has a particular history with, \"has an important place in democracy,\" Fung said, adding, \"Civil disobedience is, by definition, breaking the rules.\"\n\nIn terms of how to respond to acts of civil disobedience, Fung said, it's helpful to consider the different levels of threats an act of disobedience presents. The lowest level of threat would be cases of passive resistance, he said, while the highest level, which would also warrant a high level of force, would involve aggressive actions, like fighting or throwing things. Notably, he said, the atmosphere at many college encampments has been largely peaceful.\n\nFor Columbia demonstrators, the requests from the students were threefold: first, for the university to divest from companies that support Israel's military campaign in Gaza; second, for public transparency of the university's financial portfolio; and third, to request amnesty for all students facing disciplinary action from activism on campus.\n\nA Columbia University spokesperson told Fortune the school will not divest from Israel but has offered to publish a process for students to access a list of Columbia's direct investment holdings, and to increase the frequency of updates to that list. It also offered to make investments in health and education in Gaza.\n\nThe spokesperson told Fortune the school's goal was to reach a resolution with the protesters that would dismantle the encampment on the lawn, but its moves to authorize the police to do so has now drawn criticism from politicians, civil rights groups, and other academics.\n\n\"To jump to that very high level of force in a passive resistance case seems unjustified to me,\" Fung said.\n\nAccording to the Columbia Spectator, the NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey said that he authorized the use of \"distraction devices\" for the \"first time in many years.\"\n\nThe University Senate, professor Mont\u00e1s said, \"has a lot of symbolic and moral power, as the only university-wide representative body,\" but it doesn't hold much executive power, which falls on the president and board of trustees.\n\nStill, he said, the senate is currently weighing a no-confidence vote, and if it gains significant staff support, the vote \"could undermine the president's ability to run the university.\"\n\nAccording to a Columbia Student News report, the University Senate held a special plenary on May 3 to discuss launching an investigative task force into the administration and a potential vote of no confidence against the president. Ultimately, though, only the board of trustees can remove a president.\n\nOn Monday, Columbia announced that this year's university-wide commencement ceremony is now canceled, though smaller ceremonies will still take place.\n\n\"If the thing you were concerned about was minimizing disruption to university operations, this seems to have had the opposite effect, and perhaps foreseeably so,\" Fung said.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

They have screamed, held signs that say Al-Qassam's next targets in front of Jews who are singing songs of peace. There was a student who said that all Zionists deserve to die, and we should all be grateful that he hasn't gone around murdering us yet. This rhetoric shouldn't be allowed anywhere in the country, let alone on a campus that has 5,000 Jewish students.\"\n\nKrantz said given the hate-filled turmoil in recent weeks, she is now worried about being able to secure a solid job after graduation.\n\n\"I'm already getting comments from people being like, 'Good luck, they're not going to employ you because you went to Columbia,'\" Krantz said. \"For me, I'm a mother, and I've got two boys, and I would like to be able to get a very good job after this, and now hearing that, it's - basically takes away all the hard work.\"\n\n\"What's the point of going to a college if you're not going to get a good job?\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bailee_hill@foxnews.com", "name": "Bailee Hill", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternities_and_sororities", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraternities and sororities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_&_Friends_First", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox & Friends First"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Watters", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Watters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/05/1024/512/krantzcolumbiasenior.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546389", "eventUri": "eng-9546389", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 4213, "textEnd": 4224}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

The encampments have spread to dozens of other campuses and led to the arrests of thousands of students, violent clashes and -- Jewish groups say -- a rash of harassment and hostility toward Jews. Last week, protesters at Columbia occupied a campus building before being arrested.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get must-read New York stories each day\n\nBy submitting, I agree to the JTA/New York Jewish Week privacy policy & terms of use.\n\nPlease accept the JTA Privacy Policy\n\nBy submitting the above I agree to the privacy policy and terms of use of JTA.org\n\nAt Columbia and other campuses, outside groups on both sides of the debate have come to the protests, in some cases instigating physical fights or making inflammatory statements.\n\nNational politicians, including Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, have also come to Columbia to denounce the protests.\n\n\"It's nice that they've been supportive but it's only further polarized campus,\" one of the four co-authors of the letter, junior Eliana Goldin, told the New York Jewish Week about pro-Israel protesters unaffiliated with the school. \"I wish the entire world stayed out of campus politics so that we could figure out our problems on our own. But since that's not the reality, we wanted to get our voice out there.\"\n\nGoldin said that the four co-authors were inspired to write the letter when one of them said, \"People have been speaking in our name to the news and saying, 'This is what the Jews on campus believe,' and it's really not the case.\" It was published on Saturday night.\n\n\"So we should put out a statement and show the world what we actually stand for and combat false narratives,\" added Goldin, a student in Columbia's joint undergraduate program with the Jewish Theological Seminary who is also co-chair of Columbia's pro-Israel group.\n\nThe letter has circulated widely in the days since it was published and gained hundreds of signatories, reaching more than 450 by Wednesday afternoon. Some of the people who shared it are among the most prominent non-student activists campaigning against antisemitism at universities, such as investor Bill Ackman, who wrote on X that the letter \"provides helpful perspective on how it is to be a Jewish student on campus today.\"\n\nA post sharing the letter by Israeli Columbia professor Shai Davidai, who has publicly lambasted the school for what he says is its failure to protect Jewish students, has been viewed more than a million times. \"Their letter tells the story of what's it like being a Jewish student right now better than any professor like myself could ever do,\" Davidai wrote.\n\nThe letter does not focus on the encampment itself but does cites several examples of antisemitic and anti-Zionist speech surrounding the protest, from a student leader saying \"the Holocaust wasn't special\" to chants of \"We don't want no Zionists here.\"\n\nSupport the New York Jewish Week\n\nOur nonprofit newsroom depends on readers like you. Make a donation now to support independent Jewish journalism in New York.\n\nDonate\n\nMuch of the letter is an explanation of why the students view support for a Jewish state as an integral part of their Judaism.\n\n\"We proudly believe in the Jewish People's right to self-determination in our historic homeland as a fundamental tenet of our Jewish identity,\" it continues. \"Contrary to what many have tried to sell you - no, Judaism cannot be separated from Israel. Zionism is, simply put, the manifestation of that belief.\"\n\nIt adds, \"We are targeted for our belief that Israel, our ancestral and religious homeland, has a right to exist. We are targeted by those who misuse the word Zionist as a sanitized slur for Jew, synonymous with racist, oppressive, or genocidal. We know all too well that antisemitism is shapeshifting.\"\n\nGoldin said the core of the letter is its defense of Zionism.\n\n\"The most important part is that people understand why we're Zionist,\" Goldin told JTA. \"There's just a gross misunderstanding of what it means to be a Zionist.\"\n\nThe letter primarily focuses on rebutting the claims of anti-Zionists, but signatories said they were concerned about external interference in the protests from across the ideological spectrum. Ezra Dayanim, a Columbia-JTS senior, said he is \"not such a fan of outsiders interfering with campus affairs.\"\n\nThe letter comes shortly after a statement by Jewish student leaders at UCLA sent a similar message. The UCLA letter was posted after pro-Israel activists unaffiliated with the school attacked its encampment and a pro-Palestinian activist.\n\n\"We cannot have a clearer ask for the off-campus Jewish community: stay off our campus,\" the UCLA students wrote. \"Do not fund any actions on campus. Do not protest on campus. Your actions are harming Jewish students.\"\n\nDayanim specifically took issue with a Holocaust Remembrance Day event held Monday two blocks away from the university that was hosted by the Israeli-American Council and a variety of centrist and right-leaning Jewish groups.\n\nThe event was attended mostly by Israeli adults with no affiliation with Columbia. In addition to testimony from Holocaust survivor Tova Friedman, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan addressed the crowd, saying, \"The events we are witnessing today on college campuses are reminiscent of Kristallnacht in Nazi Germany.\"\n\nDayanim attended part of the rally, which he called a \"worthy cause.\" But he objected to calls from non-student speakers to divest from Columbia. \"I thought that the message was totally co-opted,\" he said.\n\n\"We want to speak for ourselves,\" he added. \"We don't appreciate when outsiders come in and totally distort our message. It cheapens our credibility.\"\n\nSupport the New York Jewish Week\n\nOur nonprofit newsroom depends on readers like you.

These students are the best of us: resilient, thoughtful, and deeply committed to the Jewish people and Israel.\"\n\nHe goes on to list actions that people unaffiliated with the university can take: reaching out to the university administration and encouraging them to follow through on disciplinary actions against those involved in the Hamilton Hall takeover.\n\nGoldin said she hopes students on opposite ends of the spectrum become more open to talking with each other. In recent years, many pro-Palestinian groups have adopted a policy of \"anti-normalization\" that bars them from interacting with pro-Israel groups. Hillel International also bars partnerships with anti-Zionist groups.\n\n\"We need to facilitate dialogue,\" Goldin said. \"We're on a college campus, we're at a university for a reason.\"\n\nShe added. \"Screaming past each other at protests is not productive.\"", "source": {"uri": "jta.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish Telegraphic Agency"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Shai Davidai, an assistant professor at the Columbia Business School (as it says on his X/Twitter bio), shared the Google document on the microblogging platform.\n\nLinking the document to his post, he wrote: \"Hundreds of Jewish students at @Columbia just published one of the most incredible student letters I have ever read.\n\nIt's not only magnificently written, but it also clearly articulates their experiences on campus for the past six months.\n\nTheir letter tells the story of what's it like being a Jewish student right now better than any professor like myself could ever do.\n\nPlease take 4-5 minutes to read their letter. Give Jewish students a voice.\"\n\nTitled, \"In Our Name: A Message from Jewish Students at Columbia University,\" the publicly shared letter opens with the message that \"many have spoken in\" their community's name. This statement may be seen as a dig at those Jewish students standing in solidarity with the Palestinian cause.\n\nThese claims can be linked to a previous report of a Jewish student addressing concerns of \"anti-Semitism\" on US campuses. On April 23, Jared Kannel, yet another fellow Jewish student, spoke to TRT World and asserted that he felt \"100% safe\" on university grounds.\n\nAlso read | Pro-Palestine protesters arrested at NYC's Fashion Institute of Technology as Israel moves into Rafah\n\nKannel, who's been partaking in pro-Palestinian protests and joined the demonstration in the Gaza encampment at Columbia University, said, \"I'm a Jewish student at Columbia. When we talk about antisemitism on campus, that's taking the spotlight away from Gaza, away from Palestine and Palestinian students on campus, and putting it back onto me. I am perfectly safe here. And this has all been a distraction because they dont' want us talking about the nonstop massacre of Gaza, of Palestinian civilians...\"\n\nHowever, the new letter from hundreds of Columbia students of Jewish faith highlighted that such \"people claiming to represent 'real Jewish values'... delegitimize (their) lived experiences of antisemitism.\"\n\nThe letter addresses that most of these students \"did not choose to be political activists,\" and \"are average students... trying to make it through finals.\" However, with the other side of the narrative allegedly \"demonizing them \"under the cloak of anti-Zionism,\" they've \"forced\" these students into their \"activism and forced (them) to publicly defend our Jewish identities.\"\n\nThe letter continues: \"We proudly believe in the Jewish People's right to self-determination in our historic homeland as a fundamental tenet of our Jewish identity.\" This particular huge group of Jewish students at Columbia claims that \"Judaism cannot be separated from Israel.\" Adding on to that, they also declare, \"Zionism is, simply put, the manifestation of that belief.\"\n\nMoving on, they foreground that their religious texts are filled with \"references to Israel, Zion and Jerusalem\" and that Israel is replete with \"archaeological remnant of a Jewish presence spanning centuries.\"\n\nAlso read | Watch: Police use bulldozer to halt pro-Palestine protest at Amsterdam University\n\nAlso underlining how, despite most of them not being \"religiously observant,\" \"Zionism remains a pillar of (their) Jewish identities.\"\n\nAddressing generations of suffered trauma, the students underscore a sense of collective alienation tied to their community. Eventually, they proclaim that Israel isn't merely their \"ancestral homeland,\" but also the \"only place in the modern world where Jews can safely take ownership of their own destiny.\"\n\nThereafter, the students correlate \"the essence of Hitler's antisemitism\" with the \"evil irony of today's antisemitism,\" which is addressed as a \"twisted reversal of (their) Holocaust legacy\" as pro-Palestine protesters have allegedly \"dehumanized them on campus and imposed the \"white colonizer's title on them, as mentioned in the letter.\n\nColumbia's students of the Jewish faith alleged that these \"antisemitic\" slurs have branded them as \"the oppressors of all brown people,\" while others have supposedly hurled the \"Holocaust wasn't special\" claims at them.\n\nAdditionally, the student body reportedly also included how their fellow university mates at Columbia have chanted the following lines:\n\nThe Jewish student body further goes on to accuse society of \"blaming\" and \"scapegoating\" Jewish people \"as responsible for societal evil of the time.\"\n\nThe lengthy petition addressed to the Columbia community then lists several instances of the violent history faced by Jews, as the students label themselves \"victims of genocide\" for not being \"European enough.\" Their claims again drive the divisive wedge between them and their fellow college-mates, who're standing with the Gaza cause and claim Palestinians to be the victims of a genocide fuelled by Israel.\n\nOther statements also allege that many \"misuse\" the word \"'Zionist' as a sanitized slur,\" which is believed to be synonymously associated with being \"racist, oppressive or genocidal.\" Notably speaking of how \"antisemitism is shapeshifting,\" these students proudly hold on to their firm love for Israel\n\nBefore signing off, this group of Jewish students also accused \"students and faculty\" of physically blocking access to the campus entrance.\n\nBeyond the claims made in this latest letter update, other media reports have previously spotlighted other Jewish students standing in support of the pro-Palestine campus protests.\n\nCommonDreams.Org shared an open letter signed by another set of hundreds of Jewish students at US universities condemning Israel's \"genocidal assault on Gaza.\"\n\nAn extract from this particular open letter in solidarity with student encampments for Gaza, read: \"We demand that academic and political leaders stop misrepresenting and demonizing protests and their oorganizers\"\n\nThe original five Jewish student authors of this letter reportedly highlight that they are from different college campuses in the US. However, identifying themselves as \"members of Jewish Voice for Peace, IfNotNow, and Students for Justice in Palestine chapters and a number of independent campus organizations\" they claim that this letter has been penned independently and does not share any affiliations with the aforementioned organizations.\n\nTheir public address further states, \"We reject the ways that these encampments have been smeared as antisemitic, and we call on our institutions to take action to stop Israel's assault on Gaza.\"\n\nAlso, taking note of those people who've spread \"violent, hateful, and antisemitic messages,\" the signers assert they \"wholeheartedly reject the claim that these encampments are antisemitic and that they are an inherent threat to Jewish student safety.\"", "source": {"uri":

They also charge that anti-Zionist Jews who stand with pro-Palestinian protesters \"tokenize themselves\" and try to delegitimize the experiences of Zionist Jews on campus.\n\nSome of the students who signed the letter, which had 540 signatories as of Thursday morning, have already spoken publicly against Columbia for the antisemitism they say they have faced there. One student testified before Congress about the issue; others have been counterprotesters at pro-Palestinian rallies. Others have not spoken out before.\n\nIn all, by Thursday the letter was signed by just over 10 percent of the estimated 5,000 Jewish undergraduates and graduate students at Columbia and its affiliated colleges. All signatories gave their names, college affiliation and year of graduation, unlike some public letters, that allow for anonymous signatures.\n\nTitled \"In Our Name: A Message from Jewish Students at Columbia University,\" the letter represents the views of students who state that they love Israel, even though they do not always agree with the actions of the Israeli government.\n\n\"Our love for Israel does not necessitate blind political conformity,\" the letter stated. \"It's quite the opposite.

We do not bang on drums and chant catchy slogans. We are average students, just trying to make it through finals much like the rest of you. Those who demonize us under the cloak of anti-Zionism forced us into our activism and forced us to publicly defend our Jewish identities,\" the letter said.\n\nAfter defending the concept of Zionism and \"the Jewish People's right to self-determination,\" the letter then when on to explain Judaism's link to Israel and its being a haven against anti-Semitism. On the issue of anti-Semitism, the letter notes that Jewish people often get put into a corner wherein they are guilty for every societal ill regardless.\n\nIn every generation, the Jewish People are blamed and scapegoated as responsible for the societal evil of the time. In Iran and in the Arab world, we were ethnically cleansed for our presumed ties to the 'Zionist entity.' In Russia, we endured state-sponsored violence and were ultimately massacred for being capitalists. In Europe, we were the victims of genocide because we were communists and not European enough. And today, we face the accusation of being too European, painted as society's worst evils - colonizers and oppressors. We are targeted for our belief that Israel, our ancestral and religious homeland, has a right to exist. We are targeted by those who misuse the word Zionist as a sanitized slur for Jew, synonymous with racist, oppressive, or genocidal. We know all too well that antisemitism is shapeshifting.\n\nThe letter not only celebrated Israel's defense of Jewish people but also it being a democracy in the Middle-East that also serves as home to Muslims and Christians. It concluded with a call for peace and understanding.\n\n\"We came to Columbia because we wanted to expand our minds and engage in complex conversations. While campus may be riddled with hateful rhetoric and simplistic binaries now, it is never too late to start repairing the fractures and begin developing meaningful relationships across political and religious divides,\" it wrote.\n\n\"Our tradition tells us, 'Love peace and pursue peace.' We hope you will join us in earnestly pursuing peace, truth, and empathy.

No vandalizing or taking over of academic buildings. And no reports of insults, harassment or threats of violence aimed at Jewish students.\n\nStill, as students finish final exams and campuses empty for the summer, lawmakers point to a bill codifying a definition of antisemitism into state law. The House gave final approval last week.\n\nThe state's only Jewish legislator believes the bill heading to Gov. Henry McMaster's desk could be used by South Carolina's public universities in deciding how to respond should troubling instances or conduct violations arise with staff or students in the future.\n\nThe bill sponsored by Rep. Beth Bernstein, D-Columbia, would use the same definition of antisemitism adopted by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance and the U.S. State Department.\n\nStudent-led, pro-Palestinian protests have spread nationwide in response to Israel's military offensive in Gaza. War erupted between Israel and Palestine after Hamas militants launched an attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 civilians and taking some 250 hostages. Israel has since killed more than 34,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, according to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry.\n\nBernstein said she was disturbed by chants of \"go back to Poland\" reported at Columbia University in New York. (Poland's Jewish community was largely wiped out by Nazi Germany in the Holocaust.) And at Northwestern University in Illinois, where Jewish students are suing the school over its handling of protests, a student was called a \"dirty Jew\" and protest signs depicted a Star of David crossed through and the school's president, who is Jewish, as a \"bloodthirsty devil.\"\n\nBernstein, who is 54, said she has never seen this amount of hate directed at Jews in her lifetime.\n\nFor the Columbia lawmaker, it's personal. With two daughters of her own, one of whom is a student at Tulane University in Louisiana -- where there's been extensive protests -- she's afraid for their safety and that of other young Jewish students.\n\nShe said she worries about continuous harassment of those students by protesters as they walk to class.\n\n\"They're being ostracized,\" Bernstein said. \"Jews are being attacked just because they're Jewish.\n\nWhile supporters of Israel have called out the university protests as antisemitic, protest organizers say the antisemitic remarks of some do not reflect the views of the whole, which condemns the humanitarian crisis the conflict has led to in Gaza. Critics say those allegations are being used to silence the student movement.\n\nProtests in SC\n\nOut of South Carolina's largest college campuses, only one -- the University of South Carolina -- has reported minor protest activity.\n\nAfter the Oct. 7 attack, a revived USC chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine distributed posters and leaflets on campus. And supporters of Palestine stood silently with protest signs at a vigil for Columbia's Jewish community, held at the Anne Frank Center on campus. Blocks away at the Statehouse, protesters at a \"free Palestine\" rally organized by the Party for Socialism and Liberation chanted and held signs, while a small group of pro-Israel counter-protesters gathered across the street.\n\nBernstein, who attended the vigil, said the pro-Palestine protesters were \"maybe a tad bit disruptive, but not violent.\"\n\nMost recently, a late-afternoon demonstration was held between the university's main library and student center on the last day of classes, which coincided with the first day of Jewish Passover. Unlike elsewhere in the country, the students left at dusk, The Post and Courier reported.\n\nThen, at the university's \"midnight breakfast\" event signaling the start of exams, about a dozen protesters carrying Palestinian flags and chanting stood for about 30 minutes at the entrance of the dining area of the school's student center as students and staff passed through to the event, according to a police report from university police. They stayed after staff asked them to leave. The police report did not mention any threats or physical acts of violence.\n\nWhen the group did move, police followed them outside and the students ran away in different directions. Police saw two of the students walking on Sumter Street and arrested them for breach of peace, a misdemeanor.\n\nPolice crackdown\n\nAcross the country, by comparison, police have reported more than 2,000 arrests.\n\nTent encampments of protesters have spread across the country, mirroring one that formed at Columbia University in New York nearly two weeks ago. As the movement has drug on, universities are cracking down, calling in police.\n\nAt Columbia, police cleared the tent encampment on the school's grounds and an academic building overtaken by protesters at the Ivy League school about 20 hours earlier. The protest movement at the school also made national headlines last week after one of the organizers posted a video online encouraging violence on Jews.\n\n\"Zionists don't deserve to live,\" the student, Khymani James, said in video taken in January. \"I feel very comfortable - very comfortable - calling for those people to die.\"\n\nOpposing groups of protesters at the University of California, Los Angeles, broke out in fistfights, with students from both groups kicking and beating each other with sticks. And at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, police in riot gear shut down an encampment, arresting about 20 people for trespassing.\n\nMeanwhile, antisemitism and Islamophobia in the United States has surged to record levels since the Oct. 7 Hamas' attack, according to the Anti-Defamation League and Council on American-Islamic Relations.\n\nIn its most recent report, the Anti-Defamation League said there were 85 incidents -- 78 cases of harassment and seven acts of vandalism -- of antisemitism in South Carolina in 2023, nearly double the number reported the year before and more than five times the number reported in 2021.\n\nFormer state Sen. Joel Lourie, who is Jewish and now sits on the board of the regional Anti-Defamation League, said he suspects antisemitic sentiments have percolated under the surface for some time.\n\n\"But what we're seeing now is much more pronounced,\" he said. \"Things have escalated beyond my wildest imagination.\"\n\nLourie said it's one thing to exercise free speech. It's another when demonstrations block students from going to class or studying in the library. Recent reports of students being targeted, threatened or beaten \"crossed an extremely dangerous line.\"\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations received 8,061 complaints of anti-Muslim bias incidents last year - the highest number in the 28 years the organization has tracked cases. The report does not say whether any of those complaints originated in South Carolina.\n\nApplying the definition\n\nBernstein acknowledged that if her bill becomes state law, applications of what's antisemitic would be limited to policies and regulations at state agencies, which include public universities.\n\n\"But in light of what we're seeing on college campuses across the country, it could be used to help universities navigate any incidents if it starts to happen here in South Carolina,\" she said.\n\nThe bill defines antisemitism as \"a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.\"\n\nThe organization also provides modern examples of antisemitism:\n\nBut critics have said some of the definition's examples are overly broad, veering into complicated world politics:\n\nThe definition does specify that criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country is not antisemitic.\n\nLawmakers in more than a half-dozen states pushed laws adopting the definition. Georgia's governor signed it into law in January. South Dakota did the same in March. Virginia passed it last year, and Iowa passed it in 2022.\n\nAnd the U.S. House voted Wednesday to add the same definition to law that bars discrimination and harassment based on race, color or national origin at institutions that receive federal funding. This could give U.S. education regulators the ability to withhold funding from schools that allow protests to linger. The measure now heads to the Senate.\n\nThe ACLU, in an open letter, asked Congress to reject the effort, saying federal law already prohibits antisemitic discrimination and the move could instead chill free speech by \"equating criticism of the Israeli government with antisemitism.\"\n\nBernstein said it's important not to infringe on free speech in making such laws.\n\n\"You can disagree with Israel's policies,\" she said.\n\nBut while racial slurs are often more overt, Bernstein said antisemitism can be harder to determine, making a set definition important.\n\nHateful speech is not illegal under the First Amendment but comments that are deemed \"true threats\" are not protected as free speech. A true threat is a statement that frightens or intimidates people into believing they will be seriously harmed, according to the Free Speech Center in Tennessee.\n\nWhere things become problematic, Bernstein said, is when people lay blame to Jews as a whole, whether they're from Israel or Jewish-American, and threaten violence against them.\n\nSouth Carolina's ACLU chapter also chimed in Wednesday, reminding university leaders of the state's own, at times troublesome, history with campus protests. Demonstrations have included Civil Rights marches, calls for desegregation and opposition to the Vietnam War.\n\n\"Students have raised their voices throughout our shared history, and administrators, government officials, and law enforcement have not always responded in ways that protected their safety and their constitutionally guaranteed rights,\" the group wrote.\n\nThe group urged restraint regarding the use of law enforcement, saying they're far more likely to escalate things and pointing to past tragedies such as the 1968 Orangeburg Massacre.\n\nIn that incident 56 years ago, an attempt by students at two historically Black colleges, South Carolina State University and Claflin University, to desegregate a whites-only bowling alley turned violent after police showed up and beat protesters. Then-Gov. Robert McNair sent in the state police and National Guard, who shot into a crowd of 200 students, killing three and wounding at least 27.", "source": {"uri": "yourislandnews.com", "dataType": "news",

These anti-American activities are not the peaceful protests on college campuses of the past. They are federally funded demonstrations of support for terrorism. and the Biden administration is encouraging them.\n\nEven more concerning, campus administrators have effectively sanctioned this anti-democratic behavior and implemented policies that harm Jewish students, faculty, and community members rather than addressing the real problem: the dehumanization of and threats against a subset of the community.\n\nColumbia University is among the worst offenders in academia right now. Antisemitic protests were allowed to take root, and the result? A full blown occupation of Hamilton Hall, an immovable encampment, and assaults on Jewish students. Campus life and academic freedom have been irreversibly damaged by the incompetence of Columbia's and similar administrations and their refusal to take a principled stand against the threat of antisemitism.\n\nUniversity elites already have a history of repressing unfashionable thought, particularly when it comes to tolerance of conservatives. Now, they are blatantly allowing the repression of Jewish students and lifting up those who harbor anti-American sentiments.\n\nAmerican college campuses should be places of free thought and an open exchange of ideas. This also means students should be able to exercise their opinions and protest peacefully. That is not what is happening at Columbia and other universities right now.\n\nThe threatened minority is being persecuted, attacked, and viciously prevented from participating fully in an education to which they have an equal claim and for which they paid a hefty sum. It is fundamentally un-American and antithetical to freedom for an institution of higher learning to enable this dangerous, intolerant behavior.\n\nSetting aside the obvious moral issues for a moment, there is an economic question at hand: Who is funding these universities that are allowing, and even propagating, antisemitism?\n\nThe American taxpayer is. And I don't just mean with student loans.\n\nColumbia's own website boasts: \"Federal agencies provide about $800 million annually to fund research across every school and campus at the university and a total of $1.1B including direct support of education and contributions to help sustain the underlying research infrastructure.\"\n\nSo far this fiscal year, Columbia University has already pocketed $72 million in new spending. This begs the question of whether the Biden administration is doling out an even bigger share of Columbia's budget.\n\nExamining ongoing federal research dollars reveals just how much the federal taxpayer funds Columbia's projects - what their executive vice president of research calls \"the cornerstone\" of the university.\n\nThe university has 1,441 active projects funded through the National Institutes of Health, totaling $844,885,249 according to NIH reporting. The National Science Foundation is another major contributor to the university's research; Columbia has 487 active NSF grants, totaling $513,369,807.\n\nThat means American taxpayers are already giving Columbia University nearly $1.4 billion for current research projects through the NIH and NSF. That's $1.4 billion from the American people at the same time that Columbia's administration actively refuses to uphold basic American principles.\n\nMoney is fungible, but even if it wasn't, this particular money is not simply designated for research projects. Much of it goes directly toward subsidizing university administrators' priorities.\n\nThis includes massive amounts of funding for \"overhead,\" a nebulous allowance for each research grant that can be used for unknown administrative uses, as pointed out by the Heritage Foundation's Jay Greene. Greene found that Columbia spends 64.5% of its research funding on \"overhead\" costs. This is effectively a slush fund that the administration could be using for anything, including support for the radicals who have taken over the campus.\n\nThe most obvious example of this is federal research funding being siphoned off for \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" (DEI) initiatives, hires, and offices. There is little transparency or oversight of these funds, but they are very likely propping up liberal academia's DEI infrastructure and amplifying faculty like the over 100 professors who sided with the encampment participants as supposed victims and called for an \"immediate apology and amnesty\" for antisemitic students. Apparently it is the pro-Hamas faction that believes they are being discriminated against here. What about the apology for the Jewish students scared to walk on their own campus? And who will be the next target of this woke mob takeover?\n\nWhile antisemitism runs rampant on the Columbia lawn, the university's trustees are raking in cash by the billions. Approximately six million Jewish American adults contributed to those tax dollars.\n\nPerhaps Columbia could find a way to let enrolled Jewish students at least get to those expensive research labs safely.\n\nIf not, perhaps Congress should revoke Columbia University's ability to pocket Americans' hard-earned dollars for research projects like its $95,388 study on \"weight discrimination\" experienced by transgender children.\n\nAt its core, federal spending should reflect the federal government's priorities. It is time to stop prioritizing the woke ideologies of elite academic institutions. It is time to reprioritize and speak out for American values.", "source": {"uri": "realclearpolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Real Clear Politics"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Americanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Americanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academic freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_resistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolent resistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehumanization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dehumanization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Science Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institutes_of_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Institutes of Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity,_equity,_and_inclusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diversity, equity, and inclusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freethought", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freethought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Student loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radical politics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Research", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Research", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Organizations/Research_Funding", "label": "dmoz/Science/Organizations/Research Funding", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Research_Funding", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Research Funding", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Research_Groups_and_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Science/Research Groups and Centers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://assets.realclear.com/images/64/649474_5_.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546389", "eventUri": "eng-9546389", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

We will not stop standing up for ourselves. We are proud to be Jews, and we are proud to be Zionists.\" The Jewish students added that they hope the community will join them in an effort to \"repair our campus.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sit-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sit-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jewish identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pejorative", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pejorative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-determination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://dw-wp-production.imgix.net/2024/05/GettyImages-2011170800-scaled-e1715198106712.jpg?w=1200&h=800&ixlib=react-9.3.0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546389", "eventUri": "eng-9546389", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Don't fall for that claim. It's a scam. These protesters don't represent most students or the American public.\n\nYet Monday, Columbia University canceled graduation ceremonies, kowtowing to the radical fringe, with whom they largely agree. Students and their families be damned.\n\nHere are the facts: A miniscule 2% of people ages 18 to 29 polled by Harvard's Kennedy School named the Israel-Hamas conflict as their top political concern, compared with double digits who were concerned about the economy. Students couldn't care less about this issue.\n\nClaims that today's campus riots are reminiscent of 1968, when students closed down campuses to protest the Vietnam War, are nonsense. Back then, Gallup found 46% of respondents in that age group considered the Vietnam War the nation's biggest problem. Not 2%.\n\nRay Kelly, former New York Police commissioner, nailed it Sunday when he said the nationwide turmoil \"looks like a conspiracy. ... We need the federal government's investigative capacity to look at this whole situation.\"\n\nOrganized outside groups are behind much of the campus violence. Hours before the storming of Columbia's Hamilton Hall, an outside organization called The People's Forum -- known for its anti-Israel activities and links to the Chinese Communist Party -- started gearing up for its Hamilton Hall invasion. In a meeting, TPF's leader spewed invectives against Columbia.\n\nHours later, protesters smashed the glass doors of Hamilton Hall, vandalizing and seizing the building. When Minouche Shafik, university president, finally called in police, 13 of the 44 arrested in the building had no affiliation with the university.\n\nReflecting on the incidents at Columbia and other New York campuses, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said after the arrests, \"Individuals unaffiliated with these schools had entered these different campuses and, in some cases, were even training students in unlawful protest tactics.\"\n\nNew York University Board Vice Chairman Bill Berkley says these occupations appear to have been orchestrated by external groups. He wants the FBI to investigate.\n\nAs these groups seize control of our universities, where is the FBI? Director Christopher Wray says the bureau does not directly track college protests but will provide information to campuses if the agency becomes aware of a specific threat.\n\nHuh? The FBI should be proactively identifying and heading off campus terrorists.\n\nWhere is the Department of Justice? Two weeks ago, 27 Republican Senators sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland asking for the DOJ to investigate how students' rights are being violated on campus. Radio silence.\n\nWhere is President Joe Biden? When the President was asked if he would use the National Guard to restore order, he emphatically said, \"No.\"\n\nWhy not? The National Guard were deployed in 1962 to protect the right of Black students to attend the newly integrated University of Mississippi. Students of all races and religions who want to go to class or attend their graduation deserve protection.\n\nThe Biden administration is missing in action. Is it because the same big Dem donors supporting Biden -- the Pritzker family, George Soros, David Rockefeller Jr. -- also support pro-Palestine groups orchestrating campus protests?\n\nMeanwhile, images of campus invaders in headscarves are not winning over Americans. The latest Harvard CAPS-Harris survey shows that 61% of Americans polled want a ceasefire only after Hamas is removed from power and the hostages captured on Oct. 7 are released.\n\nThe public also knows what they are seeing on campuses is not freedom of expression -- a sacred American right -- but lawlessness and dangerous disorder. Universities need to be evenhanded, guaranteeing that all sides get to speak and students can attend class.\n\nColumbia's students were heckled and threatened, had their classes canceled and now are robbed of the grandeur of a university graduation. It's a slap in the face to them, and to their families who sacrificed to make college possible.\n\nColombia's motto is, \"In thy light shall we see light.\" Truth is, darkness has descended on Columbia and most elite college campuses.\n\nAlumni and taxpayers alike should withhold their support until these institutions see the light and prioritize their students.\n\nBetsy McCaughey is a former lieutenant governor of New York and chairman of the Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths.

Yet, for all Jewish students, this marked the point at which an unprecedented rise in campus antisemitism began, continuing to define an entire year of their university careers.\"\n\nIsaacs added:\" Since October 7th antisemitic incidents have increased nearly 6 times, with severity increasing too.

Earlier in the year, before any encampments were established, Isaacs said he spoke to Jewish students across several universities about their experiences.\n\nHe recalled one said that \"There is so much hate and I have to hide my identity and identifiable things about me for my safety. The University did not act properly.\"\n\nAnother told Isaacs: \"Most of the non-Jewish world seems oblivious to the pain we are going through. I feel isolated and alone and terrified for my community.\"\n\nWhile another student said: \"My flat mate broke the news of the war to me and said \"700 Israelis dead yaaaay lets go.\"\n\nIsaacs also turned to best practice for universities and Vice-Chancellors on how to grip this situation for Jewish students, saying communication was key.\n\n\"First, Jewish societies are the legitimate representative voice of Jewish students on each campus and Vice-Chancellors must have effective communications with Jewish student leaders in order to foster trust and good relationships such that Jewish students feel heard,\" he said.\n\n\"More broadly, universities must have the moral clarity in their leadership to communicate singular condemnations of antisemitism to the entire student body when antisemitic incidents occur.\"\n\nHe also said education was key and referred to UJS' antisemitism awareness training as \"core to enabling other students and campus leaders to have the confidence to stand in allyship with Jewish students against antisemitism.\"\n\nIsaacs added that while UJS \"respect the right to protest, it is important to recognise campus relations will only be improved when university leaders are clear with students on red lines. \"\n\nHe added:\"For example, to call to 'globalise the intifada' is not a meaningless political statement. It is a direct call to spread the sort of violence seen in Israel in the late 1990s and early 2000s which saw random acts of terror against civilians at innocuous locations. Universities have to make this red line clear.\"\n\nIsaacs said the vast majority of Jewish students identify as Zionist, and other students must recognise that a Jewish student can be a proud Zionist while also deeply caring about Palestinian human rights.\n\n\"While we respect the right to protest, where there are instances of criminality universities must draw upon their relations with police to ensure students see the consequences of their actions,\" he added.\n\n\"We are also aware that many external non-student nefarious actors are seeking to gain access to campus to cause trouble and harass Jewish students. These individuals must be denied access to campus.\"\n\nIsaacs also said universities must resist attempts by protesters to remove the IHRA definition of antisemitism.\n\n\"It is the definition accepted globally and supported by Jewish students.

One of them explains a lot.", "body": "Columbia University has several ties to Tel Aviv. One of them explains a lot.Zachary SchermeleUpdated May 9, 2024 at 10:19 PM\n\nWhen a group of pro-Palestinian protesters pitched tents on Columbia University's Manhattan campus on April 17, they had one goal: to compel the school to sever financial ties with Israel, including halting an academic program in Tel Aviv. Until the demand was met, they refused to leave.\n\nNearly a month later, it's clear that the ask was too steep. Negotiations between school administrators and student leaders soured. Police arrested hundreds of demonstrators over the next few weeks. Scores of students were suspended. The school became a lightning rod for a youth-led upheaval over the Israel-Hamas war, sparking similar protests on college campuses across the country.\n\nTheir main stipulation was a familiar one in American higher education: that the university stop drawing endowment money from companies affiliated with the Israeli government, particularly those that could stand to gain from the war in Gaza. Multibillion-dollar endowments, especially those at large research universities like Columbia, are complex and secretive. Often managed by hedge funds, they can be connected to thousands of potential revenue sources.\n\nWhat is divestment? Pro-Palestinian protesters are urging universities to divest from Israel. Here's what that means.\n\nAnother demand from the protesters drew less attention.\n\nIn 2019, Columbia launched a dual-degree program with Tel Aviv University. Under the agreement, students could earn two undergraduate degrees by studying in Israel for two years and then returning to the U.S. to finish their schooling at Columbia's School of General Studies in Manhattan. The program admitted about 60 students in 2021. Columbia offers similar programs, enrolling hundreds of students, in partnership with other universities in international hubs, including Dublin and Hong Kong.\n\nWhen protesters urged the school to end its affiliation with Tel Aviv University, Columbia's administrators didn't budge. It was a point of pride and not a matter for consideration, officials said.\n\n\"Columbia University welcomes and embraces the Israeli students, faculty, and staff on our campus and are proud of their accomplishments on behalf of the greater Columbia community,\" Columbia spokesperson Samantha Slater said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"We also benefit greatly from our dual-degree program with Tel Aviv University, a program that the university will continue to wholeheartedly support.\"\n\nThe Columbia situation, explained: Alumni pressure and a crime-fighting mayor helped set the stage for Columbia arrests\n\nColumbia's refusal to end the partnership underscores some of the more nuanced truths about how the divestment movement on college campuses is butting up against larger trends in higher education - including the demand for study abroad programs, a \"financial aid arms race,\" reliance on tuition revenue, and the puzzling ways that money, even at the richest schools, can end up unevenly siloed in ways that reshape students' lives.\n\nUnequal financial aid at Columbia\n\nWhen Charissa Ratliff-D'addario decided to leave Spokane Falls Community College in 2019, she thought she knew what she was getting into. She had always fantasized about moving to New York City. When she was 13, she hung a poster of Columbia's main library on her bedroom wall.\n\nColumbia's School of General Studies, which houses the dual-degree program with Tel Aviv University, is made for people just like her: nontraditional students a few years removed from high school. Administrators rave about how those students enrich classroom dialogues and bring fresh perspectives to younger students. When Ratliff-D'addario was accepted, she was thrilled.\n\nBut the reality of her experience didn't align with her dream. After she enrolled at 22 for her first year, she discovered that an error in the financial aid process deemed her ineligible for the grants she needed. She had to take out private loans to cover tuition. She eventually sold the house she owned in Washington state.\n\nHer challenges are similar to those faced by many students at Columbia's School of General Studies, an undergraduate school that has struggled for years to offer the same generous financial aid other Columbia students get. Though the school's enrollment numbers have increased dramatically in the last decade, General Studies students, many of whom have children and juggle jobs, receive less help covering their costs than some of the students they sit with in class.\n\nContext on Columbia: How the university became the epicenter of disagreement over the Israel-Hamas war\n\n\"It's a very tuition-driven school,\" Ratliff-D'addario said. \"I don't think there's any argument around that.\"\n\nAn undergraduate paying full tuition at Columbia and living on campus can expect to pay roughly $90,000 per year, according to the school's recent estimates. Though that number can diminish greatly when factoring in financial aid, skyrocketing tuition has helped Columbia become one of the richest and most expensive schools in the country.\n\nBut at Columbia, like many universities, every individual school is responsible for footing some major bills. Each is forced to cover a hefty annual tax from the central administration - a fee that is easier for some schools to pay than others. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences, a five-school conglomerate that houses the School of General Studies, has long faced challenges balancing its budget. The rising cost of financial aid is a big reason why.\n\n\"There was always this sense that we didn't have enough money,\" said Nicholas Dirks, who ran the Arts and Sciences arm at Columbia from 2004 to 2013 before going on to become a chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley. It was \"hardscrabble work,\" he said, to get more help for General Studies students.\n\nDual-degree programs ease some disparities\n\nDriven by a broader trend in higher education to increase international opportunities for undergraduate students, Columbia first launched a dual-degree program in 2010 with the French university Sciences Po. When the European school committed to covering students' financial aid for their first few years abroad, administrators welcomed the chance to bridge some of the financial aid disparities typically faced by General Studies students, Dirks said.\n\nAfter launching more partnerships under similar models, Columbia's dual- and joint-degree offerings more than doubled between 2010 and 2019, according to the campus newspaper. Meanwhile, the number of students in the School of General Studies increased by roughly a third, more than any of Columbia's other undergraduate schools, over the last decade.\n\n\"In my mind, it's impossible not to connect the rapid growth of General Studies with the need for revenue,\" said Michael Thaddeus, a mathematics professor at Columbia who uncovered the university's misreporting to a popular college rankings list several years ago.\n\nDirks, who ran the Arts and Sciences division a decade ago, pushed back on the idea that the School of General Studies' enrollment bump has been primarily revenue-driven. But, he acknowledged, \"it does help the bottom line.\"\n\nThough there have been some improvements to financial aid for General Studies students in recent years, the program has still not bridged the gap with Columbia's other undergraduate schools. Ratliff-D'addario, who received her bachelor's degree last year, went on to start \"Equality for GS,\" a student-led movement to increase financial aid for students like her.\n\nHoward Bunsis, an accounting professor at Eastern Michigan University, who was invited by faculty members last year to analyze Columbia's finances independently, said Columbia nixing its dual-degree programs would make no difference financially.\n\n\"Whether these existed or not would not move the needle at all in my estimation,\" he said. \"What bothers me in higher ed finance is places like Columbia crying poverty.\"\n\nZachary Schermele covers education and breaking news for USA TODAY.

It is night. New York City Police, stationed inside and outside the gates of the campus, have placed the campus on lockdown. There are barricades blocking streets. No one, unless they live in a residence hall on campus, is allowed to enter. The siege means that students cannot go to class. Students cannot go to the library. Students cannot enter the labs. Students cannot visit the university health services. Students cannot get to studios to practice. Students cannot attend lectures. Students cannot walk across the campus lawns. The university, as during the Covid pandemic, has retreated into the world of screens where students are isolated in their rooms.\n\nThe university buildings are largely vacant. The campus pathways deserted. Columbia is a Potemkin university, a playground for corporate administrators. The president of the university -- a British-Egyptian baroness who built her career at institutions such as the Bank of England, World Bank and International Monetary Fund -- called in police in riot gear, with guns drawn, to clear the school's encampment, forcibly evict students who occupied a campus hall and beat and arrest over 100 of them. They were arrested for \"criminal trespassing\" on their own campus.\n\nThese administrators demand, like all who manage corporate systems of power, total obedience. Dissent. Freedom of expression. Critical thought. Moral outrage. These have no place in our corporate-indentured universities.\n\nAll systems of totalitarianism, including corporate totalitarianism, deform education into vocational training where students are taught what to think, not how to think. Only the skills and expertise demanded by the corporate state are valued. The withering away of the humanities and transformation of major research universities into corporate and Defense Department vocational schools with their outsized emphasis on science, technology, engineering and math, illustrate this shift. The students who disrupt the Potemkin university, who dare to think for themselves, face beatings, suspension, arrest and expulsion.\n\nThe mandarins who run Columbia and other universities, corporatists who make salaries in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, oversee academic plantations. They treat their poorly paid adjunct faculty, who often lack health insurance and benefits, like serfs. They slavishly serve the interests of wealthy donors and corporations. They are protected by private security. They despise students, forced into onerous debt peonage for their education, who are non-conformists, who defy their fiefdoms and call out their complicity in genocide.\n\nColumbia University, with an endowment of $13.64 billion, charges students nearly $90,000 a year to attend. But students are not allowed to object when their tax and tuition money funds genocide, or when their tuition payments are used to see them, along with faculty supporters, assaulted and sent to jail. They are, as Joe Biden put it, members of \"hate groups.\" They are -- as Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer said of those who occupied Hamilton Hall at Columbia renaming it Hind Hall, in honor of a six-year-old Palestinian girl, Hind Rajab, who was murdered by Israeli forces after spending 12 days trapped in a car with her six dead relatives -- engaged in \"lawlessness\".\n\nDuring the assault by dozens of police on the occupied hall, one student was knocked unconscious, several were beaten and sent to hospital and a shot was fired by a police officer inside the hall. The excess use of force is justified with the lie that there are outside infiltrators and agitators directing the protest. As the protests continue, and they will continue, this use of force will become more draconian.\n\n\"The university is a place of capital accumulation,\" says Sara Wexler, a doctoral student in philosophy, seated with two other students on the fire escape. \"We have billion dollar endowments that are connected to Israel and defense companies. We are being forced to confront the fact that universities aren't democratic. You have a board of trustees and investors that are actually making the decisions. Even if students have votes saying they want divestment and the faculty want divestment, we actually don't have any power because they can call in the NYPD.\"\n\nThere is an iron determination by the ruling institutions, including the media, to shift the narrative away from the genocide in Gaza, to threats against Jewish students and antisemitism. The anger the protesters feel for journalists, especially at news organizations such as CNN and The New York Times, is intense and justified.\n\n\"I'm a German-Polish Jew,\" says Wexler. \"My last name is Wexler. It's Yiddish for money-maker, money-exchanger. No matter how many times I tell people I'm Jewish, I'm still labeled antisemitic. It's infuriating. We are told that we need a state that is based on ethnicity in the 21st century and that's the only way Jewish people can be safe. But it is really for Britain and America and other imperialist states to have a presence in the Middle East. I've no idea why people still believe this narrative. It makes no sense to have a place for Jewish people that requires other people to suffer and die.\"\n\nI have seen this assault on universities and freedom of expression before. I saw it in Augusto Pinochet's Chile, the military dictatorship in El Salvador, Guatemala under Rios Montt, and during my coverage of the military regimes in Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, Syria, Iraq and Algeria.\n\nColumbia University, with its locked gates, lines of police cruisers, rows of metal barricades three and four deep, swarms of uniformed police and private security, looks no different. It looks no different because it is no different.\n\nWelcome to our corporate dictatorship.\n\nThe cacophony of the streets of New York City punctuates our conversation. These students know what they are risking. They know what they are up against.\n\nStudent activists waited months before setting up encampments. They tried repeatedly to have their voices heard and their concerns addressed. But they were rebuffed, ignored and harassed. In November, the students presented a petition to the university calling for divestment from Israeli corporations that facilitate the genocide. No one bothered to respond.\n\nThe protesters endure constant abuse. On April 25, during Columbia's senior boat cruise, Muslim students and those identified as supporting the protests had alcohol poured on their heads and clothes by jeering Zionists. In January, former Israeli soldiers studying at Columbia used skunk spray to assault students on the steps of Lowe Library. The university, under heavy pressure once the attackers were identified, said they had banned the former soldiers from campus, but other students reported seeing one of the men on campus recently. When Jewish students in the encampment attempted to prepare their meals in the kosher kitchen at the Jewish Theological Seminary, they were insulted by Zionists who were in the building. Zionist counter demonstrators have been joined on campus by the founder of the white supremist Proud Boys organization. Students have had their personal information posted on the Canary Mission and found their faces on the sides of trucks circling the campus, denouncing them as antisemites.\n\nThese attacks are replicated at other universities, including UCLA, where masked Zionists released rats and tossed fireworks into the encampment and broadcast the sound of crying children - something the Israeli army does to lure Palestinians in Gaza out of hiding to kill them. The Zionist mob, armed with pepper and bear spray, violently attacked the protesters, as police and campus security watched passively and refused to make arrests.\n\n\"At the General Studies gala, which is one of the undergraduate schools that has a large population of former IDF soldiers, at least eight students wearing keffiyehs were physically and verbally harassed by students identified as ex-IDF and Israelis,\" Cameron Jones, a sophomore majoring in urban studies and who is Jewish, tells me. \"Students were called 'bitch' and 'whore' in Hebrew. Some were called terrorists and told to go back to Gaza. Many of the students harassed were Arabs, some having their keffiyehs ripped off and thrown to the ground. Several students in keffiyehs were grabbed and pushed. A Jewish student wearing a keffiyeh was cursed at in Hebrew and later punched in the face. Another student was kicked. The event ended after dozens of students sang the Israeli national anthem, some of them flipping off students wearing keffiyehs. I have been followed around campus by individuals and been cursed and had obscenities yelled at me.\"\n\nThe university has refused to reprimand those who disrupted the gala, even though the individuals who carried out the assaults have been identified.\n\nUniversities have hired people such as Cas Halloway, currently the chief operating officer at Columbia, who was the deputy mayor for operations under Michael Bloomberg. Holloway reportedly oversaw the police clearance of the Occupy encampment at Zuccotti Park. This is the kind of expertise universities covet.\n\nAt Columbia, student organizers, following the mass arrests and evictions from their encampment and Hind Hall, called for university-wide strikes by faculty, staff and students. Columbia has canceled its university wide commencement.\n\nI am on the campus of Princeton University. It is after evening prayers and 17 students who have mounted a hunger strike sit together, many wrapped in blankets.\n\nAs universities escalate their crackdowns, the protesters escalate their response. Students at Princeton held rallies and walk-outs throughout October and November, which culminated in a protest at the Council of the Princeton University Community, made up of administrators, students, staff, deans and the president. They were met at each protest with a wall of silence.\n\nPrinceton students decided, following the example at Columbia, to set up a tent encampment on April 25 and issued a set of demands calling on the university to \"divest and disassociate from Israel.\" But when they arrived early in the morning at their staging areas, as well as the site in front of Firestone Library which they hoped to use for an encampment, they were met with dozens of campus police and Princeton town police who had been tipped off. The students hastily occupied another location on campus, McCosh Courtyard. Two students were immediately arrested, evicted from their student housing and banned from campus. The police forced the remaining students to take down their tents.\n\nProtesters at the encampment have been sleeping in the open, including when it rains.\n\nIn an irony not lost on the students, dotted around Princeton's campus are massive tents set up for reunion weekend where alumni down copious amounts of alcohol and dress up in garish outfits with the school colors of orange and black. The protesters are barred from entering them.\n\nThirteen students at Princeton occupied Clio Hall on April 29. They, like their counterparts at Columbia, were arrested and are now barred from campus. Some 200 students surrounded Clio Hall in solidarity as the occupying students were led away by police. As they were being processed by the police, the arrested students sang the Black spiritual Roll Jordan Roll, altering the words to \"Well some say John was a baptist, some say John was a Palestinian, But I say John was a preacher of God and my bible says so too.\"\n\nThe hunger strikers, who began their liquid-only diet on May 3, issued this statement:\n\nThe Princeton Gaza Solidarity Encampment announces the initiation of a hunger strike in solidarity with the millions of Palestinians in Gaza suffering under the ongoing siege by the state of Israel. The Israeli occupation has deliberately blocked access to basic necessities to engineer a dire famine for the two million residents of Gaza. Since the announcement on October 9 by the Israeli Defense Minister prohibiting the entry of food, fuel and electricity into the Gaza Strip, Israel has systematically obstructed and limited access to vital aid for Palestinians in Gaza, even intentionally destroying existing cropland. On March 18, the U.N. Secretary General declared that \"This is the highest number of people facing catastrophic hunger ever recorded by the integrated food security classification system.\" To make bread, Gazans have been forced to use animal feed as flour. To break their fasts in Ramadan, Gazans have been forced to prepare meals of grass. 97% of Gaza's water has been deemed undrinkable since October 2021 and they have been forced to drink dirty salt water to survive. The consequences of this unprecedented famine created and maintained by Israel will devastate Gaza's children for generations to come and cannot be tolerated any longer. We have begun our hunger strike to stand in solidarity with the people of Gaza. We are drawing from the tradition of Palestinian political prisoners going on salt-water-only hunger strikes in Israeli prisons since 1968. Our hunger strike is a response to the administration's refusal to engage with our demands for disassociation and divestment from Israel. We refuse to be silenced by the university administration's intimidation and repression tactics. We struggle together in solidarity with the people of Palestine. We commit our bodies to their liberation. Participants in the hunger strikes will abstain from all food or drink except water until the following demands are met:\n\n* Meet with students to discuss demands for disclosure, divestment and a full academic and cultural boycott of Israel.\n\n* Grant complete amnesty from all criminal and disciplinary charges for participants of the peaceful sit-in.\n\n* Reverse all campus bans and evictions of students.\n\nThe university and the world must recognize that we refuse to be complicit in genocide and will take every necessary action to change this reality. Our hunger strike, though small in comparison to the enduring suffering of the Palestinian people, symbolizes our unwavering commitment to justice and solidarity.\n\nUniversity President Christopher Eisgruber met with the hunger strikers - the first meeting by school administrators with protesters since Oct. 7 - but dismissed their demands.\n\n\"This is probably the most important thing I've done here,\" says Areeq Hasan, a senior who is going to do a PhD in applied physics next year at Stanford, who is also part of the hunger strike. \"If we're on a scale of one to 10, this is a 10. Since the start of encampment, I have tried to become a better person. We have pillars of faith. One of them is sunnah, which is prayer. That's a place where you train yourself to become a better person. It is linked to spirituality. That's something I've been emphasizing more during my time at Princeton. There's another aspect of faith. Zakat. It means charity, but you can read it more generally as justice...economic justice and social justice. I'm training myself, but to what end? This encampment is not just about trying to cultivate, to purify my heart to try to become a better person, but about trying to stand for justice and actively use these skills that I'm learning to command what I feel to be right and to forbid what I believe to be wrong, to stand up for oppressed people around the world.\"\n\nAnha Khan, a Princeton student on hunger strike whose family is from Bangladesh, sits with her knees tucked up in front of her. She is wearing blue sweatpants that say Looney Tunes and has an engagement ring that every so often glints in the light. She sees in Bangladesh's history of colonialism, dispossession and genocide, the experience of Palestinians.\n\n\"So much was taken from my people,\" she says. \"We haven't had the time or the resources to recuperate from the terrible times we've gone through. Not only did my people go through a genocide in 1971, but we were also victims of the partition that happened in 1947 and then civil disputes between West and East Pakistan throughout the forties, the fifties and the sixties. It makes me angry. If we weren't colonized by the British throughout the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth century, and if we weren't occupied, we would have had time to develop and create a more prosperous society. Now we're staggering because so much was taken from us. It's not fair.\"\n\nThe hostility of the university has radicalized the students, who see university administrators attempting to placate external pressures from wealthy donors, the weapons manufacturers and the Israel lobby, rather than deal with the internal realities of the non-violent protests and the genocide.\n\n\"The administration doesn't care about the well being, health or safety of their students,\" Khan tells me. \"We have tried to get at least tents out at night. Since we are on a 24-hour liquid fast, not eating anything, our bodies are working overtime to stay resilient. Our immune systems are not as strong. Yet the university tells us we can't pitch up tents to keep ourselves safe at night from the cold and the winds. It's abhorrent for me. I feel a lot more physical weakness. My headaches are worse. There is an inability to even climb up stairs now. It made me realize that for the past seven months what Gazans have been facing is a million times worse. You can't understand their plight unless you experience that kind of starvation that they're experiencing, although I'm not experiencing the atrocities they're experiencing.\"\n\nThe hunger strikers, while getting a lot of support on social media, have also been the targets of death threats and hateful messages from conservative influencers. \"I give them 10 hours before they call DoorDash,\" someone posted on X. \"Why won't they give up water, don't they care about Palestine? Come on, give up water!\" another post read. \"Can they hold their breath too? Asking for a friend,\" another read. \"OK so I hear there's going to be a bunch of barbecues at Princeton this weekend, let's bring out a bunch of pork products too to show these Muslims!\" someone posted.\n\nOn campus the tiny groups of counter protesters, many from the ultra orthodox Chabad House, jeer at the protesters, shouting \"Jihadists!\" or \"I like your terrorist headscarf!\"\n\n\"It is horrifying to see thousands upon thousands of people wish for our deaths and hope that we starve and die,\" Khan says softly. \"In the press release video, I wore a mask. One of the funnier comments I got was, 'Wow, I bet that chick on the right has buck-teeth behind that mask.' It's ridiculous. Another read, 'I bet that chick on the right used her Dyson Supersonic before coming to the press release.' The Dyson Supersonic is a really expensive hair dryer. Honestly, the only thing I got from that was that my hair looked good, so thank you!\"\n\nDavid Chmielewski, a senior whose parents are Polish and who had family interned in the Nazi death camps, is a Muslim convert. His visits to the concentration camps in Poland, including Auschwitz, made him acutely aware of the capacity for human evil. He sees this evil in the genocide in Gaza. He sees the same indifference and support that characterized Nazi Germany. \"Never again,\" he says, means never again for everyone.\n\n\"Since the genocide, the university has failed to reach out to Arab students, to Muslim students and to Palestinian students to offer support,\" he tells me. \"The university claims it is committed to diversity, equity and inclusion, but we don't feel we belong here.\"\n\n\"We're told in our Islamic tradition by our prophets that when one part of the ummah, the nation of believers, feels pain, then we all feel pain,\" he says. \"That has to be an important motivation for us. But the second part is that Islam gives us an obligation to strive for justice regardless of who we're striving on behalf of. There are plenty of Palestinians who aren't Muslim, but we're fighting for the liberation of all Palestinians. Muslims stand up for issues that aren't specifically Muslim issues. There were Muslims who were involved in the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. There were Muslims involved in the civil rights movement. We draw inspiration from them.\"\n\n\"This is a beautiful interfaith struggle,\" he says. \"Yesterday, we set up a tarp where we were praying. We had people doing group Quran recitations. On the same tarp, Jewish students had their Shabbat service. On Sunday, we had Christian services at the encampment. We are trying to give a vision of the world that we want to build, a world after apartheid. We're not just responding to Israeli apartheid, we're trying to build our own vision of what a society would look like. That's what you see when you have people doing Quran recitations or reading Shabbat services on the same tarp, that's the kind of world we want to build.\"\n\n\"We've been portrayed as causing people to feel unsafe,\" he says. \"We've been perceived as presenting a threat. Part of the motivation for the hunger strike is making clear that we're not the people making anyone unsafe. The university is making us unsafe. They're unwilling to meet with us and we're willing to starve ourselves. Who's causing the un-safety? There is a hypocrisy about how we're being portrayed. We're being portrayed as violent when it's the universities who are calling police on peaceful protesters. We're being portrayed as disrupting everything around us, but what we're drawing on are traditions fundamental to American political culture. We're drawing on traditions of sit-ins, hunger strikes and peaceful encampments. Palestinian political prisoners have carried out hunger strikes for decades. The hunger strike goes back to de-colonial struggles before that, to India, to Ireland, to the struggle against apartheid in South Africa.\"\n\n\"Palestinian liberation is the cause of human liberation,\" he goes on. \"Palestine is the most obvious example in the world today, other than the United States, of settler-colonialism. The struggle against Zionist occupation is viewed accurately by Zionists both within the United States and Israel, as sort of the last dying gasp of imperialism. They're trying to hold onto it. That's why it's scary. The liberation of Palestine would mean a radically different world, a world that moves past exploitation and injustice. That's why so many people who aren't Palestinian and aren't Arab and aren't Muslim are so invested in this struggle. They see its significance.\"\n\n\"In quantum mechanics there's the idea of non-locality,\" says Hasan. \"Even though I'm miles and miles away from the people in Palestine, I feel deeply entangled with them in the same way that the electrons that I work with in my lab are entangled. As David said, this idea that the community of believers is one body and if one part of the body is in pain, all of it pains, it is our responsibility to strive to alleviate that pain. If we take a step back and look at this composite system, it's evolving in perfect unitary, even though we don't understand it because we only have access to one small piece of it. There is deep underlying justice that maybe we don't recognize, but that exists when we look at the plight of the Palestinian people.\"\n\nThere's a tradition associated with the prophet,\" he says. \"When you've seen an injustice occur you should try to change it with your hands. If you can't change it with your hands then you should try to adjust it with your tongue. You should speak out about it. If you can't do that, you should at least feel the injustice in your heart. This hunger strike, this encampment, everything we're doing here as students, is my way of trying to realize that, trying to implement that in my life.\"\n\nSpend time with the students in the protests and you hear stories of revelations, epiphanies. In the lexicon of Christianity, these are called moments of grace. These experiences, these moments of grace, are the unseen engine of the protest movements.\n\nWhen Oscar Lloyd, a junior at Columbia studying cognitive science and philosophy, was about eight-years-old, he and his family visited the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota.\n\n\"I saw the vast distinction between the huge memorial at the Battle of the Little Bighorn compared to the small wooden sign at the massacre at Wounded Knee,\" he says, comparing the numerous monuments celebrating the 1876 defeat of the U.S. 7th Cavalry at the Little Big Horn to the massacre of 250 to 300 Native Americans, half of whom were women and children, in 1890 at Wounded Knee. \"I was shocked that there can be two sides to history, that one side can be told and the other can be completely forgotten. This is the story of Palestine.\"\n\nSara Ryave, a graduate student at Princeton, spent a year in Israel studying at the Pardes Institute of Jewish Studies, a non-denominational yeshiva. She came face to face with apartheid. She is banned from campus after occupying Clio Hall.\n\n\"It was during that year that I saw things that I will never forget,\" she said. \"I spent time in the West Bank and with communities in the south Hebron Hills. I saw the daily realities of apartheid. If you don't look for them, you don't notice them. But once you do, if you want to, it's clear. That predisposed me to this. I saw people living under police and IDF military threats every single day, whose lives are made unbearable by settlers.\"\n\nWhen Hasan was in fourth grade, he remembers his mother weeping uncontrollably on the 27 night during Ramadan, an especially holy day known as The Night of Power. On this night, prayers are traditionally answered.\n\n\"I have a very vivid memory of standing in prayer at night next to my mother,\" he says. \"My mother was weeping. I'd never seen her cry so much in my life. I remember that so vividly. I asked her why she was crying. She told me that she was crying because of all of the people that were suffering around the world. And among them, I can imagine she was bringing to heart the people in Palestine. At that point in my life, I didn't understand systems of oppression. But what I did understand was that I'd never seen my mother in such pain before. I didn't want her to be in that kind of pain. My sister and I, seeing our mother in so much pain, started crying too. The emotions were so strong that night. I don't think I've ever cried like that in my life. That was the first time I had a consciousness of suffering in the world, specifically systems of oppression, though I didn't really understand the various dimensions of it until much later on. That's when my heart established a connection to the plight of the Palestinian people.\"\n\nHelen Wainaina, a doctoral student in English who occupied Clio Hall at Princeton and is barred from campus, was born in South Africa. She lived in Tanzania until she was 10-years-old and then moved with her family to Houston.\n\n\"I think of my parents and their journeys in Africa and eventually leaving the African continent,\" she says. \"I'm conflicted that they ended up in the U.S. If things had turned out differently during the post-colonial movements, they would not have moved. We would have been able to live, grow up and study where we were. I've always felt that that was a profound injustice. I'm grateful that my parents did everything they could to get us here, but I remember when I got my citizenship, I was very angry. I had no say. I wish the world was oriented differently, that we didn't need to come here, that the post-colonial dreams of people who worked on those movements actually materialized.\"\n\nThe protest movements - which have spread around the globe - are not built around the single issue of the apartheid state in Israel or its genocide against Palestinians. They are built around the awareness that the old world order, the one of settler colonialism, western imperialism and militarism used by the countries in the Global North to dominate the Global South, must end. They decry the hoarding of natural resources and wealth by industrial nations in a world of diminishing returns. These protests are built around a vision of a world of equality, dignity and independence. This vision, and the commitment to it, will make this movement not only hard to defeat, but presages a wider struggle beyond the genocide in Gaza.\n\nThe genocide has awakened a sleeping giant. Let us pray the giant prevails.\n\nNOTE TO SCHEERPOST READERS FROM CHRIS HEDGES: There is now no way left for me to continue to write a weekly column for ScheerPost and produce my weekly television show without your help.

Where do they stand? | Blaze Media", "body": "Do the companies want to keep sponsoring employees' pursuit of MBAs at Columbia Business School when Jewish students have been harassed at Columbia?\n\nNew York City's Columbia University arguably has been ground zero for pro-Palestinian protests in the United States in recent weeks, as demonstrators captured headlines for their outrage and resistance against authority figures while influencing students on other campuses to follow suit.\n\nClaiming the state of Israel has been committing \"genocide\" against Gaza in the months since terror group Hamas -- which controls Gaza -- carried out the deadly Oct. 7 surprise attack against Israel, pro-Palestinian protesters want Columbia University to divest from Israel, among other demands.\n\n\"The encampment has been the center of round-the-clock harassment of Jewish students, who have been punched, shoved, spat upon, blocked from attending classes and moving freely about campus.\"\n\nTo make their point, Columbia students broke out their tents and erected illegal encampments on the Manhattan campus and even took over Hamilton Hall -- just like anti-Vietnam War protesters did in 1968.\n\nBut along the way, a big problem has arisen at Columbia: reports of anti-Semitism. Jewish students getting harassed and intimidated -- and worse.\n\nWhile Columbia University President Minouche Shafik has disputed claims that she's allowed anti-Semitism to grow on campus, the Associated Press reported that some Jewish students insist anti-Semitism goes unchecked there, noting one was beaten while putting up posters of Israeli hostages -- not to mention the continuous chants of \"there is only one solution\" and \"from the river to the sea,\" which call for the destruction of Israel.\n\nNewsNation said an anonymous student is suing Columbia, saying some pro-Palestinian protesters are \"continuing to commit acts of violence, they are intimidating and harassing Jewish students and faculty members, they are inciting demonstrators to engage in hate speech and also commit acts of violence, which has been taking place, and they have even called for terrorist attacks against the United States and the State of Israel.\"\n\nNewsNation's Leland Vittert read more of what's in the lawsuit: \"The encampment has been the center of round-the-clock harassment of Jewish students, who have been punched, shoved, spat upon, blocked from attending classes and moving freely about campus.\"\n\nBlaze News spoke to first-year Columbia student Parker De Dek\u00e9r, who said just days before Passover week he was on his way to a gathering at the Chabad house when someone hollered at him, \"You f***ing Jew!\"\n\n\"The only way they could identify me as Jewish was my yarmulke,\" De Dek\u00e9r recounted to Blaze News, noting that a friend soon advised him to cease wearing it as doing so was \"not safe.\"\n\nDe Dek\u00e9r told Blaze News, \"I took off my yarmulke and put it in my pocket.\" When he arrived at the gathering, he said he put it back on -- but then removed it again when he left the Chabad house.\n\nThe experience of feeling \"powerless\" was \"emotionally upsetting,\" De Dek\u00e9r recalled -- and he said he shed tears that night.\n\nBlaze News has taken a look at the executive masters of business administration program at Columbia Business School for working professionals.\n\nOne of the program's requirements is that the companies who employ the eMBA candidates must \"sponsor\" them. Not necessarily financially -- although Columbia Business School notes that the \"total cost of the Executive MBA Program for May 2023 and August 2023 entry is $239,880.\"\n\nCertainly not a dollar amount most individuals can easily shell out on their own.\n\nColumbia Business School says \"more than 800 organizations -- across industries, in countries around the world -- have sponsored one or more students\" for the eMBA program.\n\nBlaze News went through the list and picked out 25 readily recognizable companies and reached out to them with a question: Do they want to continue sponsoring employees through this program when Jewish students have been harassed, intimidated, and victimized by anti-Semitism on Columbia's campus?\n\nThe companies we questioned are:\n\nCitiGroup Inc. told Blaze News it \"will decline comment at this time.\" Philip Morris USA referred Blaze News' question to Altria, its parent company -- and Altria did not immediately respond to Blaze News' request for comment.\n\nNone of the remaining companies immediately responded to Blaze News' request for comment, either.\n\nColumbia University didn't immediately respond to Blaze News' request for comment.\n\nJay Edelson, one of the attorneys representing the student in the aforementioned lawsuit against Columbia University, noted that \"there are straight-out calls for the genocide of Jews. This has happened because of complacency and appeasement by our academic institutions. This isn't the 1930s. We're not in Germany.

One of them explains a lot.", "body": "College campuses across the country are bringing in police as pro-Palestine protesters remain at encampments.\n\nWhen a group of pro-Palestinian protestors pitched tents on Columbia University's Manhattan campus on April 17, they had one goal: to compel the school to sever financial ties with Israel, including halting an academic program in Tel Aviv. Until the demand was met, they refused to leave.\n\nNearly a month later, it's clear that ask was too steep. Negotiations between school administrators and student leaders soured. Police arrested hundreds of demonstrators over the next few weeks. Scores of students were suspended. The school became a lightning rod for a youth-led upheaval over the Israel-Hamas war, sparking similar protests on college campuses across the country.\n\nTheir main stipulation was a familiar one in American higher education: that the university stop drawing endowment money from companies affiliated with the Israeli government, particularly those that could stand to gain from the war in Gaza. Multibillion-dollar endowments, especially those at large research universities like Columbia, are complex and secretive. Often managed by hedge funds, they can be connected to thousands of potential revenue sources.\n\nWhat is divestment? Pro-Palestinian protesters are urging universities to divest from Israel. Here's what that means.\n\nAnother demand from the protestors drew less attention.\n\nIn 2019, Columbia launched a dual-degree program with Tel Aviv University. Under the agreement, students could earn two undergraduate degrees by studying in Israel for two years and then returning to the U.S. to finish their schooling at Columbia's School of General Studies in Manhattan. The program admitted about 60 students in 2021. Columbia offers similar programs, enrolling hundreds of students, in partnership with other universities in international hubs, including Dublin and Hong Kong.\n\nWhen protestors urged the school to end its affiliation with Tel Aviv University, Columbia's administrators didn't budge. It was a point of pride and not a matter for consideration, officials said.\n\n\"Columbia University welcomes and embraces the Israeli students, faculty, and staff on our campus and are proud of their accomplishments on behalf of the greater Columbia community,\" Columbia spokesperson Samantha Slater said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"We also benefit greatly from our dual-degree program with Tel Aviv University, a program that the university will continue to wholeheartedly support.\"\n\nThe Columbia situation, explained: Alumni pressure and a crime-fighting mayor helped set the stage for Columbia arrests\n\nColumbia's refusal to end the partnership underscores some of the more nuanced truths about how the divestment movement on college campuses is butting up against larger trends in higher education - including the demand for study abroad programs, a \"financial aid arms race,\" reliance on tuition revenue, and the puzzling ways that money, even at the richest schools, can end up unevenly siloed in ways that reshape students' lives.\n\nUnequal financial aid at Columbia\n\nWhen Charissa Ratliff-D'addario decided to leave Spokane Falls Community College in 2019, she thought she knew what she was getting into. She had always fantasized about moving to New York City. When she was 13, she hung a poster of Columbia's main library on her bedroom wall.\n\nColumbia's School of General Studies, which houses the dual-degree program with Tel Aviv University, is made for people just like her: nontraditional students a few years removed from high school. Administrators rave about how those students enrich classroom dialogues and bring fresh perspectives to younger students. When Ratliff-D'addario was accepted, she was thrilled.\n\nBut the reality of her experience didn't align with her dream. After she enrolled at 22 for her first year, she discovered that an error in the financial aid process deemed her ineligible for the grants she needed. She had to take out private loans to cover tuition. She eventually sold the house she owned in Washington state.\n\nHer challenges are similar to those faced by many students at Columbia's School of General Studies, an undergraduate school that has struggled for years to offer the same generous financial aid other Columbia students get. Though the school's enrollment numbers have increased dramatically in the last decade, General Studies students, many of whom have children and juggle jobs, receive less help covering their costs than some of the students they sit with in class.\n\nContext on Columbia: How the university became the epicenter of disagreement over the Israel-Hamas war\n\n\"It's a very tuition-driven school,\" Ratliff-D'addario said. \"I don't think there's any argument around that.\"\n\nAn undergraduate paying full tuition at Columbia and living on campus can expect to pay roughly $90,000 per year, according to the school's recent estimates. Though that number can diminish greatly when factoring in financial aid, skyrocketing tuition has helped Columbia become one of the richest and most expensive schools in the country.\n\nBut at Columbia, like at many universities, every individual school is responsible for footing some major bills. Each is forced to cover a hefty annual tax from the central administration - a fee that is easier for some schools to pay than others. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences, a five-school conglomerate that houses the School of General Studies, has long faced challenges in balancing its budget. The rising cost of financial aid is a big reason why.\n\n\"There was always this sense that we didn't have enough money,\" said Nicholas Dirks, who ran the Arts and Sciences arm at Columbia from 2004 to 2013 before going on to become a chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley. It was \"hardscrabble work,\" he said, to get more help for General Studies students.\n\nDual-degree programs ease some disparities\n\nDriven by a broader trend in higher education to increase international opportunities for undergraduate students, Columbia first launched a dual-degree program in 2010 with the French university Sciences Po. When the European school committed to covering students' financial aid for their first few years abroad, administrators welcomed the chance to bridge some of the financial aid disparities typically faced by General Studies students, Dirks said.\n\nAfter launching more partnerships under similar models, Columbia's dual- and joint-degree offerings more than doubled between 2010 and 2019, according to the campus newspaper. Meanwhile, the number of students in the School of General Studies increased by roughly a third, more than any of Columbia's other undergraduate schools, over the last decade.\n\n\"In my mind, it's impossible not to connect the rapid growth of General Studies with the need for revenue,\" said Michael Thaddeus, a mathematics professor at Columbia who uncovered the university's misreporting to a popular college rankings list several years ago.\n\nDirks, who ran the Arts and Sciences division a decade ago, pushed back on the idea that the School of General Studies' enrollment bump has been primarily revenue-driven. But, he acknowledged, \"it does help the bottom line.\"\n\nThough there have been some improvements to financial aid for General Studies students in recent years, the program has still not bridged the gap with Columbia's other undergraduate schools. Ratliff-D'addario, who received her bachelor's degree last year, went on to start \"Equality for GS,\" a student-led movement to increase financial aid for students like her.\n\nHoward Bunsis, an accounting professor at Eastern Michigan University, who was invited by faculty members last year to analyze Columbia's finances independently, said Columbia nixing its dual-degree programs would make no difference financially.\n\n\"Whether these existed or not would not move the needle at all in my estimation,\" he said. \"What bothers me in higher ed finance is places like Columbia crying poverty.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Don't fall for that claim.\n\nThese protesters don't represent most students or the American public.\n\nYet Monday, Columbia University canceled graduation ceremonies, kowtowing to the radical fringe with whom school leaders largely agree.\n\nStudents and their families be damned.\n\nHere are the facts: Just a miniscule 2% of people ages 18 to 29 polled by Harvard's Kennedy School named the Israel-Hamas conflict as their top political concern, compared with double digits worried about inflation and other economic issues.\n\nStudents could care less about this issue.\n\nClaims that today's campus riots are reminiscent of 1968 when students closed down campuses to protest the Vietnam War are nonsense.\n\nBack then, Gallup found 46% of respondents in that age group considered the Vietnam War the nation's biggest problem. Not 2%.\n\nRay Kelly, former NYPD commissioner, nailed it Sunday when he said the nationwide turmoil \"looks like a conspiracy.\"\n\nHe added, \"the federal government should be investigating.\"\n\nOrganized outside groups are behind much of the campus violence.\n\nHours before the storming of Columbia's Hamilton Hall, an outside organization -- The People's Forum, known for its anti-Israel activities and links to the Chinese Communist Party -- started gearing up for its Hamilton Hall invasion.\n\nIn a meeting, TPF's leader spewed invectives against Columbia.\n\nHours later, protesters smashed the glass doors of Hamilton Hall, vandalizing and seizing the building.\n\nWhen Columbia President Minouche Shafik finally called in police late on Tuesday, 13 of the 44 arrested in the building had no affiliation with the university.\n\nReflecting on the incidents at Columbia and other New York campuses, Mayor Adams said, \"Individuals unaffiliated with these schools had entered these different campuses and, in some cases, were even training students in unlawful protest tactics.\"\n\nNew York University Board Vice Chairman Bill Berkley says these occupations appear to have been orchestrated by external groups. He wants the FBI to investigate\n\nWhere is the FBI, as these groups seize control of our universities?\n\nDirector Christopher Wray says the bureau does not directly track college protests but will provide information to campuses if the agency becomes aware of a specific threat.\n\nHuh? The FBI should be proactively identifying and heading off campus terrorists.\n\nWhere is the Department of Justice?\n\nTwo weeks ago, 27 Republican senators sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland asking for the DOJ to investigate how students' rights are being violated on campus. Radio silence.\n\nWhere is Joe Biden? When the president was asked if he would use the National Guard to restore order, he emphatically said, \"No.\"\n\nWhy not? The National Guard was deployed in 1962 to protect the right of black students to attend the newly integrated University of Mississippi.\n\nStudents of all races and religions who want to go to class or attend their graduation deserve protection.\n\nThe Biden administration is MIA. Is it because the same big Democratic donors supporting Biden -- the Pritzkers, Soroses, Rockefellers -- also support pro-Palestine groups orchestrating campus protests?\n\nMeanwhile, images of campus invaders in head scarves are not winning over Americans.\n\nThe latest Harvard CAPS-Harris survey shows that 80% of Americans want a cease-fire only after Hamas is removed from power and the hostages captured on Oct. 7 are released.\n\nThe public also knows what they are seeing on campuses is not freedom of expression -- a sacred American right -- but lawlessness and dangerous disorder.\n\nUniversities need to be evenhanded, guaranteeing that all sides get to speak and that students can attend class.\n\nColumbia's students were heckled and threatened, had their classes canceled and now are robbed of the grandeur of a university graduation.\n\nIt's a slap in the face to them, and to their families, who sacrificed to make college possible.\n\nColombia's motto is: \"In thy light we shall see light.\"\n\nTruth is, darkness has descended on Columbia and most elite college campuses.\n\nAlumni and taxpayers alike should withhold their support until these institutions see the light and prioritize their students.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Kennedy_School", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard Kennedy School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_United_States_involvement_in_the_Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raymond Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irreligion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

A few students wandered in and out of buildings. A proud mother was taking pictures of her daughter. Students sunbathed on the lawn underneath Royce Hall, the center of the pro-terrorist riots days earlier, which had been secured by an LAPD and campus police presence. Apart from one smear of graffiti on a vending machine and a PLO flag hanging in the window of a dormitory, there was no sign of the riots.\n\nWhat happened to the rioters? Some may have been sleeping it off, but most weren't there.\n\nWhen the NYPD broke up pro-Hamas riots at Columbia and City College, half of the rioters turned out not to be students. While the media has portrayed the terrorist encampments on campuses as the work of outraged students, it's not clear how many anywhere are students.\n\nThe masks commonly worn by the supporters deliberately obscure their identities. But this did not help them when they were finally arrested. What it did do was initially shield the fact that many of the terrorist supporters were clearly older adults, not students, as these photos show.\n\nA bearded 59-year-old man is clearly not a student, but put on a mask, drape a keffiyah around him, and keep him in the background, and he can pass as just another warm \"student\" body.\n\nWhile the terror supporters have been careful to send students and faculty, especially sympathetic ones, unmasked in front of the cameras, the mugshots show what they're hiding.\n\nThe truth is that few students support the antisemitic encampments and most want them to go.\n\nThose are the results of a recent survey by Generation Lab which found that only 7% of students took part in them, only a quarter support them and a majority oppose them.\n\nA majority of college students want to see fewer protests, oppose BDS, and don't agree with most anti-Israel slogans. 34% of college students blame Hamas leaders for the situation in Gaza, as opposed to 19% who blame Netanyahu.\n\nAnd, more importantly, 81% say that \"students who destroyed property, vandalized or illegally occupied buildings should be held accountable\".\n\nWhat the survey really shows though is that the majority of students don't really care. When college students were asked to pick the issues they cared about the most, only 13% picked the war. The majority selected issues like free college, racial justice and social justice.\n\nOf all the issues, the Hamas war was the least important one on the list to most students.\n\nThe pro-Hamas campus riots did not happen because of widespread support from college students, but because key campuses like Columbia and UCLA had become hubs for anti-Israel groups due to the presence of pro-terrorist faculty and some Muslim and Marxist students.\n\nBy setting up terrorist encampments on college campuses, terrorist supporters exploited the cowardice and ineptitude of the administrators who had allowed them to operate on campus all along while manufacturing the narrative that they were a student movement. And as a student movement, they could lay claim to the mantle of the Vietnam War protest movement.\n\nBut are they actually a student movement rather than a movement recruiting students?\n\nThe campus encampments deployed their own security to keep out not only Jewish students, but the press. Participating students were told not to speak to anyone without approval and when they did, the results were often embarrassing as it became clear that they knew nothing. In one famous video from NYU, a protesting student couldn't explain why she was protesting.\n\nWhen the Wall Street Journal's Peggy Noonan visited Columbia University, she observed that unlike past student protesters, \"these demonstrators would generally not speak or make eye contact with members of the press\". When she tried to talk to any of the younger members, none would reply except for one who said that she couldn't talk because \"I'm not trained.\"\n\nPeople who already know what they stand for don't need to be \"trained\".\n\nThe terrorist encampments were not just set up on campuses to keep Jews out, but to keep students in. Adjuncts held classes inside them to get more students inside the pen. And then used social pressure to try to convince them to stay. Tents and snacks were brought in to make the makeshift terror compounds seem like a comfortable camping adventure.\n\nAnd masks were worn to make it hard to tell apart the students from the outside activists.\n\nThe compounds were not a form of protest, but of control. They did not arise organically from the student body, but were brought in from the outside. After a police crackdown, like the one at UCLA, there was little sign of any interest in the cause by the random students on campus.\n\nAnd that is the difference between an actual student movement and a \"Hello Fellow Kids\" one.\n\nUniversities allowed Islamic terror states like Qatar and Saudi Arabia to trade money for control. And when foreign students and terror faculty promoted support for terrorism on campus, they turned a blind eye. And students all too often allowed extremists to take over student government and speak in their name. All of that made colleges a perfect target for the riots.\n\nNow after the vandalism and violence, a lot of college students are unhappy with the consequences as graduations have been canceled and classes were replaced with virtual online learning. A fake student movement executed in their name doesn't have their support.", "source": {"uri": "frontpagemag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FrontPage Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Police last week cleared out the school's Hamilton Hall, which protesters occupied to send a message to Columbia leadership.\n\nIn a letter titled \"In Our Name,\" the school's Jewish community said it is choosing to speak out for itself instead of letting other voices do so for them.\n\n\"Over the past six months, many have spoken in our name,\" the letter opens. \"We are here, writing to you as Jewish students at Columbia University, who are connected to our community and deeply engaged with our culture and history. We would like to speak in our name.\"\n\nContinuing, the authors explained they do not want to appear like activists taking a trendy stance as they have always been passionate about their faith.\n\n\"Most of us did not choose to be political activists,\" the students wrote. \"We do not bang on drums and chant catchy slogans. We are average students, just trying to make it through finals much like the rest of you.\"\n\n\"Those who demonize us under the cloak of anti-Zionism forced us into our activism and forced us to publicly defend our Jewish identities,\" the letter continues.\n\nThe Jewish students also noted they are \"proud of Israel,\" but will not use it as a reason to act out with aggression.\n\n\"We are proud of Israel,\" the letter reads. \"While campus may be riddled with hateful rhetoric and simplistic binaries now, it is never too late to start repairing the fractures and begin developing meaningful relationships across political and religious divides.\"\n\n\"Our tradition tells us, 'love peace and pursue peace,'\" the students wrote. \"We hope you will join us in earnestly pursuing peace, truth, and empathy. Together we can repair our campus.\"\n\nREAD MORE | UNC warns professors withholding grades as part of anti-Israel protests\n\nThe letter has drawn praise from both educators and activists on social media.

They just want all of the Jews to go ... somewhere else. They chant for the creation of Palestine \"from the river to the sea,\" an explicit call for the end of Israel.\n\nWould Jews be welcome in the Palestinian state? Consider the only Jews in Gaza are Israeli soldiers trying to free Israeli captives.\n\nThey're not antisemitic; they just have an affinity for all the organizations that have spent decades explicitly calling for the murder of Jews and carrying out those crimes whenever possible. They proudly wear headbands of Hamas and fly Hezbollah flags, and, yet we still pretend not to know who they are and what they want. They are terrorist wannabes at best, and they want what all Islamic extremists want: dead Jews.\n\nFor the Daily Wire last week, Kassy Akiva reported, \"One of the most vocal student activists leading the anti-Israel Gaza Solidarity Encampment at Columbia University, Khymani James, openly stated in a livestream of an official university inquiry in January that 'Zionists don't deserve to live.'\" Only because of the following uproar did Columbia take action, booting James from the university.\n\nAnd yet, the day after Akiva's report was published, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez praised the encampment during a visit, gushing, \"The leadership you have is just so fantastic.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez, a founding member of the Squad, a group of legislators with a long, problematic history of antisemitism themselves, isn't the only one wholeheartedly supporting the protests. Rep. Ilhan Omar joined the protests after her daughter was suspended for her involvement, and she called some Jewish students \"pro-genocide,\" drawing a deserved rebuke from the Anti-Defimation League.\n\nThe protests aren't just in response to how Israel has handled its operations in Gaza. Their love of terror was immediately evident before Israel launched its response to the attacks of Oct. 7. It's not about what Israel has done or what they have alleged it has done. It's that the Jewish state dares to exist. The Jerusalem Post reported in October, before any Gaza operation began:\n\n\"A tenured professor at New York's Columbia University authored an article praising Hamas' attack on Israeli civilians last Saturday, less than a day after the attacks took place. 'What can motorized paragliders do in the face of one of the most formidable militaries in the world?' asked Joseph Massad, who has taught Modern Arab Politics at Columbia since 1999, in his article for the website Electronic Intifada. 'Apparently much in the hands of an innovative Palestinian resistance.'\"\n\nThe protests taking over America's college campuses can't be more explicit. And their love for terror organizations is reciprocated. Sami Al-Arian, convicted financier of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, tweeted his support of his wife, Nahla, who had set up camp at Columbia's encampment. She knows who her friends are.\n\nIn an email recently, Columbia's president, Minouche Shafik, told the campus community that the pro-Hamas camp and the environment on campus have become intolerable to Jewish students and others. Many Jewish students, at the behest of their rabbi who sent a WhatsApp message to observant students on campus, have already fled. Shafik went on to explain that antisemitic language and actions, not to mention calls for violence, have no place on campus.\n\nThis had to be said because this is the environment that these protests have created. They are antisemitic at their core, and they need to be dismantled immediately.\n\nThese protests and encampments have shown that there is a large and growing fifth column of terrorist sympathizers in our most elite institutions from coast to coast.\n\nCopy article link", "source": {"uri": "azdailysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arizona Daily Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jewish state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamic extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "History of antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_(Polish_trade_union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solidarity (Polish trade union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilhan_Omar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ilhan Omar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Islamic_Jihad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian Islamic Jihad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Massad", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Massad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sami_Al-Arian", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sami Al-Arian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Electronic_Intifada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Electronic Intifada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jerusalem_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Jerusalem Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rabbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_column", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fifth column"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/azdailysun.com/content/tncms/custom/image/7cba55f4-78e8-11ee-b901-cf0dbe53e41e.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546389", "eventUri": "eng-9546389", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2008, "textEnd": 2014}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Columbia's protests have been the most visible and some of the most vicious. Some students, faculty, and outside activists there have used anti-Jew rhetoric, and some have even assaulted Jewish students or blocked them from attending classes. An especially violent contingent broke into Hamilton Hall and locked authorities out.\n\nThese violent protesters have been so disruptive that their fellow students are fearful of attending classes. Furthermore, the university decided to cancel the main graduation ceremony instead of censuring and firing the faculty participating in the protests, expelling the agitating students (who have been given multiple chances to disperse), and evicting the non-school-affiliated activists. The campus has become lawless, and this contingent of fools has not only ruined the end of the year for graduating seniors but has earned Columbia University -- along with Harvard, UPenn, and other schools that have allowed this madness to take away from the academics -- a blacklisting.\n\nThirteen federal judges penned a letter to Columbia President Minouche Shafik stating that they will not hire any Columbia students because of the school's inept handling of the encampments and protests. The judges made several indictments such as, \"Columbia has disqualified itself from educating the future leaders of our country.\" They accuse the school of not enforcing its own code of conduct (that is unless the protesters are speaking out against conservative culture war issues). Finally, they level this mic drop: \"Columbia has instead become an incubator of bigotry.\"\n\nThe letter includes this ultimatum to Shafik and other university heads who are seeing disruptive pro-Hamas protests: \"Universities should also identify students who engage in such conduct so that future employers can avoid hiring them. If not, employers are forced to assume the risk that anyone they hire from Columbia may be one of these disruptive and hateful students.\"\n\nFuture employers aren't the only ones telling the Ivy Leagues and other once-respectable higher education institutions that they've had enough. Prospective students themselves are now starting to look elsewhere for their college education. Typically, the Ivy Leagues pick the cream of the crop. Now, however, the tables have turned, and the cream of the crop is choosing something else.\n\nMany college-preparing high schoolers are seeing the rise in anti-Semitism in the blue-state-run colleges and universities and, ironically, are looking at Southern schools. Why the South? Well, most of the states there are run by conservative governors who uphold law and order. Graduating high schoolers know they have a better chance of being treated fairly and not being subjected to lunatic activist peers derailing their school year and wasting everyone's time.\n\nSome wealthy Jewish families are also looking at alternative schools rather than their regular first choice of an Ivy League. As New York Post columnist Rikki Schlott states: \"If you want to improve your kid's chances of getting into an elite university -- and you can afford it -- it certainly doesn't hurt to start donating major cash to the school as early as possible.

One of them explains a lot.", "body": "When a group of pro-Palestinian protestors pitched tents on Columbia University's Manhattan campus on April 17, they had one goal: to compel the school to sever financial ties with Israel, including halting an academic program in Tel Aviv. Until the demand was met, they refused to leave.\n\nNearly a month later, it's clear that ask was too steep. Negotiations between school administrators and student leaders soured. Police arrested hundreds of demonstrators over the next few weeks. Scores of students were suspended. The school became a lightning rod for a youth-led upheaval over the Israel-Hamas war, sparking similar protests on college campuses across the country.\n\nTheir main stipulation was a familiar one in American higher education: that the university stop drawing endowment money from companies affiliated with the Israeli government, particularly those that could stand to gain from the war in Gaza. Multibillion-dollar endowments, especially those at large research universities like Columbia, are complex and secretive. Often managed by hedge funds, they can be connected to thousands of potential revenue sources.\n\nWhat is divestment? Pro-Palestinian protesters are urging universities to divest from Israel. Here's what that means.\n\nAnother demand from the protestors drew less attention.\n\nIn 2019, Columbia launched a dual-degree program with Tel Aviv University. Under the agreement, students could earn two undergraduate degrees by studying in Israel for two years and then returning to the U.S. to finish their schooling at Columbia's School of General Studies in Manhattan. The program admitted about 60 students in 2021. Columbia offers similar programs, enrolling hundreds of students, in partnership with other universities in international hubs, including Dublin and Hong Kong.\n\nWhen protestors urged the school to end its affiliation with Tel Aviv University, Columbia's administrators didn't budge. It was a point of pride and not a matter for consideration, officials said.\n\n\"Columbia University welcomes and embraces the Israeli students, faculty, and staff on our campus and are proud of their accomplishments on behalf of the greater Columbia community,\" Columbia spokesperson Samantha Slater said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"We also benefit greatly from our dual-degree program with Tel Aviv University, a program that the university will continue to wholeheartedly support.\"\n\nThe Columbia situation, explained: Alumni pressure and a crime-fighting mayor helped set the stage for Columbia arrests\n\nColumbia's refusal to end the partnership underscores some of the more nuanced truths about how the divestment movement on college campuses is butting up against larger trends in higher education - including the demand for study abroad programs, a \"financial aid arms race,\" reliance on tuition revenue, and the puzzling ways that money, even at the richest schools, can end up unevenly siloed in ways that reshape students' lives.\n\nWhen Charissa Ratliff-D'addario decided to leave Spokane Falls Community College in 2019, she thought she knew what she was getting into. She had always fantasized about moving to New York City. When she was 13, she hung a poster of Columbia's main library on her bedroom wall.\n\nColumbia's School of General Studies, which houses the dual-degree program with Tel Aviv University, is made for people just like her: nontraditional students a few years removed from high school. Administrators rave about how those students enrich classroom dialogues and bring fresh perspectives to younger students. When Ratliff-D'addario was accepted, she was thrilled.\n\nBut the reality of her experience didn't align with her dream. After she enrolled at 22 for her first year, she discovered that an error in the financial aid process deemed her ineligible for the grants she needed. She had to take out private loans to cover tuition. She eventually sold the house she owned in Washington state.\n\nHer challenges are similar to those faced by many students at Columbia's School of General Studies, an undergraduate school that has struggled for years to offer the same generous financial aid other Columbia students get. Though the school's enrollment numbers have increased dramatically in the last decade, General Studies students, many of whom have children and juggle jobs, receive less help covering their costs than some of the students they sit with in class.\n\nContext on Columbia: How the university became the epicenter of disagreement over the Israel-Hamas war\n\n\"It's a very tuition-driven school,\" Ratliff-D'addario said. \"I don't think there's any argument around that.\"\n\nAn undergraduate paying full tuition at Columbia and living on campus can expect to pay roughly $90,000 per year, according to the school's recent estimates. Though that number can diminish greatly when factoring in financial aid, skyrocketing tuition has helped Columbia become one of the richest and most expensive schools in the country.\n\nBut at Columbia, like at many universities, every individual school is responsible for footing some major bills. Each is forced to cover a hefty annual tax from the central administration - a fee that is easier for some schools to pay than others. The Faculty of Arts and Sciences, a five-school conglomerate that houses the School of General Studies, has long faced challenges in balancing its budget. The rising cost of financial aid is a big reason why.\n\n\"There was always this sense that we didn't have enough money,\" said Nicholas Dirks, who ran the Arts and Sciences arm at Columbia from 2004 to 2013 before going on to become a chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley. It was \"hardscrabble work,\" he said, to get more help for General Studies students.\n\nDriven by a broader trend in higher education to increase international opportunities for undergraduate students, Columbia first launched a dual-degree program in 2010 with the French university Sciences Po. When the European school committed to covering students' financial aid for their first few years abroad, administrators welcomed the chance to bridge some of the financial aid disparities typically faced by General Studies students, Dirks said.\n\nAfter launching more partnerships under similar models, Columbia's dual- and joint-degree offerings more than doubled between 2010 and 2019, according to the campus newspaper. Meanwhile, the number of students in the School of General Studies increased by roughly a third, more than any of Columbia's other undergraduate schools, over the last decade.\n\n\"In my mind, it's impossible not to connect the rapid growth of General Studies with the need for revenue,\" said Michael Thaddeus, a mathematics professor at Columbia who uncovered the university's misreporting to a popular college rankings list several years ago.\n\nDirks, who ran the Arts and Sciences division a decade ago, pushed back on the idea that the School of General Studies' enrollment bump has been primarily revenue-driven. But, he acknowledged, \"it does help the bottom line.\"\n\nThough there have been some improvements to financial aid for General Studies students in recent years, the program has still not bridged the gap with Columbia's other undergraduate schools. Ratliff-D'addario, who received her bachelor's degree last year, went on to start \"Equality for GS,\" a student-led movement to increase financial aid for students like her.\n\nHoward Bunsis, an accounting professor at Eastern Michigan University, who was invited by faculty members last year to analyze Columbia's finances independently, said Columbia nixing its dual-degree programs would make no difference financially.\n\n\"Whether these existed or not would not move the needle at all in my estimation,\" he said. \"What bothers me in higher ed finance is places like Columbia crying poverty.\"\n\nZachary Schermele covers education and breaking news for USA TODAY.

It was issued in addition to petitions calling for a stop to the unjust expulsion and suspensions of student protesters, and nearly two score letters previously sent to the administration representing thousands of alumni who graduated between 1966 and 2023 from all of the University's schools and identified across a variety of racial, ethnic and religious groups.\n\n\"I sign because my Jewish values of inquiry, empathy and moral courage compel me to,\" said an alumna of CC '03 and CLS '10 who grew up in both New York and Jerusalem. \"These values were nurtured in Columbia classrooms, and I know other Columbia students share them. Until my university can conduct itself in accordance with those values internally, within its communities, and around the world, it does not deserve my esteem, much less contributions of my time, money or skills.\"\n\nThe alumni letter follows the University's unprecedented aggressive actions against pro-Palestine student protesters, including suspensions and expulsion processes with inadequate due process.\n\nThis, as well as the events of April 30 and weeks prior, where Columbia University administration twice deployed New York Police Department forces to clear an encampment that represented a non-violent protest and the takeover of Hamilton Hall, renamed Hind's Hall by the protesters after a six-year-old Palestinian girl was killed by the Israeli military in January.\n\nThe police action, during which an officer's gun was shot inside Hamilton/Hind's Hall, resulted in 112 arrests, including students, supporters and community members; a similar action 20 blocks north at City College at the same time resulted in 170 arrests. Some of those arrested were denied food and water for 16 hours and even placed in solitary confinement.\n\nSince then, violence against student protesters has escalated around New York and elsewhere, including an incident on May 7 where student protesters were deliberately hit by a car.\n\n\"It's truly disappointing to see the way the university has been responding to the students,\" said Taha Saeed, GSAS '23. \"Universities are places for free speech and discourse, not police brutality. Most importantly, by failing to review its investments and divest where appropriate, the university is playing a role in the ongoing violence in Gaza. I hope they wake up and get on the right side of history.\"\n\nDespite claims by President Shafik that bringing police into campus, and keeping a police presence was necessary until May 17 to carry out graduation ceremonies, the university has since moved smaller events five miles north of campus.\n\nThe signatories of the alumni letter pledge to withhold support from the university until demands are met in three areas:\n\nThe letter is part of a series of actions that more than 6,000 alumni of conscience have collectively taken in response to the crackdown on student human rights defenders, in addition to weeks of physical and material support for students, and attempts to engage with administration around this issue.

It does not seem to occur to the protest community that such decisions are supposed to be the result of stakeholders pushing for change and officialdom wanting to accommodate them.\n\nNot extortion.\n\nCollege protests have spread beyond Columbia and Harvard to campuses across the country. And if a poll of 719 Columbia students, faculty and workers conducted by New York Magazine and the Columbia Daily Spectator is to be believed, 68 percent of those at Morningside Heights hope pro-Palestinian demands are met.\n\nHamas should be happy with American academia.\n\nMe? I stand with Israel. I also agree that all students and faculty have a free-speech right to express opposing views. But they do not have a right to trespass on campus quads, and they do not have a right to keep students who want to learn from college classrooms.\n\nAs Steven McGuire of the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, or ACTA, told me, \"Most if not all of these encampments can and should be shut down on the basis of content-neutral policies.\" He's right.\n\nSo where do we go from here?\n\nFight hate speech with smart speech. Social media platforms have enabled critics to see just how twisted many of the woke pro-Hamas protesters are.\n\nAt George Washington University, a small group of students had a bullhorn dialogue about how great it would be to execute -- actually behead -- administrators. \"To the guillotine,\" they chanted, apparently undisturbed that they were aligning themselves with the French Revolution's Reign of Terror.\n\nColumbia student Khymani James shared his negative views on Zionism on social media: \"I don't fight to injure or for there to be a winner or a loser, I fight to kill,\" James wrote. James, who has apologized, has been barred from Columbia's campus.\n\nGood luck finding a good job if any of you actually graduate.\n\nLast year, hedge fund CEO Bill Ackman called on fellow big shots not to hire students who blamed Israel, not Hamas, for the Oct. 7 massacre that left more than 1,200 dead. It's time the protest class realized that bad ideas and a general lack of judgment can have consequences.\n\nActivists who broke laws -- by damaging property or trespassing -- should face serious consequences. They prevented students who wanted to to learn in a classroom from a chance to do so. They also cost their institutions a lot of money. Their privileged status as students should not exempt them.\n\nAnyone who's involved in organizing or leading campus occupations, McGuire offered, \"should receive some pretty significant discipline.\" That could be a suspension, and in extreme cases \"even expulsion.\"\n\n(I'd add clean-up duty. Make tent dwellers clean up after themselves.)\n\nBut McGuire cautioned, \"I'd be surprised if we see consistent, strong follow-through,\" because for too many years, administrators caved to chaos.",

Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., speaks alongside Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., and the leaders of the Pro-Palestinian protest encampment at George Washington University. (AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe Left and their media allies want you to believe the protests roiling college campuses are spontaneous uprisings of morally fervent students worried about Gaza war victims. Don't fall for that claim. It's a scam. These protesters don't represent most students or the American public.\n\nYet Monday, Columbia University canceled graduation ceremonies, kowtowing to the radical fringe, with whom they largely agree. Students and their families be damned.\n\nHere are the facts: A miniscule 2% of people ages 18 to 29 polled by Harvard's Kennedy School named the Israel-Hamas conflict as their top political concern, compared with double digits who were concerned about the economy. Students couldn't care less about this issue.\n\nClaims that today's campus riots are reminiscent of 1968, when students closed down campuses to protest the Vietnam War, are nonsense. Back then, Gallup found 46% of respondents in that age group considered the Vietnam War the nation's biggest problem. Not 2%.\n\nRay Kelly, former New York Police commissioner, nailed it Sunday when he said the nationwide turmoil \"looks like a conspiracy. ... We need the federal government's investigative capacity to look at this whole situation.\"\n\nOrganized outside groups are behind much of the campus violence. Hours before the storming of Columbia's Hamilton Hall, an outside organization called The People's Forum -- known for its anti-Israel activities and links to the Chinese Communist Party -- started gearing up for its Hamilton Hall invasion. In a meeting, TPF's leader spewed invectives against Columbia.\n\nHours later, protesters smashed the glass doors of Hamilton Hall, vandalizing and seizing the building. When Minouche Shafik, university president, finally called in police, 13 of the 44 arrested in the building had no affiliation with the university.\n\nReflecting on the incidents at Columbia and other New York campuses, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said after the arrests, \"Individuals unaffiliated with these schools had entered these different campuses and, in some cases, were even training students in unlawful protest tactics.\"\n\nNew York University Board Vice Chairman Bill Berkley says these occupations appear to have been orchestrated by external groups. He wants the FBI to investigate.\n\nAs these groups seize control of our universities, where is the FBI? Director Christopher Wray says the bureau does not directly track college protests but will provide information to campuses if the agency becomes aware of a specific threat.\n\nHuh? The FBI should be proactively identifying and heading off campus terrorists.\n\nWhere is the Department of Justice? Two weeks ago, 27 Republican senators sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland asking for the DOJ to investigate how students' rights are being violated on campus. Radio silence.\n\nWhere is President Joe Biden? When the president was asked if he would use the National Guard to restore order, he emphatically said, \"No.\"\n\nWhy not? The National Guard were deployed in 1962 to protect the right of Black students to attend the newly integrated University of Mississippi. Students of all races and religions who want to go to class or attend their graduation deserve protection.\n\nThe Biden administration is missing in action. Is it because the same big Dem donors supporting Biden -- the Pritzker family, George Soros, David Rockefeller Jr. -- also support pro-Palestine groups orchestrating campus protests?\n\nMeanwhile, images of campus invaders in headscarves are not winning over Americans. The latest Harvard CAPS-Harris survey shows that 61% of Americans polled want a ceasefire only after Hamas is removed from power and the hostages captured on Oct. 7 are released.\n\nThe public also knows what they are seeing on campuses is not freedom of expression -- a sacred American right -- but lawlessness and dangerous disorder. Universities need to be evenhanded, guaranteeing that all sides get to speak and students can attend class.\n\nColumbia's students were heckled and threatened, had their classes canceled and now are robbed of the grandeur of a university graduation.

They're erecting illegal tent cities and occupying academic halls but want to be treated like hotel guests, even while guarding their anonymity by wearing masks and keffiyehs. In recruiting radical professors who beat the drum for Marxism all day long, administrations have created entitled activists hellbent on destruction.\n\nAt New York University's walkout recently, a faculty member reprimanded me after I chatted with a couple freshmen about why they were rallying. \"The mama bear in me is on high alert,\" the professor warned. I explained that the students consented to the interview and didn't have to reveal their identities if they were uncomfortable. As shown in this instance, faculty coddle their students but still insist they offer important contributions to the political discourse.\n\nAs children are prone to do, protesters at various campuses dreamed up elaborate forts from which they could play cops and robbers and other games. Footage from Columbia showed the protesters melodramatically retrieving supplies from their comrades from under a campus gate. At UCLA, protesters requested specific comforts, including headlamps, EpiPens, and \"hot food for lunch!\" but expressly no bagels or bananas. Formidable revolutionaries, until someone accidentally eats gluten.\n\nA female protester's social media tour of the Columbia encampment revealed an arts and crafts area, a makeshift library stocked with comic books, a live band, and a flea market donating proceeds to the Palestinian cause. A narrator informs the listener that \"Students in this encampment are agents of their own learning, their time, and their engagement with the world around them\".\n\nContinuing their charade, protesters at UCLA, or the \"People's University\" as they rebranded it, fenced off a library with checkpoints so that students couldn't enter unless they showed wristbands proving their allegiance to the Palestinian cause. While they're gatekeeping their exclusive club and filming content like they're influencers at a music festival, they're also cosplaying as freedom fighters, flying the Hezbollah flag, and yelling slogans that deny Israel's right to exist.\n\n\"Unfortunately, being Gen Z means dealing with repeated states of the world that are in absolute hostility and turmoil,\" one senior at Columbia told the New York Times.\n\nIf this was the best spokesperson the Times could find, it indicates that their movement is both narcissistic and historically ignorant. Like other footage circulated online has shown, many students are clueless about the geopolitical conflict they're protesting. They are just useful idiots for terrorism.\n\nOf course, their positions come from parroting their professors, who are themselves enabling the chaos. At Columbia, professors in safety vests protected students in the illegal encampment by forming a human wall. The same thing happened at NYU. Last week, Princeton professor Max Weiss gleefully announced the student and professor takeover of Clio academic hall.\n\nThese actions have consequences well beyond college grounds. Violent protests like those seen at UCLA have prompted worried administrators to shut down usual academic proceedings, stealing college milestones from the same class intake that lost their high school graduation to Covid. The University of Southern California's decision to cancel its graduation ceremony in anticipation of more unrest is unlikely to be an unfortunate outlier.\n\nThe dreadful example of Columbia, which tolerated its encampment for weeks, might explain why university administrators feel so jittery. After police made hundreds of arrests just to have the occupation pop back up again, Columbia gave an ultimatum to evacuate or face suspension. After ignoring the deadline, the protesters escalated the situation by moving into Hamilton Hall, forcing out staff members, vandalising property, and barricading themselves inside.\n\nWith a building besieged, Columbia finally called in an NYPD crackdown. Police in riot gear pulled students out and took many others into custody, charging for burglary, criminal mischief, trespassing, and disorderly conduct. Students who took over Hamilton Hall faced expulsion.\n\nThough they insist they're mature adults with bargaining power, students got into the collective fetal position once they were held to account for their lawlessness. After the NYPD response, Columbia law students claimed they were so traumatised that they could not function. They demanded the school cancel finals because of their distress.\n\n\"The violence we witnessed last night has irrevocably shaken many of us...,\" the editors of the Columbia Law Review wrote. \"...The events of last night left us, and many of our peers, unable to focus and highly emotional during this tumultuous time.\"\n\nThese students were told by Left-wing professors and activist groups to act in a drama, but they don't know the underlying plot. While they deserve the appropriate disciplinary action for crimes they committed, we can't ignore that these students are spoiled pawns. Modern universities are daycares for radicals. It's high time we treat the students as the toddlers they're determined to act as.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keffiyeh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keffiyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walkout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tent_city", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tent city"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marxism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anonymity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Library"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radical politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_exist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right to exist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resistance_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Resistance movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flea_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flea market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cosplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Banana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weiss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Weiss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Princeton University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Student", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Students", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Students", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rp47YdjJs53BC0OzFt3S7A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/44cd231b73da26d975ba3b9ccb1fe693", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546389", "eventUri": "eng-9546389", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Some universities, such as Northwestern and Brown, have even entered into or contemplated dangerous concession agreements with the demonstrators that will make antisemitism on their campuses worse.\n\nThus, we request that you assure strict compliance with universities' obligations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to provide a safe, harassment-free, violence-free learning environment for Jewish and pro-Israel students, and assure strict compliance with universities' Title VII obligations to provide a non-hostile work environment for Jewish and pro-Israel faculty.\n\nWe request that wherever necessary, you send in federal law enforcement, and defund and take other legal action against universities that fail to comply. We further request that you enforce the federal criminal statute prohibiting \"providing material support or resources to designated foreign terrorist organizations\" against entities and individuals providing material support to Hamas, the PFLP and their front groups on campuses.\n\nThroughout the past 18 years, the ZOA and some other Jewish organizations initiated numerous Title VI complaints regarding glaring antisemitic activities at specific schools. Some of our complaints were resolved - but others lingered at the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights for years despite our repeated requests for prompt action. Meanwhile, antisemitism on American campuses festered and grew exponentially. The antisemitic violence and intimidation is so out-of-hand now that this issue can no longer wait. At this point, there is no need to wait for time-consuming individual complaints.\n\nWe urge you to act immediately, with the full-scale force of the law, on a nationwide basis.\n\nIt is intolerable that so many Jewish students are in fear for their lives, are prevented from attending classes that they paid tuition for, are barred from studying in libraries that they also paid tuition for, and are unable to establish Jewish organizational tables or participate in Jewish events without antisemitic mobs perpetrating nonstop harassment, interference or worse.\n\nIt is unconscionable that Jewish students are being subjected to antisemitic \"no go\" zones illegally taken over by mobs that establish their own laws; \"checkpoints\" manned by Hamas-supporters that block Jews from walking across the quad; lines of radical faculty members who link arms to exclude Jewish students from illegal pro-Hamas encampment areas; shrines honoring convicted murderers of Jews; nonstop antisemitic blood libels; mobs vandalizing Jewish centers and ripping off and burning mezuzahs (Jewish religious symbols) on Jewish students' doors; and days-long drumbeats of threats and chants calling for Jews' and Israelis' murder and exclusion.\n\nAnd it is frightening that Jewish students are being subjected to calls to \"globalize the Intifada,\" repeat October 7 every day, and make American Jewish students the next victims of multiple October 7ths.\n\n\"Intifadas\" are the terror wars against Jews. In Israel, Palestinian Arab terrorists murdered or maimed approximately 10,000 innocent Jews in Intifadas, by bombing civilian buses, pizza parlors full of children, Passover Seders full of Holocaust survivors and elsewhere; and with car ramming, knifing and shooting attacks.\n\nThe violence and hatred directed at Jewish students on college campuses did not spring up organically. The look-alike tents, encampments, signs, PFLP and Hamas terrorist \"honorees,\" chants and tactics on campuses throughout the country are coordinated with bigger players. Campuses throughout the nation use similar terminology (e.g., \"Flood New York City,\" \"Flood the Encampments\"), which reflects Hamas' title for its heinous anti-Israel atrocities (\"Al Aqsa Flood\"). None of this is coincidental. Radical and terror-allied national and international organizations and funders are coordinating campus antisemitism, tactics, violence and riots. Local students collaborate with these national groups and professional outside agitators. They all must be stopped to address the crisis on our campuses.\n\nAccordingly, we request that you also investigate and take all available legal actions against the organizers, funders, students and outside agitators involved in antisemitic campus violence. There must be consequences for all who have turned our campuses into hate-fests.\n\nFor your convenience, this letter also includes a list of some of the organizations fomenting the antisemitic demonstrations and violence. Incidentally, in June 2022, we wrote to you requesting that you investigate and take action against organizations behind the dangerous \"Mapping Project\" that targets and promotes violence against American Jews, schools, synagogues and other Jewish institutions. Those organizations are also among the groups promoting violence on college campuses today. Organized antisemitic violence and intimidation will continue to metastasize until strong action is taken to shut it down.\n\nJewish and pro-Israel students are not the only ones affected by the current situation. Out-of-control campus antisemitism and riots, campus shut-downs and canceled classes and exams are disrupting virtually all students' ability to learn and develop the knowledge base, moral compass and critical thinking skills that they will need to lead healthy, productive lives and contribute to the well-being of our nation and the world.\n\nGraduations that are canceled due to campus antisemitism (e.g., at Columbia University and University of Southern California) or disrupted (including by a student wearing fake blood and an \"NEU kills\" t-shirt at Northeastern and other incidents) mar or deprive virtually all students and their friends and families of a celebratory event that they worked for and looked forward to for years.\n\nWe were personally informed that during campus riots in the late 1960s, the FBI came onto campus, took photographs, and reported to college administrators that riot participants included outside agitators from the PFLP terror organization. Such monitoring and investigation is also needed today, especially when flags of designated terror organizations PFLP and Hezbollah are displayed in encampments and encampment participants openly identify themselves as terror organization Hamas (e.g., yelling \"we are all Hamas\" at Columbia University). We are concerned by Director Wray's recent interview response that the FBI does not monitor the current demonstrations - although at least it shares intelligence about threats. We urge the FBI to do much more.\n\nThe anti-Jewish violence and hatred at American campuses is now at shocking crisis levels, and is still escalating. Here are examples of what is occurring at universities across the nation:\n\n* A mob of hundreds of pro-Hamas, pro-PFLP demonstrators surrounded, blockaded, taunted, repeatedly pushed and prevented the passage of two Jewish students. One of the Jewish students, Sara Tartak, is editor-in-chief of the Yale Free Press and was attempting to report on the antisemitic Yale encampment. Antisemitic demonstrators waved flashlights, keffiyehs and Palestinian flags in Ms. Tartak's face. (Ms. Tartak later noted that these tactics of encircling, blockading and waiving objects in Jewish students faces are nationwide.) Then a Palestinian Arab demonstrator stabbed Jewish Ms. Tartak in the eye with a Palestinian flagpole. Ms. Tartak received a blunt force injury and needed emergency medical care at the hospital. When Ms. Tartak urged police to disband the encampment, they merely responded that they needed authorization. The Connecticut division of American Muslims for Palestine (AMP) boasted that they succeeded because no arrests were made over the April 20-21, 2024 weekend.\n\n* A huge mural, signs and a shrine at Yale honored PFLP terrorist commander Walid Daqqa, who was convicted of kidnapping, severely torturing and murdering a 19-year-old Israeli, Moshe Tamam in 1984. The PFLP terrorists commanded by Daqqa castrated and gouged out Moshe Tamam's eyes before shooting him in the head.\n\n* Antisemitic anti-Israel demonstrations have been taking place at Yale since October 7. Their \"Occupy Beinecke\" demonstration (illegally occupying Yale's Beinecke Plaza) held pro-Hamas \"teach-ins\" at which they honored PFLP terrorist Walid Daqqa and Hamas propagandist Refaat Alareer. In a BBC interview, Alareer called Hamas' and fellow Gazans' October 7 atrocities \"legitimate and moral\" and \"exactly like the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising\"; and repeatedly wrote on X the canard that: \"ALL the rape/sexual violence allegations are lies. Israel uses them as smokescreens to justify the Gaza genocide.\"\n\n* After police finally dismantled the illegal \"Occupy Beinecke\" encampment and made dozens of arrests commencing April 22, 2024, anti-Israel demonstrators (both Yale students and outside agitators) then attempted to re-start their demonstrations by marching on the Yale president's house and police department.\n\n* On April 30, 2024, five violent antisemitic demonstrators kicked in the head, stomped on, and knocked unconscious a young Jewish girl, Eleanor [last name withheld] when she bent over to try to pick up an Israeli flag. The Jewish victim suffered a concussion, repeated flashbacks and trauma. The demonstrators also stomped on the Israeli flag. A prominent Jewish journalist posted: \"UCLA, where beating Jewish girls unconscious is free speech.\"\n\n* On April 29, 2024, violent antisemitic demonstrators attacked a pro-Israel counter-protester, yanked off the counter-protester's hat, ripped away the sign that the counter-protester was holding, and threatened and tried to use a taser on the pro-Israel counter-protester. Campus security standing nearby failed to intervene.\n\n* On May 1, 2024 and other times, keffiyeh-clad antisemitic, pro-Hamas demonstrators set up metal and human barricades and prevented peaceful Jewish students from walking to class on their regular route through the main UCLA campus.\n\n* On April 30, 2024, antisemitic, screaming, keffiyeh-clad demonstrators holding plywood blockaded a Jewish student from entering the library. The antisemitic demonstrators then hunted down, chased, surrounded and prevented the Jewish student from escaping.\n\n* On April 25, 2024, pro-Hamas students and others set up a huge, continuing illegal encampment on Royce Quad, blocked the main area of the campus, determined who would go in and out of the area, and surrounded their illegal encampment with metal and plywood barriers. After days of the pro-Hamas encampment participants attacking, blocking and mistreating Jewish students, without any action or response from the college administration, Jews from the Los Angeles community had enough, and came to campus to remove the illegal encampment barriers. Their aim was to encourage the police to finally take down the barriers and end the encampment. Pro-Israel protesters cheered and played the American national anthem when the police finally arrived.\n\n* After establishing an illegal tent encampment on the UW-Madison campus, pro-Hamas demonstrators made \"Heil Hitler\" salutes at Jewish students, and ominously chanted \"There is only one solution, Intifada, revolution\" - a clear call for Jews to be murdered.\n\n* Pro-Hamas demonstrators violently clashed with police when the police removed the illegal tents, while screaming the anti-Jewish genocidal chant, \"Free, free Palestine.\" The pro-Hamas demonstrators pushed back police, and surrounded a tent to prevent the police from removing it.\n\n* Immediately after police removed the illegal pro-Hamas tent encampment on May 1, 2024, an even larger tent encampment was constructed. Instead of holding the pro-Hamas students accountable for their offenses, the chancellor appeased them by agreeing to meet with the pro-Hamas students and to not bring in more police before then. Meanwhile, the pro-Hamas demonstrators cheered for a speaker yelling on a bullhorn: \"We won't stop until Palestine is free\" (meaning, until Israel is destroyed); and pro-Hamas trucks flashed antisemitic blood libels accusing Israelis (Jews) of perpetrating genocide. The Milwaukee Hillel Executive Director reported that Jewish students felt unsafe and that the university needed to do more to protect Jewish students.\n\n* On May 1, 2024, a few steps away from MIT's Hillel [Jewish activities] building, pro-terror demonstrators cheered when a speaker praised and defended the Muslim Brotherhood and designated terrorist organizations Hamas and the PFLP, and declared, \"We're on the side of the fighters [Hamas, etc.]! We're on the side of those that fight the enemy [Israel].\" The Muslim Brotherhood is the parent organization of Hamas, al Qaeda and other terror groups; preaches hatred and violence towards Jews and Israel's destruction; bombs Coptic Christian churches; and its leader issued a fatwa calling for the murder of American troops.\n\n* On November 9-10, 2023 (the 85th anniversary of Kristallnacht - the \"night of broken glass\" nationwide pogroms in which Nazis and Hitler Youth destroyed hundreds of synagogues, looted 7,000 businesses and arrested and sent to Dachau thousands of German Jews), an antisemitic, anti-Israel, pro-Hamas group called \"Coalition Against Apartheid\" (CAA) physically obstructed Jewish students from attending classes, and invited more protestors to join CAA in calling for a violent Intifada in MIT's main lobby after the administration told students to leave the lobby. Jewish students were fearful of leaving their rooms.\n\n* CAA also harassed MIT staff members in their offices for being Jewish and interrupted classes for weeks. In addition, on social media and posters during their blockade, CAA threatened \"you can't hide\" with MIT's Jewish president's name painted in a depiction of blood, and singled out Jewish professors by name.\n\n* On October 7, 2023, CAA posted on social media, and on October 8, 2023, CAA sent emails to all MIT dorms supporting, justifying, and glorifying Hamas' atrocities (\"Victory is ours\"; \"Affirming the right of all occupied peoples to resist\"; etc.) and blaming Israel for the violence perpetrated on her citizens.\n\n* On October 19, 2023, CAA held a rally outside the MIT Student Center calling for violence and murder of Jews, with chants including \"One Solution: Intifada Revolution\" and \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.\" Some demonstrators directly harassed Israeli students. One attendee allegedly tried to run an Israeli student over with his bike and said \"Your ancestors [referring to Holocaust victims] didn't die to kill more people.\"\n\n* On November 2, 2023, MIT's pro-Hamas CAA stormed the MIT Israel internship offices, harassed staff, accused staff of associating with genocide, and chanted \"From the river to the sea,\" etc.\n\n* On December 6, 2023, CAA hosted a speaker, who was theoretically under non-academic suspension. The speaker called for targeting Hillel.\n\n* At a demonstration on December 14, 2023, crowds cheered for \"armed resistance\" [violence] and to \"hold a knife to their throats.\" There were also calls for \"no peace.\"\n\n* MIT's Graduate Student Union (GSU) engages in antisemitic boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) and other antisemitic activities, and refused to give Jewish graduate students religious exemptions (required under Title VII), forcing the Jewish students to file federal discrimination charges with the EEOC in March 2024.\n\n* On October 8, 2023, Columbia's SJP chapter wrote an open letter that celebrated Hamas' October 7 atrocities as a \"historic moment for the Palestinians\"; condemned campus officials who showed sympathy for Jews or decried Hamas' atrocities; justified and defended Hamas and Gazans - claiming that they were resisting oppressors and were not engaging in terrorism; and demanded divestment from Israel. Columbia Professor Shai Davidai noted that this demonstrated that SJP's actions were \"always about support for Hamas.\"\n\n* Demonstrators who hid their faces with keffiyehs at Columbia demonstrations were cheered by fellow antisemitic demonstrators while openly shouting \"We are Hamas, we are all Hamas.\" They also threatened American Jewish students with many more October 7th massacres, saying \"Remember the 7th of October! That will happen not one more time, not five more times, not 10 more times, not 100 more times, not 1000 more times, but 10,000 times!\" and \"Never forget the 7th of October. Are you ready? 7th of October is about to be every day. Every day. 7th of October is going to be every day for you.\" Another demonstrator declared that October 7 was one of the greatest days of his life.\n\n* The pro-Hamas demonstrators also called Jewish women \"f---ing b---ches\" and told them \"get the f--- out of here.\"\n\n* A November 15, 2024 protest featured huge banners to \"Free Palestine\" \"By any means necessary\" (meaning by violence) \"Within Our Lifetime.\" In case anyone doubted what \"Free Palestine\" meant, the banners showed a Palestinian Arab flag entirely covering a map of Israel.\n\n* On March 24, 2024, a two-hour \"Resistance 101\" zoom event for Columbia and Barnard students featured terror organization PFLP senior member Khalid Barakat and his wife, Charlotte Kates, the international coordinator of PFLP front group Samidoun. \"Within Our Lifetime\" and a divest group that grew out of SJP organized the \"Resistance 101\" zoom session, which was sponsored by Barnard's Center for Research on Women. Barakat told students that Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and the PFLP in Gaza are emboldened by what they're seeing at Columbia. Kates told the students that they should keep demonstrating because it was important to the resistance, that they should openly embrace armed resistance and Hamas, that October 7th was necessary, and there was \"nothing wrong with being a Hamas fighter.\"\n\n* On April 17, 2024, pro-Hamas demonstrators set up a hostile, antisemitic \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment,\" while Columbia's president was testifying before Congress about campus antisemitism. Antisemitic Columbia faculty locked arms in human chains to help the pro-Hamas demonstrators prevent Jewish students and press outlets (e.g., ABC and Fox News) from entering or walking on the campus lawn occupied by the encampment. Keffiyeh-wearers and Qatari-financed pro-Hamas propaganda outlet Al Jazeera were allowed to freely enter the encampment.\n\n* A Jewish neighbor living across the street from the Columbia campus stated that for the past seven months, Columbia's demonstrators have caused an extreme hostile anti-Jewish antisemitic atmosphere. For instance, while she was standing in her kitchen preparing for Passover, she heard the demonstrators screaming: \"Say it loud and say it clear, We don't want no Zionists [Jews] here.\"\n\n* On Saturday night April 20, 2024, Jewish students who were waving American and Israeli flags and singing peace songs on the Columbia campus were subjected to physical assaults and intimidation. Masked keffiyeh-wearers threw water in the Jewish students' faces and chanted, \"Fuck Israel, Israel's a bitch!\"; \"You guys are all inbred\"; \"We say justice, you say how? Burn Tel Aviv to the ground.\"; \"Hamas, we love you. We support your rockets, too.\" A keffiyeh-masked demonstrator held up a sign with an arrow pointing toward towards the Jewish students that read: \"Al-Qassam's Next Targets.\" Al-Qassam is the military wing of Hamas. Pro-Hamas demonstrators chased the Jewish students towards the campus gates and the Jewish students needed to flee for their safety.\n\n* After pro-Hamas demonstrators chased Jewish students to Columbia's only open gate on April 20, they found that Within Our Lifetime -- a group openly committed to Israel's destruction -- was leading a mass protest blocking the gate. A keffiyeh-wearing demonstrator berated the Jewish students, and a different keffiyeh-wearing demonstrator grabbed a Jewish student's Israeli flags, brought them back to the pro-Hamas mob inside the gates and attempted to set fire to the Israeli flags. The Jewish student followed and rescued his flags from the fire, while pro-Hamas demonstrators shoved the Jewish student and threw solid objects at the Jewish student's face and chest. The pro-Hamas demonstrators chased the Jewish students out from the campus again, where another pro-Hamas demonstrator yelled at the Jewish students: \"Go back to Poland!\" (The Nazis murdered 95% of Polish Jews in the Holocaust.)\n\n* On April 21, 2024, Rabbi Elie Buechler, a rabbi associated with Columbia University's Orthodox Union Jewish Learning Initiative on Campus, sent a WhatsApp message to about 300 mostly Orthodox Jewish students that recent events at the university \"have made it clear that Columbia University's Public Safety and the NYPD cannot guarantee Jewish students' safety in the face of extreme antisemitism and anarchy.\" Rabbi Buechler advised: \"It deeply pains me to say that I would strongly recommend you return home as soon as possible and remain home until the reality in and around campus has dramatically improved.\"\n\n* A class action subsequently filed against Columbia for not providing a safe environment for Jewish students noted that: \"There are straight-out calls for the genocide of Jews. This has happened because of complacency and appeasement by our academic institutions,\" and \"Since its formation, the encampment has been the center of round-the-clock harassment of Jewish students, who have been punched, shoved, spat upon, blocked from attending classes and moving freely about campus, and targeted by pro-terrorist hate speech -- both verbal and in written form on massive banners and signs -- with statements such as: 'Death to the Jews'; 'Long live Hamas'; 'Globalize the Intifada.'\"\n\n* Longstanding antisemitism at Columbia is reflected in previous lawsuits, filed prior to the class action suit related to the antisemitic pro-Hamas encampment. On February 21, 2024, 5 Jewish students and two Jewish organizations sued Columbia for severe and pervasive antisemitism. Their lawsuit documented that:\n\n\"Columbia faculty and students have openly lauded Hamas's October 7 atrocities as 'astounding,' 'awesome,' and 'great feats.' Mobs of pro-Hamas students and faculty have marched by the hundreds through Columbia's campus, shouting vile antisemitic slogans, including calls for genocide, such as: 'Jews will not defeat us'; 'There is only one solution, Intifada revolution'; 'We will honor our martyrs'; 'Resistance is justified'; 'By any means necessary'; and, in Arabic, 'From water to water, Palestine will be Arab.' Those mobs have occupied buildings, promoted violence against Jews, and harassed and assaulted Jews on campus. Jewish and Israeli students have been spat at, physically assaulted, threatened, and targeted on campus and social media with epithets such as 'fuck the Jews,' and 'death to Jews.' Columbia faculty have promulgated antisemitism in their courses and dismissed and intimidated students who object. What is most striking about all of this is Columbia's abject failure and deliberate refusal to lift a finger to stop and deter this outrageous antisemitic conduct and discipline the students and faculty who perpetrate it. Columbia's antisemitism manifests itself in a double standard invidious to Jews and Israelis. Columbia selectively enforces its policies to avoid protecting Jewish and Israeli students from harassment, hires professors who support anti-Jewish violence and spread antisemitic propaganda, and ignores Jewish and Israeli students' pleas for protection.\"\n\n* On April 22, 2024, after Jewish Columbia professor Shai Davidai emailed Columbia officials that he planned to simply sit in the illegal encampment and needed security protection to do so, Columbia deactivated Davidai's ID card so that he could not enter the campus. Meanwhile, a bigger pro-Hamas illegal tent encampment sprang up on the Columbia campus.\n\n* On April 30, 2024, instead of abiding by the deadline to remove their tent encampment, over 200 demonstrators violently took over and occupied Columbia's Hamilton Hall administration building. The demonstrators locked arms in front of the building, smashed windows, vandalized the building, threatened a facilities worker, forced public safety workers out of the building, hung an intifada banner out the window, and placed metal tables and furniture in front of the building as a barricade. The demonstrators declared that they would stay in the building until Columbia agreed to their antisemitic, anti-Israel divestment demands and amnesty demands, and said that the university would have blood on its hands if the university tried to remove them by force. In response, President Biden noted that forcibly taking over building is wrong. About 12 hours after the demonstrators took over the building, police crawled through windows, arrested demonstrators and cleared the building.\n\n* At a rally in October 2023, Professor Russell Rickford praised the October 7 massacre of Jews, saying \"It was exhilarating. It was exhilarating, it was energizing. You would not be human\" not to feel the same. \"I was exhilarated!\" Although Rickford was then suspended, Rickford was back on campus in April 2024, egging on protesters and leading antisemitic chants.\n\n* A Cornell student was arrested in November 2023 for threatening to kill and harm Cornell's Jewish students. Classes were cancelled on November 2, 2023 as a result of stress cause by these threats.\n\n* Cornell pro-Hamas demonstrators set up an illegal encampment in Cornell's Arts Quad in solidarity with the Columbia University pro-Hamas demonstrators, and chanted \"There is only one solution: Intifada revolution\" which calls for the death of the Jewish people. Jewish students also felt that the Cornell encampment itself was an endorsement of the antisemitism at Columbia, and wondered whether it was safe to continue attending Cornell.\n\n* Talia Dror '24, a vice president of Cornellians for Israel explained that \"Jewish students at this campus are not accepted unless they renounce a key part of their identity -- being Zionists.\"\n\n* Alums for Campus Fairness sent a brochure to New York City metro high schools urging Jewish students not to apply to Cornell because Cornell \"is no longer a safe place for Jewish students.\"\n\n* On October 26, 2023, Jewish students had to shelter in the library while pro-Hamas demonstrators banged on the library doors and windows, screaming chants for Israel's annihilation (e.g., \"From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be free.\").\n\n* During a five-day Northwestern University pro-Hamas encampment (illegal occupation) at Northwestern University's Deering Meadow, pro-Hamas demonstrators:\n\n** Called for the murder of Jews, chanting: \"Intifada, Intifada, long live the Intifada.\"\n\n** Confronted and surrounded Jewish or pro-Israel individuals; and \"escorted them\" off the lawn, while chanting: \"Shame on you,\" \"Settlers, settlers go back home\" and \"We don't want no Zionists here.\"\n\n** Formed threatening lines in front of pro-Israel counter-protesters.\n\n** Justified and called for \"resistance\" (a well-known euphemism for terrorism) against Jews, chanting \"Resistance is justified, when people are occupied.\"\n\n** Confronted security guards hired by Northwestern.\n\n** Called for Israel's elimination, chanting \"Free, free Palestine,\" \"From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be free,\" and defaced Northwestern's Jacobs Center by spray-painting \"Free Palestine\" and \"Death 2 Israel\" on the building.\n\n** Established a memorial table to Hamas propagandist Refaat Alareer, who called Hamas' and fellow Gazans' October 7 atrocities \"legitimate and moral' and \"exactly like the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising\" in a BBC interview; and repeatedly wrote on X: \"ALL the rape/sexual violence allegations are lies. Israel uses them as smokescreens to justify the Gaza genocide.\"\n\n* Shamefully, Northwestern's president, provost and student affairs vice president made an agreement appeasing and rewarding the pro-Hamas demonstrators/trespassers, with full ride Palestinian Arab scholarships; new Palestinian Arab faculty posts; a renovated building for Muslim MENA (Middle East and North African) students; disclosure of holdings (which assists pro-Hamas demonstrators' antisemitic divestment efforts); a student conduit to the Board of Trustees Investment Committee (which also assists antisemitic divestment efforts); input into campus dining services and residential and retail vendors which will enable antisemitic groups to harass and try to remove Jewish and pro-Israel vendors and services; and university efforts to prevent the demonstrators from facing the employment consequences of their antisemitic activities. This appeasement (aside from its immorality) will result in even more terror at Northwestern and on other American campuses in the future.\n\n* Two weeks prior to October 7, U Penn hosted an antisemitic, anti-Israel \"Palestine Writes\" (hate) festival, with organizers and speakers who spread anti-Jewish libels and hate; support, honor, incite and celebrate terrorists and the Intifada terror wars against Jews; and defend, praise and even assist designated terrorist organizations, including Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), IHH, the Fatah/PLO Al Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, and other Palestinian Authority terror groups. At least one \"Palestine Writes\" speaker was a convicted terrorist. This hate festival escalated anti-Jewish hatred even before October 7, and was accompanied by the vandalization (twice) of U Penn's Hillel center.\n\n* On April 25, 2024, U Penn, Temple University and Drexel University students set up an illegal \"Gaza Solidarity\" encampment near U Penn. The encampment flew flags of designated terror organization PFLP, and cheered praises for Hamas' military wing the Al Qassam brigades. On April 26, U Penn's interim president ordered the encampment to disband immediately due to university violations, and harassment and intimidation - but the pro-Hamas demonstrators ignored the order.\n\n* Two thousand concerned U Penn students signed a petition calling for U Penn's interim president to follow through on his call to disband the encampment.\n\n* On October 27, 2023 (less than three weeks after October 7), three Jewish students were assaulted at a violent anti-Israel demonstration organized by the Tulane SJP chapter in front of the main gate of Tulane. Two antisemitic men drove through the demonstration in a pickup truck, waving a Palestine flag, and then attempted to set an Israeli flag on fire. When a Jewish student tried to prevent the Israeli flag from burning, a masked antisemite hit the Jewish student in the head with a flagpole. Another anti-Israel demonstrator punched and hit another Jewish student in the head with a megaphone, breaking the Jewish student's nose. Jewish students no longer feel safe at Tulane.\n\n* On May 2, 2024, a group of violent anti-Israel demonstrators approached a Jewish girl standing with an Israeli flag, and refused to back off when the Jewish girl said they were too close. The anti-Israel demonstrators then grabbed the Jewish girl's Israeli flag. When Jews tried to prevent the anti-Israel demonstrators from grabbing the Israeli flag, the anti-Israel demonstrators punched the Jewish president of Students Supporting Israel, Ilan Sinelnikov, in the head three times.\n\n* On Feb. 26, 2024, Bears for Palestine posted a \"call for action\" to incite a riot to stop a planned international law event by Israeli attorney Ran Bar-Yoshafat from going forward. An antisemitic mob of 200 rioters then banged on windows, prevented students from entering the event, broke two windows and a door of the auditorium, chanted \"Intifada\" and \"Free Palestine,\" and yelled \"Jew, Jew, Jew\" and spat in the face of Jewish students attempting to enter the auditorium. The speech did not take place, and the speaker and Jewish students had to be evacuated for their personal safety. In a subsequent letter, Berkeley's Chancelor and Executive VP wrote that it was not possible to both keep students safe and let the event go forward, \"given the size of the crowd and the threat of violence.\" The Wall Street Journal noted that the fault lies as much with the school officials who fail to punish and expel the offenders.\n\n* In April 2024, after Law School Dean Erwin Chemerinsky and his wife, a professor at Berkeley Law, invited students to celebratory graduation dinners in their home, Berkeley Law SJP placed posters throughout the school targeting Chemerinsky, apparently because Chemerinsky is Jewish. The SJP posters contained a Nazi-blood-libel-style cartoon depicting Chemerinsky with bloody lips holding bloody utensils, along with the statement: \"No dinner with Zionist Chem while Gaza starves.\" The Berkeley Law SJP president, who also works for CAIR, came to Chemerinsky's first dinner with mics and 10 collaborators, disrupted the dinner, and refused the dean and his wife's requests to leave their home. Fifteen demonstrators came to the dean's home, chanted offensively and banged drums to disrupt the third dinner.\n\n* In October 2022 (a year prior to Hamas' October 7 atrocities) nine Berkeley Law School student associations, led by SJP, adopted antisemitic bylaws banning any speaker who supports Zionism or Israel from speaking on any subject at the law school.\n\n* On October 24, 2023, GWU's SJP chapter projected statements supporting Hamas in huge capital letters onto the Gelman Library building, including \"GLORY TO OUR MARTYRS\" and \"FREE PALESTINE FROM THE RIVER TO THE SEA.\"\n\n* On April 25, 2024, at a protest organized by SJP, an anti-Israel demonstrator carrying a Palestinian flag also held a sign calling for the \"final solution\" - the Nazi plan to exterminate all Jews.\n\n* Demonstrators established an illegal pro-Hamas encampment in University Yard reaching a peak of about 500 persons on April 25, including demonstrators from Georgetown University. The encampment decreased in size, but demonstrators refused to disband after the university warned that students could face temporary suspension or be administratively barred for refusing to relocate after a 7 p.m. deadline on April 25, 2024. On Friday morning April 26, the D.C. police refused university officials' pleas to clear the encampment. Police did however put metal barricades around the encampment, to prevent others from joining it.\n\n* The pro-Hamas encampment demonstrators chanted \"Free, free Palestine\" and \"Zionism will fall.\" These chants called for the annihilation of Israel and for the destruction of an identity of almost all Jews.\n\n* During the continuing encampment, pro-Hamas demonstrators hoisted a Palestinian flag; wrote \"Zionism is terrorism\" on the street; wrapped a Palestinian flag and keffiyeh onto a statue of George Washington; encircled an anti-abortion protestor, covered his face with keffiyehs and chanted \"Justice is our demand, no peace on stolen land\" (a call for nonstop violence against Israel, despite the fact that Jews did not \"steal\" their own land); chanted \"Glory to the martyrs\" [\"martyrs\" refers to Palestinian Arab terrorists]; hosted a speaker who said that Blacks and anti-Israel groups \"have the same enemy - similar apartheid regimes in Israel and South Africa\"; planted a garden with flags of South Africa, \"Palestine\" and Yemen; chanted \"IOF [Israel \"Occupation\" Forces], KKK, MPD, they're all the same\"; chanted after again hoisting a Palestinian flag, while banging on drums and metal pots: \"Who got the flag up? We got the flag up. Who got the campus? We got the campus. Are you leaving? We're not leaving. Who's winning? We're winning.\"; later chanted \"[GWU President] Granberg in your ivory tower we the students have the power\" and \"Say it clear and say it loud, Gaza you make us proud\"; hosted a speaker who declared: \"We will not rest until we bring President Granberg and the Board of Trustees to their f*cking knees\"; later chanted to more drumbeats: \"Free, free Palestine,\" and \"We will honor all our martyrs,\" and \"From the sea to the river, Palestine will live forever\"; and reiterated that they would stay in the encampment until the university dropped charges against pro-Hamas demonstrators and divested from companies that supply Israel.\n\n* On May 3, 2024, the GWU \"Gaza Solidarity Encampment\" held a \"People's Tribunal,\" in which they charged, found guilty and called for beheading GWU's president, provost and trustees. The demonstrators chanted \"Guillotine! Guillotine! Guillotine!\"\n\n* On May 2, 2024, the GWU provost announced that final exams scheduled to take place in four buildings near the pro-Hamas encampment would be relocated so that students could take the tests in quiet, without disruptions. In addition, on April 25, 2024, the GWU Law School dean sent a video to law students that their final exams would be moved to undisclosed locations to protect their safety.\n\n* The pro-Hamas demonstrators also posted antisemitic signs saying: \"Students will leave [the encampment] when Israelis leave\" and \"Students will go back home when Israelis go back to Europe, US, etc. (their real homes).\"\n\nUnfortunately, the actions described at the above universities are typical of the horrors that Jewish students are enduring at numerous campuses across the country. These actions are reminiscent of the Nazi brown shirts at German universities in the 1930s.\n\nOrganizers, Funders, etc. of Antisemitism on Campus\n\nMust Be Investigated and Held Accountable\n\nSome of the major groups reported to be organizing, funding and instigating violence and threats harming Jewish students include:\n\n* \"Students for Justice in Palestine\" (SJP) a.k.a \"Palestine Solidarity Committee\" (PSC) a.k.a \"Students Against Israeli Apartheid\" (SAIA)\n\n* \"Educators for Justice in Palestine\" (a faculty support group for SJP)\n\n* American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), which funds and helps train SJP\n\n* \"Divestment Coalitions\" consisting of coalitions of many of the groups listed here.\n\n* Code Pink\n\n* \"Within Our Lifetime\" (WOL) (which calls for destroying Israel \"by any means necessary.\"\n\n* Samidoun (a front group for designated terrorist group PFLP)\n\n* US Campaign for Palestinian Rights (USCPR)\n\n* WESPAC (Westchester Peace Action Committee Foundation)\n\n* CAIR (Council on American Islamic Relations)\n\n* The People's Forum, bankrolled by Chinese propagandist & tech mogul Neville Roy Singham\n\n* Arabella Advisors\n\n* Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) and Palestine Legal\n\nFor more information, please see, for instance, \"The NGO Network Orchestrating Antisemitic Incitement on American Campuses,\" NGO Monitor, Apr. 25, 2014 ; and Canary Mission's documentation about hatred and violence that these and similar groups and their leaders are inciting.\n\nCombating Jew-Hatred on Campuses\n\nNeeds to Be a Top Law Enforcement Priority\n\nThe situation described herein is frightening and intolerable and must be addressed. College campuses are meant to be shining citadels that educate our youth with lifelong skills and a love for learning. Our nation cannot afford to have our universities descend into mob-run war zones that foment the oldest and most despicable hatred - antisemitism. Jewish students and faculty in this country should not have to continue enduring violence, threats, disruption, fear and interference with their studies. Non-Jewish studies are likewise victims of the disruptions of their classes, schedules, events and campuses.\n\nWe urge you to make combating Jew-hatred a top priority. Please thoroughly investigate the antisemitic activities, groups and their leaders identified in this letter, who are openly targeting, and promoting and inciting violence against Jews on our campuses. Prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law as supported by the evidence. Monitor these groups and their leaders closely and shut these groups down. Please also produce a full and transparent report on your findings and activities. And use all the tools at your disposal to ensure that American Jewish students and faculty can exist and thrive at our colleges and universities without risk of being targeted for harassment, intimidation or violence.\n\nThank you for your diligent work. Please consider us a resource; we are here to help.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nMorton A.

Checkpoints at UCLA encampment provoked fear, debate among Jews", "body": "Eilon Presman was about 100 feet from the UCLA Palestinian solidarity encampment when he heard the screams: \"Zionist! Zionist!\"\n\nThe 20-year-old junior, who is Israeli, realized the activists were pointing at him.\n\n\"Human chain!\" they cried.\n\nA line of protesters linked arms and marched toward him, Presman said, blocking him from accessing the heart of UCLA's campus. Other activists, he said, unfurled kaffiyeh scarves to block his view of the camp.\n\n\"Every step back that I took, they took a step forward,\" Presman said. \"I was just forced to walk away.\"\n\nIt's been a week since police swarmed the UCLA campus and tore down the pro-Palestinian camp, arresting more than 200 people. But the legacy of the encampment remains an issue of much debate, particularly among Jewish students, who make up nearly 8% of the university's 32,000 undergraduates.\n\nIn the days leading up to April 30 -- when pro-Israel counterprotesters attacked the camp with fists, bats and chemical spray, and police took hours to stop the violence -- frustration had swelled among many Jews: Viral videos showed activists restricting the passage of students they targeted as Zionists.\n\nSome Jewish students said they felt intimidated as protesters scrawled graffiti -- \"Death 2 Zionism\" and \"Baby Killers\" -- on campus buildings and blocked access with wooden pallets, plywood, metal barricades and human walls.\n\nThe pro-Palestinian student movement includes various strains of activism, including calls for a cease-fire in Gaza, support for Hamas and demands that universities divest from firms doing business with Israel. But on campuses across the country, no word has become more charged than \"Zionist.\"\n\nIn its most basic definition, a Zionist is somebody who believes that the Jewish people have a right to statehood in their ancestral homeland as a place of refuge from centuries of persecution -- in other words, that Israel, established as a Jewish state in the wake of the Holocaust, has a right to exist.\n\nUsing that definition, the Anti-Defamation League considers anti-Zionism a form of antisemitism. But protesters -- including many Jews -- draw a sharp distinction, arguing that it is Zionism that fuels Israel's right-wing government and the assault on Gaza that they say amounts to genocide against Palestinians.\n\nSome of the Jewish students who took part in the encampment played a role in excluding Zionists.\n\nMembers of Jewish Voice for Peace at UCLA, a small but rapidly growing group on campus, argue they had a moral responsibility to pressure university officials to divest from Israel.\n\nThe camp and its checkpoints, they said, were not hostile to Jews. Restricting fellow students from entering was just a pragmatic move to protect protesters inside from physical, verbal or emotional abuse.\n\n\"We are committed to keeping each other safe,\" said Agnes Lin, 22, a fourth-year art and art history student and member of Jewish Voice for Peace. Anyone who agreed to the UC Divest Coalition's demands and community guidelines, she said, was welcome.\n\n\"What is not welcome is Zionism,\" she added. \"Or anyone who actively adheres to a very violent, genocidal political ideology that is actively endangering people in Gaza right now.\"\n\nIn practice, students who supported the existence of Israel were kept out -- even if they opposed Israel's right-wing government and its bombardment of Gaza.\n\nSenior Adam Thaw, 21, said activists blocked him and others from accessing a public walkway to Powell Library.\n\nAfter telling him they were not letting anyone through, a male activist eyed his Star of David necklace: \"If you're here to espouse that this is antisemitism, then you can leave.\"\n\n\"Who are you to tell me where I can and cannot go?\" said Thaw, who is on UCLA's student board of Hillel, the largest Jewish campus organization in the world.\n\nAs complaints from Jewish students mounted, UCLA declared the encampment \"unlawful.\" In an April 30 statement, Chancellor Gene Block said most activists had been peaceful, but the tactics of some were \"shocking and shameful.\"\n\n\"Students on their way to class,\" he said, \"have been physically blocked from accessing parts of the campus.\"\n\n::\n\nThe campus was dark and hushed when Sabrina Ellis joined dozens of activists at 4 a.m. to set up the encampment on the lawn of Dickson Court.\n\nAfter pitching tents and erecting barricades of wooden pallets and sheets of plywood, Ellis, a 21-year-old international student from Brazil, took shifts guarding the entrance.\n\nEllis didn't call it a checkpoint. The goal was to exclude and physically block \"agitators\" -- anyone who might be violent, record students or disagree with the cause.\n\n\"Our top priority isn't people's freedom of movement,\" Ellis said. \"It is keeping people in our encampments physically and emotionally safe.\"\n\nThe longtime member of Jewish Voice for Peace -- who wore a large Star of David over her T-shirt and a kaffiyeh wrapped around her shoulders -- said the camp \"was not profiling based on religion.\"\n\nBut as activists blocked Zionist students from public campus space, they faced charges that they engaged in viewpoint discrimination.\n\nBefore allowing anyone in, Ellis said, a protester read the demands of the encampment, which included calling for UC and UCLA to divest all funds from companies \"complicit in the Israeli occupation,\" boycott all connections with Israeli universities, sever ties with the Los Angeles Police Department and demand a permanent cease-fire.\n\nThen, activists ran through their safety guidelines: Ask before taking a photo or video; wear a mask to limit the spread of COVID; do not post identifying information or photos; and no engagement with counterprotesters.\n\nIf students didn't agree, \"we would just kindly tell them that they're not allowed to come in,\" Ellis said.\n\nSome Jewish students were shaken by the experience, arriving at Hillel upset and even crying.\n\n\"They were genuinely going about their day and couldn't get access as protesters asked them, 'Are you a Zionist?' or looked at their necklace,\" said Daniel Gold, executive director of Hillel at UCLA.\n\n::\n\nFor pro-Palestinian activists who are Jewish, the camp was a peaceful space to promote justice, a welcoming interfaith community with therapist-led processing circles and candlelit prayer services.\n\nBlue tarps and blankets were put down in the middle of the lawn for Islamic prayers and a Passover Seder and a Shabbat service.\n\nOn the first evening, about 100 activists, many Jewish, sat in a circle to pray, sing, drink grape juice and eat matzo ball soup, matzo crackers and watermelon.\n\n\"It was really beautiful,\" said Lin, the art major. \"We were trying to hold these spaces to show that Judaism goes beyond Zionism.\"\n\nOther Jewish students were more wary as they navigated the camp.\n\nPresman, who moved to the U.S. when he was 12 and identifies as a Zionist, was alarmed when he scanned the quad on the first day. He saw signs saying \"Israelis are native 2 HELL,\" he said, and banners and graffiti showing inverted red triangles, a symbol used in Hamas propaganda videos to indicate a military target.\n\n\"Do people know what that means?\" he wondered.\n\nTucking his Star of David under his T-shirt, Presman said, he entered and approached activists, introducing himself as an Israeli citizen.\n\n\"Maybe we can find common ground,\" he said, asking, \"one human being to the other?\"\n\nSome students put their hands up, he said, blocking him as they walked away. Others treated the conversation as a joke. One protester, he said, told him that everything Hamas did was justified.\n\nPresman said he had one good conversation: An activist who identified as anti-Zionist admitted not being 100% educated on what Zionism was, but agreed that Israel should exist. They came to the conclusion the activist was a Zionist.\n\nBut most of Presman's exchanges, he said, ended negatively when activists realized he was defending Zionism. He said he was called a \"dirty Jew\" and \"white colonizer.\"\n\nOther students -- even those who did not fully support the encampment -- said they did not experience such slurs.\n\nRachel Burnett, a senior who described herself as a non-Zionist Jew, disagreed with the call for divestment and academic boycotts, especially of UCLA's Nazarian Center, an educational center for the study of Israeli history, politics and culture.\n\nEntering the camp after a classmate vouched for her, Burnett was disturbed by anti-Israeli signs and graffiti that named Abu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the military wing of Hamas. But she also bonded with protesters, including a woman in a hijab.\n\n\"Of course, some protesters deny Oct. 7 or condone violence as long as it can be put under the guise of decolonial resistance, which is obviously horrific,\" Burnett said. \"But that's not the case of many students inside the encampment.\"\n\nBurnett contrasted what she saw as a peaceful, friendly mood inside the camp with the pro-Israel counterprotests where people held up benign slogans, such as \"Bring the Hostages Home,\" but engaged in hostile behavior.\n\nAs counterprotesters converged for a Sunday rally, she said, a pro-Israel activist spat on her and told she should have been slaughtered in the kibbutzim on Oct. 7.\n\nJust as some pro-Palestinian activists demonized all Zionists as evil and pro-genocide -- ignoring the wide range of viewpoints within the Zionist community -- Burnett thought some pro-Israel counterprotesters were dehumanizing student activists in the encampment and spreading a \"mass hysteria narrative.\"\n\nAs the encampment expanded -- and organizers set up entrance points near Royce Hall and Powell Library -- some Jewish students took videos that swiftly went viral.\n\n\"It's time to go,\" a protester wearing a yellow safety vest and kaffiyeh told a student in one video as he guarded an entrance near Powell Library. \"You don't have a wristband.\"", "source": {"uri":

But there I was with established reporters, sectioned off from rows of tents by manila rope and Columbia student \"press liaisons.\"\n\nIt was April 22 when I first found myself at the Columbia Gaza Solidarity Encampment, on what began an unbelievable two weeks covering the protests and arrests in New York City. Walking around Columbia, I looked more like a protester than a journalist. Several networks approached me for interviews and a student gave me her friend's matcha to hold while she spoke to a reporter.\n\nLargely because of my age, I was privileged to hear student protesters' unfiltered passion, instead of the defensive stance elicited by more skeptical senior reporters often looking for an angle with shock value. One of the first questions I heard another reporter ask was, \"Are you hiding members of Hamas in the encampment?\"\n\nThe students, predominantly 18- to 22-year-old women, many from Barnard, spent days eating, sleeping, and organizing at the encampment. Every half hour, students shared updates over a speaker like they were at summer camp. They encouraged their fellow protesters to wear \"allergy armbands\" to prevent a potential medical event at the food and supplies tables. They reminded each other to drink water and use electrolyte packets, which -- along with sandwich wraps, Benadryl, toothbrushes, blankets, and other goods -- were donated by faculty, community members and other students.\n\nLooking around the campsite, I saw students from all backgrounds sitting and eating together, making signs, and escaping the sun in their tents. I noted the many \"Jews for Free Palestine\" signs displayed at the encampment and a whiteboard with that day's programming announcing a 6 p.m. Seder. Several of the student spokespeople for the encampment were Jewish, and stressed to me that this was a diverse, interfaith movement, despite what one might see in mainstream media coverage.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge the real instances of antisemitism that occurred in and around Columbia's campus. One video in particular shows a protester holding up a sign to pro-Israeli demonstrators that read \"Al-Qasam's Next Targets.\" It's unclear whether the perpetrator was affiliated with Columbia University; nevertheless, this and other documented incidents are clearly unacceptable. However, if you are only watching the same four clips of these incidents amplified by mainstream and social media, you aren't getting the full story.\n\nThe media likes to focus heavily on extremist fringes and the specific missteps of student movements or individuals. Protests movements are complicated and messy, in 1968 or 2024. After visiting the encampment and speaking to students, I've come away with a much clearer picture of the goals and behavior I believe defined the majority of protesters at the Columbia encampment.\n\nStudents spoke to me about the sense of community and love they felt among the tents. \"Please eat, reserve your energy, stay hydrated\" one student urged over the mic, to which 50 or so students yelled back \"Thank you!\" I walked by a student's tent with a sign offering free tutoring to her peers. Students set up a library at the encampment and walked around handing out cold cloths to anyone who was overheating.\n\nDalia, a Palestinian freshman at Columbia, explained that her peers were more \"united\" than ever and overwhelmingly supported university divestment from companies with Israeli ties (76.55%). \"As a Palestinian, and just as anyone of moral consciousness, we have a commitment to use the privilege of being at this Ivy League university as our platform.\" One Barnard junior, who wished to remain anonymous, shared, \"I think a lot of people try to put us in two camps: antizionist and Zionist, but I don't believe that that's accurate...It's not about the other students on campus, it's about the people who are dying in Gaza.\"\n\nStudents talked about the gruesome images from Gaza that flooded their phones on a minute by minute basis. Sofia, a Columbia senior, called it the \"first live streamed genocide.\" The \"moment calls us\" a second anonymous student told me. After spending years in school learning about colonialism and American protest movements, and then watching horrific bloodshed on social media every day for the past seven months, it should be no surprise that these students felt \"called.\"\n\nThe protesters who took over Columbia's Hamilton Hall renamed the building Hind's Hall after Hind Rajab, the 6-year-old Palestinian girl trapped in a car with her dead family members, all of whom were shot by the IDF. She begged the Red Crescent for help over the phone. Twelve days later, she and the Red Crescent paramedics who'd come to her aid were found dead, with evidence of \"direct fire munition\" from the IDF.\n\nJust one day after the arrests at Hamilton Hall and the NYPD shutdown of campus, students and protesters gathered outside the building and projected on it in enormous, bright lights: \"Hind's Hall Forever.\" Despite arrests, suspensions, and doxing, these students remained steadfastly committed to each other and to their cause. I saw these young people for what they were: complex, passionate, loving and committed.\n\nThey are shouting at us whatever the cost. We will all hear them sooner or later.", "source": {"uri": "ctmirror.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The CT Mirror"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Together we can repair our campus.\"\n\nColumbia has been a hotbed of pro-Palestine demonstrations in recent weeks -- so much so that the NYPD had to go in last week and clear out the massive tent encampment and root out protesters who occupied historic Hamilton Hall.\n\nThe student letter highlighted a number of antisemitic incidents that allegedly stemmed from those protests -- which eventually led the school to cancel its spring university-wide commencement.\n\nJewish students felt \"helpless\" when they saw students and faculty block them from entering shared portions of the campus, the letter said.\n\n\"We know all too well that antisemitism is shapeshifting,\" the letter read. \"The silence is familiar.

After speaking with Jewish students, Wood said Jewish students wanted a space where people \"understand them, care about them and are rooting for them to succeed.\"\n\n\"Our goal is that we will be a choice institution for students across the world, and particularly across the country who identify as Jewish and want to learn more about Jewish life and culture,\" Wood said.\n\nCreating an affinity center, which studies show have been beneficial for underrepresented students, came to mind.\n\n\"I think this will provide a face to our community,\" Baptiste said. \"This will provide a human face to connect with Jewish identity and not just a mysterious entity. We are actually people who exist, who have a community.\"\n\nAdditionally, Wood said Sacramento State planned to provide training on antisemitism for faculty and staff, kosher food options and a recruitment initiative to increase the Jewish student population on campus.\n\nA safe space for Jewish students is needed amid a steep rise in antisemitic hate crimes, said Rachel Darling, executive director of Hillel house.\n\n\"Jewish students are seeking out community and wanting a space where they can safely celebrate their Jewish heritage,\" Darling said. \"Having a safe haven for Jewish students to come together, to build community and celebrate their Jewish identity is so important.\"\n\nThe opening also came a day after President Joe Biden, speaking during a ceremony to remember victims of the Holocaust, decried the \"ferocious surge\" in violence and hateful rhetoric on college campuses and around the globe since Hamas attacked Israel and triggered a war in Gaza.\n\nWithin the center Wednesday, photos of Israeli hostages, were laid upon a table underneath an Israeli flag. Over 100 hostages have been unaccounted for. The flyers read \"bring them home.\"\n\nThe center's opening -- happening hours after the university announced an agreement with pro-Palestinian protesters to investigate and divest from its Israel-tied investments -- may have seemed like a juxtaposition to the encampment across campus.\n\nCountering an atmosphere where people seem to be \"moving away from open dialogue,\" Wood aimed to meet the moment with optimism -- Sacramento State, he said, should be a place where \"open conversations\" can unlock understanding, acceptance and a path forward.\n\n\"We want to go and be something that's different. Where other campus communities may vilify, we want to unify,\" Wood said. \"For other campus communities who want sow seeds of discord, we want to sow seeds of truth and understanding.\"\n\nMichael Berbach, a fourth-year computer science major, said the Jewish community is multifaceted. Individuals have different belief systems and isn't a monolith. He said with the opening of the center, there is a renewed sense of belonging.\n\n\"There wasn't really an opportunity to get to know the community here on campus before,\" Berbach said.\n\nThe Jewish Life and Resource Center joins 10 other affinity and equity centers on campus, including the Asian Pacific Islander Desi American Center for students of Asian descent, the Esak'tim\u00e1 Center for Native American and Indigenous students, the MLK Center for Black and African American students, the PRIDE Center for LGBTQ students and the Veteran's Success Center.", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com",

Her framing of the protests as antisemitic riots dominated the interview, as she pressed the Mayor on \"the calls that are being made on campus against Jewish students, against Zionism, against Israel.\" Adams embraced the premise without apparent reservation. \"I've never witnessed, during my time, this type of protests, where you saw such a high level of normalizing antisemitism, celebrating a terrorist organization like Hamas -- that is not who we are,\" he said.\n\nFor weeks, as protesters have gathered in encampments at American colleges, the Israeli media has routinely described the demonstrators as \"pro-Hamas,\" as \"antisemitic,\" and as \"rioters.\" (A leading news site for the ultra-Orthodox, not content to pick one adjective, recently reported the arrest of \"twenty pro-Palestinian, Hamas supporting, anti-Semitic protesters.\") The tone is often both outraged and strangely mocking; the protesters are portrayed as dangerous Hamas apologists and also as yoga-loving, easily triggered Gen Z-ers who couldn't find Palestine on a map. An article in the financial newspaper Globes dismissed the unrest as manufactured, declaring, \"The anti-Semitic demonstrations on U.S. campuses, which include violence against Jewish students, incitement to genocide, justification of rape, and severe harassment, are not a spontaneous protest.\" The popular news site Ynet began a report on the occupied hall at Columbia with a litany of threats: \"Hammers, knives, gas masks, ropes.\"\n\nThis Sunday, on the eve of Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seemed to compare the pro-Palestinian protests to Kristallnacht -- the hideous night in 1938 when antisemitic mobs set upon Jews across the German Reich. It is no surprise to hear Netanyahu deploy this kind of inflamed rhetoric; it serves his political interests to turn the world's attention away from his policies and toward the protesters. It is more surprising that moderate Israelis have adopted this view of the protests. \"What's happening on American college campuses is unforgivable,\" Yair Lapid, Israel's opposition leader, wrote on X two weeks ago, as the protests intensified. \"It is antisemitism, it is support for terrorism, it is support for Hamas which murders LGBT people and oppresses women.\" This kind of binary view is perilous. It fails to acknowledge an essential problem: Israel's leadership, the most extreme right-wing government in the country's history, is prosecuting an unwinnable war that has overwhelmingly claimed the lives of women and children, while laying waste to their land.\n\nTo be sure, some of the protesters do use antisemitic language. Columbia recently barred Khymani James, a leader of the pro-Palestine movement, from campus after reports came out that he had told administrators to \"be grateful that I'm not just going out and murdering Zionists.\" Videos show demonstrators at Columbia forming a human chain to drive out people whom they referred to as Zionists. And some members of the movement openly support Hamas. (Near the university, one was caught yelling \"We are Hamas!\" at a young man who was draped in an Israeli flag and wearing a yarmulke.) Some protest leaders have refused to condemn Hamas for the atrocities of October 7th, when it killed roughly twelve hundred Israelis and took about two hundred and fifty hostages, in the deadliest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust. In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, more than thirty student groups at Harvard endorsed a statement that held Israel \"entirely responsible for all the unfolding violence.\" The Columbia chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine, along with the activist group Columbia Jewish Voice for Peace, praised Hamas gunmen for a \"counter-offensive against their settler-colonial oppressor.\"\n\nYet these abhorrent statements should not distract from the campus protesters' basic moral assertion. Since October 7th, Israeli forces in Gaza have killed more than thirty-four thousand people. On Tuesday, Israel sent tanks into the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million displaced Gazans have been sheltering, and ordered a hundred thousand of them to evacuate. The protesters are calling for a ceasefire and for an end to the killing of innocents. Their rhetoric can be alarming, as when they suggest that the founding of Israel was inherently sinful and that Israelis should therefore -- what, exactly? Vanish? But protests are designed to provoke, to shock bystanders out of complacency. It is self-defeating to suggest that the only way to engage with them is by force.\n\nAlready, the schism between young American Jews and Israel is widening. When the Israeli media paint all campus protesters, some of whom are Jewish, as Hamas apologists, it risks making this gap insurmountable. The students are demanding that their universities divest from investments tied to Israel -- placing it alongside apartheid-era South Africa and Darfur, two other places from which American universities have divested. Even if administrators decline to accept these demands, Israeli academics are already facing an unprecedented boycott, while the country's cultural institutions are being shunned overseas.\n\nIsrael, then, is at risk of losing crucial strategic alliances. President Biden, far more than other world leaders, has maintained steadfast support for Israel, but there are signs that even that is beginning to fray. Last week, he halted a shipment of more than three thousand bombs to Israel amid growing concerns over its conduct in the war. Unless Israel replaces its government and reverses course, it may become a global pariah.\n\nBut Israel's politicians, and its mainstream media, are not reckoning with these shifts. Every aspect of civic life, including the economy, is subordinated to the war. On Tuesday, there were reports that Israel's far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, had repeatedly refused to meet with Netanyahu to discuss how to bring down soaring prices in the country. Smotrich reportedly explained that he was trying to force Netanyahu to expand the military's advance in Gaza: \"First, we need to enter Rafah and then take care of fuel prices.\" (Smotrich denied the reports.) Israel launched its incursion into Rafah later that day.\n\nIsraeli newscasts now have a customary slogan emblazoned at the top of the screen: \"Together We Will Win.\" The media are full of stories re\u00ebxamining the October 7th attacks: the attackers' brutality; the defiance and displacement in their wake; the survivors, the uprooted, the widows and orphans. Bearing witness to the attacks is urgently necessary. So is depicting, honestly and transparently, the acts of Israeli forces in Gaza and of Jewish settlers in the West Bank -- to \"look the occupation in the eyes,\" as a motto of the peace movement has it. No Israeli leader has yet spoken out persuasively about the trauma of Palestinians or voiced genuine concern for their lives. The answer to the images of babies being pulled from the rubble in Gaza, their hair gray with dust and their eyes wild with fear, cannot be \"What about October 7th?\"\n\nWhen the war is shown on Israeli news, it is often from the point of view of Israeli soldiers -- at times literally, in the form of combat footage from their helmet-mounted cameras. (Haaretz, which, along with +972 Magazine, has produced admirable reporting on the Palestinian side of the conflict, is often called treasonous by the government's supporters.) Or else it is folded into stories about how Israel is, in the words of Donald Trump, \"losing the P.R. war.\" The common gripe in Israel is that we have a failure of hasbara, or media relations. It is as if the vast number of Gazan casualties, the famine spreading in the northern Strip, and the government's refusal to discuss an exit strategy were a mere inconvenience, a situation that would resolve itself if only we Israelis were given a platform to explain ourselves.", "source": {"uri": "newyorker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Yorker"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The website where the letter is posted updates new signatories and has a financial contribution ticker at the bottom, which at the time of publishing, reads: $68,354,601 financial contributions at risk. Just hours earlier, the number was around $41m.\n\nIn the letter, the signatories demand divestment from \"all companies and institutions that fund or profit from Israeli apartheid, genocide, and occupation in Palestine\", the release of a statement calling for a permanent ceasefire, and that all charges against student activists are dropped.\n\nThe signatories also demanded the university finance the healthcare needed for the students \"brutalized by the NYPD on April 30, 2024\" and the removal of Shafik from her position as university president.\n\nWithin the context of the months-long Gaza solidarity protests and encampments at US universities, Columbia University has faced some of the most extreme measures, with law enforcement forcefully entering parts of the campus, tearing down encampments and assaulting protesters.\n\n\"Students - who paid $1.53 billion in tuition last year alone - are rightfully demanding that they have a say in where that money goes. We are in full support of Columbia University divesting from Israel, and we are beyond appalled at how far University administration has gone to protect their investments at the expense of student safety and intellectual inquiry,\" the letter reads.\n\nThe letter reminds the administration that the student body \"overwhelmingly\" passed a divestment resolution earlier this year with over 70 percent of voter support, and how the university has a history of protests reaching back to Apartheid-era South Africa and the Vietnam War.\n\nThe alumni initiative isn't the first or only such initiative to pressure universities in the US with alumni contributions. At New York University earlier this year, hundreds of alumni pledged to withhold more than $3m worth of potential contributions from the institution's largest fundraising day over its suppression of students and faculty organising against what they called Israel's \"genocide\" in Gaza.\n\n\"We launched this campaign as a signal to the administration to drop its repression on campus,\" a spokesperson for NYU Alumni for Palestine told Middle East Eye in a previous article.\n\n\"We will hold [NYU President Linda Mills] accountable through public, financial, and other pressures until we see that all suppressions are dropped and all individuals who have been terminated or expelled are reinstated,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe Columbia alumni letter concludes with: \"The University must now act boldly in support of Palestinian life and liberation - a sentiment echoed throughout Columbia's own Core Curriculum, scholarship, and purported values. Anything less is a betrayal of the core lessons we were taught at Columbia University.\"\n\nMiddle East Eye revealed earlier this week through testimony from several witnesses that the New York Police Department assaulted a number of students and then blocked those injured students from accessing medical assistance at two New York university campuses where hundreds were part of Gaza solidarity encampments.\n\nEvidence of police violence emerged after university administrators ordered a sweep on the evening of 30 April local time at two New York City campuses, Columbia University and City College of New York (CCNY), in what has now become a nationwide story of police repression of student protests for Palestine.\n\nAt CCNY in West Harlem, students were sprayed with mace and pepper spray. Others were beaten with batons and were tackled to the ground. Student protesters suffered burns, broken bones, concussions and broken teeth.\n\nOne medic, who asked not to be named, told Middle East Eye for an earlier article that police blocked them from offering assistance to the injured.\n\nA notoriously violent counter-terror battalion of the NYPD, padded in riot gear and known as the Special Response Group (SRG), entered the campuses and beat protesters.\n\nThe SRG's role in the disbanding of student protests at Columbia and CCNY is likely to raise eyebrows, given that it came just days before City Hall was to hold a hearing about breaking up the unit.\n\n\"Established in 2015, the unit is known for its misconduct, racial bias, and abuse of protesters. Initially created for counter-terrorism, the SRG quickly morphed into the violent protest policing unit it is today,\" the New York Civil Liberties Union said in 2023.\n\nAt CCNY, a college associated with the City University of New York (Cuny), the largest urban public university in the country, the SRG were sent to the campus to raid and dismantle the encampment after the college's president, Vincent Boudreau, declared a state of emergency.\n\nIn response to the violence last week, Cuny's pre-law clinic released a statement on Sunday in which it described the police action as \"unrelentless violence, with chemical irritants being aimlessly sprayed, people being tasered while handcuffed, elderly women being hit with batons, hundreds of people being 'kettled' and pressed against store fronts and scaffolding ... Muslim women having their hijabs ripped from their hair, a Jewish man had their kippa knocked off their head, and over 170 arrests were made by NYPD and the Goon Squad, to name a few,\" the statement read.\n\n\"There was literal blood and broken teeth on the ground,\" said the statement.", "source": {"uri": "middleeasteye.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Middle East Eye"}, "authors": [],

We reject the ways that these encampments have been smeared as antisemitic and we call on our institutions to take action to stop Israel's assault on Gaza.\n\nIn the last week, we have watched the movement of student encampments for Gaza spread across the country. We have also watched as these protesters have been met with repression, arrests, violence, and false claims of antisemitism. As Jewish students, we wholeheartedly reject the claim that these encampments are antisemitic and that they are an inherent threat to Jewish student safety. We believe that safety for Jewish students can only come when all students are safe, including Palestinian students, BIPOC students, and queer and trans students.\n\nWhile journalists, students, and even police have consistently reported encampments to be peaceful, school administrations and city officials have intentionally and consistently escalated through state violence. Their tactics have included arresting and brutalizing students, and denying students access to housing, medical care, and religious spaces. The majority of these acts have targeted Arab, Muslim, Black, and brown students. This violence we've seen this week does not make any of us safer. We wholeheartedly condemn the brutal repression of the encampments.\n\nSince October 7th, many of us have shown up to fight for Palestinian liberation as Jews: Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Mizrahi, practicing, secular, and everything in between. Many of us have friends and relatives who were killed on October 7th. Many of us have faced violence, arrest, and harassment for our participation in the movement for a Free Palestine.\n\nThe narrative that the Gaza solidarity encampments are inherently antisemitic is part of a decades-long effort to blur the lines between criticism of Israel and antisemitism. It is a narrative that ignores the large populations of Jewish students participating and helping to lead the encampments as a true expression of our Jewish values. The beautiful interfaith solidarity by Jewish students observing Passover seders and Shabbat at encampments across the country show that the rich Jewish tradition of justice is on full display inside the encampments. The denial of Jewish participation in this movement is not only incorrect, but it is an insidious attempt to justify unfounded claims of antisemitism. As neo-Nazis are marching in the streets and fascist politicians are campaigning on the antisemitic Great Replacement theory, we wholeheartedly reject the lie that these student activists are targeting Jewish students in their protest.\n\nWe are deeply disturbed by the small number of individuals who have attempted to co-opt these encampments to spread violent, hateful, and antisemitic messages. However, we refuse to allow these administrations to use the safety of Jewish students as political cover for their violent reactions to peaceful protest. We commend the student organizers for keeping to their values of peaceful, powerful protest.\n\nWhile the world's focus is on students, we cannot forget that Israel is continuing its genocidal assault on Gaza. More than 34,000 Palestinians and 1,200 Israelis have been killed since October 7th. Israel has killed more than 14,000 children and destroyed schools, hospitals, and all institutions of higher learning in Gaza. The Israeli government has done nothing to return the remaining 133 hostages to their families as they continue to hold thousands of Palestinian prisoners without charge. Instead, Netanyahu's far right-wing coalition -- backed by the Biden administration -- has chosen to escalate the war, destruction, and loss of life. In the West Bank, full villages are being depopulated after months of settler terrorism, backed by the state. While we protest on campuses in the U.S., more than 80% of schools in Gaza have been decimated by Israeli bombs, amounting to what scholars regard as 'scholasticide.' The devastation is unfathomable, and it is truly heinous to see individuals attempting to demonize student peace activists in our name as Israel continues to massacre Gazans, massacres that our educational institutions are complicit in through their investments and repression.\n\nWe as Jewish students demand divestment from Israel and an academic boycott of all Israeli educational institutions contributing to the Israeli military assault on Gaza or protection of settlers in the West Bank. We also demand amnesty for all nonviolent student protesters and an end to the brutal repression by academic institutions and law enforcement. Finally, we demand that academic and political leaders stop misrepresenting and demonizing protests and their organizers, protect the voices of student activists, and take immediate action to stop Israel's genocidal acts before more Palestinians are killed.", "source": {"uri": "forward.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Forward"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sephardic_Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sephardic Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizrahi_Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mizrahi Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Israeli_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criticism of the Israeli government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Jews", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ashkenazi Jews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover_Seder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passover Seder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shabbat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secularism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massacre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massacre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Judaism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Judaism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://forward.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2151223018.jpg?_t=1715200163", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546389", "eventUri": "eng-9546389", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 1392, "textEnd": 1403, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

If Columbia had been faced with a campus uprising of religious conservatives upset because they view abortion as a tragic genocide, we have no doubt that the university's response would have been profoundly different,\" the letter stated. \"By favoring certain viewpoints over others based on their popularity and acceptance in certain circles, Columbia has failed as a legitimate, never mind elite, institution of higher education.\"\n\nAdditionally, the letter contended that \"both professors and administrators are on the front lines of the campus disruptions, encouraging the virulent spread of antisemitism and bigotry ...

The protesters eventually moved to Bruin Plaza, where there were as many as 200 attendees.\n\nAdditionally, UCPD Patrol Division Lieutenant Richard Davis told The Daily Bruin that after initially stopping them over possible curfew violations, the individuals in question refused to show student identification.

Both The Bruin and The Times reported that those arrested were pro-Palestinian protesters; one student claimed to the Times that the detained protesters were \"dropping off supplies for the sit-in.\"\n\nJewish Woman Assaulted by Pro-Palestinian Protesters at UCLA During Pro-Israel Rally Speaks Out\n\nA young Jewish woman who was assaulted by pro-Palestinian protesters at UCLA during a pro-Israel rally on April 28 opened up about the incident in an interview with NBC Los Angeles.\n\nThe woman identified herself as being Eleanor, a student at Pierce College in Woodland Hills. Eleanor explained that the assault occurred when she attempted to pick up an Israeli flag that her sister dropped. \"I'm going down to get it, it's being kicked and stepped on, and then I'm being kicked and stepped on,\" she said. Her mother told the outlet that \"they kicked her back and her head slammed [on] the ground, and for a minute I thought, 'That's it.

The fellows also participate in trips and events such as Shabbatons.\n\nGet New Jersey Jewish News's Newsletter by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\nIn addition, they work in groups, both in class and independently, to create projects they can implement on their future campuses to address issues they examined.\n\n\"When they came to speak to us at MMY to recruit fellows, I was really interested,\" Ms. Koenig said.\n\n\"I wanted to be well prepared to go to Barnard next year with the facts on the Israel-Palestinian situation. I liked the idea of being in an environment of other students who will be on American campuses next year after a gap year in Israel. And Nitzavim has great speakers and business mentors and a community I can reach out to for support.\"\n\nShe said that she also feels supported by the promise of alumni campus visits by Rabbi Adi Isaacs, director for the past 12 years of Jewish Year Abroad, the independent, privately funded nonprofit organization that runs Nitzavim Fellowship and other supplemental gap-year programs.\n\n\"I have never been so horrified by antisemitic sentiments on college campuses,\" Rabbi Isaacs wrote in a recent social-media post. \"I speak to many students on campus, and one student shared that she has been a very active voice for the Jewish community on campus and received tremendous backlash. She was shaken up by personal threats as well as calls on her campus to globalize the intifada.\n\n\"While it's scary and difficult to hear, this very threat is what makes our mission at Jewish Year Abroad more important than ever. I am proud to be a part of creating Jewish student leaders on college campuses who will stand up against antisemitism and spread the light about Israel and Judaism.\"\n\nThe program's students from North Jersey and MetroWest this year are Alexandra Nadritch, Oran Goodman, Jonah Siegler, Jessie Horowitz, and Emma Susman of Englewood; Shira Kaplan of Teaneck; and Eitan Bitansky of Springfield. Netanya Greiff, Nitzavim Fellowship's director, made aliyah from West Caldwell three years ago.\n\n\"This is the third year of the program, and obviously it's more relevant than ever,\" Ms. Greiff said.\n\n\"This year we've paired each group with a student mentor who participated in Nitzavim and now is on the campus they're going to next year. This mentor can give them the inside scoop about what will or will not work on their campus. The other new aspect is that we are pairing the project groups with professional mentors, who can give them critical feedback from a business perspective.\"\n\nLike startup entrepreneurs, the fellows work with their business mentors to articulate their mission, vision, and values statement; conduct market research; and build an implementation plan including branding and design elements.\n\nMs. Koenig and two other Barnard-bound fellows are working with mentor Danielle Renov, the \"Peas, Love & Carrots\" food blogger, on their \"Chicken Soup for the Soul\" project, which would enable any Jewish Columbia/Barnard student to receive homemade chicken soup when they're feeling under the weather. \"We'll deliver it along with a card explaining the Jewish value of visiting the sick,\" Ms. Koenig said.\n\nShe said that the Nitzavim sessions on public speaking and programming have provided her with \"skills that will come in handy as I expect to have a role in the campus Jewish community.\n\n\"A lot of speakers talked about how to handle hostility on campus. It's for sure overwhelming to see what's going on, but the Jewish community at Columbia seems really strong, and hopefully they will stick together as a strong communal force.\"\n\nMs. Kaplan, 18, a Ma'ayanot graduate now studying at Stella K. Abraham Beit Midrash in Migdal Oz, plans to go to Brandeis next year.\n\n\"We've gotten a lot of education on common misconceptions about Israel we might hear on campus, and how to respond,\" she said. \"For example, we talked about the security barrier, which is often called the 'apartheid wall,' and learned why Israel implemented it in the first place.\n\n\"I also learned that some people are not worth getting into a conversation with, and we should just walk away. We can judge the situation by the tone of their voice and whether they are actually listening or just repeating the same thing over and over.\"\n\nMs. Kaplan already had a good grounding in these issues; she'd participated for four school years in the Jewish Federation of Northern New Jersey's five-session iCan LEAP leadership program, which prepares high school students for opportunities and challenges ahead.\n\n\"The project I'm working on to help the Brandeis Jewish community is about fostering interfaith dialogue,\" she said. \"Jewish communities tend to isolate themselves, and we need to encounter people of different religions and backgrounds. This actually can help Israel's cause.\"\n\nMr. Bitansky, an 18-year-old Kushner graduate studying at Yeshivat Migdal HaTorah in Modi'in, had intended to go to the University of Maryland in the fall. However, during his gap year he decided to make aliyah and now plans to serve in the IDF.\n\nBut he's still working with other fellows heading to the University of Maryland on the details of a project focused on shared Shabbat meals as a means of \"bridging different types of Jews, from very religious to nonaffiliated, and try to get them to become more of a cohesive community on campus.\"\n\nMr. Bitansky said he learned in Nitzavim that the overwhelming majority of Jewish college students are unaffiliated.\n\nHe anticipates that the skills and information he's gaining through the fellowship will be useful even though he's not going to college in the United States.\n\n\"In general, we learned to work with others and create and implement an idea,\" he said. \"Even in Israel, there is a lot of strife between Jewish communities, and we have to think about how to solve those issues.\"\n\nMs. Greiff said that the Nitzavim Fellowship program will not end in June; the fellows will have the opportunity to attend a summer session to further hone their preparedness for the campus experience.\n\nThe 80 fellows are heading to 25 different schools, many of them at the forefront of pro-Palestinian protests. Eleven of them are going to the University of Maryland, 11 to SUNY Binghamton, and nine to New York University.\n\nThe other schools are Barnard, Case Western Reserve, City College of New York, Columbia, Cooper Union, George Washington, Macaulay Honors College (CUNY), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Nottingham Trent (in England), Old Dominion, Princeton, Queens College, Rutgers, Tulane, University of Chicago, University of Michigan, University of Pennsylvania, Vanderbilt, Washington University in St. Louis, and Yale.", "source": {"uri": "njjewishnews.timesofisrael.com",

Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law and ADL (the Anti-Defamation League) today announced they have filed complaints with the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights against two California colleges -- Occidental and Pomona -- for permitting severe discrimination and harassment of Jewish students in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Arnold & Porter joined the Brandeis Center and ADL in the filing against Pomona College.\n\nSince 10/7, Jewish and Israeli students on both campuses have been verbally harassed and physically surrounded, followed, threatened, and intimidated by protestors. They have been shouted at, told to \"go back to the gas chambers,\" and called \"kike,\" \"f**king Jew,\" \"f**king Zionist,\" and \"murderer.\" Many have been obstructed from moving freely about campus and cannot carry out their jobs or partake in educational opportunities as a result of anti-Semitic bullying, and some have even been physically assaulted. Many Jewish students confine themselves to their dorm rooms or refrain from participating in certain educational and/or extracurricular activities, avoiding certain dining halls or caf\u00e9s, common areas on campus, and campus events to avoid anti-Semitic harassment. Several have transferred to other schools due to persistent anti-Semitism.\n\n\"Jewish students on these campuses are hiding in their dorms and avoiding their own campus rather than risk verbal and physical attacks,\" stated Kenneth L. Marcus, founder and chairman of the Brandeis Center and the former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education for Civil Rights. \"Pomona and Occidental know full well this is happening. But instead of enforcing the law and their own policies, they are caving to the anti-Semitic mob and letting them bully, harass, and intimidate Jewish students. Anti-Semitism left unaddressed will not go away. It will only snowball and escalate until the problem is faced head on as the law requires.\"\n\n\"There's simply no excuse for the persistent and pervasive antisemitic harassment being faced by Jewish students at Occidental and Pomona colleges,\" said Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO and National Director. \"No student should be forced to transfer due to continual harassment. We urge the U.S. Department of Education to investigate these schools for potential civil rights violations and to take effective measures to protect Jewish students on these campuses.\"\n\nOccidental College\n\nOccidental is fully aware of the pervasive and hostile environment for Jewish students, and has ignored and enabled it.\n\nThe complaint details how Jewish students were forced out of school-sponsored employment opportunities due to severe and pervasive anti-Semitic environments. Many Jewish students chose to leave their jobs rather than continue to subject themselves to anti-Semitic attacks, Holocaust inversion, and harassment while others chose to take unsafe routes home rather than continue to be harassed.\n\nAt every turn, Occidental has put its Jewish students last, swiftly enforcing policies against its Jewish students while continuing to ignore the same or similar violations from the anti-Israel and anti-Semitic crowd. Jewish students are harassed and obstructed daily on campus, in their dorms, in the dining hall, and more. One particularly egregious incident occurred when anti-Semitic protests occupied and vandalized the central administrative building for nearly a week. Despite several warnings to the trespassing students and staff, Occidental forwent enforcing school policies and instead capitulated to the occupiers' demands. Occidental sent a clear message - when the victims of violations are Jewish, the rules will not be enforced.\n\nFaculty at Occidental have also played a role in encouraging the anti-Semitic environment. One professor told her students she felt \"invigorated\" by the Hamas terrorist attack and encouraged students to share her excitement. Others have participated in pro-Hamas chanting and made anti-Semitic statements. More than 60 faculty members sent an email denying that Hamas' actions were terrorism. The school has said nothing to condemn these anti-Semitic declarations, sending a green light to students that this behavior is permitted.\n\nPomona College\n\nThe already hostile environment for Jewish students at Pomona took a turn for the worse immediately following the October 7 terrorist attack with various student groups and members of the faculty loudly supporting the murderous Hamas attacks, blaming the Israeli victims, and creating a shrine honoring the Hamas terrorists. Pomona students blocked access to buildings, interfered with classes and school events, and harassed current and prospective students. At first, the Pomona administration did very little to remedy the hostile environment. But as the situation deteriorated, President G. Gabrielle Starr eventually began to respond. But despite her laudable, albeit belated efforts to address growing antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment on campus, Pomona failed to eliminate the hostile environment, in part, because the opposition from pro-Hamas students and faculty had already grown too strong.\n\nMultiple incidents of physical violence and intimidation occurred during the numerous explicitly pro-Hamas protests that took place at Pomona. For example, during one demonstration, protestors surrounded Jewish students who were putting up posters of hostages, physically preventing them from hanging the posters. The protestors then followed the Jewish students and a Jewish adult staff member, obstructed their paths, verbally harassed them, and tore up at least 300 of the Jewish students' pre-approved flyers. Later that day a protestor saw one of the Jewish students and aggressively pushed him into a wall. The Jewish student was then tailed by other protestors who threatened and intimidated him. The school has taken no action and school security has even refused to watch security footage of the protest incident. Most Jewish students sheltered in in their dorms or left campus entirely for their safety, missing classes to avoid the physically hostile demonstrators.\n\nAnother protest was so disruptive, including loud antisemitic chants and the blocking of entrances, forcing President Starr to cancel her Family Weekend Address. During another protest, when a student tried to move past the demonstrators to attend the Harry Potter Dinner, an annual Pomona tradition, the demonstrators blocked and grabbed him. Protestors have also disrupted and harassed prospective student tours to such a degree that one prospective student started sobbing. The message was clear: Jewish families and Jewish students are not welcome at Pomona. During a recent protest, President Starr had to call the police to protect herself and the Pomona community at large, resulting in nineteen arrests for criminal trespass and obstruction of justice. This conduct has ensued despite President Starr's warnings to the Pomona community, her attempts to impose order on campus, and her efforts to offer support to the victimized Jewish and Israeli students.\n\n\"I have seen anti-Semitism here grow tremendously in the last 3 years,\" stated Pomona student, Ayelet Kleinerman. \"I have raised it with the administration many times, but even when they had the opportunity to take it seriously, they didn't. They've called the police for their own safety, but they are not doing enough to protect Jewish students. From hate speech to retaliation in class and outside it to the mob that is occupying our campus and has taken over much of campus life, Jewish students are scared.\"\n\nTitle VI prohibits discrimination based on race, color, and national origin, including discrimination against Jews on the basis of their actual or perceived shared ancestry or ethnic characteristics, in educational institutions that receive federal funding. Under the law, harassing, marginalizing, demonizing, and excluding Jewish students based on the Zionist component of their Jewish identity is unlawful. UNESCO has cautioned that \"Jew\" and \"Zionist\" are often used interchangeably today in an attempt by anti-Semites to cloak their hate. According to President Biden's U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism, released in May 2023, \"Jewish students and educators are targeted for derision and exclusion on college campuses, often because of their real or perceived views about the State of Israel. When Jews are targeted because of their beliefs or their identity, when Israel is singled out because of anti-Jewish hatred, that is antisemitism. And that is unacceptable.\"\n\nEarlier this week the Department of Education opened an investigation into a complaint filed by the Brandeis Center and ADL about \"severe and pervasive\" anti-Semitism in Berkeley K-12 public schools.\n\nThe Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law is an independent, unaffiliated, nonprofit corporation established to advance the civil and human rights of the Jewish people and promote justice for all. LDB engages in research, education, and legal advocacy to combat the resurgence of anti-Semitism on college and university campuses, in the workplace, and elsewhere. It empowers students by training them to understand their legal rights and educates administrators and employers on best practices to combat racism and anti-Semitism.

And, when peaceful, these can be a useful and impactful mechanism to advocate for change.\n\nSadly, what's happening on our college campuses right now is making a mockery of that grand tradition and civil right.\n\nOver the past few weeks, pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, UCLA, the University of Wisconsin, University of North Carolina and others have disrupted classes and campus life, held administrators hostage to impossible and unserious demands, and resulted in the mass arrests of students and faculty, with some even turning violent.\n\nWorse, they've exposed some shocking and disturbing episodes of rabid antisemitism and calls for violence.\n\nA Columbia student and self-proclaimed leader of the pro-Palestinian movement there, Khymani James, was finally suspended for saying that \"Zionists don't deserve to live.\"\n\n\"I think that taking someone's life in certain case scenarios is necessary and better for the overall world,\" he said matter of factly. \"Be glad, be grateful that I'm not just going out and murdering Zionists.... So yes, I feel very comfortable calling for those people to die.\" It only took four months to suspend James -- \"temporarily\" -- after he posted the disgusting video publicly.\n\nAt UCLA, pro-Palestinian students prohibited a Jewish student from entering campus to attend classes. Another Jewish student was asked if he was \"a Zionist\" before being blocked from entering the library.\n\nAt George Washington University protesters held signs advocating for a \"FINAL SOLUTION\" -- a grotesque callback to Hitler's plan for exterminating Jews.\n\nAnd on campuses all over the country protesters have been spotted wearing Hamas headbands, calling for \"Intifada,\" proudly flying Hezbollah terror flags, and shouting \"We are Hamas!\" and \"Go back to Poland!\"\n\nIt's ugly stuff, and hard to wrap your mind around how these supposedly well-educated, enlightened, college students ended up on what is so clearly the wrong side of history.\n\nI don't blame them, entirely. Even smart kids can be na\u00efve, idealistic, and vulnerable to propaganda disguised as revolution. Rebellion can be fun -- more fun than going to class. Yelling petulantly about complex global problems is a lot easier than trying to fix them through policy.\n\nBut where are the adults to tell them that what they are doing is stupid, dangerous, and misguided, and in no way helping their cause?\n\nWhere are the parents to tell their kids that camping out in tents for Hamas and refusing to go to class isn't what they intended their $80,000 in annual tuition for?\n\nWhere are the administrators to tell protestors that prohibiting other students from going to class, threatening other students' lives and breaking into buildings will not be tolerated so don't even try it?\n\nMost importantly, where are the educators to tell students that Hamas and Hezbollah are violent terror groups antithetical to their supposed values -- that the regime they align with murders gay people, rapes women, and muzzles free speech? Or, contrary to what a fifth of young Americans shockingly believe, the Holocaust was not \"a myth\"?\n\nIf anything, we've seen the opposite guidance from the adults.\n\nWe've seen university presidents at Harvard and University of Pennsylvania struggle to answer basic questions about whether calling for the genocide of Jews is a violation of campus policy.\n\nWe've seen politicians come to campus in solidarity with pro-Hamas protesters. Rep.

They spoke the usual libels against Israel. Genocide. Murderers. Israel as a colonial state. I pulled out both my phones and went live on Facebook and Instagram, where I have, thank God, a large international following.\n\nSeriously, I asked the people leading the service, who called themselves rabbis. This is what Shabbat means to you? A blood libel against the Jewish people and the IDF?\n\nMost were wearing covid masks to disguise their identities. They began to encircle me with posters so that I could not film them. I asked why they were hiding. I told them my name, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach. I showed I was unmasked because I do not believe in hiding my convictions. They became more menacing and pushed up against me with their signage and said help was coming. The cavalry was on its way.\n\nA few minutes later, about 1,000 student protesters from NYU arrived. The leader with the bullhorn recognized me and said, \"Rabbi Shmuley the [insert expletive] is here.\" I was largely booed.\n\nGet New Jersey Jewish News's Newsletter by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\nAnd then things really got menacing. I was surrounded by a frightening and violent mob. I stood my ground. \"You are so ugly.\" \"You smell.\" \"You're a monster.\" All beautiful and ancient Jewish tropes. They knocked off my yarmulke multiple times. I dropped an air pod out of my ear. They kicked it between each other like a soccer ball.\n\nSuddenly, a crazed young woman came, and screaming at the top of her lungs, pushed and assaulted me with all her might. I started yelling for the NYPD. The cops, who were across the street, came and started to escort me out of the throng.\n\nI objected. Why was I being removed? I had done nothing wrong. I was being assaulted. Why aren't the people who assaulted me being arrested? \"You can come and make a report across the street, but we need to remove you.\" I reluctantly followed them and made a report, surrounded by New York's finest.\n\nLet me be clear. I love the police. They are my heroes. But their natural disposition amid all the assaults against Jews since October 7 is to \"de-escalate\" the situation, usually by having the peaceful Jewish victims removed for their own safety while the pro-Palestinian mob takes over the streets.\n\nI told the police I am grateful for their protection. But then there are optics. \"Anyone watching this scene, with scores of police surrounding me while the mob continues to charge the most heinous things about Jews, will conclude that I'm the one who did something wrong. You've ceded the public square to antisemites.\"\n\nA few moments, later a senior captain of the NYPD with whom I'm friendly called me and told me he heard what was going on and asked me to help de-escalate. He's an Orthodox Jew and an outstanding public servant. I had to leave to get home in time for Shabbat anyway, so I accepted his counsel and left.\n\nThe violent mob that surrounded me was the closest I've ever come to feeling the way a Black man in America would have felt in the South before a lynching. And truth be told, while I was surrounded by this horrible morass of degenerate and reptilian haters, I felt not an ounce of fear. In fact, the only fear I felt was being arrested by the police. Would they accuse me of incitement for simply being a Jew with a yarmulke? Should I have hidden my identity so as not to provoke the mob?\n\nWelcome to America in the year 2024, where our best universities are now controlled by pro-terrorist thugs, our Jewish senators, like Bernie Sanders, are traitors to their people who essentially say that Israel is always the aggressor and never the victim, and where the police, trying their best to de-escalate the situation, essentially are telling Jews that they should consider lowering their visibility to not be targets.\n\nOne of the most frequently asked questions I receive is whether I believe a Holocaust is possible outside of Israel, in the United States or Europe. My answer is no. It's not a genocide of the Jews that I fear in the near term (although I am amazed at how many people disagree with me). Rather my concern is that as the intimidation on campuses and town squares increases, we Jews will become the Illuminati, a secret society that hides in plain sight.\n\nIt's already mostly happened in Europe, where, except for Orthodox neighborhoods, yarmulkes and magen Davids disappeared decades ago. But now it's happening all over the United States. Expect to see synagogues that don't say \"synagogue\" and JCCs that don't use the word Jewish.\n\nWhat are the implications for an international community that goes underground?\n\nWell, for that we need look no further than the Marranos of Spain, 500 years ago. Anyone see any remaining? Can you find any Marrano shuls in Seville or yeshivas in Barcelona? Of course not. They died out centuries ago.\n\nBut why? Why couldn't Jewish observance continue in secret?\n\nWell, for the same reason that a marriage cannot survive without overt displays of affection and a father-son relationship cannot thrive without demonstrative love. The moment something goes underground completely, however deeply felt it might be, is the moment it starts to die.\n\nIn the same way that a soul cannot be sustained without a body, Jewish observance cannot be sustained without Jewish pride. As we leave the synagogues and take off our yarmulkes, our children are watching, and the message they get is that there is no Jewish identity outside the ghetto. They learn to compartmentalize their Jewishness, which is another way of saying they learn to make it secondary.\n\nSo what should we do about all the harassment, bullying, and even violence against Jewish students on campus?\n\nWell, one part of me wants to tell Columbia, Yale, and Harvard to go to hell. Let's encourage all the Jewish students to leave, and you'll see that the academic reputations of these once august institutions will crater immediately. Jewish students and Jewish faculty are the cornerstones of so many American academies of excellence. If the Columbia campus neo-Nazis get their way and make the university Judenrein, then the degrees these pro-Hamas thugs will be receiving will be valuable only for them becoming parking attendants.\n\nBut on the other hand, I know this reaction is rash, angry, and unacceptable. Retreating to the ghetto for security is not the solution. We have to force the university administrations and American law enforcement to do their damn jobs and protect Jewish students. We are not only a people who live in our ancient and eternal homeland in Israel. We are also a global faith community, whose values and ideals have changed the world forever, and infinitely for the better. We cannot retreat to Fortress Israel as if we Jews were about to make our last stand at Masada. We need to continue to be a global faith community, and we need thriving diaspora communities throughout the world, with Israel as its central focal point.\n\nBut in America what we most need right now is Jewish students fighting back on campus. It was something that I taught our 5,000 Jewish and non-Jewish student members at Oxford to do beginning 30 years ago, when we first saw the pro-Palestinian mobs trying to demonize Israel and take over the campuses. We fought back with rallies, and with six Israeli prime ministers whom we brought to make the case for the Jewish state to audiences of thousands.\n\nSo many people tell me that we Jews, at some 15 million, have no hope against 1.3 billion Muslims and 400 million Arabs. Oh really? On the campuses the numbers are actually reversed.\n\nThere are about 700 Jewish undergraduates at Harvard, 1,500 at Columbia, and 2,500 at NYU. The Jewish students vastly outnumber Students for Justice in Palestine and other pro-Hamas pro-terrorist groups. So why did these bullies take over their campuses?\n\nAnswer: because maybe, maybe we have 10 percent of the Jewish students at most who are in the fight\n\nfor Israel.\n\nUntil we overcome Jewish fear, we will never live out our Jewish promise. Until we confront the Islamists on the city streets, Judaism will continue to go further underground. And even one person, on a street corner or in a New York public park, can make a difference.\n\nThe time to fight back is now.", "source": {"uri": "njjewishnews.timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news",

Matzah, haroset and bitter herbs were arrayed on a seder plate used by students sharing the holiday meal together.\n\nBut in other ways, the seder lived up to the century-old university's longtime reputation as a hotbed of radical politics. The seder plate included both olives and strawberries for Palestinian rights. At the end of the meal, attendees adapted the traditional concluding words to say, \"Next year in free Jerusalem\" -- a reference to the oppression that its participants say Palestinians face from Israel.\n\nThe seder was one of dozens organized by anti-Zionist Jewish students on college campuses this Passover, as part of a sweeping pro-Palestinian protest movement that has spiraled out from Columbia University, about seven miles north of The New School in Manhattan. As at Columbia, police broke up The New School's encampment, arresting 43 people last week.\n\nNow, faculty members have created an encampment of their own, marking a first in the movement and vowing not to turn in grades until the students' demands for divestment from Israel are met.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get must-read New York stories each day\n\nBy submitting, I agree to the JTA/New York Jewish Week privacy policy & terms of use.\n\nPlease accept the JTA Privacy Policy\n\nBy submitting the above I agree to the privacy policy and terms of use of JTA.org\n\nWhat distinguishes the New School seder -- and its faculty encampment -- is that both have the support of the school's Jewish religious leader, who identifies as an anti-Zionist.\n\n\"I am deeply moved that so many [New School] students have joined the Gaza solidarity encampment,\" Louisa Solomon, an alumna with decades of anti-Zionist activism under her belt, told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. \"We are witnessing a multiracial, multifaith global movement for liberation and our students at TNS represent a vibrant piece of it, demanding their tuition dollars stop supporting genocide.\"\n\nSolomon, a student at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Seminary, became The New School's on-campus rabbi last fall -- the first in the school's history. Solomon arrived on campus just before the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that launched the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and spurred anti-Israel protests worldwide, including at colleges and universities.\n\n\"It often feels to me like what happened after Oct. 7 is that the center fell out,\" Solomon told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. \"Cracks and divides in the Jewish community are longstanding. But the inflammation and passion and pain around them is more pronounced after Oct. 7. And that's true at The New School, I think, as it is elsewhere.\"\n\nSolomon stands out because most campus rabbis are affiliated with either Hillel International or the Chabad Hasidic movement, both of which support Israel. Many at schools with encampments have focused on supporting and advocating for Jewish undergraduates who have been disquieted, and at times targeted and harassed, by the protests. Like most rabbis, they reject the notion that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.\n\nSolomon, by contrast, was one of about 300 people arrested at the anti-Zionist Jewish Voice for Peace's \"emergency seder in the streets\" to protest U.S. support for the Israeli military on the second night of Passover. It was not her first time facing arrest for pro-Palestinian activism since Oct. 7. She is a member of the group Rabbis for Ceasefire.\n\nHer work on campus, where she was hired part-time primarily to serve the non-Zionist Jewish Culture Club, has centered on supporting students who are participating in the protests.\n\n\"As I met with Jewish students at the TNS Gaza solidarity encampment preparing for Shabbat services to be held there, I was struck by how much of their pain and fear comes not from the sources mainstream media suggests, but from Jewish communities,\" she told JTA. \"Jewish parents, camps and synagogues are in many cases condemning these courageous students, questioning their Judaism, kicking them out.\"\n\nSupport the New York Jewish Week\n\nOur nonprofit newsroom depends on readers like you. Make a donation now to support independent Jewish journalism in New York.\n\nDonate\n\nSolomon was hired on a part-time basis, primarily to provide support to the school's Jewish Culture Club. The club was created as an alternative to Hillel, which has a small presence and no dedicated staff on campus. (The seven-college Hillel consortium serving the school also does not employ a rabbi.)\n\nSolomon's support for the club has benefited students who are involved, they told JTA.\n\n\"As a Jewish student, the Jewish Culture Club has been a very safe space for me, especially meeting with Louisa and meeting with other students at these events,\" said Stella, who has been active in the New School's encampment. (She asked to be identified by a nickname and that her last name not be used because the administration had threatened to suspend students involved in the protest.)\n\nStella, a first year at The New School, said the Jewish Culture Club and guidance from Rabbi Louisa Solomon have provided a \"safe space\" for her on campus. (Jackie Hajdenberg)\n\nAlthough not explicitly anti-Zionist at its inception, since Oct. 7 the Jewish Culture Club has trended that way. It condemned a Hillel trip to Israel that students at other city colleges took last fall. And it joined Students for Justice in Palestine in protesting when Hillel (which had just absorbed a pro-Israel advocacy group) invited an Israel Defense Forces soldier to speak about his Oct. 7 experience. It also held a Shabbat service in the encampment.\n\nThe divide between Hillel and the Jewish Culture Club has been deepening, according to a recent report in The New School's student newspaper. The paper reported that the pro-Israel advocacy group had messaged the Jewish Culture Club to collaborate on an event but had not gotten a response. Solomon, meanwhile, said she has tried to set up a meeting with the Hillel president but did not hear back.\n\nJTA was unable to reach Hillel's student president at The New School, and the director of the CUNY/Baruch Hillel consortium did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBut some Hillel-affiliated students have taken notice of Solomon's presence. Henry Shane, a Jewish junior who is on the Hillel student board, told JTA last month that he was avoiding campus entirely because of the encampment. Occasionally, Shane attends New York University's Conservative minyan, which is run through that school's own Hillel. He still keeps in touch with his hometown rabbi in California, too. But he said he doesn't feel like he has pastoral support from his own university.\n\n\"It's really unfortunate that The New School has a rabbinic intern who has made clear on her social media platform where she stands,\" Shane told JTA. \"She does attend many of these demonstrations at The New School and I think that has also really defined who she is for many students.\"\n\nMeanwhile, at Columbia, Jewish student pro-Palestinian protesters said they craved the kind of rabbinic support Solomon offers. Shay Lev, a sophomore active in Jewish Voice for Peace and that school's encampment, said it was \"so cool\" to hear about a rabbi who was supporting anti-Zionist Jewish students. (Like Stella, Shay Lev -- the student's first and middle names -- declined to be identified by their full name because of fear of retribution.)\n\n\"I've had so many people come to me being, like, 'I haven't gone to a seder, I didn't come to a Shabbat dinner for years, because I haven't felt welcome in Jewish spaces.' And then they come to JVP services, and they pray for the first time in years,\" Shay Lev said. \"And yeah, I would really appreciate an actual qualified rabbi doing it, so I don't have to, because you know, I'm a 20-year-old without any rabbinical training.\"\n\nFounded in 1919, The New School, which enrolls approximately 7,200 undergraduates and is located in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, has a long history of radical activism. \"Dissenting opinions, radical ideas, and progressive solutions have always had a home at The New School,\" the school's website boasts.\n\nIt also notes a handful of past students who were drawn to the school's mission, including former Israeli President Shimon Peres while he worked for Israel's Defense Ministry in the 1950s. Political theorist and Jewish refugee Hannah Arendt, who was critical of Zionism but not opposed to it, was a professor of social research there in the 1960s and '70s.\n\nSupport the New York Jewish Week\n\nOur nonprofit newsroom depends on readers like you.

As a student, she was also an activist involved in Jews for Racial and Economic Justice and a predecessor to Jewish Voice for Peace, called Jews Against the Occupation.\n\nIn 2002, Solomon was one of four Jewish activists ejected after interrupting a talk by former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at the Pierre Hotel in Manhattan to protest Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories. \"Fortunately, we weren't arrested in the end, and I think we got our point across,\" she said on the progressive radio show \"Democracy Now\" at the time.\n\nSolomon grew up in a home with parents who were political activists in the 1960s and 1970s -- she recalls a shelf in her home full of books by Black Panthers and a now-out-of-print anthology of Palestinian poetry. Although she says she always felt religious, she didn't have much of a formal religious education. She did not apply to rabbinical school until she was pregnant with her second child, now 4.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Louisa Rachel Solomon (@louieludwig)\n\nIn her current role, she has protested Israel since the earliest days of the war. On Oct. 8, she posted a photo of herself with her child in a sukkah, celebrating the holiday that was ending as news of the Hamas attack and its steep toll was still emerging.\n\n\"Judaism can be liberatory and Judaism can be an instrument of oppression,\" she posted on Instagram. \"Judaism is not Zionism and my kids will not be taught that their Jewishness requires loyalty to Israel, insularity, or valuing Jewish life more than non-Jewish life.\"\n\nShe credits her time at The New School with awakening her as a Jewish activist.\n\n\"Jewishness for me was very connected to social justice activism as a young person,\" she said. \"I made Jewish friends at The New School and found that many of us were queer, many of us were far to the left of the established Jewish communities we'd had access to before. And we got connected to Jewish activism.\"\n\nAfter graduating, Solomon's activism receded somewhat as she embarked on both a professional and musical career. She worked first at UJA-Federation of New York, which has a long history of supporting Israel, and then at the publishing house Simon and Schuster for many years while also touring with her band The Shondes, whose Yiddish name means \"shame.\"\n\nBut she was never shy about her opposition to Israel, and in 2014, the Washington, D.C., Jewish federation canceled The Shondes' headlining role at a music festival over Solomon's support for the movement to boycott Israel.\n\nSolomon said at the time that she and her bandmates had engaged in activism together as New School students and that she felt they were making an impact on Jewish fans who supported Israel.\n\n\"Since the band formed in 2006, we haven't had as much time for that kind of activism,\" she told Tablet. \"A lot of it has happened through the band's shows, and trying to do events with Hillels has brought forth opportunities to talk about the issue with Zionists.\"\n\nJonathan Sarna, a prominent Jewish historian and professor at Brandeis University, said Solomon's appointment reflects two trends: a growing shortage of non-Orthodox rabbis to fill open positions, and rising anti-Israel sentiment among younger Jews.\n\nSupport the New York Jewish Week\n\nOur nonprofit newsroom depends on readers like you.

Now we are seeing that that is coming forward.\"\n\nSarna, who disparaged Jewish participation in the encampments, lamented the idea of a campus rabbi who ideologically overlaps with only some Jewish students on campus. \"Part of your obligation is to say 'I'm available to the whole spectrum of Jews,' just like in a family,\" he said.\n\nSolomon said that she does aim to serve \"any and all students,\" including non-Jewish students, who seek her guidance. She says she would be happy to meet with Hillel's leaders or anyone else, no matter their beliefs about Israel.\n\n\"It's definitely a source of great sadness to me if anyone feels unable to approach me in a rabbinic capacity because of disagreements they have with my political views,\" she said. \"I know what that feels like, to be a person who can't seek out support from a rabbi, because that rabbi has alienated me -- certainly an experience many of us have had.\"\n\nCritics and allies of Solomon agree on at least one thing: In light of the seismic shifts transforming the American Jewish world since Oct. 7, the idea of an anti-Zionist campus rabbi is no longer as surprising as it once was.\n\n\"There's that old saying that Jews have a difficult time agreeing on things,\" Stella said. \"There's so much diversity in Jewish culture, so I don't think the idea of an anti-Zionist rabbi is so radical.\"", "source": {"uri": "jta.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jewish Telegraphic

Without a doubt, college professors are the most dangerous people in America. They're not dangerous because they challenge the status quo or encourage their students to think critically. On the contrary, they are dangerous because they encourage impressionable young college students to adhere to the doctrines of the professors they choose without giving them the chance to meaningfully challenge those doctrines.\n\nDuring the recent pro-Palestinian and pro-Hamas protests on elite college campuses, thousands of students put up tents on private property, commandeered university-owned buildings, defaced private property and chanted disturbing, antisemitic rhetoric. But while we constantly talk about the actions of the students, we fail to recognize that these students aren't alone but instead are educated and cheered on by their college professors.\n\nAt Columbia University, many of the university's professors joined the protests, donning orange reflective vests and standing alongside students in protest of Israel and -- apparently -- in support of the students' right to free speech. Of course, these professors, like their students, are not constitutional scholars, yet they teach their students that what they're doing is protected.\n\nThe First Amendment does not protect the right to vandalize or trespass on private property, which is what these students were doing, or even make terroristic threats or aid a terrorist organization, which arguably many of these students did. The very idea that there were professors aiding the students in their illegal takeover of the university should sound alarm bells.\n\nEven in the face of the professors' statements and actions, which were to the effect of \"we support our students' right to protest,\" no rights were being violated. But you can be absolutely sure the impressionable college students seeing their actions and reading their statements feel more emboldened than ever and as though they were the ones wronged, not the scores of Jewish students who were barred from campus nor the many impoverished students unable to access the now-closed dining halls.\n\nThere can be no doubt left now that students who witnessed their professors, people of great authority and respect to them, supporting a protest that resulted in the unprovoked stabbing of a Jewish woman in the eye with a Palestinian flag, chants of \"death to America\" and \"globalize the intifada\" (a violent uprising in which more than a thousand Israelis were murdered in the early 2000s), students claiming \"we are Hamas,\" and a significant number of students donning Hamas militant headbands will think any violence or violent rhetoric on their part is somehow justified.\n\nLook no further than the case of Russell Rickford, an associate history professor at Cornell University, who took a leave of absence after openly stating that the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks were \"exhilarating\" and \"energizing.\" He was seen back on campus, protesting in solidarity with the students and speaking in support of the students and Palestine.\n\nWhy should a student feel afraid of being suspended -- or even expelled -- when a professor of the institution who met a similar fate is back on campus voicing his support of Palestine?\n\nOne thing any college student -- particularly one who challenges authority -- will learn is that when that authority (the professor, the administration or even the student body) is overwhelmingly liberal, questioning dogma is a recipe for failure and being labeled an outcast. For a college student, a bad grade can make or break their college career, which, to college students, is the most immediately important thing in their life. Giving a college professor the ability to judge a student more harshly because they disagree or even simply question the professors' beliefs is the perfect recipe for indoctrination.\n\nLet's be clear, college professors should not be feared; they should be respected when they earn that respect, same as anyone else. The only power they wield is the title they were given by their institution -- a title that can be quickly stripped away from them. To college students, these professors are the most academically accomplished people they know, so they follow them mindlessly; that's why they are dangerous.\n\nWell-educated people are often the least intelligent. They are so confident in their ability to think critically that they have successfully convinced themselves that they can do no wrong. It is only when students have an honest professor who understands their fallibility that they can truly learn.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "armstrong_williams@townhall.com", "name": "Armstrong Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Private property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vandalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Status quo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_to_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Death to America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second Intifada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indoctrination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indoctrination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dogma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornell University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Schools_of_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Schools of Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Research_Funding", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Research Funding", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/122/5094e1fb-996f-4df5-8271-f8fe4e03ae79.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546389", "eventUri": "eng-9546389", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 3043, "textEnd": 3049}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

It was issued in addition to petitions calling for a stop to the unjust expulsion and suspensions of student protesters, and nearly two score letters previously sent to the administration representing thousands of alumni who graduated between 1966 and 2023 from all of the University's schools and identified across a variety of racial, ethnic and religious groups.\n\n\"I sign because my Jewish values of inquiry, empathy and moral courage compel me to,\" said an alumna of CC '03 and CLS '10 who grew up in both New York and Jerusalem. \"These values were nurtured in Columbia classrooms, and I know other Columbia students share them. Until my university can conduct itself in accordance with those values internally, within its communities, and around the world, it does not deserve my esteem, much less contributions of my time, money or skills.\"\n\nThe alumni letter follows the University's unprecedented aggressive actions against pro-Palestine student protesters, including suspensions and expulsion processes with inadequate due process.\n\nThis, as well as the events of April 30 and weeks prior, where Columbia University administration twice deployed New York Police Department forces to clear an encampment that represented a non-violent protest and the takeover of Hamilton Hall, renamed Hind's Hall by the protesters after a six-year-old Palestinian girl was killed by the Israeli military in January.\n\nThe police action, during which an officer's gun was shot inside Hamilton/Hind's Hall, resulted in 112 arrests, including students, supporters and community members; a similar action 20 blocks north at City College at the same time resulted in 170 arrests. Some of those arrested were denied food and water for 16 hours and even placed in solitary confinement.\n\nSince then, violence against student protesters has escalated around New York and elsewhere, including an incident on May 7 where student protesters were deliberately hit by a car.\n\n\"It's truly disappointing to see the way the university has been responding to the students,\" said Taha Saeed, GSAS '23. \"Universities are places for free speech and discourse, not police brutality. Most importantly, by failing to review its investments and divest where appropriate, the university is playing a role in the ongoing violence in Gaza. I hope they wake up and get on the right side of history.\"\n\nDespite claims by President Shafik that bringing police into campus, and keeping a police presence was necessary until May 17 to carry out graduation ceremonies, the university has since moved smaller events five miles north of campus.\n\nThe signatories of the alumni letter pledge to withhold support from the university until demands are met in three areas:\n\nThe letter is part of a series of actions that more than 6,000 alumni of conscience have collectively taken in response to the crackdown on student human rights defenders, in addition to weeks of physical and material support for students, and attempts to engage with administration around this issue. Among the plans are alternative reunion events to coincide with official reunion events scheduled for May 30 to June 1.", "source": {"uri": "english.wafa.ps", "dataType": "news", "title": "WAFA Agency"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemat_Shafik", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nemat Shafik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Hall_(Columbia_University)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_resistance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonviolent resistance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton,_Ontario", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamilton, Ontario"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_activists", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights activists"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_College_of_New_York", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "City College of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_brutality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police brutality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_confinement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solitary confinement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546389", "eventUri": "eng-9546389", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-30", "dateEnd": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 3671, "textEnd": 3687}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 1616, "textEnd": 1624}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 2433, "textEnd": 2438}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 3026, "textEnd": 3032}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

Through this role, I have had the unique privilege of working with and developing relationships with all different stakeholders at the college from students, faculty, administrators and staff. These relationships derive from a deep desire to make Columbia the best place it can be for students.\n\nIt is no secret that Columbia has some significant financial challenges, most pressingly is the budgetary crisis that is going to shape the operations of the institution over the next couple of years. As the college works to mitigate its financial crisis, it is important that our community does not turn on itself in a destructive nature, as we saw during the seven-week strike this past fall. Everyone who comes to campus chooses to be here, and we must reclaim the collective institutional pride that we all share.\n\nCurrently, Columbia is a very siloed institution, separated by different offices, departments, student organizations and majors. We, as a community, tend to stay confined to our own echo chambers of concern. We need to be looking at these separations and create more opportunities for collaboration and partnerships.\n\nEntering my role as president, I wanted to see Columbia bring environmental sustainability back to the forefront of our conversations and behavior. One way we did this was through collaboration between SGA, the office of Facilities and Planning and the Science and Mathematics Department as we created an annual Earth Day Clean-Up on campus.\n\nAnother issue our community needs to work on addressing is financial accessibility for the current students at Columbia. In comparison to other private arts colleges, Columbia is the most affordable option that maintains artistic prestige. During my time here, the tuition has been raised by 20% and I had to work multiple jobs just to make my way through school. This is unsustainable for the future if those increases are not met with appropriate scholarships from outside sources. We are pricing out students from low-income communities and those who pay their way through college, thereby hurting our DEI objectives as an institution.\n\nBeyond just the sticker tuition price, other unanticipated costs can get in the way of a student's persistence. There are many classes required for graduation where students need to finance their own projects. Students and faculty need to have a real and honest dialogue about how much these assignments will cost to provide greater transparency before students register for those classes. Administration should work with faculty to establish microgrants to help our students who need assistance paying for these required projects.\n\nFurthermore, my experience and so many other students' experiences have been shaped by Student Affairs and my student organization. When I first came to Columbia, I did not know a single person here. When I attended Convocation, I signed up for two organizations: SGA and the quidditch team. By simply signing up and going to their meetings, I immediately began to feel a sense of community at this school. The more than student organizations supported by the college provide everyone with a sense of belonging and an avenue by which to make long-lasting friendships.\n\nThe Student Affairs staff is by far one of the greatest assets our college has access to. They are driven to make sure that students have the environment and support to be as successful as they possibly can. Students need support from these folks and when the administration looks at areas to make cuts, I believe they should not compromise one of the primary reasons students stay at this school.\n\nAttending Columbia, for myself and so many other students, has allowed me to explore and express my own identity in a community that prides itself on what makes us individually unique.\n\nThrough SGA, I worked to help upfit this culture by providing an avenue for students to raise concerns, questions and ideas. We did this by working with organizations like the Latino Alliance and BSU, as well as the office for Student Diversity and Inclusion, Campus Security and the Library. Additionally, we have addressed food insecurity by providing regular donations to keep the Columbia Cares Pantry and the Little Food Library stocked. This ensures that no matter the situation -- whether a student forgets their lunch or they are unable to afford groceries that week -- they do not go hungry at school. Everything SGA has done has been the byproduct of collaboration and the hard work of students who genuinely care about improving our campus experience.\n\nOverall, I believe what makes Columbia great is the passionate people that make up our unique community. There are a lot of challenges ahead of us, but I am confident that through productive conversations, mutual respect and transparency, we will get through this. It has been my honor serving as president of SGA and I want to thank everyone who has made this experience so impactful.", "source": {"uri": "columbiachronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Columbia Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Records", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Columbia Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Echo chamber (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students'_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Students' union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scholarship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathematics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accessibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(real-life_sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quidditch (real-life sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boise_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boise State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food security"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://columbiachronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/OP-ED-1200x857-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546389", "eventUri": "eng-9546389", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

Khalil said Columbia never put anything in writing, instead making offers verbally. Still, the documents the students delivered to the administration shed new light on their discussions surrounding issues of divestiture, student amnesty, international aid, and concessions the university was willing to make.\n\n\"The university refused to commit to divestment, and we wanted assurances,\" Khalil said.\n\nThe records and interviews show that Khalil and fellow protesters were unwilling to accept terms offered by Columbia that were similar to proposals that students at other campuses, such as Brown University, had accepted. Columbia, like Brown, offered to review its investments and consider divestitures. But without a firm promise, Columbia's offer didn't go far enough for Khalil and other protesters, since the university had previously rejected divestment proposals.\n\nMahmoud Khalil speaks with CNN on Monday, April 29. CNN\n\nJust days after the encampment first appeared, Khalil said he and other protest leaders were offered a meeting with school president Minouche Shafik to discuss their demands. They declined, he said, believing it to be a publicity stunt by the school where the substance of their concerns and demands would not be addressed. Instead, they continued negotiating with other administrators from the school.\n\nPart of the protesters' demands called for more transparency of Columbia's investment portfolio to be able to fully assess the university's ties to Israel and the war in Gaza.\n\nLess than 1% of the school's $13.6 billion endowment is publicly disclosed. From that limited information, protestors identified small holdings in 19 companies they believe are connected to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, including defense contractors Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics that make weapons used by Israel, and Caterpillar, whose bulldozers have been used by Israel to demolish Palestinian infrastructure in the West Bank and have been used by the IDF during the ground invasion of Gaza. Based on the students' findings of Columbia's public investments, they asked for more transparency of the university's undisclosed financial holdings.\n\nThe school did not offer to completely open its books to the students but, according to a statement from Shafik, instead offered a process for students to access the school's direct holdings and to more frequently update that list. The university also proposed launching programs to aid childhood development in the West Bank and Gaza, among other suggestions.\n\nKhalil said they then presented Columbia with another offer: Rather than dump Israel-tied investments, Columbia could instead divest from weapons manufacturing companies and any companies complicit in violating international law.\n\nNYPD officers in riot gear march onto Columbia University campus, where pro-Palestinian students are barricaded inside a building and have set up an encampment, in New York City on April 30, 2024. Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty Images\n\nColumbia again declined their offer, Khalil said, instead threatening suspensions for those at the encampment. At that point, Khalil and his co-negotiator got up and walked out.\n\n\"It was clear they didn't want to do anything,\" he said.\n\nShortly thereafter, in a statement on May 1, Shafik announced that the negotiations were over. She said that university leaders had engaged with protesters \"in serious dialogue in good faith\" and offered various overtures including the consideration of new divestment proposals but were \"unable to come to resolution.\" She had earlier stated that the university sought to collaboratively reach an agreement with protesters that would result in the orderly removal of the encampment, which she said had created an unwelcoming environment for many Jewish students and faculty.\n\nA spokesperson for Columbia declined to comment on the details of the negotiations but referred CNN to public comments from Shafik.\n\nThe New York Police Department cleared the student encampment, which involved a variety of participants including Jewish students, after nearly two weeks. The school suspended Khalil, a move they later reversed. A university official who was unwilling to speak on record described Khalil's suspension as \"unintentional.\"\n\nMeanwhile, student protesters at some other universities were able to reach agreements with their administrations to reconsider divestiture.\n\nJust a few hours north, at Brown University, the administration agreed to consider divestment from companies that support Israel after what the school's president called \"productive discussions\" with students, who in turn agreed to end their encampment. A school advisory committee will provide a recommendation on whether to divest in the fall, and then a university board will vote on the matter, according to the agreement.\n\nNorthwestern University also reached a deal with protestors in which the school committed to answering questions about specific financial holdings and reestablishing an advisory committee for responsible investment.\n\nOther universities have rejected protesters' calls to divest from Israel and some have outright refused to negotiate. Speaking on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday, University of Florida President Ben Sasse said, \"We just don't negotiate with people who scream the loudest ... A lot of universities bizarrely give the most attention and most voice to the smallest, angriest group, and it's just not what we're going to do here.\"\n\nGiven Columbia's history, Khalil and his fellow students had some reason to be hopeful that the school would be responsive to their demands. The university has a storied history of student protests and demands for divestments on other hot-button issues.\n\nStudents in the 1980s called on the university to withdraw investments in companies doing business in South Africa, which then maintained a racial segregation policy called apartheid. Columbia's student senate approved a plan to divest in 1983 but the university's trustees initially opposed their efforts. The trustees eventually conceded and voted to sell most of the university's stock in US companies with business in the country.\n\nMore recently, Columbia emerged as a leader when in 2015 it became the first college in the United States to divest from private prison companies after a student activist campaign that launched the year before.\n\nColumbia now also refrains from investing in publicly traded tobacco, thermal coal and fossil fuel companies.\n\nBut when it comes to Israel, the university has long taken a different stance.\n\nIn 2002, Columbia's then-president Lee Bollinger criticized a petition to divest from companies that had sold arms to Israel. At the time, Bollinger said, \"The petition alleges human rights abuses and compares Israel to South Africa at the time of apartheid, an analogy I believe is both grotesque and offensive,\" according to the Columbia Daily Spectator student newspaper. An advisory committee sided with Bollinger in opposition to the petition, the paper reported.\n\nPeople set up a makeshift memorial for the Jewish hostages taken by Hamas on October 7, 2023 at Columbia University as students maintain an ongoing pro-Palestinian encampment on their campus on April 23, 2024 in New York City. Stephanie Keith/Getty Images\n\nComparisons between Israel and the apartheid system in South Africa that ended in the 1990s have sparked contentious debate. The advocacy group Human Rights Watch has accused Israel of seeking the \"domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians\" coupled with \"systematic oppression\" and \"inhumane acts,\" which the group argued amounts to apartheid. Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called those claims \"preposterous and false.\" The Anti-Defamation League stated that Israel has safeguards for ensuring equal treatment of citizens and argued that the apartheid label \"would seem to question the legitimacy of the world's only Jewish state.\"\n\nIn 2016, a coalition of Columbia students again launched a campaign to push the university to cut ties with certain Israel-linked companies.\n\nThat effort eventually led to an undergraduate student vote that favored divesting, but then-president Bollinger again opposed the effort and said in a 2020 statement that such matters aren't decided by student referendum and that the university \"should not change its investment policies on the basis of particular views about a complex policy issue, especially when there is no consensus across the University community about that issue.\"\n\nThe student newspaper reported last month that another vote at Columbia College - an undergraduate school at the university - overwhelmingly favored divestment from Israel, though less than half of the college's students participated.\n\nThe university committee that advises on the ethics of the school's investments also ruled against a proposal to divest from Israel in February. The committee concluded that \"there is significant opposition in the Columbia University community to withdrawing financial support from Israel, as evidenced by the actions of many students, faculty, and alumni.\"\n\nIn recent months, Columbia has faced pressure from donors on matters related to Israel and protesters.\n\nHedge fund billionaire Leon Cooperman threatened in October to halt donations to the university and called for the school to terminate or suspend a professor who had written favorably of Hamas' October 7 attack. Cooperman criticized protesters and said, \"Israel is the only reliable ally the United States has in the Middle East.\" In April, donor Robert Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, called for the school to end the protests and suggested he would withhold donations because he was \"no longer confident that Columbia can protect its students and staff.\"\n\nEven if Columbia wanted to divest all its assets with varying links to Israel, the nature of endowments makes that quite difficult, experts told CNN.\n\nFor example, the university could easily sell shares of individual stocks it directly holds, but investments in index funds would require someone to painstakingly analyze each company in the fund to understand whether ties to Israel exist. And Columbia may lack authority to dictate terms on private equity investments managed by separate partners.\n\n\"It's much more difficult to put restrictions on the indirect investments,\" said Luigi Zingales, a professor at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. Zingales argued pro-Palestinian protesters would probably have more success in achieving their goals if they focused on only a few specific companies in which universities have direct investments, rather than calls for broader divestment.\n\nOn Thursday, Columbia's president published an editorial in the Financial Times affirming the university's commitment to free speech. \"We were unable to come to an agreement but this can not be the end of the dialogue,\" Shafik wrote. \"This crisis has also revealed how vulnerable universities are to those that seek to divide us,\" she added.\n\nAs for Khalil, the student negotiator at Columbia, he told CNN that in hindsight he thinks his group may have been too lenient in their negotiation tactics.\n\n\"We were negotiating in very good faith. I would have changed my approach regarding that,\" he said. \"I don't regret not reaching an agreement because the agreement they offered was, to us, literally rubbish. It did not have anything, so I'm glad that we did not accept.\"\n\nWith negotiations over, Khalil said he's focused on strengthening Columbia's Palestinian community and educating a growing number of students interested in, and supportive of, the Palestinian cause.\n\n\"There's definitely a momentum right now,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"},

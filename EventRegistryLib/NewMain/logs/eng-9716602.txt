He said a sheltering procedure test inside Starliner went well. It was conducted to determine if astronauts could quickly disconnect from the space station and shelter in the Starliner if needed.\n\nWilliams said, \"I feel confident that, if we had to, if there was a problem with the International Space Station, we would get in (the Starliner spacecraft) and we could undock, talk to our team, and figure out the best way to come home.\"\n\nThe NASA astronauts said they expect a return trip after thruster testing is finished at NASA's testing facility in New Mexico. Their original planned space station mission was supposed to last eight days and was to have ended June 14.\n\nDespite the helium leaks and thruster failures, both Wilmore and Williams expressed confidence in Starliner's ability to get them home.\n\nWilliams said during the press conference from space on Wednesday that she and Wilmore have been through many simulations that have made her believe if they had to \"we could get in our spacecraft, we could undock, talk to our team and figure out the best way to come home.\"\n\nWilmore began the news conference describing what the mission was like.\n\n\"Launch was spectacular, truly amazing,\" he said. \"And then we got into our operational capabilities checks and the spacecraft performed unbelievably well. It was truly amazing the precision that this spacecraft held.\"\n\n\"And then we got into day two, the start of day two, it was the same starting off and then we did have some failures as we are all aware. We lost an RSS jet and then we lost another one and then you could tell thrust, the control, the capability was degraded. The handling qualities were not the same,\" he said.\n\nWilmore said he was thankful that they had practiced and gotten certified for manual control of the Starliner and the astronauts took over manual control for over an hour at one point.\n\nAnd Wilmore said even with the degraded thrusters, Starliner \"came right down the middle\" during docking.\n\nWilliams said that, once they got onto the space station, \"We still had a lot of checks for Starliner and those all went really well. One of them was practicing for a safe haven to make sure that we had all the emergency equipment that's laid out that we need to have to get into our spacecraft use it as a safe haven in case something happens to the International Space Station.\"\n\nShe said there were a couple of other tests with habitability to make sure that the spacecraft is ready to support four people.\n\nShe said they also grabbed a couple ISS crew members to come in there with them and go through all of the actions as well as checking out the environmental control system.\n\n\"So we are really satisfied with putting more people in the spacecraft once we get back and work through all the issues that we've found already,\" Williams added.\n\nShe reiterated that this was a test flight and the astronauts were expecting to find some issues.\n\n\"So we are finding some stuff and we're correcting it,\" Williams said. \" And we're making changes, making updates with our control team.\"\n\nShe said every day during the mission they've had conferences to go over things that they found or thought about or might add for the next flight.\n\nWilliams said they've been integrated right into expedition 71 on the space station and they've been doing science for that, and some major maintenance that's been waiting for awhile, too.\n\nShe said that included work on a urine pump to remove a pump and put it into a good body. She said they called it \"Frankenpump.\"\n\nShe said she did some gene sequencing and Wilmore did some experiments with the moon microscope.\n\nShe said they also used a couple ISS crew members to enter the Starliner capsule and go through all of the actions, as well as checking out the environmental control system, needed by the spacecraft in unique situations.\n\n\"So we are really satisfied with putting more people in the spacecraft once we get back and work through all the issues that we've found already,\" Williams said.\n\nAsked if they had any qualms about returning to Earth aboard Starliner, Williams said, \"I have confidence. Butch has confidence. We're here on the space station with our safe haven of Starliner.\"\n\nShe said she and Wilmore are having a great time on the space station and are not complaining that they are away from Earth for extra weeks.\n\nWilliams said during hurricane Beryl the astronauts were able to take pictures of the eye and see the definition of the eye of that storm.\n\nShe said in Houston, \"Power was lost and trees are down, but we're a big team and everybody pulls together in Texas.\"\n\nAsked if they were confident that Starliner is fit and solid for future missions, Wilmore said, 'Failure is not an option.\" He said issues with spacecraft on test flights is expected, but he trusts the team they are working with to correct the issues.\n\nBoth Navy veterans, Wilmore and Williams arrived at the ISS on June 5 on Boeing's Starliner on a test flight and were expected to fly home on the spaceship a week later. Since then, the Starliner has developed several technical issues, leaving the astronauts with no way home.\n\nThe issues include helium leaks and a thruster issue that could make getting back to Earth a hazardous adventure.\n\nNASA said the space station has more than enough supplies for them and the current ISS residents, the crew of Expedition 71.\n\n\"NASA and Boeing continue to evaluate Starliner's propulsion system performance and five small helium leaks in the spacecraft's service module, gathering as much data as possible while docked to the International Space Station,\" NASA said in a statement.\n\n\"Once all the necessary ground testing and associated data analysis is complete, leaders from NASA and Boeing will conduct an agency-level review before returning from the orbiting complex.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki",

Helium leaks and thruster failures almost derailed their arrival at the International Space Station, and have kept them there much longer than planned. Now the earliest they could return may be the end of July, officials said.\n\nIn their first news conference from orbit, the pair said they expect to return once thruster testing is complete here on Earth. They said they're not complaining about getting extra time in orbit, and are enjoying helping the station crew. Both have previously spent stints at the orbiting lab, which is also home to seven others.\n\n\"I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem,\" Williams told reporters.\n\nThe test flight should have lasted eight days, ending on June 14.\n\nNASA's commercial crew program director Steve Stich said the earliest the Starliner astronauts might return is the end of July. The goal is to get them back before SpaceX delivers a fresh crew in mid-August, but that, too, could change, he noted.\n\nThis week, NASA and Boeing are trying to duplicate the Starliner's thruster problems on a brand new unit at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, one of the prime landing sites in the U.S. western desert. The trouble is in the propulsion system, used to maneuver the spacecraft.\n\nFive thrusters failed as the capsule approached the space station on June 6, a day after liftoff. Four have since been reactivated. Wilmore said there should be enough working thrusters to get him and Williams out of orbit. There are also bigger engines that could fill in, if necessary.\n\n\"That mantra you've heard, failure is not an option, that's why we are staying here now,\" Wilmore said. \"We trust that the tests that we're doing are the ones we need to do to get the right answers, to give us the data that we need to come back.\"\n\nBoeing and NASA consider the ground tests essential to determine what might have gone wrong since that part of the capsule -- the service module -- is discarded before landing. The leaks also are located in this disposable section.\n\nSo far, testing has not replicated the hot temperatures reached during the flight, according to Stich. Managers want to make sure the suspect thrusters are not damaged, before bringing Starliner back. They were fired more frequently than anticipated early in the flight, and the extra demand on them may have caused them to fail, Stich noted.\n\nAt the same time, ground tests are being conducted to better understand the helium leaks, which could stem from bad seals. Officials have previously said there is ample helium left for the trip home.\n\nHurricane Beryl slowed some of the work. Johnson Space Center in Houston, home to the control centers for both NASA and Boeing, was closed earlier this week to all but the most critical staff.\n\nBoeing's Mark Nappi stressed that in an emergency, Starliner and its crew could return right now. While the company does not believe the thrusters are damaged, \"we want to fill in the blanks and run this test to assure ourselves of that.\"\n\nNASA ordered up the Starliner and SpaceX Dragon capsules a decade ago for astronaut flights to and from the space station, paying each company billions of dollars. SpaceX's first taxi flight with astronauts was in 2020. Boeing's first crew flight was repeatedly delayed because of software and other issues.\n\nThere have been no discussions with SpaceX about sending up a rescue capsule, Stich said.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

That's what we do,\" Wilmore said, acknowledging that an ongoing investigation by the US space agency and Boeing involving thruster tests on earth is key for their return.\n\nThe current test mission is Boeing's final step before the spacecraft can clinch NASA certification for routine astronaut flights and become the second US orbital capsule alongside SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which has dominated the nascent human spaceflight market amid Starliner's development delays.\n\nNASA officials and Boeing engineers have focused on the faulty thrusters and aim to conduct weeks of further testing before allowing Starliner to return Wilmore and Williams to earth.\n\nThe testing includes firing identical thrusters at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico to get insight into what might be plaguing the thrusters in space.\n\n\"Once that testing is done, then we'll look at the plan for landing,\" NASA's commercial crew chief Steve Stich told reporters last month.\n\n\"We're not going to target a specific date until we get that testing completed.\"\n\nThe testing could last \"a couple weeks\" or more, followed by a NASA review of the resulting data, Stich said.\n\nStarliner is approved to stay docked to the ISS for 45 days, or up to 90 days using various backup systems and depending on the health of its lithium ion batteries, which have caused concerns in the past.\n\nAlthough NASA and Boeing have said Starliner is capable of returning the astronauts to earth in the event of an emergency on the ISS, the capsule is not approved to fly home under normal, non-emergency circumstances until its thruster issues are resolved or at least better understood.\n\nNASA and Boeing officials have emphasised that the two astronauts are not stranded in space.\n\nGet the latest news from

They expect to return once thruster testing is complete.\n\n\"We trust that the tests we're conducting are necessary to get the right answers and provide us the data we need to come back,\" Wilmore said.\n\nFive thrusters failed as the capsule approached the space station on June 6, a day after liftoff. Four have since been reactivated. NASA and Boeing are focusing on replicating the thruster issues on a new unit at White Sands, New Mexico, to better understand and address the problems.\n\nSteve Stich, NASA's commercial crew chief, indicated that the testing could last several weeks, followed by a detailed review of the data. Only after this process will a specific return date be set.\n\nDespite these setbacks, the astronauts believe that, if needed, the existing thrusters and additional larger engines would suffice to bring them back safely.\n\n\"If there was a problem with the ISS, we could get into our spacecraft, undock, talk to our team, and figure out the best way to come home,\" said Williams.\n\nWilmore added that there should be enough working thrusters to get the Starliner out of orbit, and there are also bigger engines that could be used if necessary.\n\nThe astronauts' confidence is bolstered by their extensive training and rigorous simulations, preparing them for a range of potential failures.\n\n\"This is a tough business that we're in. Human spaceflight is not easy in any regime, and there have been multiple issues with every spacecraft that's ever been designed. That's the nature of what we do,\" said Wilmore.\n\nThey added that they are are enjoying helping the space-station crew as two extra sets of hands.\n\n\"We're having a great time here on the ISS. Butch and I have been up here before, and it feels like coming back home. We're not complaining about a few extra weeks,\" Williams said.\n\nInitially planned to return by June 13, the astronauts' stay has been extended multiple times. The current target for their return is now no sooner than late July.\n\n'We have two vehicles'\n\nFollowing the astronauts' press conference, NASA and Boeing held another media briefing to address questions from reporters.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of using a different vehicle for reentry, Stich, from NASA, mentioned the agency has considered contingency plans to use another commercial vehicle, without specifying its name.\n\n\"We have two vehicles, two different systems that we could use to return the crew. This gives us more time to go through the data and then decide if we need to take any alternative actions,\" Stich said.\n\nThis other vehicle is the SpaceX Crew Dragon, which has been deployed several times without incident, transporting astronauts to and from the ISS. Should the astronauts end up hitching a ride home via the Crew Dragon, it would be another black eye for the embattled Boeing.\n\nHowever, NASA's primary plan remains to return Wilmore and Williams on the Starliner, which has been declared safe for emergency return.\n\n\"Right now, we don't see any reason that wouldn't be the case,\" Stich added.\n\nStich also noted the option of undocking the Crew Dragon used for the SpaceX Crew-8 mission to make room for the astronauts if more time is needed with the Starliner docked at the ISS.\n\nThere have been no discussions with Elon Musk's SpaceX about sending another Crew Dragon to bring the Starliner astronauts back to Earth, NASA said.\n\nThe Starliner program has faced numerous delays and technical challenges since its inception. Initially slated to fly in 2020, the program has been repeatedly pushed back due to software issues and other technical difficulties. NASA remains committed to the Starliner as a critical component of its commercial crew program, alongside SpaceX's Dragon capsule.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jesus_mesa@newsweek.com", "name": "Jesus Mesa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White Sands, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "White Sands, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Data_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Data Centers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2425585/boeing-starliner-astronauts.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=c5cadf0f5aa3a6dff3269e3de22f35b7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716602", "eventUri": "eng-9716602", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 920, "textEnd": 926}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 2492, "textEnd": 2499}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

According to the organization, Wimore and Williams may stay at the International Space Station (ISS) until later in the summer.\n\nScientists and engineers are working through testing to better understand and resolve issues that occurred during Starliner's launch and flight last month, including some misfiring thrusters and helium leaks. The testing is expected to conclude by the end of the week.\n\n\"I think we're really working to try to follow the data and see when's the earliest that we could target for undocking and landing,\" said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program. \"I think some of the data suggest optimistically maybe it's by the end of July but we'll just follow the data each step at a time and at the right time figure out when the right undock opportunity is.\"\n\nWhile teams are looking to have Wimore and Williams depart from the space station before a crew turnover in mid-August, Starliner has been deemed safe to return to Earth at any time in an emergency situation. Currently, the ship is considered capable of returning its crew safely if they had to evacuate the space station on short notice.\n\nButch Wilmore and Suni Williams check in from space\n\nSpeaking in a separate press conference streaming live from ISS on Wednesday, Wilmore and Williams said they're \"not complaining\" about spending more time away from Earth.\n\n\"We are having a great time here on ISS,\" said Williams. \"Butch and I have been up here before and it feels like coming back home. It feels good to float around, it feels good to be in space and work up here with the International Space Station team. It's great to be up here so I'm not complaining, Butch isn't complaining that we're here for a couple extra weeks.\"\n\nAnd while the idea of being up in space longer than initially planned may sound scary to some, Wilmore and Williams are more than confident in the Starliner, its team, and their ability to get back home safely.\n\n\"We're absolutely confident (it'll get us back safe),\" said Wilmore.\n\n'Let's put some fire in this rocket': Crewed Boeing Starliner finally launches from Florida\n\nWhen is Starliner coming back?\n\nThe Starliner's return to Earth has been repeatedly delayed since its initial planned reentry no later than a week after launch. It was then pushed to no earlier than June 18, then June 22, then June 25.\n\nNow, Starliner and its crew aren't anticipated back until the end of July at the earliest.\n\nThe changes were partially due to the crew staying longer to better prepare the Starliner for the \"long-term goal of having it perform a six-month docked mission at the space station,\" Stich said in an earlier June announcement. NASA also later mentioned spacewalks, data collection and the completion of further testing as reasons for the delay.\n\n\"We are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process,\" said Stich in a June 21 update. \"We are letting the data drive our decision-making relative to managing the small helium system leaks and thruster performance we observed during rendezvous and docking.\"\n\nWhen it is time for Starliner to return, it will land in New Mexico. Starliner will \"descend under parachutes to land in the desert grounds of White Sands,\" according to Boeing. After slowing to about 4 mph, airbags attached to the bottom of the spacecraft will deploy and soften its landing.\n\n\"The landing will mark the first time an American capsule has touched down on land with astronauts aboard,\" the company said in the release.\n\n\"I feel confident that if we had to, if there was a problem with ISS, we could get in our spacecraft and we could undock, talk to our team and figure out the best way to come home,\" Williams said in the virtual conference on Wednesday. \"We've practiced a lot so I have a feeling, I have a real good feeling in my heart that this spacecraft will bring us home no problem.\"\n\nWhat is the Starliner crew doing in space?\n\nWhat have the astronauts been doing all that extra time in space? Quite a lot, actually, starting right from launch.\n\n\"Launch was spectacular, I mean truly amazing,\" said Wilmore, noting that the spacecraft performed \"unbelievably well\" and with \"amazing\" precision.\n\nThe second day after launch, said Wilmore, the loss of function in two RCS jets made handling noticeably different but, thankfully, the pair had practiced and been certified for manual control. They manually took over the ship for about an hour while teams on the ground troubleshot and got the jets back.\n\nOnce landing at ISS, the two integrated in with the exiting crew. They are fully certified for all aspects of life aboard the space station, said Wilmore, including spacewalks, operating technology and performing maintenance, which they have done \"a lot of.\"\n\n\"That's part of living here, you gotta keep that space station going,\" said Wilmore.\n\nThe pair have also gotten to participate in a lot of scientific experimentation, according to WIlliams. From gene sequencing to using a 3D-printed moon microscope, they are keeping busy as temporary members of the ISS crew. More testing will be done on the Starliner's functions and how to optimize them both before, during and after undocking as well.\n\nThe inaugural crewed flight of Boeing's CST-100 Starliner, meant to compete with the likes of Elon Musk's SpaceX spacecraft, was waylaid by a series of technical issues. It began on May 6, the original launch date, when trouble with a valve in the rocket's upper stage forced the mission to be scrubbed.\n\nThe team was able to replace the valve, but then engineers encountered another obstacle: a small helium leak in Starliner's service module. That issue caused additional delays until it finally lifted off.\n\nAdditional helium leaks in the Starliner's propulsion system were later found after launch. During a media teleconference in late June, Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program, said five leaks had been discovered since Starliner docked at ISS.\n\nThe valve that went faulty during launch also did not come back online when the crew test-fired the spacecraft's thrusters. The crew did not try to test-fire the defective valve and they don't plan to use it during the return flight \"out of an abundance of caution,\" according to Stich.\n\nStill, the craft safely navigated to the International Space Station, docking autonomously the following afternoon on the forward-facing port of the ISS's Harmony module.", "source": {"uri": "indystar.com", "dataType":

Five of Starliner's 28 maneuvering thrusters went dead during its 24-hour trek to the station, a propellant valve failed to properly close and there have been five leaks of helium, which is used to pressurize the thrusters.\n\n\"We're absolutely confident,\" Wilmore told reporters. \"That mantra you've heard, failure is not an option.\"\n\n\"And that's why we're staying, because we're going to test it. That's what we do,\" Wilmore said, acknowledging that an ongoing investigation by the U.S. space agency and Boeing involving thruster tests on Earth is key for their return.\n\nThe current test mission is Boeing's final step before the spacecraft can clinch NASA certification for routine astronaut flights and become the second U.S. orbital capsule alongside SpaceX's Crew Dragon, which has dominated the nascent human spaceflight market amid Starliner's development delays.\n\nNASA officials and Boeing engineers have focused on the faulty thrusters and aim to conduct weeks of further testing before allowing Starliner to return Wilmore and Williams to Earth. That testing includes firing identical thrusters at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico to get insight into what might be plaguing the thrusters in space.\n\n\"Once that testing is done, then we'll look at the plan for landing,\" NASA's commercial crew chief Steve Stich told reporters last month. \"We're not going to target a specific date until we get that testing completed.\"\n\nThe testing could last \"a couple weeks\" or more, followed by a NASA review of the resulting data, Stich said. Starliner is approved to stay docked to the ISS for 45 days, or up to 90 days using various backup systems and depending on the health of its lithium ion batteries, which have caused concerns in the past.\n\nThough NASA and Boeing have said Starliner is capable of returning the astronauts to Earth in the event of an emergency on the ISS, the capsule is not approved to fly home under normal, non-emergency circumstances until its thruster issues are resolved or at least better understood.\n\nNASA and Boeing officials have emphasized that the two astronauts are not stranded in space.\n\nA Russian satellite last month broke apart into some 180 pieces of debris near the space station's orbit and forced astronauts into their various docked spacecraft, including Wilmore and Williams getting into Starliner, to prepare for a potential escape. Boeing cited the event as an example of Starliner's readiness to return home if absolutely necessary.\n\n\"Starliner stood ready to undock and return Wilmore and Williams to Earth if needed,\" the company said in a statement last month.\n\nThe debris risks waned and astronauts emerged from their capsules an hour later.\n\n(Reporting by Joey Roulette; Editing by Will Dunham)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propellant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Missile Range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium-ion_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lithium-ion battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/871d64b/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Ffb%2F4f736fd113e06957f59dd9dd82ce36%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK690MS%3A12024-07-10T160554Z_1_LYNXMPEK690MS_RTROPTP_3_SPACE-EXPLORATION-BOEING-STARLINER.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716602", "eventUri": "eng-9716602", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 700, "textEnd": 706}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Human spaceflight is not easy in any regime, and there have been multiple issues with every spacecraft that has ever been designed.\"\n\nThe pair launched atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station back on June 5 arriving to the ISS a day later for what was originally planned to be about an eight-day stay on board. They have now been on board 34 days.\n\nStarliner is making its first crewed flight as part of Boeing's efforts to join SpaceX and its Crew Dragon spacecraft to help transport astronauts to and from the ISS as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nBefore launch, teams already had been tracking a small helium leak in the propulsion module, and more leaks appeared after launch on the way to the station. That's also when Starliner suffered thruster issues forcing a delay in docking.\n\n\"We did have some failures, as we're all aware,\" Wilmore said. \"We had lost (a reaction control system) jet, and then we lost another one. And then you could tell the thrust control, the capability was degraded. And the qualities were not the same. But thankfully, we had practiced and we had gotten certified for manual control. And so we took over manual control.\"\n\nTeams were able to get all but one of the thrusters back online, and after Starliner docked, the helium leaks were blocked off, so the spacecraft has been safely attached to the ISS since. NASA and Boeing also signed off on Starliner's use in the event astronauts needed to make and emergency departure from the ISS.\n\nBut the regular departure is on hold while teams continue to pore over data related to the propulsion module problems.\n\n\"We're taking our time on the ground to go through all the data that we have before we decide on the return opportunity,\" said NASA Commercial Crew Program manager Steve Stich in a followup press conference . \"We're taking time to build confidence in the spacecraft to understand the thruster performance -- those aft thrusters that failed off during docking, and also totally understand the helium margins before we undock.\"\n\nThe opportunity to remain safe at the ISS and go over data before the trip home is similar to how SpaceX's first Crew Dragon visit went with astronauts back in 2020 on the Demo-2 mission.\n\n\"What we're doing is not unusual for a new spacecraft,\" he said.\n\nBoeing's Commercial Crew Program lead Mark Nappi said 30 items were identified for Starliner's leak and thruster issues, and that more than half had been closed already. The remaining ones he said would be closed by next week.\n\n\"We knew there would be some learning from this flight test,\" he said. \"We've learned a great deal. ... we've made some adjustments and we'll continue to make more. ... we'll look at all the lessons learned and apply the corrections as necessary.\"\n\nNothing in testing, though, has suggested anything other than bringing the pair back home on Starliner even as ground testing continues.\n\n\"We do have a lot of confidence in the thrusters as they are today,\" Nappi said. \"With the extra time, though, let's go run this test.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Williams said she and Wilmore have been busy working alongside the Expedition 71 crew members on the station performing maintenance, including help fixing a broken urine processing system pump, but also lending a hand with the science on board.\n\n\"I got to do some gene sequencing, I think (Wilmore) got to do some other science experiments, as well, with a moon microscope that was 3-D printed,\" Williams said. \" So we've been thoroughly busy up here, integrated right into the crew.\"\n\nShe said once a week the pair climb into Starliner to talk with the control team to \"work through all the new nuances that they're working very hard on the ground to make sure that we will be able to come home before too long.\"\n\nNo date yet has been set for that return, although the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight to the station to replace the one already docked is scheduled for mid-August next month. Stich said that a few days before that would be the back end of the window, but that data optimistically suggests it could happen before the end of July.\n\nDubbed the Crew Flight Test (CFT), it's the last step before NASA certifies the vehicle and Boeing can begin regular missions starting with Starliner-1, which is for now on the table still potentially flying as early as February 2025, although delays on the ISS now and more work that may need to be done after the conclusion of CFT could push that first flight later.\n\nBut first, NASA and Boeing have to sign off on the Starliner to get Williams and Wilmore home. Because the propulsion module will be jettisoned on the flight back home before re-entry, teams want to get as much data about the thruster issues and helium leaks as possible, which is why they are doing the ground testing and delaying the astronauts' return.\n\n\"You've heard, failure is not an option. That's why we are staying here,\" Wilmore said. \"We did have some degradation on our thrusters and we know that, and that's why we're staying because we're going to test it.

The astronauts rode to orbit on Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, which, after years of delays, successfully blasted off on its inaugural crewed flight from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 10:52 a.m. EDT on June 5.\n\nBut it wasn't long before a spate of issues began to plague the fledgling spacecraft. Engineers discovered five separate helium leaks in the spacecraft's thruster system and five failures of its reaction control system (RCS) thrusters, which will be essential for safely orienting the craft to reenter Earth's atmosphere.\n\nWith these issues in mind, NASA and Boeing delayed the return of the spacecraft to later this month, leaving the astronauts stranded aboard the ISS.\n\nStill, the astronauts said they are sure they will be able to return home safely aboard Starliner.\n\n\"We've been through a lot of simulations,\" Williams said at a news conferenceWednesday (July 10). \"I feel confident that if we had to -- if there was a problem with the International Space Station -- we could get in our spacecraft, we could undock, talk to our team and figure out the best way to come home.\"\n\nRelated: China's secret space plane has released another unknown object over Earth\n\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\n\nGet the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nDuring their time aboard the ISS, Wilmore and Williams have been performing a number of maintenance tasks and participating in scientific projects. Once a week, they have returned to the Starliner capsule to work through thruster issues with engineers at ground control.\n\nThe astronauts' stay has been largely safe but not entirely without incident. On June 27, a defunct Russian satellite broke apart in orbit, sending debris toward the ISS and forcing Williams and Wilmore, along with the other seven astronauts on board, to take cover inside their respective space capsules.\n\nDue to limited battery life, Starliner was initially only approved to stay docked with the ISS for 45 days, narrowing the troubleshooting window. Fortunately, NASA officials revised that window, saying the batteries could be good for an additional 45 days, allowing the astronauts to stay in orbit well into fall.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore said they are confident that the Starliner will be able to return them home.\n\n\"We are ready. We will be ready unless the data shows otherwise,\" Wilmore said at a separate news conference Wednesday. \"But right now, based on what we know, we're absolutely ready.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\n-- NASA set to launch 2 rockets into the northern lights\n\n-- China discovers strange glass beads on moon that may contain billions of tons of water\n\n-- NASA offers SpaceX $843 million to destroy the International Space Station\n\nKey to Starliner's safe reentry is the ability of its RCS thrusters to perform a safe deorbit burn. That capability isn't in much doubt, Williams said at the news conference. But the one potential challenge to returning home that hasn't been fully assessed is the status of the RCS thrusters.\n\n\"We'll find out if they really are degraded,\" Williams said. \"I think, with the number of jets we have, we're probably going to find something really positive.\"\n\n\"We've practiced a lot, so I have a real good feeling in my heart that this spacecraft will bring us home, no problem,\" she added.", "source": {"uri": "livescience.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "livescience.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_turner@livescience.com", "name": "Ben Turner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reaction control system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Live Science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_control_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mission control center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_maneuver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbital maneuver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aurora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zH8rp46tovfsDih7at3gKT-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716602", "eventUri": "eng-9716602", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 733, "textEnd": 739}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 1403, "textEnd": 1410}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 2428, "textEnd": 2435}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

The ongoing mission is a critical test flight for Starliner to see if the vehicle is ready to perform regular crewed trips to space.\n\nHowever, Starliner's test flight has been plagued by ongoing issues. After launching to space, Starliner experienced as many as five separate helium leaks. Additionally, five of the capsule's thrusters - tiny engines the vehicle uses to maneuver through space - failed and had to be rebooted. NASA and Boeing said they were able to bring four of the thrusters back online, while one will remain off throughout the mission.\n\nEngineers have been analysing the issues while Starliner's been docked to the ISS. And on June 28, NASA and Boeing said they would be conducting a new testing campaign at the agency's White Sands facility in New Mexico. The plan entails firing up a thruster similar to the one Starliner uses, to see how it might behave during different phases that the capsule will experience in space.\n\nDepending on what engineers learn from that test, NASA and Boeing will make the decision about when and how Starliner will come home.\n\n\"We're going to learn from that,\" Wilmore said of the White Sands testing. \"And we're going to incorporate new processes, new procedures that we will employ if necessary.\"", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Missile Range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://imagevars.gulfnews.com/2024/07/10/Butch-Wilmore-and-Suni-Williams_1909df0530b_medium.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716602", "eventUri": "eng-9716602", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1123, "textEnd": 1129}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 2018, "textEnd": 2025}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

The mission was originally slated for a week in space, but now NASA hopes to return a crew of two astronauts on board the Starliner by no earlier than the end of July.\n\nBoeing's Starliner capsule launched atop United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket on June 5, carrying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. Since its shaky docking to the space station, Starliner's performance during its ascent has raised concern that the spacecraft might not be able to transport its crew back to Earth. \"I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem,\" Williams said during a news conference from the ISS on Wednesday.\n\nDuring its approach to the space station, five of Starliner's thrusters failed, of which four were recovered.Starliner also developed five helium leaks, one of which had been identified prior to its launch. The engineering teams believe the leaks may be related to the activity of the thrusters.\n\nThe mission was originally scheduled for eight days, but the crew's return has been delayed several times while ground teams conduct tests on the vehicle and collect data before giving the green light for the astronauts to return to Earth. Despite the several delays, NASA has constantly reassured the media that the astronauts are not stranded in orbit, and that Starliner can undock from the ISS at any point and return the crew safely. This prolonged stay in space, NASA officials insist, is a choice.\n\n\"We have a nice opportunity to almost use the International Space Station as a temporary hangar to take our time and understand the spacecraft before we undock and return,\"Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nThe Crewed Flight Test is part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program and is meant to transport crew and cargo to and from the International Space Station (ISS) under a $4.3 billion contract with the space agency. NASA's other commercial partner, SpaceX, has so far launched eight crews to the space station.\n\nThis week, NASA and Boeing started testing a brand new unit of the Starliner spacecraft at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico in an attempt to replicate the thruster issues encountered during its flight. \"The temperatures we've been able to achieve are not quite what we would have hoped for based on the flight data,\" Stich admitted. \"The teams are off looking at that data and trying to determine the next steps.\"\n\nFor now, Starliner is sitting pretty in orbit but it will need to come down eventually. The ISS crew is due for a handover in mid-August, with NASA's Crew-9 set to launch to orbit on board SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft (I know, so awkward). Astronauts Wilmore and Williams will need to depart from the ISS before that happens.\n\n\"I think we're really working to try to follow the data and see when's the earliest that we could target for undocking and landing,\" Stich said. \"I think some of the data suggests, optimistically, maybe it's by the end of July, but we'll just follow the data each step at a time, and then at the right time, figure out when the right undocking opportunity is.\"\n\nDespite this much uncertainty about a return date, NASA still insists that Starliner is ready to go home at any moment. \"The prime option today is to return Butch and Sunny on Starliner,\" Stich said. \"Right now, we don't see any reason that that wouldn't be the case.\"", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "passant_rabie@gizmodo.com", "name": "Passant Rabie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Missile Range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/06/fca74c0e7435b31af774acfb3ba38593-e1720644155350-1024x577.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716602", "eventUri": "eng-9716602", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 530, "textEnd": 536}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

They were chipper as they answered reporters' questions.\n\n\"We've been through a lot of simulations for this spacecraft to go through all sorts of iterations and failures, and I think where we are right now and what we know right now ... I feel confident,\" Williams said, next to his crewmate and in front of a U.S. flag.\n\n\"I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem. I feel confident that if we had to -- if there was a problem with the International Space Station -- we'd get in our spacecraft, undock, talk to our team and figure out the best way to come home,\" said Williams, her hair comedically splayed out above her amid the lack of gravity.\n\nIt was their first news conference while in orbit, and the pair said they expect to return to Earth once thruster testing is complete, although they did not give a timeline or date.\n\nBut they're not complaining about getting to spend extra time in space, and said they're having a good time helping the crew aboard the ISS, as well as running science experiments and tests while in orbit.\n\nWilmore said they went into the mission knowing there would be kinks, saying, \"This is the world of test. This is a tough business.\"\n\n\"Human spaceflight is not easy in any regime, and there have been multiple issues with every spacecraft that's ever been designed, and that's just the nature of what we do,\" Wilmore said. \"You know that mantra, 'Failure is not an option.'\"\n\nThe astronauts even did a little bit of zero-gravity physical comedy to prove they're in good spirits, with Williams doing backflips to close out the livestream, as Wilmore laughed.\n\nIt's the inaugural crewed flight for the Boeing-built Starliner, a massively over-budget project that's been plagued by setbacks and delays from the beginning.\n\nBut listening to Wilmore's praise for the vehicle, you would have no idea that this particular flight has been in space for weeks longer than expected, nor that it has suffered from failed docking attempts, multiple helium leaks, thruster issues and more.\n\n\"Launch was spectacular. I mean, truly amazing,\" Wilmore said in Wednesday's briefing. \"And then we got into our operational capabilities checks, and the spacecraft performed unbelievably well.\"\n\nHe addressed the fact that he had to take manual control of the craft at one point, when several thrusters failed as the Starliner approached its docking port at the ISS.\n\n\"Thankfully, we had practiced and we had gotten certified for manual control, and so we took over manual control for over an hour,\" Wilmore said.\n\nAt a second briefing Wednesday, this time from officials at NASA and Boeing, they said the Starliner teams are also conducting tests on the ground in New Mexico, which will wrap up this weekend. The testing plans have faced a \"hiccup\" in the form of Hurricane Beryl, which made landfall with the southern U.S. earlier this week.\n\nSteve Stich, NASA's Commercial Crew Program manager, said on Wednesday that the \"big driver\" for timing is getting the astronauts home before the SpaceX Crew-9 mission arrives with more astronauts in August.\n\n\"That's kind of a back end. I think we're really working to try to follow the data and see when's the earliest that we could target for undock and landing,\" Stich said, adding that, \"optimistically, maybe it's by the end of July.\"\n\nAnd while no firm return is on the horizon, NASA said the astronauts would appear in another livestream before they return the Starliner into our atmosphere.\n\nSince its June 5 liftoff, the capsule has had five helium leaks, five maneuvering thrusters go dead and a propellant valve fail almost completely, prompting the crew in space and mission managers in Houston to spend more time than expected pursuing fixes mid-mission.\n\nThis means Wilmore and Williams have extended their stay aboard the ISS for much longer than originally planned -- the original mission plan was to stay just a week to 10 days, but the pair left Earth 35 days ago, more than a month.\n\nIt's the Starliner's first flight with a crew and the crucial last test program before NASA can certify the spacecraft for routine astronaut missions. If approved, it will be added as a second U.S. crew vehicle in the fleet, operating alongside SpaceX's Crew Dragon.\n\nStich previously said the Starliner is approved to spend up to 45 days at the ISS if needed, and it's not unusual for astronauts to unexpectedly be required to extend their stay at the space station. An anonymous source familiar with flight planning told Reuters that, if absolutely necessary, the Starliner could stay docked at the ISS for up to 72 days, using various backup systems.\n\nThe latest in-flight problems follow years of other challenges Boeing has faced with Starliner, including a 2019 uncrewed test failure where dozens of software glitches, design problems and management issues nixed its ability to dock to the ISS.\n\nA 2022 repeat uncrewed test had a successful docking, but uncovered additional software issues and problems with some of the capsule's thrusters.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gravity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_and_berthing_of_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Docking and berthing of spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weightlessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propellant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Propellant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NASA.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716602", "eventUri": "eng-9716602", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 3902, "textEnd": 3908}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Helium leaks and thruster failures almost derailed their arrival at the International Space Station and have kept them there much longer than planned. Now the earliest they could return may be the end of July, officials said.\n\nIn their first news conference from orbit, the pair said they expect to return once thruster testing is complete here on Earth. They said they're not complaining about getting extra time in orbit, and are enjoying helping the station crew. Both have previously spent stints at the orbiting lab, which is also home to seven others.\n\n\"I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem,\" Williams told reporters.\n\nThe test flight should have lasted eight days, ending on June 14.\n\nNASA's commercial crew program director Steve Stich said the earliest the Starliner astronauts might return is the end of July. The goal is to get them back before SpaceX delivers a fresh crew in mid-August, but that, too, could change, he noted.\n\nThis week, NASA and Boeing are trying to duplicate the Starliner's thruster problems on a brand new unit at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, one of the prime landing sites in the U.S. western desert. The trouble is in the propulsion system, used to maneuver the spacecraft.\n\nFive thrusters failed as the capsule approached the space station on June 6, a day after liftoff. Four have since been reactivated. Wilmore said there should be enough working thrusters to get him and Williams out of orbit. There are also bigger engines that could fill in, if necessary.\n\n\"That mantra you've heard, failure is not an option, that's why we are staying here now,\" Wilmore said. \"We trust that the tests that we're doing are the ones we need to do to get the right answers, to give us the data that we need to come back.\"\n\nBoeing and NASA consider the ground tests essential to determine what might have gone wrong since that part of the capsule -- the service module -- is discarded before landing. The leaks also are located in this disposable section.\n\nSo far, testing has not replicated the hot temperatures reached during the flight, according to Stich. Managers want to make sure the suspect thrusters are not damaged before bringing Starliner back. They were fired more frequently than anticipated early in the flight, and the extra demand on them may have caused them to fail, Stich noted.\n\nAt the same time, ground tests are being conducted to better understand the helium leaks, which could stem from bad seals. Officials have previously said there is ample helium left for the trip home.\n\nHurricane Beryl slowed some of the work. Johnson Space Center in Houston, home to the control centers for both NASA and Boeing, was closed earlier this week to all but the most critical staff.\n\nBoeing's Mark Nappi stressed that in an emergency, Starliner and its crew could return right now. While the company does not believe the thrusters are damaged, \"we want to fill in the blanks and run this test to assure ourselves of that.\"\n\nNASA ordered up the Starliner and SpaceX Dragon capsules a decade ago for astronaut flights to and from the space station, paying each company billions of dollars. SpaceX's first taxi flight with astronauts was in 2020. Boeing's first crew flight was repeatedly delayed because of software and other issues.\n\nThere have been no discussions with SpaceX about sending up a rescue capsule, Stich said.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_the_Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Development of the Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Missile Range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johnson Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/07/NASA-ASTRONAUTS.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716602", "eventUri": "eng-9716602", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 1219, "textEnd": 1226}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1829, "textEnd": 1835}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Then another went offline.\n\nStarliner approaching the space station for docking in June. Foto: NASA\n\n\"You could tell the thrust, the control, the capability was degraded.

Ultimately, five RCS thrusters unexpectedly shut down. They got a few thrusters back, Wilmore said, but things weren't the same.\n\n\"From that point on, you could tell that the thrust was degraded,\" though they didn't know why at the time, Wilmore said.\n\nStill, when it came time to dock to the space station, where there were only a few inches of room for error, the spaceship did the job.\n\n\"Starliner came right down -- in automatic mode at this point -- right down the middle, even with the degraded thrusters, which was truly impressive knowing what we know now,\" Wilmore said.\n\nWhat's wrong with Boeing's spaceship\n\nNASA has also discovered five leaks in Starliner's helium supply, which is used to pressurize its propulsion system.\n\nNASA is working to understand all the issues on the spacecraft and get more data to ensure the return trip will be safe. Engineers are testing an RCS thruster at NASA's White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico, trying to replicate the unexpected issues that arose mid-flight and ensure the thrusters will perform well on the return journey.\n\nIn the meantime, Wilmore and Williams have been busy working on experiments and station maintenance with the other astronauts on the space station.\n\n\"We've been thoroughly busy up here integrated right into the crew,\" Williams said. \"About once a week we get to jump into Starliner and talk to our control team there and work through all the nuances that they're working very hard on the ground.\"\n\nBoeing keeps falling behind\n\nNASA requires Boeing to put Starliner through extensive testing to uncover issues like these. In addition to ground testing, the spaceship had to fly an uncrewed mission to the space station.\n\nThe first attempt never reached the space station and experienced multiple failures, but eventually, in a later uncrewed attempt, Starliner reached the ISS.\n\nThis crewed mission with Williams and Wilmore is supposed to be the final test to certify the spacecraft for routine astronaut missions, and the astronauts expected to uncover some imperfections.\n\nThe leaks and thruster failures are the latest of many issues Boeing has faced with its spacecraft over the years, which has set it far behind competitor SpaceX.\n\nSpaceX's Crew Dragon was developed on a similar timeline through the same NASA program as Starliner, but it finished testing and NASA certification in 2020. It's been flying people to and from the space station ever since.\n\nIt's not yet clear how the new issues will affect Boeing's ability to get its spacecraft into the regular space station rotation. Still, Wilmore and Williams expressed confidence.\n\n\"We are really satisfied with putting more people in the spacecraft once we get back and we work through all the issues that we've found already,\" Williams said.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "morgan_mcfall_johnsen@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Morgan McFall-Johnsen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reaction control system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Weightlessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thrust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_TV", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASA TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Test_Facility", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Test Facility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/668eb271b2528216eeb517bb.jpg?ver=1720641823", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716602", "eventUri": "eng-9716602", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 543, "textEnd": 549}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

According to the organization, Wimore and Williams may stay at the International Space Station (ISS) until later in the summer.\n\nScientists and engineers are working through testing to better understand and resolve issues that occurred during Starliner's launch and flight last month, including some misfiring thrusters and helium leaks. The testing is expected to conclude by the end of the week.\n\n\"I think we're really working to try to follow the data and see when's the earliest that we could target for undocking and landing,\" said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program. \"I think some of the data suggest optimistically maybe it's by the end of July but we'll just follow the data each step at a time and at the right time figure out when the right undock opportunity is.\"\n\nWhile teams are looking to have Wimore and Williams depart from the space station before a crew turnover in mid-August, Starliner has been deemed safe to return to Earth at any time in an emergency situation. Currently, the ship is considered capable of returning its crew safely if they had to evacuate the space station on short notice.\n\nButch Wilmore and Suni Williams check in from space\n\nSpeaking in a separate press conference streaming live from ISS on Wednesday, Wilmore and Williams said they're \"not complaining\" about spending more time away from Earth.\n\n\"We are having a great time here on ISS,\" said Williams. \"Butch and I have been up here before and it feels like coming back home. It feels good to float around, it feels good to be in space and work up here with the International Space Station team. It's great to be up here so I'm not complaining, Butch isn't complaining that we're here for a couple extra weeks.\"\n\nAnd while the idea of being up in space longer than initially planned may sound scary to some, Wilmore and Williams are more than confident in the Starliner, its team, and their ability to get back home safely.\n\n\"We're absolutely confident (it'll get us back safe),\" said Wilmore.\n\n'Let's put some fire in this rocket':Crewed Boeing Starliner finally launches from Florida\n\nWhen is Starliner coming back?\n\nThe Starliner's return to Earth has been repeatedly delayed since its initial planned reentry no later than a week after launch. It was then pushed to no earlier than June 18, then June 22, then June 25.\n\nNow, Starliner and its crew aren't anticipated back until the end of July at the earliest.\n\nThe changes were partially due to the crew staying longer to better prepare the Starliner for the \"long-term goal of having it perform a six-month docked mission at the space station,\" Stich said in an earlier June announcement. NASA also later mentioned spacewalks, data collection and the completion of further testing as reasons for the delay.\n\n\"We are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process,\" said Stich in a June 21 update. \"We are letting the data drive our decision-making relative to managing the small helium system leaks and thruster performance we observed during rendezvous and docking.\"\n\nWhen it is time for Starliner to return, it will land in New Mexico. Starliner will \"descend under parachutes to land in the desert grounds of White Sands,\" according to Boeing. After slowing to about 4 mph, airbags attached to the bottom of the spacecraft will deploy and soften its landing.\n\n\"The landing will mark the first time an American capsule has touched down on land with astronauts aboard,\" the company said in the release.\n\n\"I feel confident that if we had to, if there was a problem with ISS, we could get in our spacecraft and we could undock, talk to our team and figure out the best way to come home,\" Williams said in the virtual conference on Wednesday. \"We've practiced a lot so I have a feeling, I have a real good feeling in my heart that this spacecraft will bring us home no problem.\"\n\nWhat is the Starliner crew doing in space?\n\nWhat have the astronauts been doing all that extra time in space? Quite a lot, actually, starting right from launch.\n\n\"Launch was spectacular, I mean truly amazing,\" said Wilmore, noting that the spacecraft performed \"unbelievably well\" and with \"amazing\" precision.\n\nThe second day after launch, said Wilmore, the loss of function in two RCS jets made handling noticeably different but, thankfully, the pair had practiced and been certified for manual control. They manually took over the ship for about an hour while teams on the ground troubleshot and got the jets back.\n\nOnce landing at ISS, the two integrated in with the exiting crew. They are fully certified for all aspects of life aboard the space station, said Wilmore, including spacewalks, operating technology and performing maintenance, which they have done \"a lot of.\"\n\n\"That's part of living here, you gotta keep that space station going,\" said Wilmore.\n\nThe pair have also gotten to participate in a lot of scientific experimentation, according to WIlliams. From gene sequencing to using a 3D-printed moon microscope, they are keeping busy as temporary members of the ISS crew. More testing will be done on the Starliner's functions and how to optimize them both before, during and after undocking as well.\n\nThe inaugural crewed flight of Boeing's CST-100 Starliner, meant to compete with the likes of Elon Musk's SpaceX spacecraft, was waylaid by a series of technical issues. It began on May 6, the original launch date, when trouble with a valve in the rocket's upper stage forced the mission to be scrubbed.\n\nThe team was able to replace the valve, but then engineers encountered another obstacle: a small helium leak in Starliner's service module. That issue caused additional delays until it finally lifted off.\n\nAdditional helium leaks in the Starliner's propulsion system were later found after launch. During a media teleconference in late June, Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program, said five leaks had been discovered since Starliner docked at ISS.\n\nThe valve that went faulty during launch also did not come back online when the crew test-fired the spacecraft's thrusters. The crew did not try to test-fire the defective valve and they don't plan to use it during the return flight \"out of an abundance of caution,\" according to Stich.\n\nStill, the craft safely navigated to the International Space Station, docking autonomously the following afternoon on the forward-facing port of the ISS's Harmony module.", "source": {"uri": "jacksonville.com", "dataType":

Despite problems, the astronauts praise Starliner's performance during docking with the ISS. NASA is confident about the astronauts' safe return, gathering valuable data from the extended mission.\n\nNASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams made history onboard the first crewed Starliner mission last month. However, their stay in space has gone on longer than anticipated due to helium leaks and thruster problems with Boeing's CST-100 Starliner, delaying their return journey by almost a month and counting. The two astronauts provided an update today from onboard the International Space Stations (ISS) and fielded questions from journalists.\n\nNASA astronauts speak on Starliner experience\n\nButch Wilmore and Suni Williams spoke highly about the Starliner launch and docking, despite encountering setbacks that have led to their stay on the ISS extending over a month. Helium leaks were detected on Starliner both before launch and during the approach to the ISS, while multiple thrusters also malfunctioned at the docking phase. Wilmore was very impressed by how the Starliner held up in the face of adversity, stating,\n\n\"Even with degraded thrusters, the capability was there to actually dock that precise.\"\n\nThe two astronauts are confident about their ability to get home. Williams reiterated that the mission was a flight test and they were \"expecting to find some things,\" staying in close coordination with their control team to gather as much data as possible. In fact, NASA has stated that one of the upsides of Wilmore and Williams' prolonged stay in space was the additional data it would yield.\n\nPhoto: NASA\n\nWilliams said,\n\n\"We are really satisfied with putting more people in the spacecraft once we get back and we work through all the issues that we've found already.\"\n\nThe journey so far\n\nIt has been a long journey for Starliner's first crewed mission to take place, and there's still a lot of work to be done to successfully bring the two astronauts home. The CST-100 Starliner first docked with the ISS in May 2022, its second attempt at docking after a failed mission in 2019, but its first crewed attempt happened last month.\n\nWhile the June 5th launch was ultimately a success, problems were discovered with the spacecraft during and after its journey, including five small helium leaks and thruster malfunctions on approach to the ISS. As reported by Satnews, NASA has stated it has the \"luxury of time\" and is in no rush to bring the astronauts back. Mark Nappi, manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program, added,\n\n\"We're not stuck on ISS. The crew is not in any danger, and there's no increased risk when we decide to bring Suni and Butch back to Earth.\"\n\nGround tests started last week at NASA's White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico to replicate the conditions for the journey home. The Starliner's batteries were initially anticipated to last around 45 days, but NASA recently stated they would last for another 45 days.\n\nRelated NASA: How Astronauts Celebrate The 4th Of July On The International Space Station\n\nThis year features the highest number of Americans in space for July 4th since 2006.\n\nAccording to Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, the two could be heading back to Earth by the end of July, although he noted this was optimistic.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN --\n\nBoeing's Starliner spacecraft and its crew have been in space for more than a month -- much longer than the weeklong stay initially expected.\n\nThe vehicle has suffered technical issues that have delayed its return indefinitely, and there's still no return date on the horizon.\n\nBut the two astronauts piloting this historic test mission mostly spoke favorably about the vehicle that carried them to the International Space Station, marking the inaugural crewed flight of the Boeing-built spacecraft.\n\n\"Launch was spectacular. I mean, truly amazing,\" Butch Wilmore, one of two NASA astronauts helming this mission, said in a Wednesday news briefing. \"And then we got into our operational capabilities checks, and the spacecraft performed unbelievably well.\"\n\nWilmore praised the vehicle's precision control. But he also said that when several thrusters unexpectedly failed as the Starliner approached its docking port at the International Space Station, he felt the thrust was \"degraded.\"\n\n\"But thankfully, we had practiced and we had gotten certified for manual control, and so we took over manual control for over an hour,\" Wilmore added.\n\nIn addition to those thruster issues, Starliner experienced helium leaks on the first leg of the trip. As of Wednesday morning, NASA and Boeing officials had not yet revealed whether they've determined the root cause of those problems.\n\nTo learn more about the thruster issues, the Starliner team is conducting tests on the ground in New Mexico.\n\nStarliner's inaugural crewed mission took flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on June 5, ending years of delays that have surrounded the vehicle as it's endured development setbacks, cost overruns and even an uncrewed test mission that suffered a mission-ending error and had to be flown again.\n\nNASA and Boeing have said that the fresh wave of issues affecting this flight should not prevent the spacecraft from bringing its crew -- astronauts Sunita Williams and Wilmore -- safely home from space. Yet they have not named an expected time frame for Williams and Wilmore's return while insisting the crew is not \"stuck.\"\n\n\"I feel confident that, if we had to, if there was a problem with the International Space Station, we would get in (the Starliner spacecraft) and we could undock, talk to our team, and figure out the best way to come home,\" Williams said.\n\nThe reason that teams on the ground say they want to keep the Starliner safely attached to the International Space Station is so that they can continue working to find out what caused the thruster issues and helium leaks. Both problems are on a portion of the Starliner that is not supposed to survive reentry back to Earth, leaving ground teams with few options to continue gathering data from the component after Williams and Wilmore return home.\n\n\"This is a test flight -- we were expecting to find some things,\" Williams added, echoing comments she made before liftoff. \"We are finding stuff, and we're correcting it and making changes, making updates with our control team.\"\n\nRemoval of suitcases\n\nJust ahead of liftoff in June, NASA reorganized the cargo on board Starliner, removing two suitcases for Williams and Wilmore and replacing them with a 150-pound (68-kilogram) pump needed to get the space station bathroom working as intended.\n\nIn space, every bit of liquid is important, and astronauts have long used a water processing system to convert urine into drinking water. But in May, a piece of that conversion system broke.\n\nThe pump's failure \"put us in a position where we'd have to store an awful lot of urine,\" said Dana Weigel, manager for NASA's International Space Station Program, before the flight. She added that the urine was being stored in containers on board the station.\n\nThat's why NASA had to scramble to get a replacement part on the next flight to the space station, opting to send it with Williams and Wilmore at the expense of some of their more personal comforts.\n\nThe two suitcases that were removed held clothes and toiletries -- including shampoo and soaps -- that Wilmore and Williams selected.\n\nWeigel added that spare clothes and toiletries were already on the station for Williams and Wilmore to use.\n\nTest flights: SpaceX's vs. Boeing's\n\nBoeing's Starliner spacecraft is designed to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which had its first crewed test mission, called Demo-2, in 2020 that appeared to go off without a hitch.\n\nBoth Starliner and Crew Dragon are part of the same NASA program, called Commercial Crew.\n\nComparing the two vehicles, however, is not always straightforward. SpaceX designed its cargo Dragon spacecraft years before its Crew Dragon capsule, while Boeing somewhat started from scratch with Starliner.\n\nBut SpaceX's Demo-2 mission looked far different from Starliner's debut crewed flight.\n\nDuring the SpaceX's Demo-2, astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley gave at least two public tours of their spacecraft while en route to the space station, and they held a news conference from the space station on June 1, 2020 -- the day after docking.\n\nHurley and Behnken already knew their mission would likely last months. NASA said before takeoff that the agency wanted to keep the space station fully staffed, waiting to bring Behnken and Hurley home until the next crew mission was ready to fly. Ultimately, SpaceX's Demo-2 mission lasted 64 days -- far short of the advertised maximum length of the trip, 110 days.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore, on the other hand, are approaching their 36th day in space for a mission that officials initially billed as a roughly weeklong trip.\n\nWhat's more, the astronauts are about 10 days short of the 45-day maximum duration that NASA initially laid out, but officials are now considering extending that maximum to at least 90 days.\n\nWilliams said Wednesday that she and Wilmore have joined the astronauts already on board the station to help with regular tasks.\n\n\"We've been doing science for them, maintenance, some major maintenance that it's been waiting for a little while, like stuff that's been on the books for a little bit,\" Williams said.",

Helium leaks and thruster failures almost derailed their arrival at the International Space Station, and has kept them there much longer than planned.\n\nIn their first news conference from orbit, they said they expect to return once thruster testing is complete here on Earth. They said they're not complaining about getting extra time in orbit, and are enjoying helping the station crew.\n\n\"I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem,\" Williams told reporters.\n\nThe test flight should have lasted eight days, ending on June 14.\n\nThis week, NASA and Boeing are trying to duplicate the Starliner's thruster problems on a brand new unit at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, one of the prime landing sites in the U.S. western desert. The trouble is in the propulsion system, used to maneuver the spacecraft,\n\nFive thrusters failed as the capsule approached the space station on June 6, a day after liftoff. Four have since been reactivated. Wilmore said there should be enough working thrusters to get him and Williams out of orbit. There are also bigger engines that could fill in, if necessary.\n\n\"That mantra you've heard, failure is not an option, that's why we are staying here now,\" Wilmore said. \"We trust that the tests that we're doing are the ones we need to do to get the right answers, to give us the data that we need to come back.\"\n\nBoeing and NASA consider the ground tests essential to determine what might have gone wrong since that part of the capsule -- the service module -- is discarded before landing.

They were supposed to stay on the station for eight days, then return home so NASA could certify the spaceship and start using it regularly.\n\nShortly after they reached space, though, the Boeing spacecraft started glitching. They've been on the ISS ever since, while NASA and Boeing troubleshoot and insist the astronauts are \"not stranded.\"\n\nIn a brief call with journalists on Wednesday, Williams and Wilmore finally shared their take on the situation and described what it was like to realize something was wrong with their spaceship.\n\n\"Launch was spectacular. I mean, truly amazing,\" Wilmore said.\n\nThe astronauts were pressed back into their seats as the rocket roared through the atmosphere, then experienced the relief of microgravity as Starliner slid into orbit.\n\nThen, in space, they began checking the spaceship's operational capabilities and it \"performed unbelievably well,\" Wilmore said.\n\nAstronauts use a scale of 1 (best) to 10 (worst) to rate spacecraft handling qualities. Wilmore said he's never given a 1 rating before, \"but I was tempted.\"\n\nHe added, \"It was truly amazing, the precision that this spacecraft held\" -- until day two of the mission.\n\nAs they approached the space station, one of Starliner's 28 Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters unexpectedly shut down. Then another went offline.\n\n\"You could tell the thrust, the control, the capability was degraded. The handling qualities were not the same,\" Wilmore said.\n\nThe astronauts took manual control for over an hour while ground teams were troubleshooting. Ultimately, five RCS thrusters unexpectedly shut down. They got a few thrusters back, Wilmore said, but things weren't the same.\n\n\"From that point on, you could tell that the thrust was degraded,\" though they didn't know why at the time, Wilmore said.\n\nStill, when it came time to dock to the space station, where there were only a few inches of room for error, the spaceship did the job.\n\n\"Starliner came right down -- in automatic mode at this point -- right down the middle, even with the degraded thrusters, which was truly impressive knowing what we know now,\" Wilmore said.\n\nNASA has also discovered five leaks in Starliner's helium supply, which is used to pressurize its propulsion system.\n\nNASA is working to understand all the issues on the spacecraft and get more data to ensure the return trip will be safe. Engineers are testing an RCS thruster at NASA's White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico, trying to replicate the unexpected issues that arose mid-flight and ensure the thrusters will perform well on the return journey.\n\nIn the meantime, Wilmore and Williams have been busy working on experiments and station maintenance with the other astronauts on the space station.\n\n\"We've been thoroughly busy up here integrated right into the crew,\" Williams said. \"About once a week we get to jump into Starliner and talk to our control team there and work through all the nuances that they're working very hard on the ground.\"\n\nNASA requires Boeing to put Starliner through extensive testing to uncover issues like these. In addition to ground testing, the spaceship had to fly an uncrewed mission to the space station.\n\nThe first attempt never reached the space station and experienced multiple failures, but eventually, in a later uncrewed attempt, Starliner reached the ISS.\n\nThis crewed mission with Williams and Wilmore is supposed to be the final test to certify the spacecraft for routine astronaut missions, and the astronauts expected to uncover some imperfections.\n\nThe leaks and thruster failures are the latest of many issues Boeing has faced with its spacecraft over the years, which has set it far behind competitor SpaceX.\n\nSpaceX's Crew Dragon was developed on a similar timeline through the same NASA program as Starliner, but it finished testing and NASA certification in 2020. It's been flying people to and from the space station ever since.\n\nIt's not yet clear how the new issues will affect Boeing's ability to get its spacecraft into the regular space station rotation. Still, Wilmore and Williams expressed confidence.\n\n\"We are really satisfied with putting more people in the spacecraft once we get back and we work through all the issues that we've found already,\" Williams said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reaction control system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weightlessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thrust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Test_Facility", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Test Facility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.HKrIgmrTpGWjDIb8Ec4Tg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/business_insider_articles_888/20424f1b2d1cb307eddb49faeb4c3b3f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716602", "eventUri": "eng-9716602", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 342, "textEnd": 348}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Two astronauts who should have been back on Earth weeks ago said Wednesday that they're confident that Boeing's space capsule can return them safely, despite a string of vexing breakdowns.\n\nNASA test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams launched aboard Boeing's new Starliner capsule early last month, the first people to ride it. Helium leaks and thruster failures almost derailed their arrival at the International Space Station, and has kept them there much longer than planned. Now the earliest they could return may be the end of July, officials said.\n\nIn their first news conference from orbit, the pair said they expect to return once thruster testing is complete here on Earth. They said they're not complaining about getting extra time in orbit, and are enjoying helping the station crew. Both have previously spent stints at the orbiting lab, which is also home to seven others.\n\n\"I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem,\" Williams told reporters.\n\nThe test flight should have lasted eight days, ending on June 14.\n\nNASA's commercial crew program director Steve Stich said the earliest the Starliner astronauts might return is the end of July. The goal is to get them back before SpaceX delivers a fresh crew in mid-August, but that, too, could change, he noted.\n\nThis week, NASA and Boeing are trying to duplicate the Starliner's thruster problems on a brand new unit at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, one of the prime landing sites in the U.S. western desert. The trouble is in the propulsion system, used to maneuver the spacecraft.\n\nFive thrusters failed as the capsule approached the space station on June 6, a day after liftoff. Four have since been reactivated. Wilmore said there should be enough working thrusters to get him and Williams out of orbit. There are also bigger engines that could fill in, if necessary.\n\n\"That mantra you've heard, failure is not an option, that's why we are staying here now,\" Wilmore said. \"We trust that the tests that we're doing are the ones we need to do to get the right answers, to give us the data that we need to come back.\"\n\nBoeing and NASA consider the ground tests essential to determine what might have gone wrong since that part of the capsule -- the service module -- is discarded before landing. The leaks also are located in this disposable section.\n\nSo far, testing has not replicated the hot temperatures reached during the flight, according to Stich. Managers want to make sure the suspect thrusters are not damaged, before bringing Starliner back. They were fired more frequently than anticipated early in the flight, and the extra demand on them may have caused them to fail, Stich noted.\n\nAt the same time, ground tests are being conducted to better understand the helium leaks, which could stem from bad seals. Officials have previously said there is ample helium left for the trip home.\n\nHurricane Beryl slowed some of the work. Johnson Space Center in Houston, home to the control centers for both NASA and Boeing, was closed earlier this week to all but the most critical staff.\n\nBoeing's Mark Nappi stressed that in an emergency, Starliner and its crew could return right now. While the company does not believe the thrusters are damaged, \"we want to fill in the blanks and run this test to assure ourselves of that.\"\n\nNASA ordered up the Starliner and SpaceX Dragon capsules a decade ago for astronaut flights to and from the space station, paying each company billions of dollars. SpaceX's first taxi flight with astronauts was in 2020. Boeing's first crew flight was repeatedly delayed because of software and other issues.\n\nThere have been no discussions with SpaceX about sending up a rescue capsule, Stich said.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

(AP) -- Two astronauts who should have been back on Earth weeks ago said Wednesday that they're confident that Boeing's space capsule can return them safely, despite breakdowns.\n\nNASA test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams launched aboard Boeing's new Starliner capsule early last month, the first people to ride it. Helium leaks and thruster failures almost derailed their arrival at the International Space Station, and has kept them there much longer than planned.\n\nIn their first news conference from orbit, they said they expect to return once thruster testing is complete here on Earth. They said they're not complaining about getting extra time in orbit, and are enjoying helping the station crew.\n\n\"I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem,\" Williams told reporters.\n\nThe test flight should have lasted eight days, ending on June 14.\n\nThis week, NASA and Boeing are trying to duplicate the Starliner's thruster problems on a brand new unit at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, one of the prime landing sites in the U.S. western desert. The trouble is in the propulsion system, used to maneuver the spacecraft,\n\nFive thrusters failed as the capsule approached the space station on June 6, a day after liftoff. Four have since been reactivated. Wilmore said there should be enough working thrusters to get him and Williams out of orbit. There are also bigger engines that could fill in, if necessary.\n\n\"That mantra you've heard, failure is not an option, that's why we are staying here now,\" Wilmore said. \"We trust that the tests that we're doing are the ones we need to do to get the right answers, to give us the data that we need to come back.\"\n\nBoeing and NASA consider the ground tests essential to determine what might have gone wrong since that part of the capsule -- the service module -- is discarded before landing. The leaks also are located in this disposable section.\n\nNASA ordered up the Starliner and SpaceX Dragon capsules a decade ago for astronaut flights to and from the space station, paying each company billions of dollars. SpaceX's first taxi flight with astronauts was in 2020.

Starliner has now been in space 36 days and counting as the agency and Boeing perform additional testing in New Mexico before clearing the spacecraft to return.\n\nThe mission is the first time Starliner is carrying people, flying NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams.\n\nNASA's Commercial Crew manager Steve Stich emphasized during a press conference that the first \"option today is to return Butch and Suni on Starliner,\" adding \"we don't see any reason\" currently to turn to the agency's other transportation option, which would be SpaceX's Crew Dragon, to bring back the astronauts.\n\nSign up here to receive weekly editions of CNBC's Investing in Space newsletter.\n\nStich - while acknowledging that a SpaceX capsule could be part of contingency plans in case Starliner were to return from the ISS empty - noted that NASA does not yet need to \"make a decision as to whether we need to do anything different.\"\n\n\"Certainly we've dusted off a few of those things to look at relative to Starliner, just to be prepared in the event that we would have to use some of those kinds of things,\" Stich said.\n\n\"[But] there's really been no discussion with sending another Dragon to rescue the Starliner crew,\" Stich added later.\n\nBoeing and NASA on July 3 began testing the spacecraft's thruster technology back on the ground in White Sands, New Mexico - aiming to replicate an issue that caused as many as five of Calypso's thrusters to shut down when the spacecraft was maneuvering to dock with the ISS. The ground testing is being done to \"make sure that with all these pulses and all the heat we're putting into it, that it doesn't cause any damage to the thruster,\" Stich said.\n\nStich noted that an \"end of July\" return for Starliner is \"optimistically\" based on completing the testing. Boeing and NASA teams in White Sands are conducting inspections of the test thruster over this next week.\n\nBut \"so far we've not been able to replicate the temperatures that we saw in flight,\" Boeing's Mark Nappi, vice president of the Starliner program, said during the press conference.\n\n\"What we're trying to do with this testing is fill in some gaps, because ... what we're trying to do is understand if the thrusters are performing [as expected], then we will be able to undock and just return.

I mean, truly amazing,\" Butch Wilmore, one of two NASA astronauts helming this mission, said in a Wednesday news briefing. \"And then we got into our operational capabilities checks, and the spacecraft performed unbelievably well.\"\n\nWilmore praised the vehicle's precision control. But he also said that when several thrusters unexpectedly failed as the Starliner approached its docking port at the International Space Station, he felt the thrust was \"degraded.\"\n\n\"But thankfully, we had practiced and we had gotten certified for manual control, and so we took over manual control for over an hour,\" Wilmore added.\n\nIn addition to those thruster issues, Starliner experienced helium leaks on the first leg of the trip. As of Wednesday morning, NASA and Boeing officials had not yet revealed whether they've determined the root cause of those problems.\n\nTo learn more about the thruster issues, the Starliner team is conducting tests on the ground in New Mexico.\n\nStarliner's inaugural crewed mission took flight from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on June 5, ending years of delays that have surrounded the vehicle as it's endured development setbacks, cost overruns and even an uncrewed test mission that suffered a mission-ending error and had to be flown again.\n\nNASA and Boeing have said that the fresh wave of issues affecting this flight should not prevent the spacecraft from bringing its crew -- astronauts Sunita Williams and Wilmore -- safely home from space. Yet they have not named an expected time frame for Williams and Wilmore's return while insisting the crew is not \"stuck.\"\n\n\"I feel confident that, if we had to, if there was a problem with the International Space Station, we would get in (the Starliner spacecraft) and we could undock, talk to our team, and figure out the best way to come home,\" Williams said.\n\nThe reason that teams on the ground say they want to keep the Starliner safely attached to the International Space Station is so that they can continue working to find out what caused the thruster issues and helium leaks. Both problems are on a portion of the Starliner that is not supposed to survive reentry back to Earth, leaving ground teams with few options to continue gathering data from the component after Williams and Wilmore return home.\n\n\"This is a test flight -- we were expecting to find some things,\" Williams added, echoing comments she made before liftoff. \"We are finding stuff, and we're correcting it and making changes, making updates with our control team.\"\n\nJust ahead of liftoff in June, NASA reorganized the cargo on board Starliner, removing two suitcases for Williams and Wilmore and replacing them with a 150-pound (68-kilogram) pump needed to get the space station bathroom working as intended.\n\nIn space, every bit of liquid is important, and astronauts have long used a water processing system to convert urine into drinking water. But in May, a piece of that conversion system broke.\n\nThe pump's failure \"put us in a position where we'd have to store an awful lot of urine,\" said Dana Weigel, manager for NASA's International Space Station Program, before the flight. She added that the urine was being stored in containers on board the station.\n\nThat's why NASA had to scramble to get a replacement part on the next flight to the space station, opting to send it with Williams and Wilmore at the expense of some of their more personal comforts.\n\nThe two suitcases that were removed held clothes and toiletries -- including shampoo and soaps -- that Wilmore and Williams selected.\n\nWeigel added that spare clothes and toiletries were already on the station for Williams and Wilmore to use.\n\nBoeing's Starliner spacecraft is designed to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, which had its first crewed test mission, called Demo-2, in 2020 that appeared to go off without a hitch.\n\nBoth Starliner and Crew Dragon are part of the same NASA program, called Commercial Crew.\n\nComparing the two vehicles, however, is not always straightforward. SpaceX designed its cargo Dragon spacecraft years before its Crew Dragon capsule, while Boeing somewhat started from scratch with Starliner.\n\nBut SpaceX's Demo-2 mission looked far different from Starliner's debut crewed flight.\n\nDuring the SpaceX's Demo-2, astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley gave at least two public tours of their spacecraft while en route to the space station, and they held a news conference from the space station on June 1, 2020 -- the day after docking.\n\nHurley and Behnken already knew their mission would likely last months. NASA said before takeoff that the agency wanted to keep the space station fully staffed, waiting to bring Behnken and Hurley home until the next crew mission was ready to fly. Ultimately, SpaceX's Demo-2 mission lasted 64 days -- far short of the advertised maximum length of the trip, 110 days.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore, on the other hand, are approaching their 36th day in space for a mission that officials initially billed as a roughly weeklong trip.\n\nWhat's more, the astronauts are about 10 days short of the 45-day maximum duration that NASA initially laid out, but officials are now considering extending that maximum to at least 90 days.\n\nWilliams said Wednesday that she and Wilmore have joined the astronauts already on board the station to help with regular tasks.\n\n\"We've been doing science for them, maintenance, some major maintenance that it's been waiting for a little while, like stuff that's been on the books for a little bit,\" Williams said.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

It was the first astronaut launch for Boeing after years of delays and setbacks.\n\nThe test flight was expected to last a week or so, enough time for Wilmore and Williams to check out the capsule while docked at the station. But problems with the capsule's propulsion system, used to maneuver the spacecraft, prompted NASA and Boeing to delay the flight home several times while they analyzed the trouble.\n\nThey also wanted to avoid conflicting with spacewalks by station astronauts. But a spacewalk this week was canceled after water leaked from an astronaut's spacesuit. The issue hasn't been resolved and the planned spacewalk next week was postponed.\n\nAs Starliner closed in on the space station a day after launch, last-minute thruster failures almost derailed the docking. Five of the capsule's 28 thrusters went down during docking; all but one thruster was restarted.\n\nStarliner already had one small helium leak when it rocketed into orbit and several more leaks sprung up during the flight. Helium is used to pressurize fuel for the thrusters.\n\nBoeing said this week that the two problems aren't a concern for the return trip.\n\nIn delaying the astronauts' return, NASA and Boeing said they needed more time to collect information about the thruster trouble and leaks while the capsule was docked. Both are in the service module, a unit attached to the capsule that burns up during reentry.\n\nNASA initially said the Starliner could stay docked at the space station for up to 45 days due to battery limits. But in-flight tests have shown that limit can be extended, Stich said.\n\nOfficials said they won't set a return date while they do ground tests of capsule thrusters in the New Mexico desert, which were expected to last a couple of weeks. They want to try to replicate the situation that occurred during docking.\n\n\"I want to make it very clear that Butch and Suni are not stranded in space,\" said Stich, adding that Starliner is designed for a mission of up to 210 days. Stich said the astronauts could return to Earth in Starliner in the case of a space station emergency.\n\nAfter the space shuttle fleet retired, NASA turned over astronaut rides to private companies.

According to the organization, Wimore and Williams may stay at the International Space Station (ISS) until later in the summer.\n\nScientists and engineers are working through testing to better understand and resolve issues that occurred during Starliner's launch and flight last month, including some misfiring thrusters and helium leaks. The testing is expected to conclude by the end of the week.\n\n\"I think we're really working to try to follow the data and see when's the earliest that we could target for undocking and landing,\" said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program. \"I think some of the data suggest optimistically maybe it's by the end of July but we'll just follow the data each step at a time and at the right time figure out when the right undock opportunity is.\"\n\nWhile teams are looking to have Wimore and Williams depart from the space station before a crew turnover in mid-August, Starliner has been deemed safe to return to Earth at any time in an emergency situation. Currently, the ship is considered capable of returning its crew safely if they had to evacuate the space station on short notice.\n\nSpeaking in a separate press conference streaming live from ISS on Wednesday, Wilmore and Williams said they're \"not complaining\" about spending more time away from Earth.\n\n\"We are having a great time here on ISS,\" said Williams. \"Butch and I have been up here before and it feels like coming back home. It feels good to float around, it feels good to be in space and work up here with the International Space Station team. It's great to be up here so I'm not complaining, Butch isn't complaining that we're here for a couple extra weeks.\"\n\nAnd while the idea of being up in space longer than initially planned may sound scary to some, Wilmore and Williams are more than confident in the Starliner, its team, and their ability to get back home safely.\n\n\"We're absolutely confident (it'll get us back safe),\" said Wilmore.\n\n'Let's put some fire in this rocket': Crewed Boeing Starliner finally launches from Florida\n\nThe Starliner's return to Earth has been repeatedly delayed since its initial planned reentry no later than a week after launch. It was then pushed to no earlier than June 18, then June 22, then June 25.\n\nNow, Starliner and its crew aren't anticipated back until the end of July at the earliest.\n\nThe changes were partially due to the crew staying longer to better prepare the Starliner for the \"long-term goal of having it perform a six-month docked mission at the space station,\" Stich said in an earlier June announcement. NASA also later mentioned spacewalks, data collection and the completion of further testing as reasons for the delay.\n\n\"We are taking our time and following our standard mission management team process,\" said Stich in a June 21 update. \"We are letting the data drive our decision-making relative to managing the small helium system leaks and thruster performance we observed during rendezvous and docking.\"\n\nWhen it is time for Starliner to return, it will land in New Mexico. Starliner will \"descend under parachutes to land in the desert grounds of White Sands,\" according to Boeing. After slowing to about 4 mph, airbags attached to the bottom of the spacecraft will deploy and soften its landing.\n\n\"The landing will mark the first time an American capsule has touched down on land with astronauts aboard,\" the company said in the release.\n\n\"I feel confident that if we had to, if there was a problem with ISS, we could get in our spacecraft and we could undock, talk to our team and figure out the best way to come home,\" Williams said in the virtual conference on Wednesday. \"We've practiced a lot so I have a feeling, I have a real good feeling in my heart that this spacecraft will bring us home no problem.\"\n\nWhat have the astronauts been doing all that extra time in space? Quite a lot, actually, starting right from launch.\n\n\"Launch was spectacular, I mean truly amazing,\" said Wilmore, noting that the spacecraft performed \"unbelievably well\" and with \"amazing\" precision.\n\nThe second day after launch, said Wilmore, the loss of function in two RCS jets made handling noticeably different but, thankfully, the pair had practiced and been certified for manual control. They manually took over the ship for about an hour while teams on the ground troubleshot and got the jets back.\n\nOnce landing at ISS, the two integrated in with the exiting crew. They are fully certified for all aspects of life aboard the space station, said Wilmore, including spacewalks, operating technology and performing maintenance, which they have done \"a lot of.\"\n\n\"That's part of living here, you gotta keep that space station going,\" said Wilmore.\n\nThe pair have also gotten to participate in a lot of scientific experimentation, according to WIlliams. From gene sequencing to using a 3D-printed moon microscope, they are keeping busy as temporary members of the ISS crew. More testing will be done on the Starliner's functions and how to optimize them both before, during and after undocking as well.\n\nWilmore and Williams launched into space on June 5 after several last-minute scrubs delayed the plans.\n\nThe inaugural crewed flight of Boeing's CST-100 Starliner, meant to compete with the likes of Elon Musk's SpaceX spacecraft, was waylaid by a series of technical issues. It began on May 6, the original launch date, when trouble with a valve in the rocket's upper stage forced the mission to be scrubbed.\n\nThe team was able to replace the valve, but then engineers encountered another obstacle: a small helium leak in Starliner's service module. That issue caused additional delays until it finally lifted off.\n\nAdditional helium leaks in the Starliner's propulsion system were later found after launch. During a media teleconference in late June, Stich, manager of NASA's commercial crew program, said five leaks had been discovered since Starliner docked at ISS.\n\nThe valve that went faulty during launch also did not come back online when the crew test-fired the spacecraft's thrusters. The crew did not try to test-fire the defective valve and they don't plan to use it during the return flight \"out of an abundance of caution,\" according to Stich.\n\nStill, the craft safely navigated to the International Space Station, docking autonomously the following afternoon on the forward-facing port of the ISS's Harmony module.\n\nContributing: Eric Lagatta, Jonathan Limehouse and

However, Starliner has experienced several mechanical issues, including helium leaks and a thruster issue, leaving the astronauts stuck onboard the ISS with no set return date.\n\nNASA has insisted Wilmore and Williams are safe while they remain onboard the ISS with the Expedition 71 crew. The agency has said the ISS has plenty of supplies in orbit, and the station's schedule is relatively open through mid-August.\n\n\"I want to make it clear that Butch and Suni aren't stranded in space,\" Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew program, said during a June 28 teleconference. \"Our plan is to continue to return them on Starliner and return them home at the right time.\"\n\nNASA and Boeing say Wilmore and Williams are \"integrated\" with the Expedition 71 crew aboard the ISS and are helping the crew with station operations as needed, as well as completing \"objectives\" needed for NASA's possible certification of Starliner.\n\n\"Since their arrival on June 6, Wilmore and Williams have completed half of all hands-on research time conducted aboard the space station, allowing their crewmates to prepare for the departure of Northrop Grumman's Cygnus spacecraft,\" NASA wrote in a recent update.\n\nThis week, teams at NASA's White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico are performing ground tests of Starliner's thruster, putting it through similar conditions the spacecraft experienced on its way to the ISS, according to an update on Boeing's website.\n\nMORE: Boeing's Starliner launches its 1st astronaut-crewed flight after several delays\n\nThe tests will replicate Starliner's docking, when some of the thrusters failed, and what the thrusters will experience from undocking to landing back on Earth.\n\n\"We really want to understand the thruster and how we use it in flight,\" said Dan Niedermaier, the lead Boeing engineer for the thruster testing, in a statement. \"We will learn a lot from these thruster firings that will be valuable for the remainder of the Crew Flight Test and future missions.\"\n\nStarliner has been plagued by issues even before launch. The flight test was originally tentatively scheduled for May 6, but was scrubbed after a problem with an oxygen valve on a rocket from United Launch Alliance, which manufactures and operates the rockets that launch Starliner spacecraft into orbit.\n\nA new launch date was subsequently set for May 25, but then a small helium leak was discovered in the Starliner service module, which contains support systems and instruments for operating the spacecraft.\n\nThose helium leaks and a thruster issue threatened to delay Starliner's docking, but it docked successfully. Five days after docking at the ISS, NASA and Boeing announced that the spacecraft was experiencing five \"small\" helium leaks, but added at the time that enough helium remained for the return

The original CFT mission was scheduled to last about eight days on the International Space Station. Still, the astronauts have remained in orbit for 35 days because of issues with the spacecraft service module.\n\nFive thrusters went out as Starliner approached the ISS for docking on June 6. Teams are also investigating several helium leaks on the spacecraft.\n\nPHOTOS: HURRICANE BERYL FLIPS SEMI-TRUCKS, KNOCKS OUT POWER AFTER TEXAS LANDFALL\n\nThis week, Hurricane Beryl added complications to the efforts to bring the astronauts home.\n\nNASA's Johnson Space Center was in the path of Hurricane Beryl, which left millions in southeast Texas without power, including NASA's Commercial Crew Manager Steve Stich and other NASA and Boeing team members.\n\nJohnson Space Center opened for full operations on Wednesday, two days after Beryl's landfall on the Texas coast.\n\n\"A little bit of a hiccup, I would say, with Hurricane Beryl coming through. Some people are actually impacted and not able to work as much as we would hope, but we're still continuing to make a lot of progress,\" Stich said.\n\nBoeing's Commercial Crew Program manager Mark Nappi said Beryl also impacted Boeing's resources at its Houston facilities.\n\n\"It impacts the resources that we have just in Houston at the Boeing facility. So, you know, with those resources not being available, we had to reprioritize some of that work and reorder it so that we can still try to stay on plan.\"\n\nPart of the delay in bringing the astronauts back to Earth is that the service module where the issues originate separates from the Starliner crew module and burns up in Earth's atmosphere. Boeing and NASA are attempting to get as much data while in space as possible before the module is gone.\n\nTeams in Texas, New Mexico, Alabama, and Ohio have been working with Starliner hardware on Earth to try to replicate the issues seen in space.\n\nAfter testing in the vacuum chamber at Glenn Research Center in Ohio, teams are running thruster testing at NASA's White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico.\n\nNo date has been set for the astronauts' return to Earth. Stich said \"optimistically\" they could undock at the end of July.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore have added additional hands to the daily tasks around the orbiting laboratory, including maintaining experiments and providing spacewalk support. This is the third spaceflight for both astronauts.\n\nThis week the astronauts watched as Beryl took aim at their families and friends in Houston.\n\nPhotos from the ISS and astronauts showed the powerful hurricane as a category 5 when it was pummeling the Caribbean Islands earlier in the week.\n\n\"We are having a great time here on ISS. As you know, Butch and I have been up here before, and it feels like coming back home. It feels good to float around. It feels good to be in space and work up here with the International Space Station team,\" Williams said. \"I'm not complaining, Butch isn't complaining that we're here for a couple of extra weeks.\"\n\nIn a call on Wednesday, both astronauts expressed confidence in the teams on the ground working to ensure their safe return to Earth.\n\n\"I feel confident that if we had to, if there was a problem with the International Space Station, we can get in our spacecraft, and we can undock, talk to our team and figure out the best way to come home,\" Williams said.\n\nLast week, the astronauts had to shelter in Starliner as a \"lifeboat\" when a Russian satellite created a debris field in the same orbit as the space station.\n\nWilmore said they could dock at the ISS when the thrusters went out because of the team's effort at mission control. He said he was confident the team could handle any issue that might arise on the spaceflight home.\n\n\"This is a tough business that we're in. Human spaceflight is not easy in any regime. And there have been multiple issues with every spacecraft that's ever been designed. And that's the nature of what we do,\" Wilmore said.\n\nWilmore said decades of human spaceflight give him confidence in the testing process happening now with Starliner.\n\n\"We are very close and friends with those that are making these decisions. And we trust them. We trust their integrity. We trust their technical acumen,\" Wilmore said. \"We trust that the tests that we're doing are the ones that we need to do to get the right answers, to give us the data that we need to come back.\"",

NASA and Boeing have not set a date for their return.\n\nNASA program manager Steve Stich didn't commit to a firm departure date during a separate news conference, but indicated a late-July return might be possible. If Starliner doesn't leave, Stich said the capsule would block another mission scheduled to come to the ISS in mid-August.\n\nThe two astronauts are the first to fly to space in the capsule, which is designed to ferry NASA's astronauts to and from the ISS. The ongoing mission is a critical test of whether the Starliner vehicle is ready to perform regular crewed trips to space.\n\nHowever, Starliner's test flight has been plagued by ongoing issues. After launching to space, the craft experienced as many as five separate helium leaks. Additionally, five of the capsule's thrusters failed and had to be rebooted. NASA and Boeing said they were able to bring four of the thrusters back online, while one will remain off throughout the mission.\n\nEngineers have been analyzing the issues while Starliner's been docked to the ISS. And on June 28, NASA and Boeing said they would be conducting a new testing campaign at the agency's White Sands facility in New Mexico. The plan entails firing up a thruster similar to the one Starliner uses to see how it might behave during different phases that the capsule will experience in space.\n\nDepending on what engineers learn from that test, NASA and Boeing will decide when and how Starliner will come home.\n\n\"We're going to learn from that,\" Wilmore said of the White Sands testing. \"And we're going to incorporate new processes, new procedures that we will employ if necessary.\"\n\n(Updates with details from news conference in sixth paragraph.)", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams are safe on the station and, NASA insists, not stranded, but they will not yet be returning home due to thruster issues with their spacecraft.\n\nIn a press conference today from the station, Wilmore was particularly enthusiastic about the handling of the spacecraft following launch. \"The spacecraft performed unbelievably well,\" he said.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nAs part of the astronauts' evaluation of the spacecraft, they give a grade from one to 10 on a scale called the Cooper-Harper rating scale, with one being the best possible. \"I've never given a one in all my flight test years on a Cooper-Harper rating scale for handling qualities, but I was tempted,\" he said.\n\nAfter the first day, though, there were problems with the Starliner's thrusters, which caused handling issues. Even with these issues, though, Wilmore said that the docking of the spacecraft with the ISS was still extremely precise.\n\nWilliams gave details about what the pair have been up to during their time on the ISS, including checking over the Starliner and testing that it would hold four people comfortably. They have also been working with other members of the current ISS crew on maintenance tasks on the station, like replacing pumps and working on science research.\n\nRegarding the issues with Starliner, Williams was relaxed, saying, \"This is a test flight, so we were expecting to find some things, and so we are finding stuff and we are correcting it.\"\n\nIn a later press update, NASA and Boeing representatives discussed the issues further. \"We're taking our time on the ground to go through all the data that we have before we decide on the return opportunity. We're taking time to build confidence in the spacecraft, to understand the thruster performance,\" said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, who detailed some of the testing being done regarding the thruster issues. \"What we're doing is not unusual for a new spacecraft.\" He also emphasized that in an emergency, William and Wilmore could use the Starliner to return to Earth.\n\nNASA still has not given a date for the planned return of the Starliner to Earth, though the departure of the current ISS Crew-8 and the arrival of Crew-9, both scheduled for mid-August, will be a scheduling concern. There is a possibility that the Starliner may return to Earth at the end of July, but this isn't yet known for sure.\n\nThe most pressing issue for the Starliner in terms of time spent in orbit is its batteries, which were originally supposed to be used for 45 days only. Currently the Starliner is at 35 days in space, but Stich said that the batteries are healthy and not showing any performance issues, so that time could potentially be extended.\n\nIn the meantime, the astronauts will remain on the station and are sanguine about the situation. \"This is the world of test,\" Wilmore said. \"There have been multiple issues with every spacecraft that has ever been designed, and that's the nature of what we do.\"", "source": {"uri": "digitaltrends.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Trends"}, "authors": [{"uri": "georgina_torbet@digitaltrends.com", "name": "Georgina Torbet", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flight test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-10-193343.jpg?resize=800%2C418&p=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716602", "eventUri": "eng-9716602", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Barry \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Butch\u00e2\u20ac Wilmore and pilot Sunita \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Suni\u00e2\u20ac Williams home on the trouble-prone Boeing Starliner spacecraft, officials from NASA and Boeing said Wednesday afternoon.\n\nDuring a teleconference, officials said engineers are still working on the issues that have plagued the maiden crewed flight of Boeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Starliner spacecraft. They said the two astronauts may return home at the end of the month, but only after tests have become completed and reviewed.\n\nNASA and Boeing officials summarized the issues that have burdened the Boeing Crew Flight Test mission, which took off on Wednesday, June 5, on a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. Five small helium leaks were discovered in a flange of the spacecraft\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s service module\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thruster system. These leaks are believed to be caused by a faulty seal.\n\nThe helium is used to help pressurize the thrusters.\n\nOne of the five aft reaction control system thrusters that maneuver Starliner to and from the International Space Station has been deselected for the rest of the mission.\n\nAll five failed during the approach of the space station on Thursday, June 6, but officials were able to conduct a hot-fire test that saw four of the five being re-selected and working.\n\nDespite the five leaks, officials have said that Starliner has enough helium for the return trip home.\n\nScroll down to see the timeline of the mission events.\n\nOn Wednesday, NASA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Commercial Crew Program Manager Steve Stich told the media that the Starliner team is conducting hot-fire testing of a spare thruster at the White Stands Test Facility in New Mexico.\n\nThis is to help teams determine what the working four thrusters on Starliner can handle on the return trip home, and to better understand what has, and might happen.\n\nThe testing will take place in two parts: The uphill phase replicates the flight of the Starliner and its docking with the International Space Station, while the downhill phase will be the undocking from the station and return to Earth.\n\nBoeing\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s commercial Crew Program Vice President and Program Manager Mark Nappi also said that spare seals are being tested as well to determine what caused the ones in the Starliner module to leak. He said teams on the ground are trying to replicate what may have happened for there to be five helium leaks.\n\nOnce data is collected and ground testing completed, leadership will review the results and then decide when Wilmore and Williams will return home. Stich said they are aiming for the end of this month, but it all depends on the data.\n\nWhile taking media questions, Stich told Spectrum News that officials would like to see Starliner return to Earth before the NASA-SpaceX Crew-9 mission next month, because the space station only has two docking ports designed for SpaceX\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Dragon spacecraft and Starliner. These ports are found in the Harmony module.\n\nCurrently, Starliner is docked on the forward-facing port of the Harmony module, while the Dragon capsule Endeavour, which is being used for the Crew-8 mission, is on the zenith port facing space.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We really have to free up a port to do the rotation coming up, and one of the two ports need to be free up for that,\u00e2\u20ac said Stich.\n\nBoth Nappi and Stich said firmly that Williams and Wilmore are expected to return on Starliner, even though NASA said in a June 16 update that the spacecraft may remain docked for months.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Based upon current space station resources and scheduling needs, a short duration mission with two astronaut test pilots is sufficient to meet all NASA and Boeing test objectives for CFT, which include demonstrating Starliner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability to safely fly operational crewed missions to and from the space station. To protect against unforeseen events with crew transportation to the station, NASA may extend the CFT docked duration up to six months and add an additional astronaut later, if needed,\u00e2\u20ac stated NASA.\n\nBefore the teleconference, the media heard from both Wilmore and Williams in their own press conference as they were floating in the International Space Station.\n\nWilmore started off the press conference by saying, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the spacecraft performed unbelievably well\u00e2\u20ac during liftoff and docking.\n\nThe commander of the mission admitted that there were failures, such as the thrusters not working, and he said both they had to manually control the Starliner craft for more than an hour as the Starliner team back on Earth were trouble shooting.\n\nEventually, four thrusters did come back online and the Starliner autonomously docked with the ISS on Thursday, June 6, which Wilmore called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153impressive.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nLike Wilmore, Williams said the Starliner has performed well and the two have conducted tests, like using it as a safe haven in case of an emergency \u00e2\u20ac\" like when a Russian satellite broke apart and the astronauts had to seek shelter in late June \u00e2\u20ac\" and placing two other astronauts inside it.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We still had a lot of checks for Starliner and they went really well,\u00e2\u20ac she said of the tests.\n\nShe stressed that this Starliner mission is a flight test and issues are not uncommon.\n\nButch said that they both feel confident in using Starliner to return back to Earth, with Williams saying: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have a really good feeling in my heart that this spacecraft will bring us home.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nThe pair were supposed to be aboard the ISS for a minimum of eight days, but due to the issues with Starliner, they have had to stay longer.\n\nThe Starliner\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s batteries have a shelf life of 45 days, and as of Wednesday, July 10, it is day 35 of the mission. Stich said the batteries are being assessed.\n\nThe maiden crewed mission has seen a string of problems, from launching to docking and attempting to return back to Earth.\n\nHere is a timeline of the issues that has troubled the mission.", "source": {"uri": "mynews13.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News 13"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Crewed_Flight_Test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Crewed Flight Test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reaction control system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_(ISS_module)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harmony (ISS module)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Endeavour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle Endeavour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenith", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zenith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/06-21-2024_Starliner_Docked_To_ISS_B_2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716602", "eventUri": "eng-9716602", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 734, "textEnd": 740}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 1259, "textEnd": 1265, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-16", "textStart": 3492, "textEnd": 3499}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 5721, "textEnd": 5728}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

He said the pair tested a \"Safe Haven procedure,\" sheltering inside Starliner in the event they needed to suddenly undock from the ISS, and the test went well.\n\n\"We've been through a lot of simulations...and I think where we are right now...I feel confident that if we had to, if there was a problem with the International Space Station, we could get in our spacecraft, we could undock, talk to our team and and figure out the best way to come home,\" Williams added.\n\nWilmore and Williams lifted off on June 5 from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida and docked with the ISS on June 6.\n\nThe pair were initially expected to spend one week aboard the ISS evaluating the spacecraft and its systems and return June 14. However, Starliner's mechanical issues left the astronauts stuck onboard the ISS with no set return date.\n\nNASA has insisted Wilmore and Williams are safe while they remain onboard the ISS with the Expedition 71 crew. The agency has said the ISS has plenty of supplies in orbit, and the station's schedule is relatively open through mid-August.\n\n\"We're taking our time on the ground to go through all the data that we have before we decide on the return opportunity,\" Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew program, said during a Wednesday afternoon press briefing. \"We're taking time to build confidence in the spacecraft to understand the thruster performance ... and also totally understand the helium margins before we undock.\"\n\nNASA and Boeing say Wilmore and Williams are \"integrated\" with the Expedition 71 crew aboard the ISS and are helping the crew with station operations as needed, as well as completing \"objectives\" needed for NASA's possible certification of Starliner.\n\n\"Since their arrival on June 6, Wilmore and Williams have completed half of all hands-on research time conducted aboard the space station, allowing their crewmates to prepare for the departure of Northrop Grumman's Cygnus spacecraft,\" NASA wrote in a recent update.\n\nThis week, teams at NASA's White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico are performing ground tests of Starliner's thruster, putting it through similar conditions the spacecraft experienced on its way to the ISS, according to an update on Boeing's website.\n\nThe tests will replicate Starliner's docking, when some of the thrusters failed, and what the thrusters will experience between when Starliner undocks from the ISS and touches down back on Earth.\n\n\"This testing is trying to replicate what the worst-case thruster saw inflight,\" Mark Nappi, Boeing's vice president of its Commercial Crew Program, said during the Wednesday afternoon news conference. \"So far, we've not been able to replicate the temperatures that we saw in flight, so the team is off talking about that - as a matter of fact, right now - so that they can determine whether or not there's a form of testing, or something in the test that we want to go change, so that we can replicate that situation.\"\n\nStich said the tests, and taking one's time with them, are not unusual for a new spacecraft, and because Starliner can be powered from the ISS, it allows the team to use the space station as temporary hangar. He added that he expects the tests to be completed by the end of this week or over the weekend.\n\nStarliner had been plagued by issues even before launch. The flight test was originally tentatively scheduled for May 6, but was scrubbed after a problem with an oxygen valve on a rocket from United Launch Alliance, which manufactures and operates the rockets that launch Starliner spacecraft into orbit.\n\nA new launch date was subsequently set for May 25, but then a small helium leak was discovered in the Starliner service module, which contains support systems and instruments for operating the spacecraft.\n\nThose helium leaks and a thruster issue threatened to delay Starliner's ISS docking, but it docked successfully. Five days after docking with the ISS, NASA and Boeing announced that the spacecraft was experiencing five \"small\" helium leaks, but added at the time that enough helium remained for the return

Human spaceflight is not easy in any regime, and there have been multiple issues with every spacecraft that has ever been designed.\"\n\nThe pair launched atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station back on June 5 arriving to the ISS a day later for what was originally planned to be about an eight-day stay on board.

That's also when Starliner suffered thruster issues forcing a delay in docking.\n\n\"We did have some failures, as we're all aware,\" Wilmore said. \"We had lost (a reaction control system) jet, and then we lost another one. And then you could tell the thrust control, the capability was degraded. And the qualities were not the same. But thankfully, we had practiced and we had gotten certified for manual control. And so we took over manual control.\"\n\nTeams were able to get all but one of the thrusters back online, and after Starliner docked, the helium leaks were blocked off, so the spacecraft has been safely attached to the ISS since. NASA and Boeing also signed off on Starliner's use in the event astronauts needed to make and emergency departure from the ISS.\n\nBut the regular departure is on hold while teams continue to pore over data related to the propulsion module problems.\n\n\"We're taking our time on the ground to go through all the data that we have before we decide on the return opportunity,\" said NASA Commercial Crew Program manager Steve Stich in a followup press conference . \"We're taking time to build confidence in the spacecraft to understand the thruster performance -- those aft thrusters that failed off during docking, and also totally understand the helium margins before we undock.\"\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reaction control system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Launch_Alliance", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Launch Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_V", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlas V"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thrust"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/297/29730/2973029.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716602", "eventUri": "eng-9716602", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 732, "textEnd": 738}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nShortly after they reached space, though, the Boeing spacecraft started glitching. They've been on the ISS ever since, while NASA and Boeing troubleshoot and insist the astronauts are \"not stranded.\"\n\nIn a brief call with journalists on Wednesday, Williams and Wilmore finally shared their take on the situation and described what it was like to realize something was wrong with their spaceship.\n\n\"Launch was spectacular. I mean, truly amazing,\" Wilmore said.\n\nThe astronauts were pressed back into their seats as the rocket roared through the atmosphere, then experienced the relief of microgravity as Starliner slid into orbit.\n\nThen, in space, they began checking the spaceship's operational capabilities and it \"performed unbelievably well,\" Wilmore said.\n\nAstronauts use a scale of 1 (best) to 10 (worst) to rate spacecraft handling qualities. Wilmore said he's never given a 1 rating before, \"but I was tempted.\"\n\nHe added, \"It was truly amazing, the precision that this spacecraft held\" -- until day two of the mission.\n\nAs they approached the space station, one of Starliner's 28 Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters unexpectedly shut down. Then another went offline.\n\n\"You could tell the thrust, the control, the capability was degraded. The handling qualities were not the same,\" Wilmore said.\n\nThe astronauts took manual control for over an hour while ground teams were troubleshooting. Ultimately, five RCS thrusters unexpectedly shut down. They got a few thrusters back, Wilmore said, but things weren't the same.\n\n\"From that point on, you could tell that the thrust was degraded,\" though they didn't know why at the time, Wilmore said.\n\nStill, when it came time to dock to the space station, where there were only a few inches of room for error, the spaceship did the job.\n\n\"Starliner came right down -- in automatic mode at this point -- right down the middle, even with the degraded thrusters, which was truly impressive knowing what we know now,\" Wilmore said.\n\nNASA has also discovered five leaks in Starliner's helium supply, which is used to pressurize its propulsion system.\n\nNASA is working to understand all the issues on the spacecraft and get more data to ensure the return trip will be safe. Engineers are testing an RCS thruster at NASA's White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico, trying to replicate the unexpected issues that arose mid-flight and ensure the thrusters will perform well on the return journey.\n\nIn the meantime, Wilmore and Williams have been busy working on experiments and station maintenance with the other astronauts on the space station.\n\n\"We've been thoroughly busy up here integrated right into the crew,\" Williams said. \"About once a week we get to jump into Starliner and talk to our control team there and work through all the nuances that they're working very hard on the ground.\"\n\nNASA requires Boeing to put Starliner through extensive testing to uncover issues like these. In addition to ground testing, the spaceship had to fly an uncrewed mission to the space station.\n\nThe first attempt never reached the space station and experienced multiple failures, but eventually, in a later uncrewed attempt, Starliner reached the ISS.\n\nThis crewed mission with Williams and Wilmore is supposed to be the final test to certify the spacecraft for routine astronaut missions, and the astronauts expected to uncover some imperfections.\n\nThe leaks and thruster failures are the latest of many issues Boeing has faced with its spacecraft over the years, which has set it far behind competitor SpaceX.\n\nSpaceX's Crew Dragon was developed on a similar timeline through the same NASA program as Starliner, but it finished testing and NASA certification in 2020. It's been flying people to and from the space station ever since.\n\nIt's not yet clear how the new issues will affect Boeing's ability to get its spacecraft into the regular space station rotation. Still, Wilmore and Williams expressed confidence.\n\n\"We are really satisfied with putting more people in the spacecraft once we get back and we work through all the issues that we've found already,\" Williams said.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "morgan_mcfall_johnsen@businessinsider.com", "name": "Morgan McFall-Johnsen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reaction control system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weightlessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thrust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Test_Facility", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Test Facility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/668ebd37b2528216eeb51cbd?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716602", "eventUri": "eng-9716602", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Wilmore are still waiting for the greenlight to return from low-orbit, as engineers attempt to understand why their Boeing Starliner capsule malfunctioned as it docked into the ISS.\n\nAt 11 a.m. EDT, the pair will provide updates on their mission, research activities, and likely answer a number of questions from the media about their prolonged stay in space.\n\nWilliams and Wilmore departed from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on June 5.\n\nTheir Boeing Starliner docked into the ISS, and the pair were initially expected to spend around eight days in orbit as a test-run for the Starliner in its first manned flight, before returning to Earth on June 14.\n\nHowever, as the spacecraft approached the ISS, five of its 28 thrusters unexpectedly shut down.\n\n\"NASA and Boeing continue to evaluate Starliner's propulsion system performance and five small helium leaks in the spacecraft's service module, gathering as much data as possible while docked to the International Space Station,\" a statement by the space agency said.\n\nTheir return date has since been pushed back to at least late July, as these issues are addressed.\n\nOn June 26, NASA said that Williams and Wilmore were not \"stranded,\" and that their delayed departure from the ISS is necessary for a full examination of the Starliner's technical issues.\n\nThe source of the problems lie in the Starliner's service module, a section of the craft which will detach upon its return to earth.\n\nAs a result, the issues must be examined while the aircraft is still in space.\n\nAccording to NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich, the team is in \"no rush\" to bring the astronauts home, and both Boeing and NASA have previously said that the Starliner can spend up to 45 days docked in the station.\n\nStarliner's second test flight was more successful, though backup thrusters were required to make it to the ISS after its main propulsion system experienced a failure.\n\nStarliner's current mission, its first crewed launch, was scheduled for July 2023.\n\nHowever, this was cancelled after NASA discovered several \"technical issues\" with the spacecraft.\n\nThese included a faulty

Is there a launch today? Upcoming SpaceX, NASA, ULA rocket launch schedule in Florida\n\nStarliner is one of two capsules built by private companies for NASA to ferry astronauts to the ISS. The other is SpaceX Crew Dragon, which made it's first crewed flight in 2020 and which has had 13 successful mission to the station so far.\n\nAfter years of setbacks, Boeing was finally able to launch the Starliner carrying Wilmore and Sunita Williams to the ISS last month on what was supposed to be a one-week mission.\n\nPrior to launch, a helium leak was found in the service module - the underneath of the Starliner capsule which contains thrusters and is disposed upon reentry. Boeing teams determined that the helium leak was small and contained, and proceeded with launch operations.\n\nAs the hours leading to docking with the ISS approached, addional helium leaks in the service module were detected. As the crew prepared for approach towards the ISS, multiple thrusters shut off, forcing teams on the ground to do what is called a \"hot fire\". As the crew manually piloted Starliner, all but one of the thrusters fired back up - allowing the crew to safely dock to the ISS.\n\nSince then, the crew's landing date had been pushed twice before being postponed indefinitely as teams continue to review data from the service module - which is lost during the return to Earth. With this being a test flight - Boeing and NASA are carefully looking over data to ensure proper development of future Starliner designs.\n\nNASA teams are looking at causes behind the issues leading to this point, and investigating all areas of future thruster performance - which is critical to the safe reentry of Starliner.\n\n\"We are actually doing thruster testing as we speak at White Sands New Mexico, going through that process, trying to replicate what we saw on that flight day,\" said Wilmore.\n\n\"We've practiced a lot so I have a feeling... I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring will bring us home no problem,\" said Williams.\n\nDuring the Wednesday morning NASA press briefing, Wilmore and Williams appeared on a video stream with a large American Flag in the background.\n\n\"Welcome aboard the International Space Station first. It's a great place to be a great place to live a great place to work,\" said Wilmore with a grin. \"As you can see the American flag behind us showing the pride in our nation and what we have been able to do to this point on this mission.\"\n\nWilmore said that on a scale of one to ten - with one being the best and ten being the worst - he is tempted to rate Starliner's handling as a one.\n\nDuring the approached to the ISS, multiple thrusters went down, leaving the crew to take manual control of the spacecraft. While they could tell the power was reduced, Wilmore said the handling \"was still impressive\".\n\n\"I'll just reiterate again, this is a test flight.

However, Starliner has experienced several mechanical issues, including helium leaks and a thruster issue, leaving the astronauts stuck onboard the ISS with no set return date.\n\nNASA has insisted Wilmore and Williams are safe while they remain onboard the ISS with the Expedition 71 crew. The agency has said the ISS has plenty of supplies in orbit, and the station's schedule is relatively open through mid-August.\n\n\"I want to make it clear that Butch and Suni aren't stranded in space,\" Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew program, said during a June 28 teleconference. \"Our plan is to continue to return them on Starliner and return them home at the right time.\"\n\nNASA and Boeing say Wilmore and Williams are \"integrated\" with the Expedition 71 crew aboard the ISS and are helping the crew with station operations as needed, as well as completing \"objectives\" needed for NASA's possible certification of Starliner.\n\n\"Since their arrival on June 6, Wilmore and Williams have completed half of all hands-on research time conducted aboard the space station, allowing their crewmates to prepare for the departure of Northrop Grumman's Cygnus spacecraft,\" NASA wrote in a recent update.\n\nThis week, teams at NASA's White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico are performing ground tests of Starliner's thruster, putting it through similar conditions the spacecraft experienced on its way to the ISS, according to an update on Boeing's website.\n\nThe tests will replicate Starliner's docking, when some of the thrusters failed, and what the thrusters will experience from undocking to landing back on Earth.\n\n\"We really want to understand the thruster and how we use it in flight,\" said Dan Niedermaier, the lead Boeing engineer for the thruster testing, in a statement. \"We will learn a lot from these thruster firings that will be valuable for the remainder of the Crew Flight Test and future missions.\"\n\nStarliner has been plagued by issues even before launch. The flight test was originally tentatively scheduled for May 6, but was scrubbed after a problem with an oxygen valve on a rocket from United Launch Alliance, which manufactures and operates the rockets that launch Starliner spacecraft into orbit.\n\nA new launch date was subsequently set for May 25, but then a small helium leak was discovered in the Starliner service module, which contains support systems and instruments for operating the spacecraft.\n\nThose helium leaks and a thruster issue threatened to delay Starliner's docking, but it docked successfully. Five days after docking at the ISS, NASA and Boeing announced that the spacecraft was experiencing five \"small\" helium leaks, but added at the time that enough helium remained for the return

However, their mission encountered significant challenges, including leaks and thruster failures, which nearly derailed their arrival at the International Space Station (ISS) and extended their stay beyond the planned duration.\n\nDuring their first news conference from orbit, the astronauts conveyed optimism about their return once thruster testing on Earth is completed.Both expressed no complaints about the unexpected extension of their mission, emphasizing their enjoyment in assisting the station crew.\n\n\"I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem,\" Williams assured reporters.\n\nThe duo rocketed into orbit on June 5 as part of a test flight initially slated to last eight days. Their extended mission has provided additional opportunities to collaborate with the ISS crew and further test the Starliner's capabilities.\n\nNasa commissioned the development of the Starliner and SpaceX Dragon capsules a decade ago, investing billions of dollars in each company to facilitate astronaut flights to and from the ISS. SpaceX successfully launched its first crewed taxi flight in 2020, while Boeing's inaugural crew flight faced numerous delays due to software and other technical issues.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Wilmore and Williams remain confident in the Starliner's ability to safely return them to Earth, highlighting the rigorous testing and advancements made since the program's inception.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

NASA officials will determine whether Starliner's battery can be sustained for that long before making a decision, Stich said.\n\nFive days after arriving at the ISS last month, Boeing announced Starliner was experiencing five \"small\" helium leaks, though it wasn't immediately clear how much helium was leaking. Despite the leak, Boeing said engineers determined the helium supply was sufficient to return Starliner to Earth. NASA delayed Starliner's return multiple times in June, later announcing the capsule wouldn't return until at least early July as the agency studied propulsion system issues. Both Williams and Wilmore have continued completing tests while aboard the ISS, according to Stich, who noted the two astronauts \"aren't stranded in space\" and would return home \"at the right time.\"\n\nBoeing's Starliner spacecraft faced setbacks even before launching last month. An earlier launch attempt was delayed, after officials discovered a helium leak on Starliner's service module.

Helium, while non-combustible, provides pressure to the propulsion system.\n\nWhat's more, some of Starliner's thrusters that provide fine maneuvering initially failed to kick in during its approach to the station, delaying docking.\n\nEngineers are not sure why the craft's computer \"deselected\" these thrusters, though they were able to restart all but one of them.\n\nIn a subsequent press call, Boeing executive Mark Nappi told reporters that the \"working theory\" for the thruster malfunction was overheating due to excessive firing.\n\nTheories on the cause of the helium leaks ranged from debris entering the propulsion system to Boeing possibly installing seals that were undersized for the task.\n\nNASA and Boeing insist Starliner could fly home in case of an emergency, particularly since the problems affected only certain thrusters that control orientation.\n\nThey have no concerns over any of the more powerful thrusters responsible for the \"deorbit burn\" that will bring the spaceship back.\n\nBut much remains unclear -- including whether the orientation control thrusters that malfunctioned have become degraded, which would make it necessary to rely on other thrusters during descent, NASA official Steve Stich said.\n\nHe insisted that NASA wasn't yet considering bringing Williams and Wilmore back on a SpaceX Crew Dragon, in what would amount to a major humiliation for the aerospace giant Boeing, whose reputation has taken a hit in recent years over the safety crisis affecting its commercial jets.\n\n\"The prime option today is to return Butch and Suni on Starliner,\" said Stich, while conceding that a return flight on a SpaceX spaceship can't be ruled out.\n\nIn 2014, both SpaceX and Boeing were awarded multibillion-dollar contracts by NASA to develop crewed spaceships after the retirement of the Space Shuttle program.

The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nWith their stay on the International Space Station (ISS) extended, NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams shared their views on Boeing's Starliner spacecraft during a media talk given earlier today. Wilmore and Williams took off on ULA's Atlas V rocket from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida early last month, and their mission has been extended as NASA and Boeing are evaluating Starliner's performance after troubles with its thrusters and seals. During their talk, the astronauts were praised for Starliner's performance and stressed that Starliner can return to Earth anytime.\n\nRight off the bat, the astronauts started their conference by commenting on Starliner's performance during its journey to the space station. After Starliner had separated from Atlas V, the astronauts started the ship's operational checks. During this time, Starliner's performance was perfect, shared Wilmore. On the Cooper-Harper rating scale, which evaluates a ship's handling, the astronaut was \"tempted\" to give the ship a score of ten because of the \"precision that this spacecraft held.\"\n\nMoving into the second day, as Starliner's thrusters started to develop problems, the crew had to control the spacecraft manually. During this time, the ship's \"capability was degraded,\" outlined Wilmore, while the \"handling qualities were not the same.\" However, despite the low power, performance was \"still impressive,\" believes the astronaut. As an example, he shared that when docking to the station, Starliner has a margin of \"five degrees in attitude and about four inches in position\". However, the ship \"came right down in automatic mode at this point, and right down the middle even with the degraded thrusters.\"\n\nWilliams added that after docking with the station, the crew practiced with Starliner as a safe haven in case of an emergency on the space station. Other tests involved evaluating the ship's habitability to ensure that the ship could support four people. These included evaluating Starliner's environmental control systems, and the ship \"worked really well,\" according to the astronaut.\n\nLater in the day, NASA and Boeing officials shared more details about Starliner's return. NASA's Steve Stich outlined that teams are currently testing thrusters on Earth to understand the faults in these systems during Starliner's approach to the ISS. Starliner can return to Earth before SpaceX's Crew 9 mission takes off, but NASA and Boeing will decide on a timeline after the ground tests are complete.\n\nStarliner is a \"go to return in an emergency, if, if the crew needed to return in any point in time,\" shared Stich, and NASA will conduct a standard review for return before it proceeds with any such mission.

Watch in the player above.\n\nThe astronauts have had to stay longer at the International Space Station as engineers work on problems that cropped up on the trip with Boeing's new space capsule.\n\nNASA on Friday did not set a return date until testing on the ground was complete and said the astronauts were safe.\n\n\"We're not in any rush to come home,\" said NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich.\n\nVeteran NASA test pilots Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams blasted off aboard Boeing's Starliner capsule for the orbiting laboratory on June 5. It was the first astronaut launch for Boeing after years of delays and setbacks.\n\nThe test flight was expected to last a week or so, enough time for Wilmore and Williams to check out the capsule while docked at the station. But problems with the capsule's propulsion system, used to maneuver the spacecraft, prompted NASA and Boeing to delay the flight home several times while they analyzed the trouble.\n\nThey also wanted to avoid conflicting with spacewalks by station astronauts. But a spacewalk this week was canceled after water leaked from an astronaut's spacesuit. The issue hasn't been resolved and the planned spacewalk next week was postponed.\n\nAs Starliner closed in on the space station a day after launch, last-minute thruster failures almost derailed the docking. Five of the capsule's 28 thrusters went down during docking; all but one thruster was restarted.\n\nStarliner already had one small helium leak when it rocketed into orbit and several more leaks sprung up during the flight. Helium is used to pressurize fuel for the thrusters. Boeing said this week that the two problems aren't a concern for the return trip.\n\nIn delaying the astronauts' return, NASA and Boeing said they needed more time to collect information about the thruster trouble and leaks while the capsule was docked. Both are in the service module, a unit attached to the capsule that burns up during reentry.\n\nNASA initially said the Starliner could stay docked at the space station for up to 45 days due to battery limits. But in-flight tests have shown that limit can be extended, Stich said.\n\nOfficials said they won't set a return date while they do ground tests of capsule thrusters in the New Mexico desert, which were expected to last a couple of weeks. They want to try to replicate the situation that occurred during docking.\n\n\"I want to make it very clear that Butch and Suni are not stranded in space,\" said Stich, adding that Starliner is designed for a mission of up to 210 days.\n\nStich said the astronauts could return to Earth in Starliner in the case of a space station emergency.\n\nAfter the space shuttle fleet retired, NASA turned over astronaut rides to private companies.

The test mission was scheduled to last about a week, but Starliner's undocking was delayed several times as faulty thrusters and then a series of small helium leaks raised safety concerns.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nasa announced that it was still performing tests to ensure the capsule would perform as expected, and although the space agency was confident the craft would be safe for an emergency evacuation, mission managers were not yet ready to schedule its departure.\n\n\"Some of the data suggests optimistically, maybe it's by the end of July, but we'll just follow the data each step at a time,\" Steve Stich, Nasa's commercial crew program manager, said at a lunchtime press conference.\n\n\"We're going to work methodically through our processes, including a return flight readiness review with the agency, before we get the go to proceed towards undocking and landing. This is a very standard process.\"\n\nHe added that a routine ISS crew rotation in mid-August was \"kind of a back end\" to the mission to avoid overcrowding in orbit.\n\n\"Obviously, a few days before that launch opportunity we would need to get Butch and Suni home on Starliner,\" he said.\n\nBut he noted that the space station, currently occupied by a regular crew of seven in addition to the two Starliner astronauts, had sufficient supplies and resources, and there was no risk to anybody aboard.\n\nThat, he said, gave engineers time to perform ground fire evaluations of replica thrusters at Nasa's White Sands test facility in New Mexico, and close out the helium leak issues he believed could be signed off by the end of this week.\n\nMark Nappi, vice-president and program manager of Boeing's commercial crew program, told reporters that he was confident the Starliner program would emerge stronger because of the issues.\n\n\"All this information is going to go in a big bucket, and all the engineers are going to review it and try to see if it doesn't point to root cause or point to some additional testing that we can do in the future to eliminate this problem once and for all,\" he said.\n\nAlthough Boeing's space operations are separate from its aviation wing, the ongoing problems with Starliner have added to the company's recent public relations crisis, sparked by the crash of two 737 Max airliners and a number of other safety related incidents.\n\nDespite being years behind schedule and more than $1.5bn over budget when it launched from Florida on 5 June, Starliner was intended to restore some of the company's lost luster and offer Nasa a second private commercial crew alternative for the transportation of astronauts in lower earth orbit to SpaceX's Dragon capsule.\n\nIf the current test mission concludes successfully, Starliner capsules, known officially as CST-100 (crew space transportation), will operate six further astronaut rotation flights to the space station as part of Nasa's commercial crew program.\n\nRelated: Two US astronauts stuck in space as Boeing analyzes Starliner problems\n\nWilmore, speaking from the ISS earlier on Wednesday, said he and Williams were enjoying their \"extra\" time in space, and were unconcerned by the technical problems.\n\n\"This is the world of test. This is a tough business that we're in, human spaceflight is not easy in any regime, and there have been multiple issues with every spacecraft that's ever been designed,\" he said.\n\n\"We are very close friends with those that are making these decisions, and we trust them. We trust their integrity, we trust their technical acumen, and we trust that the tests that we're doing are the ones that we need to do to get the right answers to give us the data that we need to come back.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Missile Range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar_System", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Solar System", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_the_guardian_uk_429/78c66f4920e4c794290535808f6f10ac", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716602", "eventUri": "eng-9716602", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 434, "textEnd": 440}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 2922, "textEnd": 2928}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

NASA astronauts were supposed to stay in orbit for eight days.\n\nHowever, Boeing's Starliner has been plagued by problems and its return to Earth has been repeatedly delayed.\n\nDuring their extended stay on the ISS, the astronauts have been forced to take shelter in the spacecraft when a Russian satellite exploded nearby.\n\nHowever, if they needed to evacuate, Starliner may have struggled to get away from the space station.\n\nThe spacecraft's propulsion system is faulty, which is how it backs the capsule away from the ISS and positions itself to dive through Earth's atmosphere.\n\nMany of Starliner's thrusters have overheated when fired and leaks of helium, used to pressurise the thrusters, appear to be connected to how frequently they are used, according to NASA's commercial crew manager Steve Stich.\n\nHow stuck are they?\n\nBoeing insists the astronauts are \"not stuck\" and says \"there's no increased risk when we decide to bring Suni and Butch back to Earth,\" according to Mark Nappi, manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nStarliner is able to spend 45 days docked on the ISS, or up to 72 days at a push, relying on backup systems.\n\nIf the astronauts still couldn't use it to come back to Earth, they could hitch a lift with other crews up there.\n\nRussia's Soyuz spacecraft is due to take three people back to Earth in September and SpaceX's Crew Dragon Capsule should return in August.\n\nButch and Suni aren't in \"any danger\", according to Mr Nappi and also aren't even very stuck by space station standards.\n\nRead more from Sky News:\n\nMost

This is the first Crewed Flight Test of the Boeing Starliner, and the purpose of the mission is to understand the brand new developmental hardware to the greatest extent possible. The Service Module attached to the Boeing Starliner has sprung leaks, has a busted valve, and the thrusters were not functioning nominally. The ground teams do not know enough about the problems to fix them permanently.\n\nOn the ground, teams are replicating the entire series of firings in a simulated vacuum environment, from the start of the mission. The teams will also be firing the thrusters in the hardware simulation, for the planned sequence in the next phase of the mission, which is the undocking, reentry and landing. The teams are meticulously eliminating all the potential causes of the problems encountered. The Service Module will be jettisoned before reentry and will not survive the atmospheric friction. Everyone involved in the development of the vehicle are committed to learning as much about it as possible.\n\nEarlier today, the crew of the Boeing Starliner, Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore spoke to reporters directly from the International Space Station. Barry Wilmore noted that the spaceship handled impressively well even after the thrusters stopped working nominally on the second day of the flight, as the Boeing Starliner approached for the docking with the International Space Station.\n\nBarry Wilmore said, \"Coming into docking, those final ten metres, we have a tolerance, we can actually connect with the space station five degrees in attitude, and about four inches in position. Starliner came right down in automatic mode at this point, and right down the middle, even with degraded thrusters. That was truly impressive, given what we know now.\"\n\nSunita Williams gave a recap of the battery of tests conducted once the Boeing Starliner had docked, including practicing the 'Safe Haven' mode, where the hatch is closed and the spaceship is prepared to undock and depart from the International Space Station. The Boeing Starliner is designed for standard crew rotations for four astronauts, which are about six months long. The two astronauts, took the help of other astronauts on board the International Space Station to validate the systems on the Boeing Starliner for a crew of four people, and the Boeing Starliner aced those tests.\n\nSunita Williams said, \"I will just reiterate again, this is a test flight, we were expecting to find some things, so we are finding stuff, and we are correcting it, making changes, making updates with our control team. Every day we had conferences to go over things that we found or we thought about that we might add for the next flight.\"\n\nSunita Williams is the pilot, while Barry Wilmore is the commander of the Boeing Starliner Crew Flight Test, and both have been working closely with Boeing during the development of the vehicle, continuously providing feedback. Barry Wilmore is a former navy test pilot who had spent 167 days in space before the Boeing Starliner flight, while Sunita Williams is also a former navy test pilot as well as a test pilot instructor, and has previously spent 322 days in space. Sunita Williams danced in microgravity on returning to the International Space station.\n\nSunita Williams and Barry Wilmore are extra hands on the International Space Station, and they know the orbital platform inside out. The two astronauts are maintaining and upgrading the space station, helping out in planned extra vehicular activities, and have completed half of all hands-on science experiments. Sunita Williams conducted audited American stuff stashed in the Zarya module, while Barry Wilmore packed trash into the departing Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo craft, that will depart and burn up over a remote portion of the South Pacific Ocean on July 12.\n\nThe program manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, Steve Stitch, and the Vice President and Program Manager of the Commercial Crew Program at Boeing, Mark Nappi spoke to reporters after Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams spoke to reporters from the International Space Station. Steve Stitch said, \"We are taking our time on the ground to go through all the data that we have before we decide on the return opportunity. We're taking time to build confidence in this spacecraft, to understand the thruster performance, and also thoroughly understanding the helium margins before we undock. What we are doing is not unusual for a new spacecraft.\"\n\nAs the International Space Station is juicing up the batteries of the docked Boeing Starliner, the orbital platform is almost serving as a temporary hangar for the spaceship. The ground teams have the luxury of time to understand more about the spacecraft before the undocking and return. The ground tests of the thruster systems in the vacuum chamber is progressing well, with the teams even simulating the influence of solar rays on the thrusters, as the thrusters that did not function nominally were on the side of the spaceship facing the Sun. The teams are also double and triple checking the helium margins.\n\nMark Nappi said, \"We knew that there would be some learning from this flight test. We have learned a great deal on how the hardware works, how our processes work, and how we can improve the things that we have been doing, even to the extent of how we've been sharing information to the public through you (the reporters). You have done a nice job at giving us feedback so that we can make adjustments for the future.\"", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aditya_madanapalle@news9live.com", "name": "Aditya Madanapalle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_E._Wilmore", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barry E.

Share your photos]\n\nFor one, NASA has sought more time to study problems in Starliner's propulsion system while the capsule is still at the space station because the system is designed to separate from the capsule and burn up upon reentry. As far as the helium -- which is used to pressurize the fuel lines of the propulsion system -- mission managers say there's enough left.\n\n\"We don't understand these issues well enough to fix them permanently, and the only way that we can do that is take the time in this unique environment and go and get more data, run more tests,\" Nappi said at a teleconference in June.\n\nAccording to Stich, Wilmore and Williams have proven it's possible to power up Starliner, close the hatch and have it ready to go in case of an emergency at the space station, making note of how the capsule was used as a safe haven on June 26 when there was a satellite breakup.\n\n\"I want to make it clear -- Butch and Suni are not stranded in space,\" Stich said during the teleconference. \"Our plan is to continue to return them on Starliner and return them home at the right time.

During the address, the astronauts discussed their experiences, the challenges faced during the mission, and ongoing efforts to resolve the technical issues with their spacecraft.\n\nNASA invited media to join the live Earth-to-space call, where Williams and Wilmore provided insights into the Boeing Crew Flight Test mission and shared their thoughts on the future of space exploration. The event underscored the resilience and dedication of the astronauts and NASA's commitment to ensuring their safe return.\n\n\"I have a good feeling that the spacecraft will bring us home,\" she affirmed.\n\nWilmore also mentioned his observations from space. \"I took photos of a storm on the west coast of Africa. I am confident that it was the one that became Hurricane Beryl. It looked impressive from space,\" he said. \"We could also take photos of the eye right before it hit Texas, USA,\" Williams added.\n\nA detailed conference with NASA and Boeing Starliner officials is scheduled for later in the day, promising further insights into the mission and the path forward.\n\n**", "source": {"uri": "weather.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Weather Channel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DNA sequencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microscope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "3D printing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Crewed_Flight_Test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Crewed Flight Test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://s.w-x.co/in-sunitw.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716602", "eventUri": "eng-9716602", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 75, "textEnd": 81}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 198, "textEnd": 205}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

You can tune in to NASA's YouTube channel, NASA TV, its app or X handle for the viewing. You can also check out NASA's website for the webcast.\n\nALSO SEE: Boeing Calls Out 'Painful' Media Coverage Of Starliner Amid Sunita Williams's Extended Stay\n\nWhen are Williams and Wilmore returning?\n\nNo date has been finalised for the return of the two astronauts. We might get an update in the July 10 conference. Their stay has been extended several times due to helium leaks and thruster malfunction on Starliner which were detected after it was in space with the two astronauts.\n\nBoeing is insisting that the duo is not stuck in space and that they are collecting as much data as possible about Starliner's capabilities.\n\nAfter carrying out update and system checkouts, Chloe Mehring, the Starliner flight director, said last week, \"Starliner is healthy and no anomalies were written against the spacecraft.\"\n\nThese checkouts included testing the thrusters which were fired in orbit. \"We will learn a lot from these thruster firings that will be valuable for the remainder of the Crew Flight Test and future missions,\" said Dan Niedermaier, the lead Boeing engineer for the thruster testing.\n\nALSO SEE: ISRO Chief Speaks On Sunita Williams Being 'Stuck' In Space; 'ISS Is A Safe Place'\n\nThe CFT is Boeing's debut mission with humans to win a NASA contract for routine trips to the space station. Currently, SpaceX is the only company that offers rides to NASA astronauts to the ISS. For cargo transportation, NASA avails services from SpaceX and Northrop Grumman.\n\nPrior to CFT, Boeing launched two uncrewed missions, only one of which was ruled a success. The first one in 2019 failed to dock with the space station and had to return for landing. The second in 2022 faced a few hiccups but was called a success as it docked with the station and returned after completing the objectives.\n\n(Image: NASA)", "source": {"uri": "in.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_E._Wilmore", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barry E.

Both companies were awarded multi-billion-dollar contracts in 2014 to provide the US space agency with rides to the ISS, with SpaceX succeeding in 2020 and carrying dozens of people since.\n\nia/mlm\n\nMore from this section\n\nVice Capital Markets Launches Integration with Fannie Mae Mission Score API\n\nDr. Anju Mathur Supports Chronic Disease Day with Functional Medicine for a Blue Zone Lifestyle\n\nEighteen homebuyer assistance programs offering up to $117,000 are available to help people with disabilities and family caregivers purchase or modify a home", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@kulr8.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weightlessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weightlessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_support", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life support"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Urine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_maneuver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orbital maneuver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Residential_Housing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Residential Housing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kulr8.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/83/d83f88fe-5edf-5810-a22b-1834a2132398/668ec59514dc3.image.jpg?crop=512%2C269%2C0%2C36&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716602", "eventUri": "eng-9716602", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 251, "textEnd": 257}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

This is the first Crewed Flight Test of the Boeing Starliner, and the purpose of the mission is to understand the brand new developmental hardware to the greatest extent possible. The Service Module attached to the Boeing Starliner has sprung leaks, has a busted valve, and the thrusters were not functioning nominally. The ground teams do not know enough about the problems to fix them permanently.\n\nOn the ground, teams are replicating the entire series of firings in a simulated vacuum environment, from the start of the mission. The teams will also be firing the thrusters in the hardware simulation, for the planned sequence in the next phase of the mission, which is the undocking, reentry and landing. The teams are meticulously eliminating all the potential causes of the problems encountered. The Service Module will be jettisoned before reentry and will not survive the atmospheric friction. Everyone involved in the development of the vehicle are committed to learning as much about it as possible.\n\nEarlier today, the crew of the Boeing Starliner, Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore spoke to reporters directly from the International Space Station. Barry Wilmore noted that the spaceship handled impressively well even after the thrusters stopped working nominally on the second day of the flight, as the Boeing Starliner approached for the docking with the International Space Station.\n\nBarry Wilmore said, \"Coming into docking, those final ten metres, we have a tolerance, we can actually connect with the space station five degrees in attitude, and about four inches in position. Starliner came right down in automatic mode at this point, and right down the middle, even with degraded thrusters. That was truly impressive, given what we know now.\"\n\nSunita Williams gave a recap of the battery of tests conducted once the Boeing Starliner had docked, including practicing the 'Safe Haven' mode, where the hatch is closed and the spaceship is prepared to undock and depart from the International Space Station. The Boeing Starliner is designed for standard crew rotations for four astronauts, which are about six months long. The two astronauts, took the help of other astronauts on board the International Space Station to validate the systems on the Boeing Starliner for a crew of four people, and the Boeing Starliner aced those tests.\n\nSunita Williams said, \"I will just reiterate again, this is a test flight, we were expecting to find some things, so we are finding stuff, and we are correcting it, making changes, making updates with our control team. Every day we had conferences to go over things that we found or we thought about that we might add for the next flight.\"\n\nSunita Williams is the pilot, while Barry Wilmore is the commander of the Boeing Starliner Crew Flight Test, and both have been working closely with Boeing during the development of the vehicle, continuously providing feedback. Barry Wilmore is a former navy test pilot who had spent 167 days in space before the Boeing Starliner flight, while Sunita Williams is also a former navy test pilot as well as a test pilot instructor, and has previously spent 322 days in space. Sunita Williams danced in microgravity on returning to the International Space station.\n\nSunita Williams and Barry Wilmore are extra hands on the International Space Station, and they know the orbital platform inside out. The two astronauts are maintaining and upgrading the space station, helping out in planned extra vehicular activities, and have completed half of all hands-on science experiments. Sunita Williams conducted audited American stuff stashed in the Zarya module, while Barry Wilmore packed trash into the departing Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo craft, that will depart and burn up over a remote portion of the South Pacific Ocean on July 12.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aditya_madanapalle@news9live.com", "name": "Aditya Madanapalle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_E._Wilmore", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barry E.

Leaks and thruster failures almost derailed their arrival at the International Space Station, and has kept them there much longer than planned.\n\nIn their first news conference from orbit, they said they expect to return once thruster testing is complete here on Earth. They said they're not complaining about getting extra time in orbit, and are enjoying helping the station crew.\n\n\"I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem,\" Williams told reporters.\n\nThe two rocketed into orbit on June 5 on the test flight, which was originally supposed to last eight days.\n\nNASA ordered up the Starliner and SpaceX Dragon capsules a decade ago for astronaut flights to and from the space station, paying each company billions of dollars. SpaceX's first taxi flight with astronauts was in 2020. Boeing's first crew flight was repeatedly delayed because of software and other issues.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

In a media conference Wednesday, the agency said it's targeting a return date at the end of the month, but it hasn't yet committed to a hard date. Testing that should help explain a persistent problem is expected to wrap up later this week, at which point the mission will have more clarity about an ending.\n\nTwo astronauts have been stuck in orbit aboard the International Space Station since early June due to the Starliner's issues. The main point of concern continues to be figuring out what is going on with the thrusters that would guide the spacecraft back to Earth. Leaks in the helium storage tanks that control the thrusters, which led to multiple delays for the Starliner launch, aren't expected to endanger a return flight; at a June 18 press conference, officials reiterated that the ship needs seven hours of helium to make it home and has 70 hours' worth aboard. Though they said the craft could come home right now if needed, they also said they're not quite ready for it to do so.\n\n\"We're taking the chance to look under every rock and stone to make sure there's nothing else that might surprise us,\" said Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program.\n\nDuring a question-and-answer session with reporters, Stitch and Mark Nappi, Boeing's commercial crew program manager, toggled between expressing their confidence that a safe return mission could happen -- \"We do have a lot of confidence in the thrusters as they are today,\" Nappi said -- and a hesitancy to say that everything was A-OK.\n\nBesides concern that harm might befall Barry Wilmore and Sunita Williams, the astronauts that crewed the Starliner launch, there were questions about whether NASA would call off a return trip and send the pair home on another spacecraft. In that case, Boeing rival SpaceX would be the company giving them a life.

The Starliner is almost completely powered down while docked and is powered (batteries recharging) by the ISS while docked.\"\n\nThe company carried out a hot fire test on Starliner last month that helped most of the thrusters become functional again.\n\nNow it is carrying out ground tests in New Mexico, in which it would be replicating thruster issues the craft had inside a vacuum chamber to learn more about the problem.\n\nMark Nappi, vice president and programme manager of the Commercial Crew Programme for Boeing, had said in a media briefing on June 28 that they could run one more hot fire test.\n\n\"So if (the test in New Mexico) comes back and gives us all the answers, then we can just undock and come home,\" he said.\n\n\"If it comes back and says, 'here's 80 per cent of the answer. And if you just run one more docked hot fire, then you can get 100 per cent of the answers - then we want (Starliner) to be there so that we can get that information.\"\n\nNasa said yesterday that once the ground testing and data analysis are complete, the agency and Boeing will carry out a review before a return date is set, with an update on the situation to be provided on Wednesday during a media briefing. It is not clear whether a date will be announced.\n\nThe Starliner launch was meant to help Boeing rebuilt its reputation, which was impacted by two crashes involving 737 Max 8 jets and a mid-flight door panel blowout on a 737 Max 9 jet earlier this year.\n\nIt has a $4.2 billion contract under Nasa's Commercial Crew Programme to help safely launch and bring back astronauts for the agency.\n\nHowever, the development of Starliner has been plagued with delays because of various technical issues over the past decade.\n\nMeanwhile, Elon Musk's SpaceX, which is also part of Nasa's Commercial Crew Programme, has already launched eight crews for the agency.\n\n\"Part of the fault at the very beginning was due to the lack of clarity provided by Boeing and Nasa but they themselves were trying to first understand the issue fully before reporting back to the press,\" said Mr Flachbart.\n\n\"Boeing's other issues involving its aviation business has also contributed to the media's negative coverage of Boeing in general.\n\n\"Therefore, Boeing Space and Starliner has suffered during this period from a lot more negative press than it deserves.\n\n\"The overall delays to this first Starliner crewed mission have also impacted the media's coverage.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He said the two astronauts tested a \"Safe Haven procedure,\" sheltering inside Starliner in the event they needed to suddenly undock from the ISS. The test went well.\n\nHe said everything is in place \"as what we know now\". He said the team is doing \"thruster testing\"\n\n\"We've been through a lot of simulations...and I think where we are right now...I feel confident that if we had to, if there was a problem with the International Space Station, we could get in our spacecraft, we could undock, talk to our team and figure out the best way to come home,\" Williams added.\n\nAbout their stay at the International Space Station, Wilmore said, \"It's a great place to be, a great place to live and a great place to work.\" He also shared details about their first few days on the mission.\n\nThe launch was spectacular, it's been truly amazing and then we got into our operational capabilities checks, and the spacecraft performed unbelievably well,\" Wilmore said.\n\nHe said as they moved into Day 2 \"we lost one RCS jet (reaction control system) and then we lost another one and then you can tell the thrust, the control and the capability was degraded...\"\n\n\"But thankfully, we had practised and got certified in manual controls. We took over manual controls for over an hour...the teams on the ground did troubleshooting and we got a couple of jets back, and from that point on, you can tell that the thrust was degraded -- at the time we did not know why...but it was still impressive,\" Wilmore said.\n\nMeanwhile, Sunita Williams reiterated that this was a test flight and they were expecting to find some things. \"We are correcting it and making some changes and making updates with our control teams...,\" she added. She said there were suggestions on what could be added on for the next flight.\n\nSunita Williams said they still had a lot of checks for Starliner, and they all went very well. \"One of them was practising for safe haven, to make sure that we have all the emergency equipment hat laid out and we need to have to get into or spacecraft and use it as a safe haven - in case something happens to the space station,\" she said.\n\nWilliams said there were tests to make sure that the spacecraft had the capability to support four people. \"So we are really satisfied with putting more people in the spacecraft once we get back and work through all the issues we have found already.\"\n\nMilestone Alert!

And we're going to incorporate new processes, new procedures that we will employ if necessary.\"\n\nBut just to be on the safe side, Steve Stich, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program, said the team has \"dusted off\" plans originally developed when the Russian Soyuz spacecraft that carried NASA astronaut Frank Rubio to the station developed a coolant leak.\n\nIn that case, preliminary plans were drawn up to possibly bring Rubio down on a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule if worse came to worse. As it turned out, the Russians launched a replacement Soyuz and those plans were not needed.\n\n\"In that case, we decided to use Dragon as a contingency return option for Frank ... to use it as a lifeboat,\" Stich said. \"We had a configuration of Frank in the middeck of Dragon. I mean, certainly we've dusted off a few of those things to look at relative to Starliner, just to be prepared.\n\n\"But again, our prime option is to return Butch on Suni on Starliner. ... We're pretty far away from where we were with the Soyuz. We just want to understand the thrusters a little bit more before we commit to the final undock and return.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Williams said she and Wilmore were enjoying the extra time in space.\n\n\"We are having a great time here on ISS,\" she said. \"You know, Butch and I have been up here before, and it feels like ... coming back home. It feels good to float around. It feels good to be in space and work up here with the International Space Station team.\n\n\"So, yeah, it's great to be up here,\" she said. \"So I'm not complaining, Butch isn't complaining that we're here for a couple extra weeks.\"\n\nRunning four years behind schedule, the Starliner was launched June 5, a month later than planned due to minor problems with the crew's Atlas 5 booster, trouble with a countdown computer and because of a small helium leak in the capsule's aft service module. Helium is used to pressurize the Starliner's propulsion system so jets can fire as needed.\n\nAfter extensive analysis, NASA and Boeing managers decided the leak was not a safety threat and the Starliner was cleared for launch as is.\n\nOnce in orbit and on the way to the space station, however, four more helium leaks developed. In addition, the Starliner's flight computer took several aft-facing maneuvering jets off line when the telemetry did not match pre-set operating parameters.\n\nOne thruster was deemed unusable going forward, but the others were successfully test fired later. That \"hot-fire\" test gave engineers confidence the jets needed for post-undocking maneuvers, and to keep the Starliner steady during the critical de-orbit rocket firing, will work as needed to set the ship up for re-entry.\n\nThe thrusters in question were facing the sun during long stretches of the Starliner's approach to the station and engineers suspect the problems experienced earlier were related high temperatures and the rapidity of firings during final approach. They are trying to duplicate those conditions in the ground testing.\n\nAs for the helium leaks, the propulsion system isn't used while docked to the space station. The system was pressurized for the hot-fire test, but otherwise valves have been closed as always planned to isolate the helium tanks, eliminating additional leakage.\n\nThe system will be repressurized for undocking to enable the maneuvers required to get home. But engineers have said there is 10 times more helium in the tanks than needed for the return trip, providing a comfortable margin even if any of the known leaks got worse.\n\n\"I envision that we'll still do testing before we undock, actually first open the helium valves and then secondly once we undock to make sure everything is working correctly, as it's planned from what they found out during the thruster testing,\" Williams said. \"So I have confidence, Butch has confidence.\"\n\nAll of the hardware in question is located in the Starliner's service module, which is jettisoned just prior to atmospheric entry. As such, engineers will never be able to examine the equipment first hand. Williams said it only made sense to extend the mission to do as much testing as possible before coming home.\n\n\"If we just came home, we'd lose the SM (service module) and then we wouldn't be able to go through all this testing and understand about our spacecraft,\" she said.\n\nStich did not say when the crew might be cleared to undock. The next Crew Dragon crew rotation flight is scheduled for launch in mid August and \"a few days before that launch opportunity, we would need to get Butch and Suni home on Starliner.\"\n\n\"So that's kind of a back end,\" he said. \"We're really working to try to follow the data and see when's the earliest that we could we could target for undock and landing. I think some of the data suggests, optimistically maybe, it's by the end of July. But we'll just follow the data (and) figure out when the right undock opportunity is.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soyuz_(spacecraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soyuz (spacecraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Rubio_(astronaut)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Rubio (astronaut)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_command_and_service_module", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apollo command and service module"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Missile Range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booster_(rocketry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Booster (rocketry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buoyancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial_Life", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Extraterrestrial Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/10/cbb91e1f-9693-4e92-a083-3faeaf8b9eca/thumbnail/1200x630/7eb0e8135a1f95c35d0d53c24a067ef2/071024-cft-crew.jpg?v=2287029998c5246c93d6dd038eb30603", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716602", "eventUri": "eng-9716602", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 301, "textEnd": 307, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 458340432, "relevance": 2}

They hosted a live briefing from the ISS with reporters on July 10 to discuss the future of the mission and efforts to resolve issues with Starliner before scheduling a return flight.\n\nSteve Stich, program manager for NASA's Commercial Crew Program, told reporters on July 10 that Boeing and NASA are \"optimistically\" looking toward a late-July return window but that nothing is certain yet.\n\n\"We'll just follow the data each step at a time. And then, at the right time, figure out when the right undock opportunity is,\" he said.\n\nMr. Wilmore described the June 5 launch as \"spectacular\" and \"truly amazing\" and emphasized that he is \"absolutely confident\" that Boeing's spacecraft will return him and Ms. Williams safely to Earth.\n\nMs. Williams suggested that Starliner is ready for a return flight now if necessary.\n\n\"I feel confident that if we had to, if there was a problem with the International Space Station, we can get in our spacecraft, and we can undock, talk to our team, and figure out the best way to come home,\" she said.\n\n\"I have a real good feeling in my heart that the spacecraft will bring us home, no problem,\" Ms. Williams added.\n\nWhen asked if Boeing's years of delays to ready the spacecraft for its first crewed mission has affected his confidence in Starliner, Mr. Wilmore said spaceflight is a \"world of test\" and that \"failure is not an option.\"\n\nHe said Hurricane Beryl's hitting Texas created a \"little bit of a hiccup\" to NASA crews in Texas this week, but testing is still underway on another Starliner capsule at White Sands Test Facility in Las Cruces, New Mexico. The goal is to replicate what happened to thrusters before they went offline after takeoff and determine the exact cause of the helium leak.\n\nThe issue, Mr. Stich pointed out, is replicating the same temperatures at White Sands that Starliner experienced during flight. The spacecraft is still ready for a return in the event of an emergency, he added.\n\n\"If the crew needed to return at any point in time, it's go for return for any kind of emergency on board [the ISS],\" Mr. Stich said.\n\nNASA had said before launch that Starliner was limited to docking with the ISS for 45 days due to limitations in its battery cells. Mr. Stich explained that battery capacity shouldn't limit Starliner's time at the ISS, as the crew hasn't seen any \"degradation\" in the cells.\n\n\"If you don't see any signs the battery is degrading, or even cells are degrading, then your risk level for a given day is the same,\" he said.\n\nThat would mean the risk of the batteries failing would be the same on day 45 as it is today, Mr. Stich explained.\n\nEven if Starliner was forced to undergo an emergency undocking and reentry, the propulsion and thruster system could handle the flight, said Mark Nappi, vice president and program manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Program.\n\n\"If we were to have to do that today, we would just perform a nominal undocking and return. The propulsion system is highly redundant on each other, so if there was an issue with any one of the thrusters, the redundancy would take over and bring it safely home again,\" Mr. Nappi said.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Test_Facility", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Test Facility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Missile Range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmospheric entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Cruces,_New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Cruces, New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Cruces, New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/30/id5677739-NASA-astronauts-AP24180573043757-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716602", "eventUri": "eng-9716602", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 97, "textEnd": 104, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 488, "textEnd": 494, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 458348194, "relevance": 2}

That's what we do. That's what we do in this business. We're going to get the data that we need to help inform our decisions, so we make the right decisions.

The trip was extended to June 18, but now officials say the \"earliest they could return may be the end of July,\" per AP News.\n\nOn July 2, NASA's commercial crew program manager Steve Stich said the two astronauts \"are not stranded in space\" when concerns were raised about their return, according to ABC News.\n\nAt the time, Stich said there is currently no targeted date for the astronauts return, per CBS News. \"We're not going to target a specific date until we get that testing completed,\" he said, later adding, \"I think we're on a good path.\"\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nBoeing program manager Mark Nappi previously told CBS News that the Starliner has not experienced any new issues as they work to resolve the old ones, and believes \"we can return with Starliner at any time.\"\n\nNappi insisted: \"We're not stuck on ISS.

The ground testing is being done to \"make sure that with all these pulses and all the heat we're putting into it, that it doesn't cause any damage to the thruster,\" Stich said.Stich noted that an \"end of July\" return for Starliner is \"optimistic ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Starliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Starliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunita Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Space Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Space_Force_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cape Canaveral Space Force Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_and_Checkout_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operations and Checkout Building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kennedy Space Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_suit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Space suit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neil Armstrong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Crew_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commercial Crew Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Endeavour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Space Shuttle Endeavour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sands_Missile_Range", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White Sands Missile Range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SpaceX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Space", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Storage", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Storage", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Space", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 70}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716602", "eventUri": "eng-9716602", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 2262, "textEnd": 2268}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 458348701, "relevance": 2}

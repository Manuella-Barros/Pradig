Speaking at a seminar organised by the Comparative Law and Law Reform Cluster of the Faculty of Law, North-Eastern University, Gombe, Dr Umar Alkali, Dean Faculty of Law, North-Eastern University Gombe said children from such parents are at risk of unsecured future. Arewa PUNCH reports that Alkali made this disclosure during his presentation on \u2018Parental child abduction from the lenses of Nigerian laws,\u2019 describing forceful ownership of the child without the other parent\u2019s acceptance or court pronouncement as a crime. Alkali said, \u201cIt\u2019s a fact that this offence is committed in all parts of the country and from people you don\u2019t expect to see such a behaviour from. People who are enlightened, people in remote villages are into it. \u201cWe looked at the punishment of the offence as it relates to children because of the nature of the offence people will want to go low in doing it which makes the child more vulnerable.\u201d Speaking further, the Dean added, \u201cThe Nigerian laws didn\u2019t specify on parental child abduction. If you have not been given lawful custody of the child, you don\u2019t have the right to hold on to the child. In fact, you lack the right to take the child even if he or she is your child by force. \u201cIt\u2019s our message, and it\u2019s on both sides. It\u2019s not all the time that the fathers are culpable, even the mothers. Parents usually feel they can\u2019t abduct their children, but often, the issue comes up after separation or when the marriage is dissolved. The child is one and has to stay with one of the parents whosoever gets the custody is the lawful person to be in custody of the child. \u201cWhosoever didn\u2019t get the right and takes the child by force without following due process has abducted his child.\u201d He called on stakeholders to intensify sensitisation on the subject matter, saying, \u201cThere is the need for public enlightenment for parents to understand that it has far-reaching consequences on their children and it affects their children\u2019s education, well-being and their future.\u201d Again, Arewa PUNCH reports that simply put, parental abduction occurs when either of the parents take forceful possession of the child without the consent of the other party or approval of the court. an interview with Arewa PUNCH, The Pro Chancellor of NEU, Dr Sani Jauro said the seminar was part of the institution\u2019s way of contributing to community development. Conscious of the fact that the seminar is incidentally two days away from the much touted Father\u2019s Day celebration, Jauro added, \u201cThis university when it was conceived has as one of its visions, is to solve problems by delivering the tripartite mandate of universities. Our academics will publish and not perish. Our students will develop confidence so that whether as lawyers, you will find them exceptionally good, independent thinkers, problem solvers of the Nigerian society.\u201d In her address during the seminar, the Chief Judge of Gombe State, Justice Halima Mohammed, urged both parents to act in the interest of the child, stressing, \u201cit should be considered. It is believed that the interest of the child is better placed with the mother. The father can pay maintenance.\u201d Decrying the absence of system strengthening, Mohammed added, \u201cThe laws are there, institutions are there, but they have not been strengthened to protect the laws. Individual states have the right to make laws to suit their needs,\u201d he posited.", "summary": "<p>Following the spate of broken homes and failed relationships blessed with children, stakeholders on Friday called for the legal settlement of the child\u2019s custody to reduce challenges that resonate from such romance.

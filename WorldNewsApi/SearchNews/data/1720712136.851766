On Sunday, June 9, multiple outlets including the BBC, Associated Press and The Guardian reported that a body was discovered during the ongoing search for Mosley, 67, who was reported missing on June 5. According to the AP, Lefteris Papakalodoukas, the mayor of Symi \u2014 where Mosely went missing \u2014 was on a boat with members of the media when they saw a body above the beach in Agia Marina around 10 a.m. local time. \u201cWe zoomed with the cameras and saw it was him,\u201d he told the outlet. Papakalodoukas said, per the AP, that the body was lying face-up against a fence after appearing to have fallen down a steep slope. While the body has not yet been formally identified, deputy mayor of the island, Nikitas Grillas, told The Guardian: \u201cHe has been found in the area of Ayia Marina,\u201d adding, \u201cI can confirm that it is him.\u201d Hellenic Police did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment. The search for the TV presenter initially began after he did not return from a hike on June 5, per The Telegraph and the Associated Press. \u201cThere is just no trace of him \u2014 none whatsoever,\" Constantina Dimoglidou, a senior police spokesman, said, per The Telegraph. \"And that means that, for us at least, every potential scenario is open and being investigated.\" The Guardian reported that video security footage showed that Mosley departed St Nikolas beach around 1:30 p.m. local time. In the footage, he was seen carrying an umbrella to protect himself from the sun. \u201cThe image is now one of many that we now have of the Briton in Pedi,\u201d said a police official involved in the search, per the newspaper. \u201cThere are others that show him clearly heading towards a path that would lead him to the port town. They will help us narrow our search but in no way do they solve this mystery.\u201d Never miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.

Before his body was found, Mosley's wife told the Times: \u201cIt has been three days since Michael left the beach to go for a walk. The longest and most unbearable days for myself and my children.\u201d", "summary": "The popular British television personality was first reported missing on June 5", "url": "https://people.com/body-found-in-search-for-missing-tv-doctor-michael-mosley-reports-8660309", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/xp8fWK_8p7JJgzx1nKlPLmLBm2A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(745x360:747x362)/Dr-Michael-Mosley-tout-060724-103c7965dbbd4f0daca7d5e4b4fb7931.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:23:16", "author": "David Chiu,Jenny Haward", "authors": ["David Chiu", "Jenny Haward"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.249}

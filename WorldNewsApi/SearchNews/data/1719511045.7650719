You have indeed demonstrated a strong commitment to justice and the protection of the rights of all citizens, and we are grateful for your service. We also appreciate the security agencies for their professionalism and dedication to maintaining peace and order in the state, despite the challenges posed by the recent political developments. Your tireless efforts have ensured that our people can live in peace and security, and we are deeply grateful for your sacrifices. We are grateful for the independence and impartiality displayed by the judiciary and security agencies, which has helped to strengthen our democracy and ensure that the rights and dignity of all citizens are protected. The people and indeed leaders of the Bichi Emirates have endured the onslaught on their rights to this Emirate, and the actions of the judiciary and security agencies have averted the breakdown of law and order in Bichi Emirates in particular and by extension the other four Emirates. There is no gainsaying that all the Emirates have witnessed tremendous progress in infrastructural and socioeconomic development in the last eight years and upon no fault of any of the emirs ththe State Assembly and the executive arms of the Government of Kano State took these unpopular decisions All these have demonstrated that President Asiwaju Bola Ahmad Tinubu is a Democrat who believes in justice and fairness and a statesman who believes in a better and renewed Nigeria. Thank you all for your service and commitment to the people of Kano State and Nigerians as a whole. We look forward to continuing to work with you to build a better future for our people and our country, Nigeria. Bichi Emirate Stakeholders 1. Mal Bello Salisu 2. Alh Uba Kunchi 3.

The new tourism and marketing strategy was unveiled in Louisville -- the gateway to bourbon tourism. They also announced a new logo and a new digital marketing campaign to help tourists plan bourbon trips to the state.\n\nSpirit companies have invested huge sums into new or expanded visitor centers to capitalize on the growing appeal of getting behind-the-scenes peeks into how bourbon is crafted.\n\nFor small distilleries, joining the Kentucky Bourbon Trail was likened to making the big leagues.\n\nKim Bard, co-founder of The Bard Distillery in western Kentucky, said it will immediately change perceptions about smaller producers that were part of the craft tour.\n\n\"People would come in, a lot of times they see us as less-than because we're on the craft trail and not on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail,\" she said in an interview. \"They see that as a very distinctive line.\n\n\"Now that the KDA has put us all on the same trail, I think that sort of thinking will stop and we'll be looked at as just another distillery, which is great for us,\" she added.\n\nBrent Goodin, owner of Boundary Oak Distillery in central Kentucky, predicted that shifting to the Kentucky Bourbon Trail will boost tourism at his and other smaller distilleries. Producers see tourism as an essential part of brand promotion.\n\n\"Anything we can do to make the tourist realize that everything is Kentucky bourbon and we're all producing the same thing -- maybe not as much as the next guy but we're all kind of in it together,\" he said in an interview.\n\nAny big bourbon announcement in Kentucky typically draws a bevy of the state's political leaders. On Thursday, industry leaders were joined by Democratic Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman and Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, who co-chairs the Congressional Bourbon Caucus.\n\nBourbon tourism's global appeal is creating more business opportunities for producers, Barr said.\n\n\"There's so much opportunity in the export market for Kentucky bourbon,\" Barr said.\n\nColeman led the crowd in toasting the bourbon sector's past and future while recognizing Kentucky's status as the \"undisputed home of bourbon.\"\n\nBourbon tourism has shaken off any pandemic-era hangover as venerable bourbon producers and industry newcomers alike are benefiting from a new surge in visitors. Attendance surpassed 2.5 million visitors last year along the Kentucky Bourbon Trail and the Kentucky Bourbon Trail Craft Tour.\n\nOverall, Kentucky's bourbon industry injects $9 billion into the state's economy each year, creating more jobs and attracting more tourists than ever before, according to a recent study. More rounds of growth are expected as Kentucky producers make billions of dollars in capital investments. Kentucky distillers produced a record 2.7 million barrels of bourbon in 2022, according to the report, which was commissioned by the distillers' association.\n\nProducers had a record inventory of 12.6 million bourbon barrels aging in warehouses at the start of 2023, according to the association. Those massive inventories are a bet on the future because most bourbons typically age four to eight years before reaching their market. Bourbon gets its flavor and golden brown color during aging.\n\nKentucky distillers produce 95% of the global bourbon supply, the KDA says.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

I met with her recently to discuss her passion for Bourbon.\n\nTo be considered a Bourbon, the grains -- which can include wheat, rye, malted barley or malted rye -- must be at least 51% corn, and the liquor must be aged in charred, new oak barrels. Traditionally associated with Bourbon County, Kentucky, Bourbon may, by a 1964 Congressional Resolution, be distilled in any of the 50 American states. And so, it is interesting to start our discussion by sipping a glass of golden-brown Texas Bourbon from Goodnight.\n\n\"Everybody does the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. My bucket list trip is to do the Texas Trail,\" Ruby tells me. \"Texas had only been producing Bourbon for 20 years. To me, the Garrison Brothers are to Texas what Buffalo Trace is to Kentucky.\" Situated in the Hill Country and opened in 2006, Garrison Brothers is the first legal bourbon whiskey distillery in Texas and uses only grains grown in the state.\n\nThe story of that first sip 30 years ago\n\nBut where did Ruby's passion for brown liquor originate?\n\n\"I was born in Louisville, Kentucky, so Bourbon was always around. My father was from the hills of Kentucky where people distilled their own. As a child, if you were sick with a cold, you never got cough medicine; you got Bourbon with honey and just a little squeeze of lemon. No wonder we slept through the night!\"\n\nOver time, Ruby's drink of choice changed, but her first love was reignited during a trip to Ireland about 30 years ago. Staying in a manor house, she went down to have a pre-dinner drink, and the bartender declined to pour her a wine as she'd have wine with her meal. \"He turned me on to Paddy's, an inexpensive Irish Whiskey that I still drink today. Thirty years ago it was $19 a bottle, and Habersham Beverage carries it today for $19.\"\n\nRuby confesses, \"I'm not so much into the blends and the chemistry of it all. I just like the taste of Bourbon, and my fascination is with the stories behind the Bourbon.\"\n\nShe cites, for example, the tale of Kentucky's famed Four Roses Bourbon, established in 1888. The distillery's founder, Louisville businessman Paul Jones, Jr., fell in love with a Southern Belle. He asked to marry her several times, finally sending her a dozen roses as an ultimatum and asking her to wear a corsage of red roses to a cotillion dance if she would accept his proposal. On the night of the ball in Columbus, Georgia, she wore four roses, and the legend was born.\n\n\"Four Roses might have been distilled in Kentucky,\" Ruby exclaimed, \"but it was founded in Columbus, Georgia!\"\n\nShe also regales me with the story of Sweetens Cove Whiskey, first released in 2020 and named after a nine-hole golf course in South Pittsburgh, Tennessee, whose investors include tennis player Andy Roddick and NFL Hall-of-Famer Peyton Manning. When the partners discovered the ritual of drinking a celebratory shot of whiskey on the first tee before taking a first golf shot, the idea for their very own whiskey was born. It is now branded as \"the official Bourbon of golf.\"\n\nAnd finally, she tells me, \"When Al Capone was imprisoned on Alcatraz, he had a case of Templeton Rye delivered once a month to his cell. Now, if you're going to take a gift to someone, is that not a great bottle to bring?\" she laughs.\n\nRuby relishes the tales and the lore, crediting her good friend Bubba Rosenthal, recently retired proprietor of Habersham Beverage, for having \"taught me so much about Bourbon. He was very generous with his time and with his knowledge.\" (Together with Rosenthal, Ruby annually hosts two or three Bourbon tastings to benefit the Ronald McDonald House, CASA, or her synagogue).\n\nShe continues, \"I also like to go to Chu's on Johnny Mercer by Bull River. Tommy will find me anything.\" Over the years, she has built strong relationships with both liquor stores, and by extension with the reps of such \"big name\" brands as Woodford Reserve and Maker's Mark.\n\nRuby keeps at least 30 bottles of Bourbon open at all times; A roomy cabinet in the rear of her dining room is bursting with bottles, while cases are stored elsewhere - always away from heat and sunlight. With more than 400 bottles in her collection, she educates herself by reading three to four articles a day, and distillers frequently invite her to exclusive tours and tastings (she is often the only woman at the table) and send her bottles of their most highly sought-after blends.\n\nRuby is particularly proud of her relationship with Victoria, the master distiller for Uncle Nearest, the first spirits brand in the world to be name after a Black American. Nathan \"Nearest\" Green, the first known African American master distiller, taught Jack Daniel how to make Bourbon, and Victoria is his great-granddaughter. In 2017, the New York Times reported how Uncle Nearest founder, Fawn Weaver, researched and advocated on behalf of Green so that the Jack Daniels Distillery would officially recognize his role as teacher and mentor. Her work led to a \"momentous turn in the history of Southern foodways. Even as Black innovators in Southern cooking and agriculture are beginning to get their due, the tale of American whiskey is till told as a whites-only affair...Green's story changes all that by showing how enslaved people likely provided the brains as well as the brawn in what was an arduous, dangerous, and highly technical operation.\"\n\nWe close our meeting by discussing Ruby's favorite Bourbon cocktail. She prefers an Old-Fashioned and considers The Grey to offer the best in the city. When making The Grey's recipe at home, she blends 2 ounces Woodford Reserve, \u00bd ounce oleo-saccharum, 3 dashes Angostura bitters, 2 dashes Peychaud's bitters, and 1 \u00bd ounces water, then garnishes with cherries or orange peel. (To prepare the oleo-saccharum, peel strips from two oranges and one lemon with a vegetable peeler and muddle them in one cup of sugar. Cover and let rest overnight. Add one cup of water, stirring to dissolve the sugar, and strain out the citrus peel.)\n\nBefore I leave, Ruby pours me a glass of her favorite Pappy Van Winkle Bourbon, Pappy 15, Pappy's famed Tennessee Bourbons are notoriously expensive and notoriously difficult to acquire. Ruby has five bottles.", "source": {"uri": "eu.savannahnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Savannah Morning News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

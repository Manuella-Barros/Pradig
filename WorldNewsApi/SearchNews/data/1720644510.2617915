Vermila Studios We\u2019ve finally got our first glimpse of what indie horror game producer Blumhouse Games is working on. In just two minutes, it served up six fascinating titles launching in 2024 and beyond, delivering one of the more impressive showcases at this week\u2019s Summer Game Fest. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the indie horror scene is alive (and often undead) with titles like Crow Country, Saturnalia, Signalis, Dredge, and this month\u2019s soon-to-land Still Wakes the Deep, but having a dedicated publisher to supercharge a small-studio revolution is a wonderful thing for the industry. Blumhouse Games, which only launched in February 2023, focuses on indie experiences with budgets under $10 million; this debut line-up shows how far these budgets can go. Across half a dozen titles\u2013four from American studios, plus one each from Spain and Chile\u2013there seems to be something for all tastes. There\u2019s also a lot of top talent involved, including the designer of all-time great psychological shooter Spec Ops: The Line, the brains behind Immortality, the director of Infinity Pool, and a Nine Inch Nails guitarist. Give it a look; you won\u2019t be disappointed.

In this nightmarish take on its domestic surroundings of Spain, Vermila Studios has imagined an adventure steeped in folklore and religion. 'Crisol' doesn't pull its punches with classic body horror. Vermila Studios Players explore Tormentosa, a corrupted world filled with legends and rituals, as terrifying saint statues come to life, like even more disturbing versions of the Motorized Patriots of BioShock Infinite. It\u2019s on you to simply survive, using your own blood as ammunition against your enemies. Yikes. Grave Seasons Developer: Perfect Garbage A subversion of classic, isometric pixel-art games, Grave Seasons is a charming take on an established premise: you maintain your farm, explore the town, build relationships, and harvest crops. There\u2019s also a supernatural serial killer that\u2019s transforming people into piles of flesh and bone. Cute art, gruesome discoveries. Perfect Garbage It\u2019s on you to uncover the secrets of Ashenridge, stay ahead of the murderer, and hopefully piece together clues to stop people being killed. Uncanny Stardew Valley, so to speak. Sleep Awake Developer: Eyes Out Sleep Awake, which appears to have the most \u201cclassic\u201d horror formula of the six games showcased, is the brainchild of Spec Ops: The Line designer and director Cory Davis and Nine Inch Nails\u2019 Robin Finck. This first-person futuristic psychedelic horror is set on the \u201clast known city on Earth,\u201d but it\u2019s no sanctuary. 'Sleep Awake' is a futuristic horror with tried-and-tested mechanics. Eyes Out It\u2019s got the vibes of A Nightmare on Elm Street: people keep disappearing as they sleep, while \u201cthose who remain exist in a crisis of reckless experiments to keep awake.\u201d You take on the role of Katja, who needs to face off against depraved death cults, otherworldly forces, and \u201cthe ever-present horror of The HUSH.\u201d Fear the Spotlight Developer: Cozy Game Pals Much like last month\u2019s Crow Country, Fear the Spotlight draws inspiration from the 32-bit era\u2013where survival horror gaming flourished. 'Fear the Spotlight' draws on PS1-era aesthetics. Cozy Game Pals Its storyline is knowingly typical, and all the better for it: you sneak into a school at night with your friends Vivian and Amy, botch a seance, then explore the building to uncover \u201cthe disturbing mystery behind a school tragedy decades before,\u201d solving puzzles along the way. Trust in the game\u2019s name, too, because you really need to avoid that spotlight. The Simulation Developer: Playmestudio Created by Chilean developer Playmestudio, The Simulation sounds like a meta experience that breaks the fourth wall in new ways, offering real potential for an insidious experience. The crux of the game is that a crime scene only has one piece of evidence\u2013a \u201cnever-before-seen horror game\u201d\u2013and you, a retired game designer, are hired to investigate the case. 'The Simulation' may break the fourth wall in more ways than one. Playmestudio Soon, you discover a hidden mode within the game that plunges you into a rabbit hole of the unknown, until you struggle to know what\u2019s the game and what\u2019s real life. Project C Developer: Half Mermaid Productions Last and by some means least is Project C, which is nothing more than a couple of pieces of concept art. 'Project C' is in its *very* early stages. Half Mermaid Even its title is a code name, but it\u2019s still among the most exciting propositions on this list: the game is being created by Sam Barlow (Her Story, Immortality) and Brandon Cronenberg (Possessor, Infinity Pool). It might be a little thin on the ground, but its claims are huge: Barlow\u2019s studio Half Mermaid claims you\u2019ll \u201chave your mind broken\u201d by its \u201cmost twisted vision yet.\u201d Jason Blum, CEO and founder of Blumhouse, said the new batch of games was reminiscent of his early days in the business. He explained: \u201cIn many ways, Blumhouse Games feels like going back to our roots, with a focus on indie horror, pushing boundaries and elevating new, original stories. But this time fans can get in on the action, and immerse themselves in the Blumhouse world. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the team and we hope this first slate of games will entertain, thrill, and terrify players, and we will have more in store for fans soon.\u201d Zach Wood, president of Blumhouse Games, said his team were \u201cblown away\u201d by the work of their new partners, and \u201ccouldn\u2019t be more proud to partner with strong, independent game creators who are bringing unique ideas to the horror genre.\u201d He added: \u201cOur upcoming titles represent standout storytelling, inventive play styles, and fresh approaches to scary stories, created by game developers who are deeply passionate about horror. We hope players see our collective love of the genre and indie creativity shine through our partners and our portfolio of games.\u201d Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website.

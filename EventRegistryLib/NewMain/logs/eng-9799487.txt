But no one reported the woman missing until January 2000, when her mother filed a report.\n\nDecades later, her husband, Christopher Wolfenbarger, was arrested for murder after being a person of interest in the case for years, police said at a Wednesday press conference. The arresting officers found Wolfenbarger hiding behind a dryer at his Atlanta home on Tuesday.\n\n\"Christopher Wolfenbarger knowingly and intentionally killed Melissa Dawn Wolfenbarger and dismembered her body,\" read an arrest warrant obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n\nThe deceased woman's mother and her sister, Tina Patton, attended the press conference wearing shirts with photos of Melissa.\n\nIn April 1999, police found human remains in a trash bag dumped in an Atlanta neighborhood. At the time, officials misidentified those remains as belonging to another missing person. Additional human remains were found in another bag, two months later.\n\nDNA testing in 2003, three years after Wolfenbarger was reported missing, confirmed that both sets of remains belonged to the Atlanta woman. Police have been hunting for her killer ever since.\n\nMelissa's father, Carl Patton, was the reason police investigated the remains again in 2003, her sister previously revealed. Carl Patton was arrested and convicted that same year for five murders across Georgia from 1973 to 1977.\n\n\"My mom was able to convince him to say something about my sister,\" Tina said, according to local outlet 11Alive. \"And somebody in Atlanta saw it in the paper the next day and said, 'Wait a minute, there's some remains over here in the morgue. And the address, the vicinities are kind of close to where this girl lived.

The Atlanta Police Department held a press conference on Wednesday where they announced her husband, Christopher, has been charged with murder in her death.\n\n\"We've finally made it.

And when they would find out they would eventually say this isn't your daughter, their tones would soften.\"\n\nReporters asked Tina, Melissa's sister if the two ever suspected Christopher Wolfenbarger, and she said they \"knew it\" was him.

Based on interviews conducted by police, Melissa Wolfenbarger had not been in contact with her husband since December 1998.\n\nIt was 154 days after Melissa's family had last heard from her when police responded to an area less than a mile away from her home.

However, it wasn't until March 2003 that forensic testing confirmed the remains belonged to Melissa. The case languished for decades, with Christopher being a person of interest from the early days of the investigation.\n\nPolice finally arrested Christopher Wolfenbarger at his home in Griffin this past Wednesday. Law enforcement officials say Wolfenbarger attempted to evade capture by hiding inside his residence.\n\nMelissa's case is one of many in Atlanta's history that went unsolved for years. Cold cases pose unique challenges for law enforcement, including maintaining public interest and collecting sufficient evidence over time. Advances in forensic science have played a crucial role in solving many long-standing cases, and this arrest may offer hope to other families still seeking justice.\n\nFurthermore, domestic violence remains a pervasive issue. According to the Georgia Commission on Family Violence, many victims know their attackers personally, emphasizing the need for robust support systems and preventive measures.\n\n\ud83d\uddc2\ufe0f Domestic Violence Stats: A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that between 2003 and 2014, about 55% of all female homicides in the U.S. were related to intimate partner violence.", "source": {"uri": "thegeorgiasun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Georgia Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thom_chandler@thegeorgiasun.com", "name": "Thom Chandler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cold case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_identification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forensic identification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Person of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimate_partner_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intimate partner violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forensic science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://thegeorgiasun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/coldcase.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799487", "eventUri": "eng-9799487", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1998-12-", "textStart": 302, "textEnd": 315}, {"amb": false, "date": "2003-03-", "textStart": 507, "textEnd": 517}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

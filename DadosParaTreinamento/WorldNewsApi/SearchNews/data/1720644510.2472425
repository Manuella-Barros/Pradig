{"id": 231210678, "title": "Inside Taylor Swift's romance with Calvin Harris and her 'Getaway car' that ended it", "text": "Taylor Swift has brought her Eras World Tour to Murrayfield Stadium this weekend for three amazing nights of entertainment. The Love Story singer has not been back to Scotland since her 1989 tour in 2015 but used to make frequent visits to the country when she previously dated a certain well known Scots DJ. The 34-year-old dated Calvin Harris for just over a year from 2015 to 2016 with the pair branded as the industry's biggest \"power couple\" at the time of their relationship, overtaking Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z as the highest-earning romantic duo in the music industry in 2015. Together, they brought in a jaw dropping \u00a392m in comparison to Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s \u00a370m. Swift famously sent fans into a frenzy with an Instagram snap of her and Calvin on July 4 with the caption: \u201cFriendly relations between Scotland and America.\u201d The loved up couple also celebrated their one year anniversary with a romantic getaway to a tropical island. Unfortunately, the pair later went their separate ways in 2016 with Calvin taking to Twitter to publicly announce their messy split which largely played out in the public eye. The pair are said to have had a spat over the DJ's song, 'This Is What You Came For' with Rihanna which Taylor co-wrote with her ex-boyfriend. The split was said to be amicable at the time before Calvin took to Twitter in a furious rant after it was reported that Taylor had actually written the hit song. Lashing out at Swift, he wrote in a series of now-deleted tweets: \"I figure if you're happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do. \"I know you're off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy [Perry] ETC but I'm not that guy, sorry. I won't allow it.\" He added: \"Please focus on the positive aspects of YOUR life because you've earned a great one.\" However, the break up got even messier when just days after her split from Calvin, Taylor was spotted kissing and holding hands with British actor Tom Hiddleston in Rhode Island. The pair had met at the Met Gala the month before and had a playful dance off with one another while Swift was still in a relationship with the Scots DJ. Tom was then invited to Taylor's annual 4th of July party at her Rhode Island home and was snapped cuddling up to the Thor star while they slid down a giant water slide with some of her friends holding onto the back of them. The pair got serious as they introduced one another to their families and also jet setted around the world on multiple trips to England, Rome and Australia. However, their whirlwind romance came to a quick end the pair went their separate ways in September 2016. The following year after their split, Taylor released her Reputation album (2017) which features the fan favourite track, 'Getaway Car'. The song is believed to be about her short rebound relationship with Thor actor Tom Hiddleston after splitting with Calvin. Swifties believe she is referring to the Marvel star as her 'Getaway car' that allowed her to drive away from her failing relationship with the Scots DJ. The singer then seemingly describes her first meeting with Tom at the Met Gala in her lyrics: \"It was the best of times, the worst of crimes / I struck a match and blew your mind / But I didn't mean it / And you didn\u2019t see it. \"The ties were black, the lies were white / In shades of grey in candlelight / I wanted to leave him / I needed a reason.\" And it seems she also already knew that the relationship would be short lived as she sings: \"I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed / We never had a shot, gunshot in the dark.\" Swift also references flying a lot in the song which is something she and Tom did a lot of during their brief relationship. The Cruel Summer star has now returned to Scotland this week for the first time in nine years ahead of her Eras World Tour which will kick off in Murrayfield Stadium tomorrow night. Taylor will play three nights in Edinburgh from June 7 to June 9 which officially marks the beginning of the UK leg of her world tour.

Vance Endorsed a National Abortion Ban in the Grossest Way Possible\n\nThe Republican National Convention ended with a lengthy, divisive, and exhausting speech from Donald Trump -- now the official GOP 2024 nominee. For Democrats, the dawn brings a reminder that questions around their own presumptive candidate are far from settled.\n\nShortly after the former president's speech ended, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) took to Instagram Live for more than an hour to discuss her reasoning for continuing to stand behind President Joe Biden. As rumors continue to swirl regarding whethert the president will exit the race amid concerns about his mental and physical fitness, Ocasio-Cortez made clear she believes there are major risks to switching out the nominee this late in the game.\n\n\"If you're falling out of a coconut tree, God bless you,\" she said, referencing the Kamala Harris meme. \"If you're riding with the president, God bless. I'm not an open-convention person. I think that is crazy.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez made a point of clarifying that her intent wasn't to attack any specific stance about Biden's capabilities, but rather communicate what she was hearing behind the scenes as a lawmaker.\n\nShe pointed to the logistical challenges of switching out the ticket so close to the election. \"I think that people need to understand the reality and the gravity of what these people are proposing [...] I do think that people are talking about this without having eyes wide open,\" she explained.\n\n\"If you think that there is consensus among the people who want Joe Biden to leave, that they will support Kamala, Vice President Harris, you would be mistaken,\" she said. \"I'm going to be honest for them [...] They are interested in removing the whole ticket.\"\n\n\"If you think that is going to be an easy transition, I'm here to tell you that a huge amount of the donor class and these elites who are pushing for the president not to be the nominee also do not want to see the VP be the nominee,\" Ocasio-Cortez expanded.\n\nThe congresswoman also called out her colleagues in Congress who continue to hide behind anonymous statements and \"going on background\" calling on Biden to step aside. \"That's bullshit,\" she said. \"If you have an opinion, say it with your chest and say it in public.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez was criticized by some viewers and social media users for suggesting that the concerns around Biden have primarily been brought by the \"elites\" and the Democratic donor class. Even ahead of Biden's disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump, polling already showed that large swaths of voters were concerned about his age and ability to serve a second term. Earlier this week, a survey conducted by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 65 percent of Democrats believe Biden should drop out of the race. Other polls and surveys conducted in the aftermath of the debate paint an increasingly concerning picture for the November general election, particularly around Biden's disadvantage in key swing states.\n\nOn Thursday, CNN reported that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has privately counseled Biden that the numbers aren't adding up for him. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) have also reportedly worked to get Biden to leave the race. Meanwhile, prominent progressives like Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) had advocated for sticking with Biden.\n\nThe president is reportedly considering dropping out, and according to NBC News has had discussions about how exactly he would go about leaving the race.\n\n\"His choice is to be one of history's heroes, or to be sure of the fact that there'll never be a Biden presidential library,\" one close friend of the president told Axios on Thursday. \"I pray that he does the right thing. He's headed that way.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikki_mccann_ramirez@rollingstone.com", "name": "Nikki McCann Ramirez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) took a swing at Democratic \"elites\" who are pushing for President Biden to stand down, warning they are also \"not interested\" in seeing Vice President Harris atop the ticket.\n\nHer comments came during an Instagram Live event following former President Trump's highly anticipated speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where he officially accepted the GOP nomination for president.\n\n\"If you think that there is consensus among the people who want Joe Biden to leave that they will support Vice President Harris, you would be mistaken,\" Ocasio-Cortez said Thursday. \"They're not going to be fully honest, but I'm going to be honest for them.\"\n\n\" I'm in these rooms. I see what they say in conversations,\" she continued. \"I'm here to tell you that a huge amount of the donor class and a huge amount of these elites and a huge amount of these folks in these rooms that I see that are pushing for President Biden to not be the nominee, also are not interested in seeing Vice President being the nominee.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez has remained one of Biden's biggest allies since a disastrous debate performance last month, where he stumbled at times and sounded raspy, launched an internal party struggle. Concerns around his age and mental acuity have led to a growing faction of Democrats who have called on the incumbent to withdraw from the race.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure a lot of people knew that the President is old. President Biden is very old. Donald Trump is also very old and a racist and a neo-Nazi,\" she argued. \"A lot of people don't love that we have the same exact matchup all over again, which is to say that the debate didn't change much at all. It didn't really change a lot in terms of people's perceptions, in terms of where the electorate is at and going into the debate.\"\n\nNearly 30 Congressional Democrats, including three senators, have now pressed Biden to step aside and \"pass the torch\" to a different candidate. Since Wednesday, former President Obama, former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) have all privately raised concerns about his ability to beat Trump in November and the down-ballot implications of a potential loss.\n\nDuring the Instagram Live event, Ocasio-Cortez also raised logistical concerns about the efforts to replace Biden, warning that Republicans plan to mount legal challenges if Democrats choose someone else as the nominee.\n\n\"It has been confirmed by the Republican Speaker of the House that Republicans are already preparing legal challenges to any change on ballot that may happen,\" she said. \"The possibility of our elections being decided by the Supreme Court ruling skyrocket.\"\n\nAccording to previous reporting by The Hill, the only state whose filing deadline has passed so far is New Mexico. Democrats could still provide a different nominee than Biden to states for the November election -- though the president has already garnered about 3,850 pledged delegates, per The Hill/Decision Desk HQ's tracker.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, a member of \"The Squad,\" also slammed \"elites\" who had stood by Biden in the past and prevented a conversation about replacing him earlier in the nomination process.\n\n\"I'm looking at a watch and I'm looking at a clock and I'm looking at a calendar. And I think that if personally, people want to have this conversation six months ago, eight months ago, a year ago. It's a very different landscape of logistics,\" she said.\n\n\"If you're an everyday person that has this opinion, I'm not angry, but this whole class of people who are coming with this other opinion now have supported the president the entire time, and many of those people are the same people who closed ranks around anybody who wanted to raise this conversation a year ago,\" Ocasio-Cortez added.\n\nThe New York Democrat reiterated her previous criticisms of those in her party who have leaked information to the press in recent weeks about the fight over Biden standing down, calling it \"bulls -- .\"\n\n\"There have been lots of Democrats who have been giving little anonymous quotes to the press,\" she said. \"I'm sorry, I'm going to say because it's after the midnight, that's bulls -- .\"\n\n\"If you have an opinion, say it in public, but the idea that you are an elected official and you are supposed to be responsible for a community, and you're just gonna text some journalists on the low and say, this is what I think. Don't put my name next to it,\" she continued. \"What are you here to do? If that's your opinion, and if that's what you think is best for the country, put your name on it.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez also pressured Democrats who have given anonymous quotes to the press about losing the election if Biden remains at the top of the ticket to resign earlier in the week. She doubled down on those calls during the social media event.\n\n\"Leave, just leave like that is so garbage that is such a fundamental lack of leadership,\" she said. \"Go cash in on Wall Street. If that's what you feel like, why keep that seat warm? This job is hard. It takes a lot of effort you're resigning yourself to losing. Why don't you just turn in your keys early and give it to someone who gives a damn?\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yash_roy@thehill.com", "name": "Yash Roy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Mexico"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_Desk_HQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision Desk HQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/AP23229766966591-e1721407250341.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747436", "eventUri": "eng-9747436", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) dropped a series of bombs and made an impassioned case for keeping President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket during a livestream on Thursday.\n\nOcasio-Cortez raised a number of points in favor of sticking with Biden, with her first being that Republicans might raise legal challenges to the hypothetical replacement nominee's ballot access.\n\nThen in an aside, she slammed those members of her colleagues who have been leaking to the press to weaken Biden's position.\n\n\"What I see right now, and I want you all to know, is that over the last several weeks, there have been lots of Democrats who have been giving little anonymous quotes to the press, to some journalists, to print, and I'm not here to knock the press on it, I'm here to knock my colleagues on it. Because to me, I think that's and I'm sorry -- I'm going to say it because it's after midnight -- that's bullshit,\" she argued. \"I'm not coming for the people who have made a public statement and put their name on it. Like, Lord knows, I've done plenty of that myself. I'm talking about people who are too scared to say what they want to say in public, but somehow not afraid to say what they want to say to a journalist so long as they promise not to use their name. That's a bunch of horseshit!\"\n\nNext, she revealed that there is no guarantee that the Democratic Party would consolidate around Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"If you think that there is consensus among the people who want Joe Biden to leave that Kamala, that they will support Kamala, Vice President Harris, you would be mistaken,\" said Ocasio-Cortez. \"A lot of them are not just interested in removing the president. They are interested in removing the whole ticket.\"\n\n\"I'm here to tell you that a huge amount of the donor class, and a huge amount of these elites, and a huge amount of these folks in these rooms that I see that are pushing for President Biden to not be the nominee, also are not interested in seeing the vice president being the nominee. Will they win out on that? I don't know. But I am here to tell you, do not take that for granted,\" she added.\n\nOcasio-Cortez further underlined her point about the chaos that might engulf the party if Biden steps aside by noting that she has asked those advocating for such a course for their plan and has not received a satisfactory answer. \"What I can tell you is that I have stood up in rooms of folks making these decisions, and I have raised these questions, and no one had an answer for me,\" she said.\n\nShe went on to make an affirmative case for Biden himself, submitting that \"People underestimate Biden's performance. I think that is how he became president, is through a lot of people underestimating his performance with demographics that are not traditionally valued. And I think that people see where he's weak. They don't often see where he's strong and just electorally, purely electorally.\"\n\nShe continued:\n\nJoe Biden kind of like stomps with older people, like electorally, which is one of the strongest and most consistent electorates, and it's actually a hard electorate for Democrats to win. You know, those are not people that are on Twitter, but they vote more consistently than almost any other bracket. So you take that off the table, you cannot assume that that electorate transfers to any other candidate.\n\n\"What I'm here to say is we can't just allow these decisions to be made by groupthink, momentum, inertia. We really need to consider the consequences. And if the data, the logistics, what have you, supports another path? Go ahead, like make that,\" said Ocasio-Cortez. \"But this idea that we're we're just going to talk about what theoretically is best. This isn't, this is not 2023. And so, you know, folks are saying the- and also, folks are saying polling only has momentum. Maybe that might be true, have we thought about what is leading to that? Because I think hundreds of millions of dollars in earned media from people, like members of Congress saying things off the record, like I just. And again, I could be wrong, I could be wrong. I'm not here to tell you his is what it is. But what I, what I am here to tell you is some of the red alerts that I'm seeing on the dashboard in terms of things, concerns that I have not seen adequately addressed.\"", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Groupthink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/vAOC-Endorses-Joe-Biden-For-President- -- -And-Gets-Torn-Apart-By-Biden-Opponents-on-Left.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747436", "eventUri": "eng-9747436", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Even if they're ugly, even if they're hard, even if [it's] what we don't want, we don't get to run away,\" she said during the nearly hour-long livestream.\n\nOne of the most progressive lawmakers in Congress, Ocasio-Cortez said the debate between Biden and Trump \"sucked for everybody\" and captured the national sentiment that most \"people don't love where we're at\" regarding the candidates.\n\n\"We have the same exact matchup all over again,\" she said.\n\n\"Which is to say that the debate didn't change much at all,\" she said. What changed, she said, is that influential and wealthy supporters began to worry that Biden would not be able to defeat Trump, based on polling data they saw.\n\nBut there are issues with these proposals, she said.\n\n\"I have not seen .. an alternative scenario that I feel does not set us up for enormous peril,\" she said. \"The mechanisms by which this decision is being made is concerning me.\"\n\nThe Democratic National Convention is only weeks away, and Republicans have already vowed to prepare \"legal challenges to any name change on the ballot,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"Those legal challenges are most viable, where? In the same handful of swing seats that are needed to win the presidency.\"\n\nShe grew animated when discussing the lawmakers and others who have been speaking on background to the media about the discussions revolving around Biden's candidacy, saying that \"litigating, like, huge conversations among people of power in public can dramatically hurt our chances.\"\n\n\"I'm not here to knock the press on it.

I'm in these rooms. I see what they say in conversations,\" she said. \"A lot of them are not just interested in removing the president, they are interested in removing the whole ticket.\"\n\nBiden and Harris have also raised \"at least $100 million\" for the general election, and that \"money cannot be transferred\" if there is a new nominee, Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\nShe said she believes people underestimate Biden, and that he resonates with others when he has \"the energy of people around him\" as opposed to events like the debate, which had no audience. He also has strong support among older voters, she said.\n\n\"Biden kind of stomps with older people, like electorally, which is one of the strongest and most consistent electorates.

The two Democratic leaders fear that, according to extensive polling data and research, he will be unable to defeat GOP nominee Donald Trump in November.\n\nBut if Biden drops out of the race, the burning question becomes: Who will replace him as the nominee? Some Democratic strategists believe that Vice President Kamala Harris is their best shot, and liberal New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has described Harris as the most logical choice.\n\nHowever, progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-New York), during an early Friday morning discussion on Instagram Live, stressed that Democrats are not universally sold on Harris as a Biden replacement nominee.\n\nREAD MORE: Economist Paul Krugman: Here's the main thing Trump and Vance have 'in common'\n\nAOC told fellow Democrats, \"If you think there is a consensus among the people who want Joe Biden to leave, that they will support Vice President Harris, you would be mistaken.

I mean, if I were here to sell out, I'd be making -- there are much more profitable, peaceful ways, I assure you.\"\n\nA poll released on Thursday and conducted after Saturday's near-assassination of Trump shows the former president ahead of Biden nationally and in all seven anticipated swing states. Nearly two-thirds of Democratic voters want Biden to step down from his campaign, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted July 11-15.\n\n\"For the good of the country, I think it is time for the President to pass the torch to the next generation to carry on the legacy he started,\" Rep. Jim Costa (D., Calif.) said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nSenate majority leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), and House Democratic Caucus head Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.) have also called on Biden to reconsider. Former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, a longtime ally of Biden, privately said she would do \"everything in her power\" to get Biden off the ticket.\n\n\"Maybe I'm being too risk-averse,\" Ocasio-Cortez conceded. \"Maybe I'm not seeing what other people are seeing.

But she said the ongoing debate was being clouded by wealthy donors to a \"disturbing\" degree and being distorted by social media, \"groupthink\" and anonymous leaks by her colleagues to the news media.\n\n\"People need to understand the reality and the gravity of what these people are proposing,\" she said. \"I'm not saying this is all a reason not to do it, but I do think people are talking about this without having two eyes wide open as to what this really means.\"\n\nShe added bluntly: \"I have not seen an alternative scenario that I feel will not set us up for enormous peril.\"\n\nThe hourlong monologue, recorded as pressure intensified for Mr. Biden to step aside and as former President Donald J. Trump accepted the Republican nomination, underscored the unlikely role that the 34-year-old congresswoman and her progressive allies have taken in tumult.

And she called the idea of an open convention -- allowing multiple candidates to compete for the nomination -- \"crazy.\"\n\nLong known for pushing her party leftward on ideological questions, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez rooted her remarks in what she called \"brass tacks\" concerns. She said she had seen a \"lack of thought\" by party leaders around how to confront legal challenges associated with replacing the nominee. She vented that her colleagues in Congress were caving to pressure from donors.\n\nShe also made a case directly for Mr. Biden. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said that other Democrats \"underestimate\" Mr. Biden's continued political strength, particularly with labor unions and older Americans. While she did not directly contest polling that showed him behind, she called herself a \"polling skeptic\" and questioned whether Mr. Biden's numbers were being temporarily affected by Democrats own infighting.\n\n\"Whether you like it or not, Joe Biden kind of stomps with older people electorally,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Groupthink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "News media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/19/multimedia/19biden-democrats-aoc-pbgc/19biden-democrats-aoc-pbgc-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747436", "eventUri": "eng-9747436", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Some Democratic strategists believe that Vice President Kamala Harris is their best shot, and liberal New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has described Harris as the most logical choice.\n\nHowever, progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), during an early Friday morning discussion on Instagram Live, stressed that Democrats are not universally sold on Harris as a Biden replacement nominee.\n\nREAD MORE: Economist Paul Krugman: Here's the main thing Trump and Vance have 'in common'\n\nAOC told fellow Democrats, \"If you think there is a consensus among the people who want Joe Biden to leave, that they will support Vice President Harris, you would be mistaken. I'm in these rooms; I see what they say in conversations. A lot of them are not just interested in removing the president, they are interested in removing the whole ticket.\"\n\nCNN's Julian Zelizer, in a July 5 op-ed, called for an all-female Harris/Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ticket. But Newsweek's Khaleda Rahman, on July 19, reported that Whitmer has ruled out running for either president or vice president this year.\n\nRahman, in a separate article, reports that according to AOC, Democratic donors aren't necessarily lining up to support Harris as the nominee.\n\n\"I'm here to tell you, a huge amount of the donor class and a huge amount of these elites, and a huge amount of these folks in these rooms that I see that are pushing for President Biden not to be the nominee, also are not interested in seeing the vice president being the nominee,\" the Bronx/Queens congresswoman said during the Instagram Live discussion. \"Will they win out on that?

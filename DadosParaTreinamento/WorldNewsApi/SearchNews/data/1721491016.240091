{"id": 237072654, "title": "Daniel Radcliffe, Jonathan Groff, and Sarah Paulson Celebrate the Tony Awards 2024 by Partying All Night", "text": "It was a big night for Daniel Radcliffe, whose showstopping performance in Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Merrily We Roll Along won him his first Tony, an achievement he celebrated by partying until 4 a.m. Following the awards ceremony at New York\u2019s Lincoln Center, the Harry Potter star attended his show\u2019s party at the Ascent Lounge with his longtime girlfriend, Erin Darke. Radcliffe, who arrived just before midnight and was greeted with hugs and congratulations, relaxed at the soiree by enjoying a Diet Coke with lemon, but he admitted he was nervous when his category came up during the ceremony. \u201cInitially, I was really confused because when Ben Platt read it out, he read my character\u2019s name first,\u201d Radcliffe told Vanity Fair while clutching his Tony at the celebration. \u201cHe said, \u2018Charlie,\u2019 and I was like, Wait, is there a Charlie who is nominated? And then he said the full character\u2019s name, and I was like, Oh shit, it is me! And then I blacked out.\u201d Soon, Radcliffe was joined by his costar Lindsay Mendez, a fellow Tony nominee. \u201cI love doing this show so much, and it\u2019s so special to be doing it with Lindsay and Jonathan Groff and so many people that I love so much,\u201d he said. \u201cMusicals\u2014it is the most demanding thing that I\u2019ve ever done, and at the same time it\u2019s the best experience of my life. Winning this, it\u2019s an amazing way to end the run.\u201d Four blocks away, at P.J. Clarke\u2019s, the cast and creators of Stereophonic were in full revelry, enjoying Maine lobster rolls, sliders, and drinks. The show, about a fictional Fleetwood Mac\u2013style band clashing while creating an album together in the 1970s, was the night\u2019s top winner, taking home five awards, including best play. With 13 nods, it had already made history as the most Tony-nominated play of all time. Will Brill, who plays Reg, the bassist battling addiction, won best performance by a featured actor in a play. He beat his costars Eli Gelb and Tom Pecinka, who were both nominated in the same category. \u201cWe had a bunch of talks about supporting each other, and we talked about what we thought was likely and what we thought wasn\u2019t, and really kept on reaffirming our love for each other and how special we all felt to be in this situation,\u201d said Brill with his girlfriend by his side, taking a pause from socializing at the energetic party. \u201cIt\u2019s been nothing but a lot of love. A few of them grabbed me after I won. Tom Pecinka, who was very honest about how much he wanted to win, grabbed me and was like, \u2018I am so happy for you. I love you so much. This means the world that you got it.\u2019 That really meant a lot to me. I love these people.\u201d Across Central Park, on the Upper East Side, Broadway\u2019s biggest stars made their way to The Carlyle for the buzzy after-party thrown by Rick Miramontez, a veteran Broadway publicist, and producer John Gore. The annual bash took over the entire first and second floors of the landmark hotel, including the famed Bemelmans Bar. By 1:30 a.m., a crowd had already gathered, including Tony nominee Eddie Redmayne, Jeffrey Wright, Billy Eichner, Ashley Park, and Dylan Mulvaney\u2014as well as Radcliffe and Brill\u2014and guests weaved their way through the crowds, shoulder to shoulder. A relaxed Ariana DeBose, who hosted the Tony ceremony for the third straight year, was stationed near Bemelmans\u2019 famed piano to take in the pianist\u2019s performance up close, where she spoke with Julianne Hough and talent manager Jason Weinberg. Nearby, two-time competitive-Tony winner Billy Porter was deep in conversation with George C. Wolfe. Both were bestowed with honorary awards on Sunday night, with Porter receiving the Isabelle Stevenson accolade and Wolfe earning the award for lifetime achievement. \u201cBeing at the Tonys, I feel like I\u2019m at home. This is where I started. Theater is my first love, and theater saved my life,\u201d Porter told VF during the after-party. \u201cAnd to be in this space, and to receive my third Tony, is very, very special. Always!\u201d At 2 a.m., newly minted Tony winner Sarah Paulson strolled into the Carlyle hotel lobby with her longtime publicist, Alla Plotkin. Still beaming from having nabbed her first Tony, for best actress in a play for her work in Appropriate, Paulson said winning was \u201ca childhood dream fully realized.\u201d \u201cWe moved to New York when my mom was 27 years old, and I was five, and my sister was three, and my mom got a job as a waitress at Sardi\u2019s [the birthplace of the Tony Award],\u201d said Paulson, who graciously stopped to chat before heading into the party. \u201cI dreamt about being an actress, and then I starred in this play at the Helen Hayes, which is right next door to Sardi\u2019s, and I could smell the food being cooked at night sometimes when I was doing the play before it moved to the Belasco [Theatre]. So for me to win, and it being my first nomination\u2014I just can\u2019t believe it. I have not reentered my body! I\u2019ll put it that way.\u201d Inside the party, Paulson bumped into Alex Edelman, who was carrying his honorary Tony Award for his debut solo Broadway show, Just for Us. The two greeted each other with cheers by clinking their Tony Awards together. Soon after, Paulson and Porter met and shared an animated conversation in a corridor of the hotel. \u201cYou are just divine,\u201d he told her. Paulson then hit the dance floor and grooved to Madonna\u2019s \u201cVogue.\u201d At 3 a.m., Leslie Odom Jr. was spotted inside Bemelmans Bar wearing a stunning all-white suit and chatting with some acquaintances. He was nominated for his performance in Purlie Victorious, a comedic play about a traveling Black preacher in the small-town South of the 1950s. Meanwhile, Groff, who won best lead actor in a musical, his first Tony after two previous nominations, joined Radcliffe and Darke in a corner booth, with the three hoisting themselves onto the top of a banquette to pose for some silly photos. Guests soon learned Groff was in attendance and mobbed him for selfies. He happily obliged while holding his Tony in one hand and a cocktail in the other. At 3:45 a.m., Groff and Radcliffe made a beeline to the exit and so did the crowd. By 4 a.m., things had cleared out. \u201cI\u2019m going to be up until dawn,\u201d said Brill. \u201cThis is once in a lifetime.

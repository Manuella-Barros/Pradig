Steve Gaines, pastor of Bellevue Baptist Church in Memphis, Tennessee, and the former president of the Southern Baptist Convention, is the author of the forthcoming book, \u201cRevival: When God Comes to Church,\u201d in which he unpacks a biblical understanding of the word \u201crevival\u201d and what Christians ought to do to create an atmosphere for spiritual restoration. Listen to the latest episode of the \u201cQuick Start\u201d Podcast The most succinct definition of \u201crevival\u201d Gaines has come across, he said during a recent appearance on CBN\u2019s \u201cFaith vs. Culture,\u201d comes straight from the Old Testament: \u201cWhen the glory of God fills the house of God.\u201d \u201cThe word \u2018vive\u2019 has to do with life; \u2018re\u2019 means to repeat or to have fresh life,\u201d the pastor said. \u201cSo it means \u2018to have new life\u2019. That\u2019s what it is. And revival is not for people who don\u2019t know Christ. I like to say it this way: You can\u2019t revive something that\u2019s never been \u2018vived.\u2019 So if they\u2019ve never been given life in Jesus Christ, they can\u2019t be revived. That\u2019s for Christians. So revival is specifically for the people of God.\u201d Gaines turned then toward a passage of Scripture he believes is often \u201ctotally misrepresented.\u201d In Revelation 3:20, the Apostle John wrote, \u201cHere I am! I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in and eat with that person, and they with me\u201d (NIV). The verse, the pastor explained, isn\u2019t addressing individual salvation, as it\u2019s often used. Rather, the passage is referring to Jesus attempting to regain access to \u2014 or to revive \u2014 His collective church. \u201cHe\u2019s not knocking on the door of somebody\u2019s heart,\u201d Gaines said. \u201cHe\u2019s knocking on the door of the church of Laodicea, and He\u2019s trying to get back into His church! That\u2019s an amazing picture: that Jesus \u2014 a lot of the time \u2014 we lock Him out of His own church. We\u2019ve got our programs, we\u2019ve got our stuff, we\u2019ve got our denominations, we\u2019ve got all this stuff that we rely on, and we\u2019re not relying on the Lord.\u201d He added, \u201cThe greatest thing we can give anybody is the manifest presence of God. When they come [into the church], is God there? Is God really there in manifest presence, or is He outside knocking, trying to get into His own church? I just believe we ought to let Him have His church.\u201d The Memphis-based minister addressed what he believes are the main hindrances to revival, the traps that often keep God from engaging with His church. \u201cI tell everybody there are \u2018isms\u2019 that need to become \u2018wasms,'\u201d Gaines joked. Traditionalism, he said, is when \u201ctradition becomes more important than the Scripture,\u201d formalism is when \u201cyou\u2019re trying to make sure every little dot is dotted and every T is crossed and that you\u2019ve got it down perfectly,\u201d fanaticism is when \u201cyou start doing things that are not biblical\u201d and \u201cgoing beyond the Word of God,\u201d liberalism is when \u201cyou don\u2019t really believe everything that the Bible says, and that quenches the Holy Spirit,\u201d and, finally, legalism is \u201cadding to the Word of God.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how many times, as a Baptist, I\u2019ve heard, \u2018This is the Baptist way,'\u201d Gaines said. \u201cWell, with all due respect, I\u2019m a Baptist, but I\u2019m a Christian first. And I don\u2019t believe in the Baptist way if it\u2019s not the Bible way. \u2026 I just believe that we need to make sure that we realize that we do have enemies that want to quench the Spirit of God.\u201d As believers\u2019 relationships with the Lord are being restored from coast to coast, it\u2019s critical believers have a biblical understanding of revival and are equipped to create an atmosphere for the Holy Spirit to move among His people.

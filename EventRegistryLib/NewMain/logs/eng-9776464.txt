It's kind of crazy saying that because at the time I became the fourth fastest ever in the event. But still if I am off my game it is still not enough to say I can't be beaten because I got beat by two people,\" Lyles said.\n\n\"I needed to reflect. I needed to say what is it going to take for me to be confident enough to go into a meet and say even on my off day, I'm still going to win.\"\n\nThe American athlete was speaking at yesterday's Team USA press conference ahead of the athletics programme. The men's 100m will commence on Saturday.\n\nThe results since 2021 have shown the work that Lyles has done to improve. He has won the last two World Championships in the 200m, and won his first World 100m title last year.\n\nLyles has run a lifetime best 9,81 seconds over the 100m and 19.31 seconds for the 200m, the fourth fastest of all time and the United States' national record.\n\nHe has been talking much about being the fastest man alive, even though he was beaten by Jamaican Oblique Seville over the 100 metres this season at Racers Grand Prix at the National Stadium in Kingston. Seville clocked 9.82 seconds for the win, with Lyles second in 9.85.\n\nLyles improved his time to set a lifetime best 9.81 in winning the London Grand Prix event on July 20.\n\nJamaica's Kishane Thompson is the current world leader, clocking 9.77 seconds, the fastest men's 100m time in two years, at the National Championships last June at the National Stadium.\n\nThe Jamaicans are lining up as two of Lyles' biggest challengers, but for Lyles, the American says the difficult moments have led to him being ready to take on all comers at these Games, confident in his own abilities no matter who faces him at the line.\n\n\"I've been at the bottom. I have fought my way back up. Now here I am stronger than before. If I lose this time it's not going to be because I beat myself. It's because they had to be better.

Many athletes have shown remarkable improvement in recent weeks, including Noah Lyles, who set a personal best in the 100-meter at the London Diamond League.\n\nThis performance caught the attention of track enthusiasts, including four-time world champion Justin Gatlin, who discussed it on his YouTube podcast, \"Ready Set Go.\"\n\nWhen co-host Rodney Green asked Gatlin about Lyles' new 100-meter personal best, Gatlin thoughtfully responded that the American sprinter is carving his own path to 100-meter greatness.\n\nHe also noted that Lyles has made significant improvements in several aspects of his running style, addressing previous weaknesses. The world champion praised Lyles' performance at the London Diamond League, stating that he now looks like a true 100-meter sprinter with more potential to unlock:\n\n\"So, it's interesting to see how it's going to play out. I mean, 9.81, especially this right now, is not a bad time at all, and it's a PR for him. So, I think now he's like kind of getting it.\"\n\nHe highlighted Lyles' impressive progress in indoor and outdoor competitions, noting the substantial improvement in timing compared to previous years.\n\nHe also mentioned a headwind during the London Diamond League 100-meter race, suggesting that Lyles might have run even faster with neutral conditions or a tailwind, potentially challenging the world lead.\n\nGreen added that Lyles is known for feeding off the crowd's energy, sometimes even pushing himself beyond his limits. However, he also noted that predicting Lyles' performance against his main competitor, Jamaica's Kishane Thompson, is challenging since Thompson's response to a World Championship crowd remains unknown.\n\nAs the Olympics approach, Lyles should be aware of several top competitors in the 100-meter sprint who have posted similar seasonal bests in the world rankings. While Lyles has demonstrated impressive form, a closer look at the current landscape reveals formidable challengers vying for Olympic glory.\n\nIn the months leading up to the Paris Olympics, Noah Lyles appeared poised for a clean sweep in the 100m, 200m, and 4x100m events. However, in the 100-meter competition, several runners, including Kishane Thompson, Ferdinand Omanyala, and Oblique Seville, have already surpassed the American's time.\n\nThese three athletes are now Lyles' top rivals, and he'll need to outpace them to secure the coveted gold medal. Thompson currently leads the seasonal 100-meter rankings with a time of 9.77 seconds, followed closely by Omanyala at 9.79.\n\nLyles recently clocked 9.81 in the London Diamond League, putting him ahead of Seville, who has a seasonal best of 9.82.

I think it's funny at times.\"\n\nOnce Lyles showed up on the Seine in his Team USA regalia and painted nails, comments began rolling in on social media.\n\nOne person posted via X, \"I genuinely don't have a problem with Noah Lyles. I like the energy he brings to the sport. But that painting of the nails s-t [is]for the ladies bruh.\" Another wrote, \"Noah Lyles has his nails painted ...This is just at the halfway point of the opening ceremony. Disturbing thus far.\"\n\nPainting his nails is nothing new for Lyles, who rocked a different set at the Olympic Trials in June and at the New Balance Indoor Grand Prix in February.\n\n\"Sometimes it's like, 'Hey, I know you were brought up this way, but I was brought up that way,' and the fact that you can't see the differences of why I might do it, I find that entertaining,\" Lyles explained. \"You know, people like me because I do this. I'm just being myself.\"\n\nLyles has certainly never shied away from the attention, embracing his role as a sprinter with swagger. But he acknowledged his persona can sometimes be met with resistance.\n\n\"The most misunderstood thing is the balance between cocky and confident,\" Lyles said. \"There is a strong line that people assume my confidence is cockiness. I will say this. Anybody who thought I was cocky and met me, they're instantly like, 'Oh, that's the nicest, coolest guy I've ever met in my life.'\"\n\nLyles continued, \"I never blame anybody who thinks that I'm cocky. It's just a 'you haven't met me situation.' That's all.\"\n\nOn Saturday, August 3, Lyles will take to the track for the men's 100m heats, to be followed by the final the following day.

Keisha didn't understand why, until the USATF Indoor Nationals in Albuquerque, when Noah walked in with a motorcycle helmet on. \"Mom, you just don't get it. You don't get the vision,\" Lyles told her. Keisha agreed-she did not get it. She just rolls with it.\n\nHow any one person views Noah Lyles will change this week, in Paris. His mother understands this, but she knows him. She knows that many will get things right about her son and others will get things so-so-so-so wrong.\n\nKeisha knows that some people will see or hear her ever-more accessible son and think: \"Not for me.\" But she does not spend even a millisecond on the notion that her son just wants attention. She waves that nonsense away.\n\nShe always encouraged Noah and his two siblings to be whatever they wanted. She often repeated to them a quote she once saw attributed to John Lennon: \"When I was five years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down 'happy.' They told me I didn't understand the assignment. I told them they didn't understand life.\"\n\nShe says that when she discovered this quote, she thought: This is Noah.\n\nNoah Lyles is honest, engaging and often seems lost in his own version of outer space. He can come across as corny, but he doesn't care what people think, and that's important. He was making rap videos with his girlfriend as both prepped for the Olympics. He makes comments that sound like boasts-or worse, hubris-to many: \"That's what they all say, until they get beat!\" he booms on the Netflix docuseries SPRINT.\n\nIn Paris, the 27-year-old, six-time world champion could win three, maybe even four gold medals, including The Double, the 100 meters and 200 meters. He will also race in the 4X100 relay, and has discussed running in the 4X400 relay.\n\n\"Everybody thinks that it isn't attainable,\" Lyles says. \"But those are the things that I love.\"\n\nVintage Noah Lyles story No. 2: At the U.S. Track and Field trials in June, Lyles pulled out a series of Yu-Gi-Oh! cards before races. \"A lot of people were scrambling like me to figure out the meaning,\" Keisha says. \"I don't know the meaning of those! It means he's living his best life.\" Then, she says, after the 200-meter finals, Lyles walked into the stadium with a toy water gun. Keisha and Noah's father, Kevin Lyles-both former college track athletes-were confused.\n\nKevin asked, \"I thought we were trying to make that Olympic team. Are we out here playing with toys?\"\n\nOver the past three years, everything changed for Noah Lyles, his immediate family and everyone else in his inner orbit. Before the Tokyo Games in 2021, Lyles dealt with depression and anxiety, speaking openly about having been bullied, severe bouts of childhood asthma and twin diagnoses of Attention Deficit Disorder and Dyslexia. He won a bronze medal in the 200 in Tokyo, his first Olympics. And he presented all his differences to the world. Burned by some people's reactions, he sometimes retreated. But after Tokyo, he vowed to change.\n\n\"That makes a big difference. When you just stop caring about how other people view you,\" Keisha says. \"That's his journey from one Olympics to another. He's always been his own person. When we went to Tokyo, there was a lot more pressure, a lot more weight.\"\n\nHence the focus of these past three years. As much as there were tweaks to his form or fitness, Lyles also lasered in on understanding of self and his mental health. Improving those, he discovered, made him faster. When he looked inward, he noticed how exhausted being Noah Lyles made Noah Lyles. He committed to fewer events off the track, took fewer offers and searched for balance, not more sprints. He worked to create boundaries, to worry less about pleasing those outside his circle.\n\nAnd so that became his pattern-and he got faster. He spoke about wanting to \"transcend\" track and field, as Allyson Felix had. As his mouth motored, Lyles turned his attention to achieving The Double in Paris.\n\nLyles went to Budapest in August 2023 for the world championships. He won the 100. He won the 200. He anchored the gold medal-winning 4X100 relay team, becoming the first athlete to win three golds at worlds since Usain Bolt in 2015.\n\n\"Last year, he really solidified himself. Just the effort, dedication and determination it took, to say, 'OK, I'm going to figure this 100 meters out. I'm going to get comfortable being uncomfortable,'\" Keisha says. \"And then I watched him. Perform at such a high level every round. That puts him in a totally different conversation.\"\n\nHis performance at the U.S. trials last month in Eugene continued to elevate Lyles's profile. His family had to stop eating at restaurants because of the crowds. He signed thousands of autographs, starred in SPRINT, flashed Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, and wore a bright red running suit and white pearls. When he entered Hayward Field at the trials, Snoop was carrying his bag stuffed with his gear. He then won the 100 and the 200 to qualify, loudly and speedily, for Paris. He discussed adding the 4X400.\n\nThere were 400-meter specialists from the U.S. who didn't much care for Lyles's volunteering for that relay in Paris. And there were track aficionados who scoffed when he labeled himself, on SPRINT, the world's fastest man. Some Jamaican athletes and fans argued that Lyles had flared existing issues with comments (his girlfriend, Junelle Bromfield, is a Jamaican sprinter) voiced in public and more than once. Lyles was overconfident, to put it kindly, or arrogant. He violated the sport's unwritten codes.\n\nBut nothing Lyles said was mean, cruel or delusional. There was a basis for everything he said. He is the fastest man in the world at the moment. He may still be after Paris, too. But his comments, true as they were, did not especially endear him to the insular community of track and field. But Noah is just trying to understand himself, and the more he understands about himself, the faster he runs.\n\nAnd the faster he runs, the larger the spotlight.\n\nAnd should he accomplish everything he plans, the spotlight will soon get much larger.\n\nVintage Noah Lyles story No. 3: Keisha recalls one time, when Noah was young, he asked for green food coloring and he got mad when she didn't have any. It was for his clothes. He wanted to go to church dressed like Peter Pan. So Keisha bought green dye and Noah went to church looking st like Peter Pan. Now, she says, he's still dressing up.\n\n\"He's always been really creative and quirky and just ... him,\" says Keisha. \"He polishes his nails and wears his hair in different colors and loves fashion. I really believe he's an artist who runs fast. That's how I look at it. And artists are just weird.\"\n\nCan Lyles-the weird artist-become track's first superstar since Usain Bolt?\n\nMichael Johnson, the only man to win both the 200 and 400 meters at the same Olympics (Atlanta in 1996), is planning to start a new international track league, Grand Slam Track. The success of the league depends on closing the gap between how Americans view the sport and how much of the rest of the world views it. He needs personalities who shine in major competitions. Says Johnson, \"We're seeing the greatest collection of stand-out personalities in this sport since I was competing.\"\n\nLyles, and such charismatic athletes as Sha'Carri Richardson and Kenny Bednarek, Johnson says, inspired the league he is creating. \"The type of energy Noah brings, it's fantastic,\" Johnson says. \"He's unafraid to have that spotlight on him and go out there and perform.\"\n\nThe artist is ready for his show in Paris.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Noah Lyles Doesn't Care What You Think About Him.", "source": {"uri": "fresnobee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Fresno Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "greg_bishop@fresnobee.com", "name": "Greg Bishop", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/s87gfc/picture290605854/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/9f151314-1f65-420a-a884-efc6e20ef0fd", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776464", "eventUri": "eng-9776464", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Noah Lyles says he wants to win four gold medals in Paris. Can he?\n\nEntering Paris, Noah Lyles holds the title of \"World's Fastest Man.\" The 27-year-old is the defending world champion in the 100m and 200m and is set up to be one of the faces of these Olympic Games.\n\nLyles has yet to win an Olympic gold medal - he took 200m bronze in Tokyo - but is shooting to achieve historic highs at the Paris Games.\n\n\"Three gold medals is great,\" Lyles said on The Kelly Clarkson Show. \"But I was talking to some of my family and friends, and they're like, 'You need to go bigger.' So, what's bigger than three? Four.\"\n\nNo male track athlete has ever won four sprint gold medals at an Olympic Games. Legends Jesse Owens and Carl Lewis each collected four golds at their Olympic zeniths in 1936 and 1984, as have four others. But those included medals in field or long-distance events. Lyles is shooting for four sprinting golds, which would be a first.\n\nLyles has qualified for the Olympic 100m and 200m - events in which he won gold at 2023 Worlds in Budapest - and is considered a shoe-in to run in the men's 4x100m relay in Paris. The most hotly contested facet of his grand plan, however, is his quest to earn a spot on the U.S. 4x400m relay team.\n\nOn a recent podcast appearance, Lyles told Track World News that he'd select himself for the U.S. 4x400m relay team alongside Chris Bailey, Michael Norman and Rai Benjamin. Lyles conspicuously omitted U.S. Olympic trials 400m champion Quincy Hall, who criticized Lyles in a post to X on July 19.\n\n\"(Noah Lyles) I don't bother nobody but my blocks ready anytime you feel like you can beat me in the 400 you was talking (too) much on my name on (your) little podcast,\" Hall wrote. \"I don't do the little slick comments and remarks I line up.\"\n\nNBC Sports broadcaster Ato Boldon feels confident about Lyles' chances to run in the 4x400m relay, if he prevails in his other events.\n\n\"I've been around long enough to know that if Noah Lyles wins the 100m in dramatic fashion, then wins the 200m, and the U.S. 4x100m team is standing on top of that podium for the first time since 2000 because of Noah's fantastic anchor leg, they will find a leg for him to run on one of those relays somewhere,\" Boldon said in a broadcast team roundtable. \"I don't think he's proven that he's earned a spot on that team, and maybe it becomes a political thing. But why is anybody going to care when you show up on the TODAY show with your four gold medals from Paris hanging around your neck? You think that Dorothy in Kansas gives a s***?\"\n\nLyles did run in the 4x400m relay squad that earned a silver medal at 2024 World Indoors in Glasgow. It remains to be seen if he'll run in the event at the Paris Games - but even if not, multiple gold medals are quite possibly in the offing for Lyles. He's aiming to become the first American man to win 100m gold since the 2004 Athens Olympics, when Justin Gatlin prevailed, and the first American man to win 200m gold since those same 2004 Games (Shawn Crawford).", "source": {"uri": "nbcolympics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "nbcolympics.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious_Metals", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Precious Metals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.nbcolympics.com/sites/default/files/2023-03/ParisDefaultThumbnail.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776464", "eventUri": "eng-9776464", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 1533, "textEnd": 1540}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Ironic, right?\" Lyles said. \"Sunglasses, a hat and a COVID mask gets the job done.\"\n\nLyles acknowledged that \"the true fans\" can still \"easily pick me out,\" but he's managed to fool the more casual ones who might only know him from his appearance on the Netflix docuseries Sprint, which was released earlier this month.\n\n\"For most of the people who have only seen me on TV once or twice or watched the doc series once, they don't know how tall or short I am,\" Lyles continued. \"It's a little harder for them.\"\n\nStill, Lyles explained that he hasn't totally closed himself off from interacting with other athletes and Olympic personnel inside the Village -- but it has to be on his own terms.\n\n\"I already have my set rules,\" he said. \"I don't take pictures while I eat, I don't take pictures when I'm with my girlfriend and I don't take pictures when I work out. Other than that, everything is pretty fair game. I don't have a problem with that.\"\n\nLyles' girlfriend, Junelle Bromfield, is with him in Paris on her own hunt for gold.

speedy time of 9.83 seconds.\n\nThe 27-year-old improved upon that time two weeks ago at a Diamond League event in London posting a time of 9.81.\n\nBut he will likely come face to face with Thompson who posted a world's best time of 9.77 seconds at the Jamaica trials last month.\n\nThompson revealed he didn't go full speed at the trials either meaning he could score an even lower time at the Olympics.\n\n\"The goal wasn't to prove anything tonight, just to run a 70 or 60 and see where I am at,\" Thompson said.\n\nAs long as Thompson stays healthy the 100m showdown between him and Lyles should be a nail-biter.\n\nThompson has missed out on competitions for years due to hamstring injuries in the past.\n\nJamaica has had a stronghold on winning the gold medal in the 100m at the Olympics winning it three of the last four times at the Summer Games.\n\nLegendary Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt won all three gold for his country and still has the world record time of 9.58 seconds for the 100-meter dash.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_aquino@the-sun.com", "name": "Matthew Aquino", "type": "author",

Keisha didn't understand why, until the USATF Indoor Nationals in Albuquerque, when Noah walked in with a motorcycle helmet on. \"Mom, you just don't get it. You don't get the vision,\" Lyles told her. Keisha agreed -- she did not get it. She just rolls with it.\n\nHow any one person views Noah Lyles will change this week, in Paris. His mother understands this, but she knows him. She knows that many will get things right about her son and others will get things so-so-so-so wrong.\n\nKeisha knows that some people will see or hear her ever-more accessible son and think: \"Not for me.\" But she does not spend even a millisecond on the notion that her son just wants attention. She waves that nonsense away.\n\nShe always encouraged Noah and his two siblings to be whatever they wanted. She often repeated to them a quote she once saw attributed to John Lennon: \"When I was five years old, my mother always told me that happiness was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down 'happy.' They told me I didn't understand the assignment. I told them they didn't understand life.\"\n\nShe says that when she discovered this quote, she thought: This is Noah.\n\nNoah Lyles is honest, engaging and often seems lost in his own version of outer space. He can come across as corny, but he doesn't care what people think, and that's important. He was making rap videos with his girlfriend as both prepped for the Olympics. He makes comments that sound like boasts -- or worse, hubris -- to many: \"That's what they all say, until they get beat!\" he booms on the Netflix docuseries SPRINT.\n\nIn Paris, the 27-year-old, six-time world champion could win three, maybe even four gold medals, including The Double, the 100 meters and 200 meters. He will also race in the 4X100 relay, and has discussed running in the 4X400 relay.\n\n\"Everybody thinks that it isn't attainable,\" Lyles says. \"But those are the things that I love.\"\n\nVintage Noah Lyles story No. 2: At the U.S. Track and Field trials in June, Lyles pulled out a series of Yu-Gi-Oh! cards before races. \"A lot of people were scrambling like me to figure out the meaning,\" Keisha says. \"I don't know the meaning of those! It means he's living his best life.\" Then, she says, after the 200-meter finals, Lyles walked into the stadium with a toy water gun. Keisha and Noah's father, Kevin Lyles -- both former college track athletes -- were confused.\n\nKevin asked, \"I thought we were trying to make that Olympic team. Are we out here playing with toys?\"\n\nOver the past three years, everything changed for Noah Lyles, his immediate family and everyone else in his inner orbit. Before the Tokyo Games in 2021, Lyles dealt with depression and anxiety, speaking openly about having been bullied, severe bouts of childhood asthma and twin diagnoses of Attention Deficit Disorder and Dyslexia. He won a bronze medal in the 200 in Tokyo, his first Olympics. And he presented all his differences to the world. Burned by some people's reactions, he sometimes retreated. But after Tokyo, he vowed to change.\n\n\"That makes a big difference. When you just stop caring about how other people view you,\" Keisha says. \"That's his journey from one Olympics to another. He's always been his own person. When we went to Tokyo, there was a lot more pressure, a lot more weight.\"\n\nHence the focus of these past three years. As much as there were tweaks to his form or fitness, Lyles also lasered in on understanding of self and his mental health. Improving those, he discovered, made him faster. When he looked inward, he noticed how exhausted being Noah Lyles made Noah Lyles. He committed to fewer events off the track, took fewer offers and searched for balance, not more sprints. He worked to create boundaries, to worry less about pleasing those outside his circle.\n\nAnd so that became his pattern -- and he got faster. He spoke about wanting to \"transcend\" track and field, as Allyson Felix had. As his mouth motored, Lyles turned his attention to achieving The Double in Paris.\n\nLyles went to Budapest in August 2023 for the world championships. He won the 100. He won the 200. He anchored the gold medal-winning 4X100 relay team, becoming the first athlete to win three golds at worlds since Usain Bolt in 2015.\n\n\"Last year, he really solidified himself. Just the effort, dedication and determination it took, to say, 'OK, I'm going to figure this 100 meters out. I'm going to get comfortable being uncomfortable,'\" Keisha says. \"And then I watched him. Perform at such a high level every round. That puts him in a totally different conversation.\"\n\nHis performance at the U.S. trials last month in Eugene continued to elevate Lyles's profile. His family had to stop eating at restaurants because of the crowds. He signed thousands of autographs, starred in SPRINT, flashed Yu-Gi-Oh! cards, and wore a bright red running suit and white pearls. When he entered Hayward Field at the trials, Snoop was carrying his bag stuffed with his gear. He then won the 100 and the 200 to qualify, loudly and speedily, for Paris. He discussed adding the 4X400.\n\nThere were 400-meter specialists from the U.S. who didn't much care for Lyles's volunteering for that relay in Paris. And there were track aficionados who scoffed when he labeled himself, on SPRINT, the world's fastest man. Some Jamaican athletes and fans argued that Lyles had flared existing issues with comments (his girlfriend, Junelle Bromfield, is a Jamaican sprinter) voiced in public and more than once. Lyles was overconfident, to put it kindly, or arrogant. He violated the sport's unwritten codes.\n\nBut nothing Lyles said was mean, cruel or delusional. There was a basis for everything he said. He is the fastest man in the world at the moment. He may still be after Paris, too. But his comments, true as they were, did not especially endear him to the insular community of track and field. But Noah is just trying to understand himself, and the more he understands about himself, the faster he runs.\n\nAnd the faster he runs, the larger the spotlight.\n\nAnd should he accomplish everything he plans, the spotlight will soon get much larger.\n\nVintage Noah Lyles story No. 3: Keisha recalls one time, when Noah was young, he asked for green food coloring and he got mad when she didn't have any. It was for his clothes. He wanted to go to church dressed like Peter Pan. So Keisha bought green dye and Noah went to church looking st like Peter Pan. Now, she says, he's still dressing up.\n\n\"He's always been really creative and quirky and just ... him,\" says Keisha. \"He polishes his nails and wears his hair in different colors and loves fashion. I really believe he's an artist who runs fast. That's how I look at it. And artists are just weird.\"\n\nCan Lyles -- the weird artist -- become track's first superstar since Usain Bolt?\n\nMichael Johnson, the only man to win both the 200 and 400 meters at the same Olympics (Atlanta in 1996), is planning to start a new international track league, Grand Slam Track. The success of the league depends on closing the gap between how Americans view the sport and how much of the rest of the world views it. He needs personalities who shine in major competitions. Says Johnson, \"We're seeing the greatest collection of stand-out personalities in this sport since I was competing.\"\n\nLyles, and such charismatic athletes as Sha'Carri Richardson and Kenny Bednarek, Johnson says, inspired the league he is creating. \"The type of energy Noah brings, it's fantastic,\" Johnson says. \"He's unafraid to have that spotlight on him and go out there and perform.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score":

When he first arrived in Paris last week, Lyles had his nails painted white, with the word \"ICON\" written in blue polish across his nails.\n\nOn social media, the look divided viewers, with one alleging that painted nails were meant for women. However, Lyles said that he's not letting the criticism get to him, since he doesn't take the comments too seriously.\n\n\"I'm a person who knows that a lot of people have different opinions and they have them for different reasons,\" he told US Weekly. \"To be honest, I'm so confident in myself that it doesn't really matter.

I will say this. Anybody who thought I was cocky and met me, they're instantly like: 'Oh, that's the nicest, coolest guy I've ever met in my life.'\"\n\nHe further described how people's opinions of him change once they get to know him. \"I never blame anybody who thinks that I'm cocky. It's just a 'you haven't met me situation.' That's all,\" he concluded.\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics isn't Lyles' first time showcasing his painted nails. At the New Balance Indoor Grand Prix in February, he had his nails painted red and black, and also shared a photo of his hands over his face after competing in the event on social media.\n\n\"I have waited and worked for eight years to see the numbers I have produced this year in the 60m.

I'm getting faster every week.\n\nBut that's not always the case which has proved challenging for the American since arriving in Paris.\n\n\"Apparently the world loves 'SPRINT' and athletes do too, and I've become kind of popular in the village,\" Lyles said at the U.S. athletics team's press conference on Monday.\n\n\"Unfortunately, that has come with its own set of challenges. I'm not even the most popular person in the village, so I know I'm not the only one who's had to deal with this.\n\n\"Even though some might be superstars in your eyes, we still are human beings, and we do want to be able to have our space and our time,\" he added.\n\nLyles admits to an increased focus on his mental state ahead of the track events in Paris where he competes in the first round of 100 metres on Saturday.\n\nWorking alongside therapists, his need for space is linked to a desire to seclude himself from others which include eating at 'very random times' alongside girlfriend and Jamaican sprinter Junelle Bromfield.\n\nHis efforts come to a head in Paris in the hope of claiming Olympic 200m gold, a feat he was expected to achieve in Tokyo.\n\nLyles came third in the Covid-affected games which took place without spectators and having battled with depression at the time, he hoped to treat the Olympics as he would any other race.\n\nHowever, the American admits to poor psychological preparation in Tokyo but has opted to enjoy the moment this time round by adopting a different approach.\n\n\"That mindset of 'it's just another competition' was definitely ringing in my mind, trying to get through this depression. I was just like, 'You do this every day, you got this,'\" said Lyles.\n\n\"But I'm an emotional person. And when I got to the finals and we walked into that empty stadium, I remember we're all standing behind our blocks, that's usually the moment when in my head I'm like, 'it's showtime!' and I just remember thinking 'This is not it. This is not fun. This is not cool. This is not what I wanted.'\n\n\"That was literally the last few thoughts I had as I got into the blocks, and it sucked.\"\n\nThis time round, when I made that team, I felt so excited. I remember when they gave us these hats, it's now my favourite hat, I have not taken it really off since making the team,\" he said.\n\n\"That to remind myself to enjoy the moment. This is fun.

(A popular new Netflix documentary, Sprint, examines this dynamic in-depth.) Many rivalries are quieter: athletes display outward respect and admiration for each other and do most of their talking on the track (or field). Others are not so subtle. As the second week of the Paris Games approaches - the first full day of the Olympic track-and-field competition takes place on August 2 at the Stade de France - all eyes turn toward the runners, throwers, and jumpers. Here are six of the sport's best rivalries to watch.\n\nAmerican Noah Lyles, the defending world champion in the 100 m and 200 m, hasn't exactly endeared himself to his fellow countrymen over the years. At the start of last year's world championships in Budapest, Fred Kerley -- the Tokyo Olympic silver medalist and 2022 world-title winner in the 100 -- declared in a press conference: \"I'm Fred Kerley, this is my title. If Noah's going to run 9.65, then I'm running faster.\" Sitting on the same dais, Lyles chirped: \"That's what they all say till they get beat.\" And beat Kerley Lyles did in Hungary.\n\nAnd after Lyles chased down American phenom Erriyon Knighton, then 18, at the 200-m U.S. nationals in 2022, Lyles pointed a finger at Knighton as they passed the finish. \"That's called being posterized right there,\" NBC commentator Ato Boldon said. NBC interviewed both athletes side-by-side after the race: Knighton left the chat early, as Lyles was boasting about the victory. Knighton later refused to answer questions about the exchange.\n\nIn an interview with TIME this April, Knighton sounded like he'd rather talk about his preferred color of paint chip than Lyles. When asked what makes Lyles so difficult to race against, Knighton was terse. \"I don't know, I'm not really his coach,\" he said. \"I don't study him.\"\n\nLyles won the 100 m and 200 m at this year's U.S. Olympic trials. And after struggling with his mental health in the lead-up to Tokyo, where he won a disappointing 200-m bronze, Lyles is primed for Paris. \"I can finally say I'm showing up to an Olympic Games not depressed,\" Lyles said on Monday. \"And it feels amazing.\"\n\nKerley took third in the 100, while Knighton qualified third in the 200, at trials. Kenny Bednarek, the 200-m silver medalist in Tokyo, finished second in both events and is a threat to do damage in Tokyo. \"I think the dark horse, in both the 100 and 200, is Kenny,\" says Justin Gatlin, the five-time Olympic medalist who now hosts a track podcast.\n\nJamaica has dominated the women's 100 and 200 at the last two Olympics. Elaine Thompson-Herah swept the gold medals in both races, at both Games. Jamaica went 1-2-3 in the 100 in Tokyo.\n\nBut Sha'Carri Richardson wasn't in Japan: remember, the American 100-m star was suspended for testing positive for cannabis before Tokyo. She has the fastest 100-m time in the world this year, and at last year's world championships, Jamaican sprinters Shericka Jackson and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce finished behind Richardson, in second and third, respectively. (Thompson-Herah will miss the Paris Olympics due to an Achilles injury.) In the 200, Harvard grad Gabby Thomas ran the world's best time this year at the U.S. trials, but Jackson is the world defending champ.\n\n\"I love it,\" Thomas says of the U.S.-Jamaica clashes on the track. \"We're pushing each other to run some really cool times. Women's sprints right now are incredible to watch. I wish I could just be a fan.\"\n\nWhat do the United States, Norway, and Brazil have in common? Definitely not levels of snowfall.\n\nNo, these three nations, disparate at first glance, have produced the three fastest 400-m hurdlers of all time.\n\nAnd they'll all be in Paris. Back in Tokyo three summers ago, Karsten Warholm of Norway and Rai Benjamin of the United States ran the race of the Games: Warhom broke a world record, running under 46 seconds for the first time in history; Benjamin, meanwhile, ran the second-fastest race ever, but that still wasn't good enough for gold. Alison Dos Santos of Brazil finished third, with the third-fastest time in history: he then improved that time at the next year's world championships, winning the title.\n\n\"What we're doing is not normal,\" Dos Santos said before an Olympic tune-up race in Monaco a few weeks ago. Mark your calendars for this one.\n\nMen's 400-m hurdles final: Friday, August 9, 9:45 p.m. in Paris, 3:45 p.m. E.T.\n\nSydney McLaughlin-Levrone of the United States and Femke Bol of the Netherlands are so far ahead of the field in this race, their 400-m hurdles time could have qualified for Paris in the 400-m flat. They're the only two women in history to run this event under 51 seconds, and McLaughlin-Levrone broke her own world record in the 400-m hurdles at the U.S. Olympic trials in late June. But in July, Bol served notice that she's a real threat to McLaughlin-Levrone's supremacy: she set a new European record of 50.95 seconds at a meet in Switzerland. According to the Olympic information services, Bol's nickname is Bambi, \"given to her by her teammates as she is the youngest and seen as being a bit clumsy.\"\n\n\"We cannot overlook the fact that in the last couple of years, Femke Bol has definitely upped her game,\" says Gatlin. \"We're at a point now where it comes down to positioning. If Femke has a good lane where she feeds off of Sydney's energy and kind of maybe pace her or track her, she can strike in the home stretch and run stride-for-stride with Sydney.\"\n\nThe GOATs are going head-to-head in hurdles. \"Sydney is the clear favorite,\" Bol said in Paris on Tuesday. \"But I will be ready for it.\"\n\nJakob Ingebrigtsen of Norway is the defending Olympic champion in the 1,500-m. Josh Kerr of Great Britain is the defending world champ in the metric mile, having passed Ingebrigtsen during a ferocious kick in the last 200 m at last year's worlds. The pair have taken a war of words into these Olympics. Kerr has said that Ingebrigtsen has a \"high ego,\" is surrounded by \"yes men,\" and \"has some flaws in the manners realm.\" And after Kerr broke Mo Farah's indoor two-mile world record at the Millrose Games in New York City in February, Ingebrigtsen, who did not compete in that event, said: \"I would have beaten him in that race, blindfolded.\"\n\nThe Ingebrigtsen-Kerr clash even has Gatlin, who's a sprinter through and through, juiced. \"It brings a whole different component to their event,\" says Gatlin. \"Like, yeah, there's been rivalries in the past, but never to this level of people talking smack to each other and really having a grudge. When they go out there and run, it makes you want to grab your popcorn and go out to this race.\"\n\nMen's 1,500-m final: Tuesday, August 6, 8:50 p.m. in Paris, 3:50 p.m. E.T.\n\nThis rivalry is far friendlier, which is ironic, given the long history of conflict and border skirmishes between these two countries. In fact, Arshad Nadeem of Pakistan even lists Neeraj Chopra of India, the reigning Olympic and world champion, as his hero in his official Olympic bio. Chopra offered vocal support for Nadeem when he was fighting his federation to secure a new javelin. Nadeem, the flag bearer for Pakistan's seven-member athlete delegation at the opening ceremonies, won silver at last year's world championship, so he's a clear contender to end his hero's run of golds. He's the first Pakistani to win a medal at worlds; the country has never won an Olympic track-and-field medal in its history.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"},

He is decked out in all white -- a glittery Armani jacket, white pants, white shoes, white sunglasses and white pearls he has draped along his braided hairline. He has even painted his nails in a pearly white polish.\n\nSurrounded by a dozen cameramen, he sticks out his tongue. Then he wipes his smile away. Straight face. Then he brings back his grin. His face moves seamlessly as the flashes go on and off.\n\n\"Have y'all gotten what you need?\" he asks.\n\nIt's two weeks before the U.S. Olympic trials and nearly two months before the Olympic Games where he seems destined to make history as the fastest man on the planet. His journey has demanded so much more than outrunning opponents. He has overcome asthma, depression and disappointment. Finally, the moment is his.\n\nOn this sunny June day, Lyles has stepped away from the track for the prescreening of the Netflix documentary \"Sprint.\" He's one of the main characters.\n\nLyles walks into the theater room for a fireside conversation. He sits on a chair in the center of the stage and picks up the mic.\n\nSanya Richards-Ross, the 400-meter gold medalist in London, showers him with titles as she introduces him to the crowd. \"The face of track and field.\" \"World champion.\" And then, \"Olympic champion.\"\n\nLyles shakes his head and the smile disappears from his face. The camera flashes go on and off.\n\n\"No. Not an Olympic champion,\" he says. \"Not yet.\"\n\nLYLES SAT UP in his bed in the dead of night and tried to stay silent. He was just 3 years old and the cough that had come out of nowhere weeks earlier refused to leave. Night after night, he struggled to breathe in, breathe out. The coughs came in fits.\n\n\"My poor siblings,\" Lyles says. \"We slept in the same room.\"\n\nOn many nights his mom tiptoed into his room in their home in Gainesville, Florida. She propped Noah up and held him as he tried to fall asleep. She sat there for hours, worrying and rubbing sleep from her eyes.\n\n\"He couldn't eat without coughing. He couldn't play,\" Keisha Caine Bishop says. \"His quality of life went down.\"\n\nDoctors told Keisha that her oldest son had reactive airway disease, which meant irritants such as pollen could set off a cough. Sometimes the wheezing got so bad that Keisha would rush him to the emergency room. The cough led to ear infections. And more doctors. When Lyles was 5, an especially bad bout of coughing and wheezing sent him back to the ER.\n\n\"Can you ask the doctor to please make me better?\" Noah said to Keisha, holding her hands. Keisha smiled sadly at her child. \"Yes, baby, we're going to try our best.\"\n\nThe attending doctor ran some tests and concluded that Lyles had asthma. He put Noah on a nebulizer treatment and sent him home. Keisha researched ways to minimize the attacks. A main culprit? Dust. She ripped up their carpets, took down the curtains and threw away all the stuffed toys. She bought an air purifier and had an HVAC technician clean out their air ducts. She swapped dairy products for greens. She made juice out of carrots, beets and celery, and that became the first thing Noah drank -- without fussing -- every morning. Keisha homeschooled her three children so she could focus on Noah's needs.\n\nDespite Keisha's efforts, Noah was largely stuck inside and needed an outlet for his boundless energy. Drawing anime characters and superheroes helped him pass the time. The speedy and agile Spider-Man was his favorite. He filled his notebook with his intricate sketches.\n\nFinally, when Lyles was 7, doctors removed his tonsils and adenoids to make it easier for him to breathe. When he woke up after surgery, Lyles took in the biggest breath of air in his life. I can finally go play basketball. Soon, he was playing tag with his friends, and they struggled to keep up. \"Everybody starts scattering, because they know that somebody's about to be it, and it could be them at any moment that I choose,\" Noah says now, laughing.\n\nWhen Noah was 12, he woke up one morning, his lungs congested, his breathing coming out in short gasps. Keisha rushed him to the hospital. He was diagnosed with swine flu, a virus that affected millions of Americans in 2009. The doctor hooked him up to a breathing machine, as Keisha stood by his bed, holding his hands.\n\nNoah stayed in the hospital for two days. It took him two weeks to be able to breathe normally and to stop coughing. And then it was back to running.\n\n\"I'm a kid, and I'm going to just go run through the wall, you know?\" Noah says, laughing again. \"If I die, I die, but I'm going to die a happy kid.\"\n\nHAPPINESS, TO LYLES, is speed. His dad, Kevin Lyles, won a gold medal as an alternate in the 4x400 relay at the 1995 world championships. His mom was an All-American sprinter at Seton Hall. When he was 11 or 12 years old, Lyles began running the 100 and 200 meters at local meets, and he blew the other kids away. A few years earlier he couldn't imagine running for fun. Now he was running so fast and winning by so much that races were borderline boring.\n\nHis parents separated when Lyles was in seventh grade, and Keisha moved with the kids to Virginia, enrolling Noah and his younger brother Josephus at T.C. Williams (now renamed Alexandria City High School), which had a standout track program.\n\nThe Noah Lyles story everybody there talks about to this day happened in P.E. class. The teacher took his class to a grass field near campus and separated them into two groups. He asked Noah's group to run four laps and watched them set off. He then walked over to the other group to give them instructions. The teacher peered back at Noah's group and saw him standing in the field, hands on hips. The other kids in the group were still running -- and not even close to finishing the course. He walked over and asked Noah why he wasn't running. \"You asked me to run four laps, and I did,\" Noah said. The teacher did not believe Noah. He accused him of only running three. \"I'll show you again,\" Noah said. The P.E. teacher clicked his stopwatch and Noah ran around the field four times. It took him 7 minutes, 15 seconds, half the time it was taking the other kids.\n\nThe P.E. teacher told the rest of the school about Noah, and Michael Hughes, the track coach, showed up to watch the next day. He still remembers his first thought when he saw Noah run for the first time.\n\n\"This is how Beethoven's music teacher must have felt,\" Hughes says.\n\nAs a freshman, Noah outran almost everybody in the sprints -- not just in the school, but in the entire state. But up until his sophomore year, Noah came home from races exhausted. As he'd grown older, and his lungs got stronger, his asthma got better -- he didn't devolve into coughs or need to be rushed to the ER anymore. But his asthma made the recovery after a race agonizing. If a race happened on the weekend, he often missed school on Monday. \"He would be in bed for two days after a race because it just wiped him out,\" Keisha says.\n\nWatching her son struggle, Keisha regularly asked him, \"What is it that you want out of life? What is your purpose on this earth?\"\n\nNoah simply said: to run really fast.\n\nKeisha committed to doing everything she could to make Noah's dream possible. She reached out to doctors and specialists, who recommended a regimen of vitamins and supplements to build up Noah's weak lungs. Slowly, Noah began to get stronger, and even faster.\n\nWhen Noah was a sophomore, he represented Team USA in the Youth Olympics in China and won gold in the 200 meters. He set a personal best of 20.71 in the semifinals and won the final in 20.80. \"I took the win from the Jamaicans. I took the win from everybody else,\" he said after the race.\n\nWhen Noah turned 16, Keisha reached out to Diana McNab, who was her sports psychologist at Seton Hall, and asked her to work with Noah. She knew her son was physically gifted, and she wanted to make sure he was mentally prepared as well. McNab lived in Denver and had helped several high-performing athletes. One day, McNab suggested a hiking trip and watched as Noah packed his inhaler and checked twice to make sure that he still had it.\n\nDuring the hike, a look of confusion crossed Noah's face.\n\n\"Why do people hike?\" he turned around and asked McNab.\n\n\"Because it's beautiful and it's outside,\" she responded.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" he said, shaking his head. \"Running is the only way to go.\"\n\nSPEED BECAME LYLES' OBSESSION.\n\n\"His biggest asset was his tenacity in training,\" Hughes says. \"He would push himself to the very limits every time.\"\n\nLyles devised ways to set himself apart in the 200 meters, focusing on the curve. He sat with Hughes and talked physics: feet angles, weight distribution, momentum, force. His understanding of the human body and its ability to generate speed seemed innate to Hughes. But understanding was one thing. Executing was another.\n\n\"It took us a long time to refine it,\" Hughes says.\n\nBy the time Lyles was a senior, he had perfected how to lean his shoulders into the lane to keep his speed through the curve and then slingshot out of it.\n\nJust in time for the 2016 Olympic track trials.\n\n\"Mom,\" Lyles said just before trials. \"I'm going to make the Olympic team.\"\n\nKeisha burst into laughter. \"You're a senior in high school. Don't you mean 2020?\"\n\n\"No,\" Lyles said. \"I mean 2016.\"\n\nLyles, who had committed to Florida, made the final of the 200 at the trials. He finished fourth after three Olympians -- 34-year-old Justin Gatlin, 30-year-old LaShawn Merritt and 25-year-old Ameer Webb.\n\nThe fourth-place finish emboldened Lyles. If I can almost beat grown adults as an 18-year-old, imagine what I can do with more training and growth.\n\nAfter the race, Lyles turned pro, signed with Adidas and decommitted from Florida.\n\nAround the same time, his asthma attacks largely subsided, thanks to his supplements, his USATF-approved medication and air purifiers for his hotel room. His breathing struggles went away when he jumped in the tub and took a long, hot bath and waited for his sinuses to clear.\n\nBy 2018, he was dominating the 200 meters. He got the word \"icon\" tattooed on his torso. In 2019, he won his first world championship and vowed he was only getting started.\n\nAll signs pointed to Lyles winning the gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics in 2020.\n\nKEISHA PUT TOGETHER a care package filled with cleaning supplies, disinfectants, soaps and masks and mailed it to Noah soon after the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March 2020. She was living in Maryland, and Noah was training in Florida. She worried about people hoarding supplies from grocery stores. More than that, she worried that Noah's asthma made him especially susceptible to the disease.\n\nNoah shared her concern. He stocked up on masks. He rarely left his apartment after his training venue shut down. He used delivery services for food and groceries.\n\nOn May 25, George Floyd was murdered by a police officer in Minneapolis, reigniting the Black Lives Matter movement. Lyles sat in his apartment and scrolled through his phone, his mind churning with anger and then despair. How can I make my voice heard?\n\nHe called Keisha. \"Are we even safe?\" he asked.\n\nWhen the travel restrictions lifted, Keisha flew to Orlando. Masked, she walked into Noah's apartment. When she saw his face, her stomach constricted.\n\n\"He had no light in his eyes,\" Keisha says.\n\nA few years earlier, the Lyles family had taken the Birkman assessment -- a thorough test that reveals a person's underlying needs that drive and inspire them -- and Noah's results came back 99 out of 100 for social interactions. He was a pure extrovert, and he thrived on conversing and sharing energy and ideas with people.\n\nNow, Noah didn't want to do anything. He didn't want to leave his apartment. He didn't want to interact with people.\n\nThe pandemic and the murder of George Floyd made everything seem dire. He lost his purpose. He lost his drive.\n\nKeisha called Noah's therapist and informed her what she saw. Together, they made an appointment with a psychiatrist. Noah was diagnosed with clinical depression, and he was prescribed medication. He posted on social media that he was on antidepressants. He wanted people who were living with mental illness to know that they weren't alone.\n\nHe slowly resumed his workouts ahead of the 2021 track season. He received his COVID-19 vaccine. The antidepressants, too, began to take effect. They also contributed to him gaining eight unwanted pounds.\n\nStill, Noah tried. Most meets leading up to the Tokyo Olympics happened in empty stadiums, and Noah called McNab. \"What am I going to do?\" he asked her. He had always drawn energy from the crowds.\n\n\"'You're going to pretend that you feel great for 19 seconds, who the frick can't fake that, Noah?'\" McNab told him. \"He became the actor and acted [like] himself.\"\n\nAt the U.S. trials, Lyles wore a black glove and raised his fist before the 100.\n\n\"We're still dying in the street,\" he said to the media after he finished seventh and failed to qualify for the Olympics. \"...This needs to stop.\"\n\nHe secured his first trip to the Olympics when he won the 200 in 19.74 seconds.\n\nStill, his running felt off to Lyles and looked off to his coaches. They attributed it to the extra weight and the antidepressants. Mentally, he was feeling better, so he consulted with his mom and his doctors and decided to stop taking antidepressants.\n\nAt the Tokyo Olympics, in an empty stadium, Lyles finished third in the 200, in 19.74 seconds. He sobbed through his postrace interview as he addressed his depression and his feeling of hopelessness as a Black American.\n\nAs she watched, Keisha blamed herself for her son's disappointing season. \"Noah,\" she said after sitting him down. \"I really beat myself up a lot. Did we make the right decision?\"\n\nNoah didn't pause to think before answering. \"Mom, we made the right decision.\"\n\n\"I have to remind myself, we appreciate the spotlight, but at the end of the day, this is my kid, so what's more important -- the mental health of my kid, or him running fast?\" Keisha says.\n\n\"We chose his mental health.\"\n\nUSAIN BOLT CLAPPED his hands as Lyles blazed down the track in Jamaica last year. The world-record holder smiled wide as Lyles did what he always does these days: He won the 200.\n\nLyles walked over to Bolt and delivered an enthusiastic hug. \"Keep the same attitude, bruh,\" Bolt said to Lyles. \"This sport needs that s---, we need that personality.\"\n\nAfter his disappointment in Tokyo, Lyles pinpointed Paris as the place he would become an Olympic champion. He started lifting heavier, and he converted those eight extra pounds into eight pounds of muscle. On the track, he focused on getting out of the starting blocks faster.\n\nHe has seen the returns. Since Tokyo, Lyles has won three individual golds at the world championships, including the 100- and 200-double in 2023. At the 2022 world championships, he broke Michael Johnson's American record when he finished in 19.31. It's the third-fastest time ever, behind only Bolt (19.19) and Yohan Blake (19.26).\n\nHis performances before and after races have been equally entertaining. He screams to the skies as his name is announced. He brings anime cards to the starting blocks. He paints his nails, wears bling and colors his hair in bright shades. He once did an alley-oop celebration after crossing the finish line that angered even his mom. \"I throw myself on the mercy of the court,\" Noah said to Keisha after she told him to knock it off. Sponsors, including Adidas, Celsius, Omega, Comcast and Visa, have ponied up.\n\nAt news conferences, he's bold and brash and unfiltered. After the 2023 world championships, he riled up the sports world when a reporter asked how track and field could grow its popularity.\n\n\"You know the thing that hurts me the most is that I have to watch the NBA Finals and they have 'world champion' on their head,\" Lyles said. \"World champion of what? The United States?\"\n\nThe comment went viral. Kevin Durant wrote, \"Somebody better help this brother,\" on social media. Draymond Green wrote, \"When being smart goes wrong.\"\n\nThe attention -- good and bad -- energizes Lyles. He knows the spotlight stays only as long as he wins on the track, and he relishes the work.\n\nHe goes so far as to script his races with his sports psychologist before he runs.\n\nI walk into the arena. I am smiling widely, my Cheshire cat smile. I walk over to my blocks. I jump -- high -- tucking my knees to my chest. For a split second, I hover over the earth above all of my opponents. I land -- softly. I look down at my lane. Now I bend low. I place my feet on the blocks. On your marks. Get set. Go. My hands come up to my chin. My knee comes up in front of me. I'm jackhammering to the track. I slingshot out of the curve. I'm racing past the rest of the crowd. I can feel the tape brushing my chest. I'm number one. I'm laughing, my hands in the air, my gaze to the sky.\n\nThe two emotions that remain the same in every script? Precision -- and \"having fun, being joyful throughout,\" Lyles says.\n\n\"He's racing from his heart,\" McNab says. \"It's all spiritual.\"\n\nIt's also technical. Lyles has trained his 27-year-old, 5-foot-11, 170-pound body to apply 300 pounds of force onto the starting blocks and propel himself to a top speed, he says, of 26 mph. \"If I ran in a school zone, I'd get a ticket,\" Lyles said in June during his appearance on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\"\n\nLyles hopes it's also historical. He wants to leave Paris with four gold medals, in the 100, 200, 4x100 relay and 4x400 relay. Nobody has ever done it. Only nine men since 1904 have won double gold in the 100 and 200 individual sprints. He also wants Bolt's world records.\n\n\"What do I got to do to be considered the greatest when I leave this sport,\" Lyles says. It's a sentence, not a question. \"Grabbing an Olympic gold. Grabbing a world record. I want to get it.\"\n\nLYLES TROTS DOWN the ramp and slaps the outstretched hands of fans lining the entryway to the Icahn Stadium track. He's decked out in a bright yellow onesie, his hair adorned with pearls, for his first 200-meter race of the 2024 season. He pumps his fists in the air and then takes off -- fast -- for the starting blocks.\n\nExactly 19.77 seconds after he bounds out of the blocks at the New York City Grand Prix, he crosses the finish line. An organizer hands him a winner's bouquet, and he throws it into the air. A young girl catches it, grinning ear to ear.\n\nHe walks over to the stands and beckons the photographers to change their position so they can capture him from a new angle.\n\nLyles reaches his arms wide. He grins. Then, he wipes the smile away. Straight face. Then he squats, brings his grin back. Flashes go on and off as his face moves seamlessly.\n\nHe grabs a mic from the organizer and his radiant smile grows wide. He speaks directly to the fans.", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type":

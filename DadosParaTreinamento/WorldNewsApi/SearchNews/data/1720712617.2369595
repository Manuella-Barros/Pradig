[+] hiring significantly for these roles getty Finding a remote job is difficult enough. But locating a fully remote job that pays more than $200,000? The chances are slimmer than ever before. A new Ladders study uncovered some startling data about salaries in 2024, their buying power, and how the pendulum is shifting from fully remote and hybrid work to RTO (return-to-office) for the highest-paid earners. To have the buying power of a job that paid $100,000 a year in 1994, you would need to be making more than $200,000 today in 2024, the analysis revealed. And although in early 2023, there were at least 10% of jobs paying upwards of $200,000 available as remote, today that figure has plummeted by 60%, making it even harder to secure a high-paying job that is fully remote or even hybrid. However all is not lost. While employers may be clamping down on their work-from-home policies for their high-earning, white-collar employees, there are some industries that typically tend to favor remote work, at least slightly more than others. One such industry is fintech, which means financial technology. Fintech firms provide software and financial services such as banking, enabled by technology to make these services more secure or easier for their users. However you must bear in mind that due to the fact that the highest-paying fully remote (and hybrid) jobs are a rare find, the competition for these roles (and the companies that hire them) will be fierce. You would need to seriously stand out as an exceptional candidate with extensive experience under your belt, and specializations and certifications. You would also need to be able to sell yourself with strong results that speak to your career achievements within your resume, LinkedIn profile, and application.

The Strictly Come Dancing star, 34, is under fire amid accusations about his training technique while on the BBC show after Sherlock star, Amanda Abbington, claimed she was left with PTSD after dancing with the Sicilian-born performer. Giovanni has strenuously denied claims he was 'abusive or threatening' to any celebrities on the show. Despite the furore, the dancer didn't look like he was letting the drama get to him when he popped up in a video on Instagram, promoting luxury hotel Perola in Portugal. Parading around in the sun with his girlfriend, Molly Brown, the dancer clinks glasses with the model, before swimming - in slow motion - in a crystal clear pool while flogging his cologne, Vita, which also features in the ad. Captioning the video, Perola gushed: \"Immerse yourself in Gio & Molly\u2019s glamorous escape on Madeira Island. Our world-class dancer chose one of our off-grid sanctuaries to celebrate life, success, and love. You too can embrace the serenity of this hidden gem, where tranquility meets opulence.\" Giovanni's legion of loyal fans seized the opportunity to throw their support behind him amid his Strictly woes. One gushed: \"Absolutely Stunning. You deserve all the success that you so deservedly Earn, You are so respected for being YOU a dedicated hard working Lovely man who seems to put others first to make them shine, Bravo Gio.\" Another referred to reports the star has quit Strictly, saying: \"You will be SO missed on Strictly I won\u2019t be watching it now good luck for the future\", while a third replied: \"You deserve to be happy Gio and I wish you both all the very best.\" While many of Giovanni's Strictly colleagues have stayed silent following the recent allegations, notably Rose Aylling-Ellis, who \"is just trying to not get involved\", according to an insider, one of his most-loved partners has come to his aid. Much-loved magician's assistant, Debbie McGee took to Instagram to show fans that her support for the star has not wavered since the recent allegations. Giovanni took social media asking fans to vote for him and Anton Du Beke at the National Television Awards, where they have picked up a nomination for their travel series. Debbie, who was partnered with the Italian in 2017, wrote: \"On it\" alongside a supportive heart emoji. It's not the first time Debbie has reached out to the dancer this year. When allegations first emerged of a fallout between Giovanni and his 2023 dance partner, Amanda, the wife of late magician, Paul Daniels made it clear whose side she was on. Debbie posted a throwback snap of herself dancing with the star and wrote: \"Happy memories, Giovanni and I had the best of times on Strictly.\" The dancer was quick to express his thanks for the support, replying: \"Love you \u2026 thank you.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "summary": "Giovanni Pernice has returned to social media with an update with model girlfriend Molly Brown, amid allegations of 'threatening and abusive' behaviour in the training room at Strictly Come Dancing - which the star strongly denies", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/giovanni-pernices-fans-rally-round-32895957", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32896006.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN-Giovanni-Pernices-fans-rally-round-him-as-he-shares-update-as-Strictly-pals-continue-to-stay-s.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:14:39", "author": "Victoria Johns,Victoria-johns", "authors": ["Victoria Johns", "Victoria-johns"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.339}

But heavy strikes in recent days along the length of the territory also could be aimed at putting more pressure on Hamas in the cease-fire talks.\n\nIn a visit Wednesday to central Gaza, Israel's military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said forces were operating in different ways, in multiple parts of the territory \"to carry out a very important mission: pressure. We will continue operating to bring home the hostages.\"\n\nIsrael informed people in Gaza of the evacuation order by dropping leaflets urging \"all those in Gaza City\" to take two \"safe routes\" south to the area around the central town of Deir al-Balah. Gaza City, it said, will \"remain a dangerous combat zone.\"\n\nMonths ago, Israel ordered residents of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, to flee south, and much of the population left earlier in the war. Large parts of Gaza City and urban areas around it have been flattened or left a shattered landscape by previous Israeli assaults.\n\nThe United Nations says about 300,000 Palestinians have remained in the hard-hit north, with the bulk of those said to be in Gaza City.\n\nMost of Gaza's 2.3 million people are crammed into squalid tent camps in central and southern Gaza.\n\nIsraeli troops have pushed into parts of Gaza City in recent days, triggering the flight of thousands of Palestinians trying to escape shelling and airstrikes. This past week, the military ordered Palestinians to evacuate from eastern and central parts of the city.\n\nThere was no immediate mass exodus from the city following Wednesday's order. Many Palestinians have concluded that there is no refuge in war-stricken Gaza.\n\nThe military, meanwhile, said it wrapped up an operation launched late last month in the Gaza City neighborhood of Shijaiyah, where it killed dozens of militants and destroyed eight underground tunnels.\n\nWednesday's evacuation order came after a series of deadly strikes over the past two days in other parts of the territory. Israeli bombardment early Wednesday hit four houses in Deir al-Balah and the nearby Nuseirat refugee camp, killing 20 Palestinians.\n\nAmong the dead were six children and three women, according to officials at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where the casualties were taken. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies. The house hit in Deir al-Balah was inside the \"humanitarian safe zone\" where Israel has told Palestinians to flee for refuge.\n\nThe overnight bombardment came hours after Israeli warplanes struck the entrance of a school sheltering displaced families outside the southern city of Khan Younis. The toll from the strike rose to 31 people killed, including eight children, and more than 50 wounded, officials at the nearby Nasser Hospital said Wednesday.\n\nFootage aired by Al Jazeera television showed kids playing soccer in the school's yard when a sudden boom shook the area, prompting shouts of \"a strike, a strike!\"\n\nThe Israeli army said the airstrike near the school and reports of civilian casualties were under review. It claimed it was targeting a Hamas militant who took part in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war, though it provided no immediate evidence. The military blames civilian deaths on Hamas because the militants fight in dense, urban areas. But the army rarely comments on what it is targeting in individual strikes, which often kill women and children.\n\nIn nine months of bombardment and offensives in Gaza, Israel has killed more than 38,200 people and wounded more than 88,000, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Nearly the entire population has been driven from their homes. Many have been displaced multiple times.\n\nDuring the Oct. 7 raid, militants killed 1,200 people in southern Israel, most of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities. The militants took roughly 250 people hostage. About 120 are still in captivity, with about a third said to be dead.\n\nIsrael's new ground assault in Gaza's largest city has prompted what the U.N called a \"dangerously chaotic\" exodus of people scattering in multiple directions, unsure where to go. Some have fled to other parts of the north. The new Israeli military leaflets encouraged a mass movement south to the purported \"humanitarian zone,\" promising that people leaving Gaza City on the defined routes would not be stopped at Israeli checkpoints. Many Palestinians fear arrest or humiliation by troops at the checkpoints.\n\nAfter Israel on Monday called for an evacuation from eastern and central parts of Gaza City, staff at two hospitals -- Al-Ahli and the Patients Friends Association Hospital -- rushed to move patients and shut down, the United Nations said.\n\nHospitals in Gaza have often evacuated preemptively at any sign of possible Israeli military action, fearing raids. In the past nine months, Israeli troops have attacked at least eight hospitals, causing the deaths of patients and medical workers along with massive destruction to facilities and equipment. Israel has claimed Hamas uses hospitals for military purposes, though it has provided only limited evidence.\n\nOnly 13 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are functioning, and those only partially, according to the United Nations' humanitarian office.\n\nAmid the ongoing violence, international mediators were making a new concerted effort to push through a proposed deal for a cease-fire and release of hostages.\n\nIsrael and Hamas had appeared to narrow the gaps in recent days, but obstacles remain, even after Hamas agreed to relent on its key demand that Israel commit to ending the war as part of any agreement.\n\nHamas still wants mediators to guarantee that negotiations conclude with a permanent cease-fire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted he will not sign any deal forcing Israel to stop its campaign in Gaza without eliminating Hamas.

the past four days, Israel has struck four schools in Gaza where hundreds of civilians sought refuge, resulting in the deaths of over 50 Palestinians, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees has said.\n\nThe latest deadly strike hit a school turned shelter in southern Gaza on July 9 as Israeli forces in the war-ravaged territory's main city pushed on with a major offensive that has again displaced Palestinians.\n\nA hospital source in Khan Younis in southern Gaza said at least 29 people were killed when the school was hit in nearby Abasan.\n\nThe Israeli military said its air force had carried out a strike in the area targeting a \"terrorist\" and would review the incident.\n\nThree previous Israeli strikes since July 6 on schools across Gaza used by displaced Palestinians have killed a total of at least 20 people, according to officials and rescuers.\n\nCondemning the attack, UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini said on July 10 that Israel has targeted two-thirds of UNRWA schools since the war began last October.\n\nLazzarini emphasized that schools in Gaza have ceased to be sanctuaries of education and beacons of hope for children, instead transforming into \"overcrowded shelters.\" He remarked that Gaza is unequivocally unsuitable for children.\n\n\"The blatant disregard for international humanitarian law cannot become the new norm,\" he asserted, reiterating his call for a ceasefire.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye also condemned the Israeli attack on the school, saying that the mass graves discovered in largely destroyed Khan Younis and the targeting of four schools in as many days are \"concrete evidence\" that Israel seeks to destroy the Palestinian people.\n\nGermany said Wednesday that a deadly Israeli strike on a school in southern Gaza being used as a shelter was \"unacceptable\" and called for a rapid investigation into the incident.\n\nIsraeli army urges all Gaza City residents to leave\n\nThe Israeli army, meanwhile, dropped thousands of leaflets on Gaza City urging all residents to leave amid an intensified military offensive on the Palestinian territory's main city.\n\nThe leaflets, addressed to \"everyone in Gaza City,\" set out routes out of the city to designated safe areas further south and warned the urban area would \"remain a dangerous combat zone\" as the army hits Hamas targets.\n\nIsrael issued a first formal evacuation order for part of the city on June 27, and two more in the following days.\n\nIn the leaflet drop, the army said residents would be able to take two safe roads \"quickly and without inspection from Gaza City to shelters in Deir Al-Balah and Al-Zawiya.\"\n\nTens of thousands more residents have already fled Gaza City since troops launched the latest offensive in the city's eastern Shujaiya district and ground battles have since raged.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant claimed that 60 percent of Hamas fighters have been killed since Oct. 7, 2023.\n\nAddressing the Knesset, he said the army eliminated most of the group's battalions.\n\nHe also said 3,000 ultra-Orthodox soldiers will be drafted into the army by next year in a gradual process.", "source": {"uri": "hurriyetdailynews.com", "dataType":

Israel has urged Palestinians in Gaza City to move south amid ongoing military actions aimed at pressuring Hamas and securing the release of Israeli hostages. The recent offensive has resulted in numerous casualties, including children and civilians, sparking international concern and calls for a ceasefire. Despite recent progress in negotiations, significant obstacles remain, with both sides asserting critical demands that complicate reaching a lasting agreement amid the humanitarian crisis.The Israeli military urged all Palestinians to leave Gaza City and head south Wednesday, pressing ahead with a fresh offensive across the north, south and center of the embattled territory that has killed dozens of people over the past 48 hours.\n\nThe stepped-up military activity came as U.S., Egyptian and Qatari mediators met with Israeli officials in the Qatari capital, Doha, for talks seeking a long-elusive cease-fire deal with Gaza's Hamas militant group in exchange for the release of dozens of Israeli hostages it is holding.\n\nIsrael says it is pursuing Hamas fighters that are regrouping in various parts of Gaza nine months into the war. But heavy strikes in recent days along the length of the territory also could be aimed at putting more pressure on Hamas in the cease-fire talks.\n\nIn a visit Wednesday to central Gaza, Israel's military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said forces were operating in different ways, in multiple parts of the territory \"to carry out a very important mission: pressure. We will continue operating to bring home the hostages.\"\n\nIsrael informed people in Gaza of the evacuation order by dropping leaflets urging \"all those in Gaza City\" to take two \"safe routes\" south to the area around the central town of Deir al-Balah. Gaza City, it said, will \"remain a dangerous combat zone.\"\n\nMonths ago, Israel ordered residents of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, to flee south, and much of the population left earlier in the war. Large parts of Gaza City and urban areas around it have been flattened or left a shattered landscape by previous Israeli assaults.\n\nThe United Nations says about 300,000 Palestinians have remained in the hard-hit north, with the bulk of those said to be in Gaza City.\n\nMost of Gaza's 2.3 million people are crammed into squalid tent camps in central and southern Gaza.\n\nIsraeli troops have pushed into parts of Gaza City in recent days, triggering the flight of thousands of Palestinians trying to escape shelling and airstrikes. This past week, the military ordered Palestinians to evacuate from eastern and central parts of the city.\n\nThere was no immediate mass exodus from the city following Wednesday's order. Many Palestinians have concluded that there is no refuge in war-stricken Gaza.\n\nThe military, meanwhile, said it wrapped up an operation launched late last month in the Gaza City neighborhood of Shijaiyah, where it killed dozens of militants and destroyed eight underground tunnels.\n\nWednesday's evacuation order came after a series of deadly strikes over the past two days in other parts of the territory. Israeli bombardment early Wednesday hit four houses in Deir al-Balah and the nearby Nuseirat refugee camp, killing 20 Palestinians.\n\nAmong the dead were six children and three women, according to officials at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where the casualties were taken. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies. The house hit in Deir al-Balah was inside the \"humanitarian safe zone\" where Israel has told Palestinians to flee for refuge.\n\nThe overnight bombardment came hours after Israeli warplanes struck the entrance of a school sheltering displaced families outside the southern city of Khan Younis. The toll from the strike rose to 31 people killed, including eight children, and more than 50 wounded, officials at the nearby Nasser Hospital said Wednesday.\n\nFootage aired by Al Jazeera television showed kids playing soccer in the school's yard when a sudden boom shook the area, prompting shouts of \"a strike, a strike!\"\n\nThe Israeli army said the airstrike near the school and reports of civilian casualties were under review. It claimed it was targeting a Hamas militant who took part in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war, though it provided no immediate evidence. The military blames civilian deaths on Hamas because the militants fight in dense, urban areas. But the army rarely comments on what it is targeting in individual strikes, which often kill women and children.\n\nIn nine months of bombardment and offensives in Gaza, Israel has killed more than 38,200 people and wounded more than 88,000, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Nearly the entire population has been driven from their homes. Many have been displaced multiple times.\n\nDuring the Oct. 7 raid, militants killed 1,200 people in southern Israel, most of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities. The militants took roughly 250 people hostage. About 120 are still in captivity, with about a third said to be dead.\n\nIsrael's new ground assault in Gaza's largest city has prompted what the U.N called a \"dangerously chaotic\" exodus of people scattering in multiple directions, unsure where to go. Some have fled to other parts of the north. The new Israeli military leaflets encouraged a mass movement south to the purported \"humanitarian zone,\" promising that people leaving Gaza City on the defined routes would not be stopped at Israeli checkpoints. Many Palestinians fear arrest or humiliation by troops at the checkpoints.\n\nAfter Israel on Monday called for an evacuation from eastern and central parts of Gaza City, staff at two hospitals - Al-Ahli and the Patients Friends Association Hospital - rushed to move patients and shut down, the United Nations said.\n\nHospitals in Gaza have often evacuated preemptively at any sign of possible Israeli military action, fearing raids. In the past nine months, Israeli troops have attacked at least eight hospitals, causing the deaths of patients and medical workers along with massive destruction to facilities and equipment. Israel has claimed Hamas uses hospitals for military purposes, though it has provided only limited evidence.\n\nOnly 13 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are functioning, and those only partially, according to the United Nations' humanitarian office.\n\nAmid the ongoing violence, international mediators were making a new concerted effort to push through a proposed deal for a cease-fire and release of hostages.\n\nIsrael and Hamas had appeared to narrow the gaps in recent days, but obstacles remain, even after Hamas agreed to relent on its key demand that Israel commit to ending the war as part of any agreement.\n\nHamas still wants mediators to guarantee that negotiations conclude with a permanent cease-fire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted he will not sign any deal forcing Israel to stop its campaign in Gaza without eliminating Hamas. Hamas on Monday accused Netanyahu of \"putting more obstacles in the way of negotiations,\" including the operations in Gaza City.\n\nAn Egyptian official said the head of Egypt's General Intelligence Service, Abbas Kamel, went to Doha to join discussions over the deal. The official said U.S. and Israeli officials were also attending. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the press on the meetings.\n\nA day earlier, CIA Director William Burns, who has led the American mediation, met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi in Cairo.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_al-Balah", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mediation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuseirat_Camp", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gamal Abdel Nasser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

But heavy strikes in recent days along the length of the territory also could be aimed at putting more pressure on Hamas in the cease-fire talks.\n\nIn a visit Wednesday to central Gaza, Israel's military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said forces were operating in different ways, in multiple parts of the territory \"to carry out a very important mission: pressure. We will continue operating to bring home the hostages.\"\n\nIsrael informed people in Gaza of the evacuation order by dropping leaflets urging \"all those in Gaza City\" to take two \"safe routes\" south to the area around the central town of Deir al-Balah. Gaza City, it said, will \"remain a dangerous combat zone.\"\n\nMonths ago, Israel ordered residents of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, to flee south, and much of the population left earlier in the war. Large parts of Gaza City and urban areas around it have been flattened or left a shattered landscape by previous Israeli assaults.\n\nThe United Nations says about 300,000 Palestinians have remained in the hard-hit north, with the bulk of those said to be in Gaza City.\n\nMost of Gaza's 2.3 million people are crammed into squalid tent camps in central and southern Gaza.\n\nIsraeli troops have pushed into parts of Gaza City in recent days, triggering the flight of thousands of Palestinians trying to escape shelling and airstrikes. This past week, the military ordered Palestinians to evacuate from eastern and central parts of the city. There was no immediate mass exodus from the city following Wednesday's order. Many Palestinians have concluded that there is no refuge in war-stricken Gaza.\n\nThe evacuation order came after a series of deadly strikes over the past two days in other parts of the territory. Israeli bombardment early Wednesday hit four houses in Deir al-Balah and the nearby Nuseirat refugee camp, killing 20 Palestinians.\n\nAmong the dead were six children and three women, according to officials at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where the casualties were taken. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies. The house hit in Deir al-Balah was inside the \"humanitarian safe zone\" where Israel has told Palestinians to flee for refuge.\n\nThe overnight bombardment came hours after Israeli warplanes struck the entrance of a school sheltering displaced families outside the southern city of Khan Younis. The toll from the strike rose to 31 people killed, including eight children, and more than 50 wounded, officials at the nearby Nasser Hospital said Wednesday.\n\nFootage aired by Al Jazeera television showed kids playing soccer in the school's yard when a sudden boom shook the area, prompting shouts of \"a strike, a strike!\"\n\nThe Israeli army said the airstrike near the school and reports of civilian casualties were under review. It claimed it was targeting a Hamas militant who took part in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war, though it provided no immediate evidence. The military blames civilian deaths on Hamas because the militants fight in dense, urban areas. But the army rarely comments on what it is targeting in individual strikes, which often kill women and children.\n\nIn nine months of bombardment and offensives in Gaza, Israel has killed more than 38,200 people and wounded more than 88,000, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Nearly the entire population has been driven from their homes. Many have been displaced multiple times.\n\nDuring the Oct. 7 raid, militants killed 1,200 people in southern Israel, most of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities. The militants took roughly 250 people hostage. About 120 are still in captivity, with about a third said to be dead.\n\nIsrael's new ground assault in Gaza's largest city has prompted what the U.N called a \"dangerously chaotic\" exodus of people scattering in multiple directions, unsure where to go. Some have fled to other parts of the north. The new Israeli military leaflets encouraged a mass movement south to the purported \"humanitarian zone,\" promising that people leaving Gaza City on the defined routes would not be stopped at Israeli checkpoints. Many Palestinians fear arrest or humiliation by troops at the checkpoints.\n\nAfter Israel on Monday called for an evacuation from eastern and central parts of Gaza City, staff at two hospitals -- Al-Ahli and the Patients Friends Association Hospital -- rushed to move patients and shut down, the United Nations said.\n\nHospitals in Gaza have often evacuated preemptively at any sign of possible Israeli military action, fearing raids. In the past nine months, Israeli troops have attacked at least eight hospitals, causing the deaths of patients and medical workers along with massive destruction to facilities and equipment. Israel has claimed Hamas uses hospitals for military purposes, though it has provided only limited evidence.\n\nOnly 13 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are functioning, and those only partially, according to the United Nations' humanitarian office.\n\nAmid the ongoing violence, international mediators were making a new concerted effort to push through a proposed deal for a cease-fire and release of hostages.\n\nIsrael and Hamas had appeared to narrow the gaps in recent days, but obstacles remain, even after Hamas agreed to relent on its key demand that Israel commit to ending the war as part of any agreement.\n\nHamas still wants mediators to guarantee that negotiations conclude with a permanent cease-fire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted he will not sign any deal forcing Israel to stop its campaign in Gaza without eliminating Hamas. Hamas on Monday accused Netanyahu of \"putting more obstacles in the way of negotiations,\" including the operations in Gaza City.\n\nAn Egyptian official said the head of Egypt's General Intelligence Service, Abbas Kamel, went to Doha to join discussions over the deal. The official said U.S. and Israeli officials were also attending. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the press on the meetings.\n\nA day earlier, CIA Director William Burns, who has led the American mediation, met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi in Cairo.\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_al-Balah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuseirat_Camp", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gamal Abdel Nasser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

The renewed ground assault started in the city's eastern Shujayea neighbourhood, but this week tanks also moved to central and western districts, forcing tens of thousands of civilians to flee southwards.\n\nThe latest evacuation order comes a day after an Israeli air attack on al-Awdah School, killed at least 30 people and wounded 53 others, most of them women and children, according to Palestinian medics.\n\nExclusive footage from the school, obtained by Al Jazeera, shows young Palestinians playing football outside the school as dozens of people watch. Then a loud explosion is heard, sending people running for cover.\n\nA Palestinian boy told Al Jazeera he lost several relatives in the attack. \"We were sitting and a missile fell and destroyed everything,\" he said, sobbing. \"I lost my uncle, my cousins and my relatives.\"\n\nThe attack has been condemned by world leaders and the Israeli military has said it is investigating.\n\nThe UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said on X that two-thirds of the schools it administers in the Gaza Strip, which have served as shelters for displaced Palestinians since the war began, have been hit, killing 524 people.\n\n\"UN structures, schools and shelters are not a target,\" it said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Israeli army also said it attacked fighters inside the headquarters of UNRWA.\n\nIn a visit to central Gaza on Wednesday, Israel's military chief, Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi, said forces were operating in different ways, in multiple parts of the territory \"to carry out a very important mission: pressure\".\n\n\"We will continue operating to bring home the hostages,\" Halevi said.\n\nAt least 38,295 people have been killed and 88,241 wounded in Israel's war on Gaza since October, according to Palestinian officials. Gaza's health ministry said on Wednesday that 52 Palestinians were killed and 208 injured in the previous 24 hours.\n\nIsrael launched its war on Gaza after Hamas led an attack on southern Israel, killing at least 1,139 people, according to an Al Jazeera tally based on Israeli statistics, and seized about 250 others as hostages, dozens of whom remain in captivity in Gaza.\n\nThe stepped-up Israeli military activity comes as United States, Egyptian and Qatari mediators met with Israeli officials in Qatar's capital, Doha, for talks seeking a long-elusive ceasefire deal and an exchange of captives held by Hamas for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.\n\nHamas officials have raised concerns that heavy Israeli strikes in recent days along the length of the territory could derail the negotiations.\n\nIsmail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas, said on Monday that Israel's escalating assault has threatened talks at a crucial time and could bring negotiations \"back to square one\".\n\nHamas, however, still wants international mediators to guarantee that truce talks in Doha conclude with a permanent ceasefire.

It said the incident occurred when it struck with a \"precise munition\" a Hamas fighter who took part in the Oct. 7 raid on Israel that triggered the war.\n\nThe military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it knew that a football match was going on when the strike was ordered.\n\nAt the nearby Nasser Hospital, dozens of Palestinians bid farewell to loved ones before funerals and burials.\n\n\"The schools were overcrowded with people and the street was full too, suddenly a missile hit and destroyed the whole place,\" said Asmaa Qudeih, who lost some relatives in the attack.\n\nMore: Netanyahu says Gaza ceasefire deal must let Israel resume fighting until war goals met\n\n\"Bodies flew in the wind, body parts flew, I don't know how to describe it,\" she said.\n\nIsraeli forces continued to press their offensive in north and central Gaza on Wednesday, and deepened their incursion into two Gaza City districts, carrying out house-to-house searches.\n\nThe militant group Hamas said the renewed Israeli campaign threatened to derail efforts to secure a ceasefire in the nine-month-old war, with talks to resume in Doha on Wednesday.\n\nIn Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told U.S. Middle East envoy Brett McGurk he was committed to securing a Gaza ceasefire deal provided Israel's red lines were respected, his office said.\n\nHamas has accepted a key part of a U.S. plan aimed at ending the nine-month-old war, dropping a demand that Israel first commit to a permanent ceasefire before signing the agreement.\n\nNetanyahu has insisted the deal must not prevent Israel from resuming fighting until its war objectives are met. At the outset of the war, he pledged to annihilate Hamas.\n\nCivilians flee Gaza assault\n\nLeaflets were dropped on Gaza City on Wednesday, this time with a map marking \"safe routes\" for the evacuation of the whole city, not just certain districts. The Israeli leaflets urge civilians to head south to the central Gaza Strip.\n\nThe city, home to more than a quarter of Gaza's population before the war, was destroyed by an Israeli assault in the first weeks of fighting last year, but hundreds of thousands of Gazans are believed to have returned to the ruins in recent months.\n\nIsraeli forces patrolled the main road to the coast, snipers commandeered rooftops of some high-rise buildings still standing, and tanks were stationed inside the headquarters of the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, residents said.\n\nThe Israeli military said in a statement its forces were continuing operations in Gaza City against militants of Hamas and its ally Islamic Jihad, who they said had operated from inside the UNRWA facilities, using them as a base for attacks.\n\nMore: Amid Gaza War protests, this website profiled students and accused them of 'hatred'\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said it had received dozens of desperate calls from residents in Gaza City trapped in their homes but teams were unable to reach them because of the intensity of the bombing.\n\n\"The information coming from Gaza City shows residents are living through tragic conditions. (Israeli) occupation forces continue to hit residential districts, and displace people from their homes and refuge shelters,\" it said in a statement.\n\nMore: Masks are key tool against COVID-19. Should they be banned for war protesters?\n\nThe armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said fighters fought with Israeli forces operating in the area with anti-tank rockets and mortar bombs, and sometimes in close-range combat.\n\nThe Israeli military announced that one of its soldiers was killed in fighting on Tuesday in central Gaza. It has published the names of 681 military personnel killed in the Oct. 7 attacks and subsequent fighting.\n\nIsrael's Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, said on Wednesday that 60% of the fighters of Hamas had been killed or wounded as a result of the military offensive in Gaza.\n\nIn the central Gaza camp of Al-Nuseirat, medics said six Palestinians, including children, were killed in an airstrike on a house, while another airstrike killed two people and wounded several others in Khan Younis.\n\nMore than 38,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, health officials in the Hamas-run territory said.\n\nThe war erupted when militants led by Hamas infiltrated southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli figures.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nidal_al_mughrabi@usatoday.com", "name": "Nidal al-Mughrabi", "type":

It is the second time since the war began that Gaza City as a whole has been asked to evacuate.\n\nOver the past two weeks, Israeli forces have re-entered several districts where the military believes Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters have regrouped since the start of the year.\n\nHamas has said Israel's renewed activity in the city is threatening to derail negotiations over a potential ceasefire and hostage release deal, which resumed on Wednesday in Qatar. The talks are being attended by the intelligence chiefs of Egypt, the US and Israel, as well as the prime minister of Qatar.\n\nTop Hamas official Hossam Badran told AFP that Israel \"is trying to pressure negotiations by intensifying bombing operations, displacement, and committing massacres\".\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasised Israel's commitment to a deal as long as Israel's \"red lines are preserved\".\n\nThere are estimated to be more than a quarter-of-a-million people still living in Gaza City - and some were observed evacuating to the south.\n\nOthers, though, were not willing to leave.\n\n\"I will not leave Gaza [City].

The BBC could not independently verify these figures.\n\nOn Tuesday, the UN Human Rights Office said it was \"appalled\" by IDF orders for residents to evacuate to \"areas where Israeli military operations are ongoing and where civilians continue to be killed and injured\".\n\nIt also warned that the Deir al-Balah area was already seriously overcrowded with Palestinians displaced from other areas of Gaza and that there was little infrastructure and limited access to humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy the Hamas group in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\n\nMore than 38,295 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Gen. Herzi Halevi, said forces were operating in different ways, in multiple parts of the territory \"to carry out a very important mission: pressure. We will continue operating to bring home the hostages.\"\n\nIsrael informed people in Gaza of the evacuation order by dropping leaflets urging \"all those in Gaza City\" to take two \"safe routes\" south to the area around the central town of Deir al-Balah. Gaza City, it said, will \"remain a dangerous combat zone.\"\n\nThe United Nations says about 300,000 Palestinians have remained in the north, with the bulk of those said to be in Gaza City. There was no immediate mass exodus from the city following Wednesday's order.\n\nThe military, meanwhile, said it wrapped up an operation launched late last month in the Gaza City neighborhood of Shijaiyah, where it killed dozens of terrorists and destroyed eight underground tunnels.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n-- Hezbollah's top leader Hassan Nasrallah said Wednesday that the Lebanese terrorist group will support Hamas in whatever decision the Palestinian group makes during negotiations with Israel for a cease-fire in Gaza. \"What satisfies Hamas, satisfies us all,\" Nasrallah said, adding that he's made this point clear during regular meetings with Hamas officials.\n\n-- A slight majority of Israelis, 56 percent, supports ending the war in Gaza as part of a cease-fire deal that would free all hostages held by Hamas, according to a poll released Wednesday by the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem think-tank. The survey of 850 Israelis had a margin of error of 3.85 percent.\n\n-- A U.S. official says the head of the agency overseeing American foreign humanitarian and development aid will visit Israel on Thursday to address security concerns around aid workers and aid distribution in Gaza. The Israeli military said on Wednesday the United Nations, the main organization responsible for delivering aid in Gaza, must step up their ability to receive and distribute aid.", "source": {"uri": "reviewjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Review-Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_al-Balah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Nasrallah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Nasrallah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Democracy_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Democracy Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hezbollah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.reviewjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/19377331_web1_19377331-b4aa1faacf184ae6b73611f88cc41b1f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721092", "eventUri": "eng-9721092", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

But heavy strikes in recent days along the length of the territory also could be aimed at putting more pressure on Hamas in the cease-fire talks. Hamas has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada and the European Union.\n\nIn a visit Wednesday to central Gaza, Israel's military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said forces were operating in different ways, in multiple parts of the territory \"to carry out a very important mission: pressure. We will continue operating to bring home the hostages.\"\n\nIsrael informed people in Gaza of the evacuation order by dropping leaflets urging \"all those in Gaza City\" to take two \"safe routes\" south to the area around the central town of Deir al-Balah. Gaza City, it said, will \"remain a dangerous combat zone.\"\n\nMonths ago, Israel ordered residents of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, to flee south, and much of the population left earlier in the war. Large parts of Gaza City and urban areas around it have been flattened or left a shattered landscape by previous Israeli assaults.\n\nThe United Nations says about 300,000 Palestinians have remained in the hard-hit north, with the bulk of those said to be in Gaza City.\n\nMost of Gaza's 2.3 million people are crammed into squalid tent camps in central and southern Gaza.\n\nIsraeli troops have pushed into parts of Gaza City in recent days, triggering the flight of thousands of Palestinians trying to escape shelling and airstrikes. This past week, the military ordered Palestinians to evacuate from eastern and central parts of the city. There was no immediate mass exodus from the city following Wednesday's order. Many Palestinians have concluded that there is no refuge in war-stricken Gaza.\n\nThe evacuation order came after a series of deadly strikes over the past two days in other parts of the territory. Israeli bombardment early Wednesday hit four houses in Deir al-Balah and the nearby Nuseirat refugee camp, killing 20 Palestinians.\n\nAmong the dead were six children and three women, according to officials at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where the casualties were taken. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies. The house hit in Deir al-Balah was inside the \"humanitarian safe zone\" where Israel has told Palestinians to flee for refuge.\n\nThe overnight bombardment came hours after Israeli warplanes struck the entrance of a school sheltering displaced families outside the southern city of Khan Younis. The toll from the strike rose to 31 people killed, including eight children, and more than 50 wounded, officials at the nearby Nasser Hospital said Wednesday.\n\nFootage aired by Al Jazeera television showed kids playing soccer in the school's yard when a sudden boom shook the area, prompting shouts of \"a strike, a strike!\"\n\nThe Israeli army said the airstrike near the school and reports of civilian casualties were under review. It claimed it was targeting a Hamas fighter who took part in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war, though it provided no immediate evidence. The military blames civilian deaths on Hamas because they fight in dense, urban areas. But the army rarely comments on what it is targeting in individual strikes, which often kill women and children.\n\nIn nine months of bombardment and offensives in Gaza, Israel has killed more than 38,200 people and wounded more than 88,000, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Nearly the entire population has been driven from their homes. Many have been displaced multiple times.\n\nDuring the Oct. 7 raid, terrorists killed 1,200 people in southern Israel, most of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities. The terrorists took roughly 250 people hostage. About 120 are still in captivity, with about a third said to be dead.\n\nIsrael's new ground assault in Gaza's largest city has prompted what the U.N called a \"dangerously chaotic\" exodus of people scattering in multiple directions, unsure where to go. Some have fled to other parts of the north. The new Israeli military leaflets encouraged a mass movement south to the purported \"humanitarian zone,\" promising that people leaving Gaza City on the defined routes would not be stopped at Israeli checkpoints. Many Palestinians fear arrest or humiliation by troops at the checkpoints.\n\nAfter Israel on Monday called for an evacuation from eastern and central parts of Gaza City, staff at two hospitals -- Al-Ahli and the Patients Friends Association Hospital -- rushed to move patients and shut down, the United Nations said.\n\nHospitals in Gaza have often evacuated preemptively at any sign of possible Israeli military action, fearing raids. In the past nine months, Israeli troops have attacked at least eight hospitals, causing the deaths of patients and medical workers along with massive destruction to facilities and equipment. Israel has claimed Hamas uses hospitals for military purposes, though it has provided only limited evidence.\n\nOnly 13 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are functioning, and those only partially, according to the United Nations' humanitarian office.\n\nAmid the ongoing violence, international mediators were making a new concerted effort to push through a proposed deal for a cease-fire and release of hostages.\n\nIsrael and Hamas had appeared to narrow the gaps in recent days, but obstacles remain, even after Hamas agreed to relent on its key demand that Israel commit to ending the war as part of any agreement.\n\nHamas still wants mediators to guarantee that negotiations conclude with a permanent cease-fire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted he will not sign any deal forcing Israel to stop its campaign in Gaza without eliminating Hamas. Hamas on Monday accused Netanyahu of \"putting more obstacles in the way of negotiations,\" including the operations in Gaza City.\n\nAn Egyptian official said the head of Egypt's General Intelligence Service, Abbas Kamel, went to Doha to join discussions over the deal. The official said U.S. and Israeli officials were also attending. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the press on the meetings.\n\nA day earlier, CIA Director William Burns, who has led the American mediation, met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi in Cairo.", "source": {"uri": "whittierdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whittier Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@whittierdailynews.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_al-Balah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuseirat_Camp", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gamal Abdel Nasser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

It's unclear if the IDF plans to send many more soldiers into the city.\n\nHamas has said the attacks in Gaza City could jeopardize cease-fire talks between the two sides.\n\nGaza City, in the north of the strip, was largely destroyed by Israeli air strikes and the subsequent ground incursion. Most residents fled south to places such as Rafah and tented camps, but some returned earlier this year.\n\nIn late June, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu suggested the most intense phase of fighting in Gaza would be over \"very soon.\" Yet his military is struggling to stop Hamas from re-emerging in several areas. The IDF began a new assault on Khan Younis -- previously the second-biggest city in Gaza -- early this month for similar reasons.\n\nHamas, designated a terrorist group by the US and European Union, triggered the war when its fighters swarmed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.

The leaflet laid out two \"safe routes\" that individuals could take to evacuate the area.\n\nThe order came as Israeli military forces continued their offensive in central Gaza on Wednesday, a day after an airstrike on a school-turned-shelter for displaced Palestinians killed at least 29 people, according to Palestinian health officials.\n\nThe Israeli Defense Forces carried out airstrikes on the towns of Nuseirat and Khan Younis, killing at least six people and leaving several others wounded, according to various news outlets. The Associated Press also says eight people were killed in an airstrike on a home in Deir al-Balah, an area located within a \"humanitarian safe zone\" where Palestinians have been told by Israel to seek refuge.\n\nTuesday's attack on the al-Awda school in Abasan near the southern city of Khan Younis was apparently the fourth Israeli strike in as many days.

And an Israeli strike on Monday hit another U.N.-run school in Nuseirat, hospitalizing several people.\n\nHamas,a U.S. designated terror group, warned on Tuesday that the attacks could put cease-fire talks at risk. And the U.N. Human Rights Office expressed concern about the operation and Israel's latest civilian evacuation orders.\n\nThe U.N. agency said the orders issued Sunday called for civilians to move to the west of Gaza City for safety, only to then have the Israel Defense Forces intensify their strikes on those corridors.\n\n'The U.N. Human Rights Office has repeatedly raised concerns that IDF's evacuation orders are confusing, often instructing people to relocate to areas where IDF military operations are ongoing,' the agency said in a statement. 'We reiterate our call on Israel to take all efforts to ensure the safety of civilians in Gaza.'\n\nA Palestinian woman holds her daughter as she walks past the rubble of houses destroyed during the Israeli military offensive, amid Israel-Hamas conflict, in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, July 10, 2024.\n\nUN cites mass starvation\n\nFamine has spread across the Gaza Strip, a panel of United Nations experts in Geneva said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nThe experts pointed to the recent deaths of three children: a 6-month-old, a 9-year-old and a 13-year-old.\n\n'All three children died from malnutrition and lack of access to adequate health care,' the panel's statement said. 'With the death of these children from starvation despite medical treatment in central Gaza, there is no doubt that famine has spread from northern Gaza into central and southern Gaza.'\n\nThe panel called upon 'the international community to prioritize the delivery of humanitarian aid by land by any means necessary, end Israel's siege, and establish a cease-fire.'\n\nAn Israeli soldier looks on as a military vehicle maneuvers near the Israel-Gaza border, amid the Israel-Hamas conflict, in Israel, July 10, 2024.\n\nCease-fire talks\n\nTop intelligence officials from Egypt, Israel and the United States were set to meet Wednesday in Qatar in the latest effort to secure a cease-fire agreement, according to various news outlets.\n\nCIA Director Bill Burns is to meet with Abbas Kamael, the head of Egypt's General Intelligence Service, and Israeli spy chief David Barnea.\n\nBurns and Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the Middle East, held talks in Cairo on Monday with their Egyptian, Israeli and Jordanian counterparts, according to White House national security spokesperson John Kirby.\n\nHamas militants killed about 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7 terror attack on Israel that sparked the war. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 116 hostages, including 42 the military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 38,243 Palestinians, according to the health ministry in Gaza, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and militants. The health ministry says that Israel's military offensive in Gaza has killed or wounded more than 5% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million.\n\nSome information for this story was provided by The

The Palestine Red Crescent said that it had received dozens of distress calls but the intensity of the bombing made it impossible for them to help.\n\nThe armed wings of the Palestinian resistance groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they were battling \"Israeli forces with machine guns, mortar fire and anti-tank missiles and killed and wounded Israeli soldiers\" on Gaza City's front lines, Reuters reported.\n\nThe fresh Israeli attacks in Gaza City caused a new wave of mass forced displacement and Hamas said it may derail protracted negotiations towards a ceasefire and prisoner swap.\n\nHamas had in recent days reportedly attenuated its position that Israel end the war as a precondition to any agreement but was seeking guarantees that negotiations would lead to a permanent ceasefire.\n\nIsrael once again indicated that it would reject any deal that would leave Hamas as the de facto governing authority in Gaza. On Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his position that he would only accept an agreement that would \"allow Israel to return and fight until all the goals of the war are achieved.\"\n\nThat position appears guaranteed, if not explicitly intended, to ensure that no deal is possible.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel's Channel 12 news reported on a recent military assessment finding that \"much of Hamas' tunnel network is still in a 'good functional state' in many parts of Gaza.\"\n\nThe resistance group is still able to launch raids near boundary with Israel \"and possibly even cross it,\" according to the assessment, as reported by The Times of Israel. The military chiefs reportedly recommended in their assessment that Israel reach a negotiated deal with Hamas, even if it ends the war, in order \"to get back the hostages.\"\n\nIn his first video appearance in weeks, Abu Obeida, the pseudonymous spokesperson for the armed wing of Hamas, said on Sunday that all 24 of the Qassam Brigades battalions were intact and had recruited thousands of new fighters.\n\nNo relief as journalists killed\n\nWith ceasefire talks seemingly fated to reach another impasse, there is little sign of relief for Palestinians in Gaza who have endured relentless attacks, trauma and grief, and now increasing hunger and disease.\n\nBetween 4 and 6 July, six Palestinian journalists, one of them a woman, were killed in three incidents in Gaza City and Deir al-Balah, bringing to 158 the number of journalists killed since 7 October, according to the government media office in the territory.\n\nOn 6 July, an Israeli airstrike killed six Palestinian police officers in Rafah, southern Gaza.\n\nThe following day, the bodies of three Palestinians who were apparently executed with their hands cuffed were recovered from the area of Kerem Shalom crossing in southern Gaza.\n\n\"Abdel-Hadi Ghabaeen, an uncle of one of the deceased, said they had been working to secure the delivery of humanitarian aid and commercial shipments through the crossing,\" the AP news agency reported.\n\n\"He said he saw soldiers detain them on Saturday, and that the bodies bore signs of beatings, with one having a broken leg.\"\n\nThe government media office in Gaza announced that Ihab Ribhi al-Ghussein, an engineer and deputy labor minister, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on a school in Gaza City on Saturday.\n\nThe media office said that al-Ghussain's wife and daughter were killed previously in an Israeli strike on a house they were sheltering in after being displaced from their home in Gaza City.\n\nAlso on Saturday, Israel carried out an airstrike targeting a United Nations-run school in central Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp, claiming that it was being used as a command center by Hamas operatives.\n\nIt is unclear why Israel thinks this would be a credible excuse when even its military admits that Hamas operates out of an extensive underground infrastructure that remains functional, largely intact and beyond reach.\n\nThe government media office in Gaza said that at least 16 Palestinians were killed and more than 75 were injured in the attack on the Nuseirat school, which the UN said was being used as a shelter for nearly 2,000 displaced people.\n\nUNRWA, the UN agency for Palestine refugees, said that 190 of its facilities in Gaza \"have been hit, some multiple times, some directly\" since 7 October, killing 520 people and injuring 1,600.\n\nThe Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor said that by targeting UN schools used as shelters, Israel was demonstrating \"a deliberate policy intended to prevent security across the entire Gaza Strip and deny displaced Palestinians stability or shelter, even if that shelter is only temporary.\"\n\nGaza City evacuation orders\n\nThe Israeli military ordered tens of thousands of Palestinians in central and western Gaza City to immediately evacuate on Sunday and Monday.\n\nOn Sunday, Israel ordered residents of five blocs in Gaza City to evacuate to the western part of the city, only for that area to be ordered evacuated the following day, with Israel instructing people to move to Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.\n\nThe areas affected by the new evacuation orders \"encompass 13 health facilities that were recently functional, including two hospitals, two primary healthcare centers and nine medical points,\" according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\n\n\"In addition, four hospitals are located in close proximity to the evacuation zones,\" the UN office added.\n\nTwo health facilities - the al-Ahli Baptist hospital and the Patients Friends Association Hospital - evacuated \"in fear of intensified military activities that would render them inaccessible or non-functional,\" according to the UN.\n\nCritical care patients were transferred to the Indonesian and Kamal Adwan hospitals in northern Gaza, which the director of the World Health Organization said \"are suffering [a] shortage of fuel, beds and trauma medical supplies.\"\n\nThe lack of fuel has forced the suspension of kidney dialysis services at Kamal Adwan Hospital, the director of the facility announced on Sunday, and has placed \"the lives of newborns in the neonatal department and critical patients in the intensive care unit at risk,\" OCHA said.\n\nFollowing the hasty evacuation of the European Gaza Hospital in Khan Younis on 2 July, three hospitals have become non-functional since the beginning of the month, \"leaving only 13 out of 36 hospitals in the Gaza Strip partially functional at present,\" according to OCHA.\n\nDoctors Without Borders warned on Friday that its teams at Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis were at a breaking point and were \"running on emergency medical stocks\" to treat an overwhelming number of patients.\n\nThe medical charity said that the facility is the \"main site for field hospitals to sterilize their equipment.\" Should Nasser Medical Complex lose electricity, \"sterilization becomes difficult, and the care provided at several field hospitals will come to a stop.\"\n\nDoctors Without Borders added that Israel denied entry of trucks carrying the organization's medical supplies on 3 July. The charity said it hasn't been able \"to bring any medical supplies into Gaza since the end of April.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor warned that the ongoing closure of Gaza's crossings amounts to a death sentence for more than 26,000 sick and wounded people needing life-saving care outside the territory.\n\nOnly 21 sick and wounded patients have been evacuated out of Gaza since Israel closed Rafah crossing on 7 May.\n\nEfforts to increase aid \"wiped out\"\n\nA senior UN official said last week that a recent Israeli evacuation order affecting one-third of Gaza's territory in southern Rafah and Khan Younis had \"wiped out\" efforts towards improving the humanitarian situation in the Strip.\n\nMeanwhile, within Gaza, \"insecurity, damaged roads [and] the breakdown of law and order\" have also hampered the delivery of fuel and aid needed to sustain humanitarian operations, according to UN OCHA. This has caused food and other supplies to spoil during extremely high temperatures.\n\nThe lack of fuel has forced bakeries to close once again, including the largest bakery in Gaza, located in Gaza City. Only seven out of the 18 bakeries supported by its humanitarian partners, all of them located in Deir al-Balah, remain operational, according to the UN office.\n\nCommunity kitchens are also struggling to stay open amid a lack of fuel and food supplies, \"resulting in a reduced number of cooked meals prepared throughout Gaza,\" OCHA added.\n\nNo commercial trucks have entered northern Gaza for months, according to the UN, resulting \"in a near total lack of protein sources (e.g. meat and poultry) on the local market and only a few types of locally produced vegetables available at unaffordable prices.\"\n\nPalestinians flee the eastern area of Gaza City following Israeli military evacuation orders, 7 July 2024 (\n\nMeanwhile, ongoing military operations have caused people to leave their agricultural land untended and the destruction of greenhouses have harmed the ability of Palestinians in Gaza to produce their own food.\n\nAssessments undertaken by OCHA and other groups at 10 sites hosting new waves of internally displaced people \"show critical levels of need across all sectors,\" the UN office said, noting a particular \"dire need for safe drinking water\" and access to emergency services.\n\nOn Friday, the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor accused Israel of using water as a weapon of war through the \"persistent, systematic and widespread targeting of the Gaza Strip's water sources and desalination plants.\"\n\nThe group said that \"as a result of the genocide, the per capita share of water in the Strip has decreased to between three and 15 liters per day, while in 2022 it was approximately 84.6 liters per day.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization says that \"between 50 and 100 liters of water per person per day are needed to ensure that most basic needs are met and few health concerns arise.\"\n\nPeople displaced in northern Gaza, including from Shujaiya and other areas around Gaza City, lack safe shelters.\n\nUN OCHA said that \"many were found sleeping amid solid waste and rubble, with no mattresses or enough clothing, and some had sought shelter in partially destroyed UN facilities and residential buildings.\"\n\nWith nine out of 10 people in Gaza currently displaced, most of them forced to move multiple times, people are \"compelled to reset their lives repeatedly without any of their belongings or any prospect of finding safety or reliable access to basic services,\" the UN office added.\n\n\"What's happening in Gaza since last night is a return to the first month of genocide,\" Dr. Mustafa Elmasri, a psychotherapist in Gaza, wrote on X (formerly Twitter), on Monday.\n\n\"Under relentless bombing, people are forced to wander aimlessly, driven south to be slaughtered there. These are the darkest and most dangerous days of the war,\" Elmasri added.\n\nSally Abi Khalil, the Middle East director for the global charity Oxfam, said that \"pushing hundreds of thousands more people into what is essentially a death trap, devoid of any facilities, is barbaric and a breach of international humanitarian law.\"\n\nShe added that the areas unilaterally declared by Israel as safe zones are in fact \"the polar opposite, leaving families with the horrific choice between staying in an active combat zone or moving somewhere that is already desperately overcrowded, dangerous and unfit for human existence.\"\n\nGaza deaths vastly undercounted\n\nThe Lancet, an independent medical journal based in London, published an article by three public health experts stating that Gaza fatalities are vastly undercounted.\n\n\"Collecting data is becoming increasingly difficult for the Gaza health ministry due to the destruction of much of the infrastructure,\" according to the Lancet article, which observes that the ministry \"is the only organization counting the dead.\"\n\n\"The ministry has had to augment its usual reporting, based on people dying in its hospitals or brought in dead, with information from reliable media sources and first responders. This change has inevitably degraded the detailed data recorded previously,\" the authors added.\n\nNot all identifiable victims of airstrikes and other forms of direct violence are are included in the health ministry's list of fatalities. The some 10,000 people missing under the rubble of destroyed buildings amid the widespread destruction in Gaza are also not reflected in the official fatality figure of nearly 37,500 as of 19 June.\n\nOn Sunday, the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor called for international pressure on Israel to \"bring in trucks, special equipment and sufficient fuel, given the urgent need to clear the debris, locate bodies, and recover them with special procedures to identify and bury them in marked graves.\"\n\nThe group said that the presence of decaying bodies \"poses a threat to public safety\" amid a spread of epidemics, jeopardizing the coastal enclave's \"long-term environmental health ... to the point of ecocide, rendering the Gaza Strip unfit for human habitation.\"\n\nEven higher than the number of victims of direct violence are those who lose their lives \"from causes such as reproductive, communicable and non-communicable diseases\" resulting from the conflict, according to the authors of the Lancet article.\n\nThese deaths are a result of destroyed health and sanitation infrastructure, malnutrition and lack of access to clean water, repeated displacement and the loss of funding to UNRWA, the organization with the largest humanitarian footprint in Gaza.\n\n\"There will continue to be many indirect deaths in the coming months and years,\" according to the authors of the Lancet article, who conservatively estimate \"that up to 186,000 or even more deaths could be attributable to the current conflict in Gaza.\"\n\nThat represents approximately 8 percent of Gaza's population of around 2.3 million Palestinians.\n\nJournalist Hossam Shabat, based in northern Gaza, said that he knows from personal experience that \"deaths are way higher\" than what is being reported.\n\nIsrael's \"goal is annihilation and that's what they are achieving,\" Shabat said.\n\nIsrael's \"goal is annihilation and that's what they are achieving,\" Shabat said.\n\nUN experts declare widespread famine\n\nOn Tuesday, a group of independent UN human rights experts warned that \"the recent deaths of more Palestinian children due to hunger and malnutrition leaves no doubt that famine has spread across the entire Gaza Strip.\"\n\nAt least three children in central Gaza, where medical treatment is available, have died in recent weeks, leaving \"no doubt that famine has spread from northern Gaza into central and southern Gaza,\" the experts said.\n\nThey added that \"Israel's intentional and targeted starvation campaign against the Palestinian people is a form of genocidal violence and has resulted in famine across all of Gaza.\"\n\nThe experts called for the prioritization of delivery of humanitarian aid through land crossings \"by any means necessary\" and called for an end to Israel's siege and for a ceasefire.", "source": {"uri": "dissidentvoice.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dissident Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But heavy strikes in recent days along the length of the territory also could be aimed at putting more pressure on Hamas in the cease-fire talks.\n\nIn a visit Wednesday to central Gaza, Israel's military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said forces were operating in different ways, in multiple parts of the territory \"to carry out a very important mission: pressure. We will continue operating to bring home the hostages.\"\n\nIsrael informed people in Gaza of the evacuation order by dropping leaflets urging \"all those in Gaza City\" to take two \"safe routes\" south to the area around the central town of Deir al-Balah. Gaza City, it said, will \"remain a dangerous combat zone.\"\n\nMonths ago, Israel ordered residents of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, to flee south, and much of the population left earlier in the war. Large parts of Gaza City and urban areas around it have been flattened or left a shattered landscape by previous Israeli assaults.\n\nThe United Nations says about 300,000 Palestinians have remained in the hard-hit north, with the bulk of those said to be in Gaza City.\n\nMost of Gaza's 2.3 million people are crammed into squalid tent camps in central and southern Gaza.\n\nIsraeli troops have pushed into parts of Gaza City in recent days, triggering the flight of thousands of Palestinians trying to escape shelling and airstrikes. This past week, the military ordered Palestinians to evacuate from eastern and central parts of the city. There was no immediate mass exodus from the city following Wednesday's order. Many Palestinians have concluded that there is no refuge in war-stricken Gaza.\n\nThe evacuation order came after a series of deadly strikes over the past two days in other parts of the territory. Israeli bombardment early Wednesday hit four houses in Deir al-Balah and the nearby Nuseirat refugee camp, killing 20 Palestinians.\n\nAmong the dead were six children and three women, according to officials at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where the casualties were taken. An Associated Press reporter counted the bodies. The house hit in Deir al-Balah was inside the \"humanitarian safe zone\" where Israel has told Palestinians to flee for refuge.\n\nThe overnight bombardment came hours after Israeli warplanes struck the entrance of a school sheltering displaced families outside the southern city of Khan Younis. The toll from the strike rose to 31 people killed, including eight children, and more than 50 wounded, officials at the nearby Nasser Hospital said Wednesday.\n\nFootage aired by Al Jazeera television showed kids playing soccer in the school's yard when a sudden boom shook the area, prompting shouts of \"a strike, a strike!\"\n\nThe Israeli army said the airstrike near the school and reports of civilian casualties were under review. It claimed it was targeting a Hamas militant who took part in the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war, though it provided no immediate evidence. The military blames civilian deaths on Hamas because the militants fight in dense, urban areas. But the army rarely comments on what it is targeting in individual strikes, which often kill women and children.\n\nIn nine months of bombardment and offensives in Gaza, Israel has killed more than 38,200 people and wounded more than 88,000, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Nearly the entire population has been driven from their homes. Many have been displaced multiple times.\n\nDuring the Oct. 7 raid, militants killed 1,200 people in southern Israel, most of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities. The militants took roughly 250 people hostage. About 120 are still in captivity, with about a third said to be dead.\n\nIsrael's new ground assault in Gaza's largest city has prompted what the U.N called a \"dangerously chaotic\" exodus of people scattering in multiple directions, unsure where to go. Some have fled to other parts of the north. The new Israeli military leaflets encouraged a mass movement south to the purported \"humanitarian zone,\" promising that people leaving Gaza City on the defined routes would not be stopped at Israeli checkpoints. Many Palestinians fear arrest or humiliation by troops at the checkpoints.\n\nAfter Israel on Monday called for an evacuation from eastern and central parts of Gaza City, staff at two hospitals -- Al-Ahli and the Patients Friends Association Hospital -- rushed to move patients and shut down, the United Nations said.\n\nHospitals in Gaza have often evacuated preemptively at any sign of possible Israeli military action, fearing raids. In the past nine months, Israeli troops have attacked at least eight hospitals, causing the deaths of patients and medical workers along with massive destruction to facilities and equipment. Israel has claimed Hamas uses hospitals for military purposes, though it has provided only limited evidence.\n\nOnly 13 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are functioning, and those only partially, according to the United Nations' humanitarian office.\n\nAmid the ongoing violence, international mediators were making a new concerted effort to push through a proposed deal for a cease-fire and release of hostages.\n\nIsrael and Hamas had appeared to narrow the gaps in recent days, but obstacles remain, even after Hamas agreed to relent on its key demand that Israel commit to ending the war as part of any agreement.\n\nHamas still wants mediators to guarantee that negotiations conclude with a permanent cease-fire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted he will not sign any deal forcing Israel to stop its campaign in Gaza without eliminating Hamas. Hamas on Monday accused Netanyahu of \"putting more obstacles in the way of negotiations,\" including the operations in Gaza City.\n\nAn Egyptian official said the head of Egypt's General Intelligence Service, Abbas Kamel, went to Doha to join discussions over the deal. The official said U.S. and Israeli officials were also attending. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the press on the meetings.\n\nA day earlier, CIA Director William Burns, who has led the American mediation, met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi in Cairo.\n\nMagdy reported from Cairo. Associated Press Writer Melanie Lidman in Jerusalem contributed to this report.\n\nFind more of AP's coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "samy_magdy@eagletribune.com", "name": "Samy Magdy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "wafaa_shurafa@eagletribune.com", "name": "Wafaa Shurafa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_al-Balah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khan_Yunis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khan Yunis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuseirat_Camp", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gamal Abdel Nasser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

Footage broadcast by Al Jazeera showed children playing football in the school's yard when a sudden boom shook the area, prompting shouts of \"a strike, a strike!\"\n\nThe Israeli military said it was reviewing reports that civilians were harmed. It said the incident occurred when it struck with \"precise munition\" a Hamas fighter who had taken part in the 7 October raid on Israel that precipitated the Israeli assault on Gaza.\n\nThe area hit was crowded at the time of the attack, according to witnesses who spoke to the BBC.\n\nWednesday's attack was the fourth on or near schools sheltering displaced Palestinians in four days. Israel has said that in every instance the sites were targeted because they were being used as bases by Hamas fighters, police officers or politicians.\n\nFurther Israeli strikes in the early hours of Wednesday morning killed at least 20 Palestinians. Associated Press reported that 12 people had been killed in the Nuseirat refugee camp and eight at a home in Deir al-Balah, an area that is located within the \"humanitarian safe zone\" where Israel has told Palestinians to seek refuge.\n\nIn a visit to central Gaza on Wednesday, Israel's military chief, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, said forces were operating in different ways in multiple parts of the territory \"to carry out a very important mission: pressure. We will continue operating to bring home the hostages.\"\n\nIsraeli ground troops have advanced into sections of Gaza City in the recent days, prompting a mass exodus of thousands of Palestinians seeking to flee the barrage of shelling and airstrikes. Last week, the military directed Palestinian residents to evacuate from the eastern and central areas of the city. Despite the directive, an immediate large-scale departure from the city did not materialise.\n\nMany civilians told the Guardian they have concluded that there was no refuge in war-stricken Gaza and that they lacked confidence in the safe corridors set by Israel. Residents said they also feared that if they left, they would not be able to take belongings or return.\n\nThis is the first time that all residents of Gaza City have been asked to evacuate since the evacuation orders released by Israeli during the first week of war. Large parts of the city and urban areas around it have been flattened or left as a shattered landscape by previous Israeli assaults.\n\nThe last few days of airstrikes have been some of the fiercest since the war broke out. Hamas's armed wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, described the fighting as \"the most intense in months\".\n\nThe intensified offensive could be aimed at increasing pressure on Hamas in ceasefire talks.\n\nThe new fighting has unfolded as international mediators led by Egypt, Qatar and the US make a renewed effort to push through a proposed ceasefire deal. Talks are due to continue in Doha and Cairo this week, attended by the CIA director, William Burns, and the Mossad chief, David Barnea. \"There is an agreement over many points,\" a senior source told Egypt's Al Qahera news on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Hamas has again accused Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, of deliberately trying to thwart the truce talks.\n\nNetanyahu told a US envoy on Wednesday he was committed to securing a Gaza ceasefire deal provided Israel's red lines were respected, his office said in a statement.\n\nOn Sunday Netanyahu's office issued a document entitled Principles for a Hostage Release Deal demanding that \"any deal enable Israel to resume its offensive operations until it achieves its war goals\", to \"prevent Hamas from smuggling arms from Egypt\", and to prevent \"thousands of terrorists from returning to northern Gaza\", Haaretz reported.\n\nPressure is mounting on Israel as a Gaza ceasefire could also allow for de-escalation between Hezbollah and Israel.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Hezbollah chief, Hassan Nasrallah, speaking at a memorial event for a senior Hezbollah official who was killed in an Israeli strike last week, said that his group would end hostilities against Israel as soon as a ceasefire had been achieved in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lorenzo_tondo@theguardian.com", "name": "Lorenzo Tondo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "malak_a_tantesh@theguardian.com", "name": "Malak A Tantesh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_al-Balah", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Deir al-Balah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gamal Abdel Nasser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuseirat_Camp", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nuseirat Camp"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Burns_(diplomat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William J.

residents to leave", "body": "GAZA: The Israeli army dropped thousands of leaflets over Gaza City on Wednesday urging all residents to flee a heavy offensive that has rocked the main city of the besieged Palestinian territory.\n\nThe leaflets, addressed to \"everyone in Gaza City\", set out designated escape routes to the south and warned that the urban area, previously home to more than half a million people, would \"remain a dangerous combat zone\".\n\nThe warning follows three partial evacuation orders and came as Israeli troops, backed by tanks and aircraft, have fought the Palestinian groups in the heaviest combat operations the city has seen in months.\n\nIn one operation, the army said it had killed militants and found weapons inside the long-vacated Gaza City headquarters of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.\n\nElsewhere across Gaza, deadly strikes have hit four schools used as shelters in four days, sparking international outrage.\n\nThe upsurge in fighting and displacement came as mediator Qatar was due to resume talks Wednesday toward a truce and captives release deal to end the war, now grinding on into its 10th month.\n\nAn Israeli delegation led by Mossad chief David Barnea arrived in Doha for the talks, a source with knowledge of the negotiations said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of their sensitivity.\n\nCIA director William Burns was also expected in the Qatari capital, after holding talks in Cairo on Tuesday.\n\nThe latest fighting in Gaza has newly displaced 350,000 civilians, said UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini, who spoke before the latest leaflet drop and said \"there is absolutely no safe space in Gaza\".\n\nThe UN agency's head of communications Juliette Touma said that it was hard to know if people were sheltering in the building \"as we don't have regular access to Gaza City\".\n\nIsrael has also imposed a punishing siege on Gaza's 2.4 million people, eased only by sporadic aid deliveries.\n\nIndependent UN rights experts on Tuesday accused Israel of carrying out a \"targeted starvation campaign\" that constituted \"a form of genocidal violence\".\n\nIsrael's mission to the UN in Geneva accused the panel's members of \"spreading misinformation\" and \"supporting Hamas propaganda\".\n\nIn Israel, meanwhile, protesters have regularly taken to the streets to demand the Netanyahu government strike a deal to bring home the captives. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "omanobserver.om", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oman Observer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The city lies north of the Netzarim Corridor, a 38-square-kilometer zone that separates the north from the rest of the Strip.

An Israeli airstrike killed at least 30 Palestinians at a school housing displaced people near Khan Younis, mostly women and children. \"There's no safe haven\" anywhere in Gaza, says al-Satarri. \"The people who are bearing the brunt of those bombardments are the Palestinian displaced people.\" He also responds to ceasefire talks.\n\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: As ceasefire talks are being held in Doha, Israel is intensifying its war on Gaza. Earlier today, the Israeli military ordered the full evacuation of all civilians from Gaza City. Al Jazeera reports Tuesday was the deadliest day in Gaza in weeks. At least 30 people were killed in an Israeli airstrike on a school housing displaced Palestinians near Khan Younis. Most of the dead were reportedly women and children. It was the fourth Israeli attack on a school over the past four days in Gaza. Al Jazeera aired footage showing children playing soccer at the school at the time of the blast.\n\nThe Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza decried the attack as a, quote, \"heinous massacre against displaced citizens,\" unquote. Eyewitnesses said the Israeli attack resulted in body parts flying through the air.\n\nASMAA QUDEIH: [translated] We were sitting safely in the afternoon, somewhat settled. Suddenly, a missile was fired. I'm not sure what kind of missile, F-16 or not, Apache. The schools were overcrowded with people, and the street was full, too. Suddenly, a missile hit and destroyed the whole place. There were bodies and body parts. Bodies flew. Body parts flew in the air. I don't know how to describe it. I can't. People sitting safely, selling goods, making a living to provide for their children. No one. I don't know what happened. Why would they hit us like that?\n\nAMY GOODMAN: We go now to Gaza, where we're joined by journalist Akram al-Satarri. He's joining us from outside the Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza.\n\nI know that there's a time delay, but, Akram, if you can describe exactly what has happened in what's being described as the deadliest 24 hours in a number of weeks?\n\nAKRAM AL-SATARRI: Yes, indeed, the deadliest 24 hours in a number of months, rather than weeks, heavy bombardment taking place in different parts of the Gaza Strip, including Gaza north, Gaza City, Gaza central area, Khan Younis area and also Rafah area. In Khan Younis only, 27 people out of 56 people who were killed in the last 24 hours were killed in that area. One shelter that was used by hundreds of families and one tent -- one area that was used by families as a shelter outside of the school were targeted by three missiles that brought to that heavy loss amongst them. Twenty-seven children, women, elderly people and youth, as well, were killed. More than 52 other people were killed. Al-Nuseirat area also, 24 hours also ago, witnessed a large-scale incident, where around 19 Palestinians were killed and around 70 others were injured. Rafah also has been witnessing large-scale bombardment that has been taking the lives of tens of Palestinians. Gaza central area also, besides al-Nuseirat, al-Bureij also witnessed a targeting incident where around nine people were killed in a heavy crowded area in the middle of al-Bureij refugee camp, where thousands of displaced people were there and were trying to secure their very basic needs amidst that very critical situation characterizing a great deal of lack to the essential supplies for the people who are in need.\n\nSo, the bombardments are technically everywhere in the Gaza Strip. The people who are bearing the brunt of those bombardments are the Palestinian displaced people and the Palestinians from Khan Younis, Rafah, Gaza central area, Gaza City and the north, who have been asked also to move from their areas. In Khan Younis area, around a quarter-million Palestinians were asked to head from the eastern part of the city to the western side of the city. In Gaza, around 300,000 Palestinians are already asked by the Israeli forces to leave the Gaza City and head south toward Deir al-Balah area and Khan Younis and Rafah. So, overall, tense situation that has been exacerbated by the Israeli measures, followed by the adverse development taking place not only because of the bombardment, but rather because of the very large-scale displacement, that reminds the Palestinians of the very first days of the war and even worse than that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Can you tell us, Akram, about the reports that flyers are being dropped all over Gaza City telling everyone to leave, what exactly this means? We are seeing that the Palestinian Red Crescent has said its teams are receiving dozens of humanitarian distress calls from residents in Gaza City, where the ambulances and medics are not able to enter because, the Red Crescent described, the intensity of the bombardment of the area. What is happening in Gaza City?\n\nAKRAM AL-SATARRI: Yes, the intensity of the bombardment in that area, Gaza area, is coupled with the requests that were made by the Israeli forces asking around 400,000 Palestinians who are living in Gaza, including also the internally displaced people, to head south. And they were describing the route to head south, and they were saying that Salah al-Din Street and also another, al-Rashid Street area, are the safe routes for the Palestinians to make it to the announced humanitarian shelters and routes as described by the Israeli occupation forces, while, unfortunately, there's no safe haven in Gaza, no one safe, no place safe, according to the description that was made by the commissioner general of the U.N. That means a new round of massive displacement is planned by the Israeli occupation forces, not only in Gaza City, where 400,000 Palestinians are staying, but also in Khan Younis area, where is a quarter-million of Palestinians that were asked to move to the eastern -- or, western part of the city.\n\nSo, those actions are now leading to more despair, leading to more displacement, and are likely also to lead to more destructions once the Israeli occupation forces start the destruction in that area, which they have started at a very large scale in al-Shuja'iyya, in al-Sabra, in al-Daraj, in al-Tuffah and also in al-Saraya area, which are main neighborhoods in Gaza, including the Gaza Old City, that is an historical place that has already been targeted by the Israeli occupation forces, as well, and a significant portion of it was destroyed.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I'm looking at a piece in The Guardian describing footage broadcast by Al Jazeera showing children playing football in the school's yard when a sudden boom shook the area, prompting shouts of \"A strike! A strike!\" If you can explain what happened when the kids were playing soccer?\n\nAKRAM AL-SATARRI: Well, apparently, obviously, there were targeted by the Israeli occupation forces. This is one of the incidents that was documented by the cameras. Unfortunately, hundreds more incidents are taking place without a camera being there to capture the horror that has been caused, the destruction that has been brought to the life and to the facilities, and the death that has taken the life. Families were divided. According to one of my friends who was there, who is an emergency doctor, they received 27 bodies of one family, and the only surviving member of the family was a 26-years-old -- a 26-days-old child. So, many incidents are taking place. Many lives are wasted.\n\nAnd when you look at the condition and the context and the way people were living when they were targeted, you come to a conclusion that people were just not doing anything. They were not engaging in combat activities. They were not carrying arms. They're not fighting. They're just plain people who are seeking some comfort, some rest and respite to their life amidst that ever-escalating military situation, amidst that ever-exacerbating humanitarian crisis. They were trying to play together -- I mean the children. They were trying to find some time of peace, when their life was targeted and they were ending up dead.\n\nAnd I think also most of them not only dead, but some of them are losing their limbs and end up like physically disabled, some of them losing their sight, which some of the people who are reporting about some of the children who were injured were losing their eyes and losing their ability to sense things. One of them lost their four limbs, a child, a baby boy, who lost his four limbs. So, you can't imagine, and I don't think you can ever be able to imagine the level of distress that has been caused.\n\nPeople who have been communicating with the Palestinian Red Crescent Society are people who were trapped under the rubble of their homes. The story of al-Helou family, that was targeted in Gaza City, and around 19 family people were killed, and the only survivor, who was 19 years old, was communicating with the Palestinian Red Crescent and was telling them that he cannot help his family and that his mother was killed and that she is on his lap and that his father is screaming from under the rubble and seeking help. And his brothers and sisters were also seeking help by screaming, and no one could help them, because the Palestinian Red Crescent Society cannot go to those areas where some fighting is taking place; otherwise, they would be targeted. And we have seen different incidents where the Palestinian Red Crescent Society teams were targeted, and even international organizations, like the World Central Kitchen and also some other organizations, the UNRWA, were targeted, and they ended up losing some of their staff.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Yes, UNRWA, their headquarters were hit. UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini wrote today, \"4 schools hit in the last 4 days. Since the war began, two thirds of @UNRWA schools in Gaza have been hit, some were bombed out, many severely damaged. Schools have gone from safe places of #education & hope for children to overcrowded shelters and often ending up a place of death & misery. Nine months in, under our watch, the relentless, endless killings, destruction and despair continue. Gaza is no place for children. The blatant disregard of international humanitarian law cannot become the new normal ... Ceasefire now before we lose what is left of our common humanity.\" Again, those are the words of the UNRWA commissioner-general, Philippe Lazzarini, the Palestinian relief and works agency. Your comment on the ground, Akram, and if you can also respond to whether people on the ground are hearing about the negotiations that are taking place -- well, it was in Cairo, now in Doha -- around a ceasefire?\n\nAKRAM AL-SATARRI: Landslide majority of the Palestinians are disconnected from the external world. They don't have internet. They don't have electrical supplies. They don't have access to any communication whatsoever. So, unfortunately, most of them, in the past who were extremely interested, they were trying to go to the places where they have electrical supplies due to having the PV panels or where they have been following the news, but now people are extremely busy surviving.\n\nThey have been linking any talk about the negotiation and any analysis about any breakthrough when it comes to negotiation and a swap deal with the major developments taking place on the ground. Like, whenever they talk about negotiation, they understand that the Israeli government is going to start a large-scale military step where they would be targeting Gaza. And the very same thing practically is happening. They were talking about the negotiation in Doha and Cairo in the media, and then, the day after, the Israeli occupation forces started that large-scale ground operation in Gaza, and now they're asking 400,000 Gazans to leave Gaza City and move to the south of Gaza. And they're asking quarter a million to move from the first half of Khan Younis to the other half of Khan Younis.\n\nSo, people are pessimistic about the intention of the Israeli government to do anything whatsoever that can eventually lead to a ceasefire or to rest or respite or peace or comfort or safety or whatever thing that have to do with the rest of a humanitarian soul that has been haunted by the ongoing bombardment and loss and fear of imminent death. So, Palestinians are struggling. Unfortunately, most of them don't have access to the internet, so they cannot continue following the news about the developments. But they have been seeing the developments with their own eyes.\n\nI believe the ones who were killed in Khan Younis, the 27 family members and also the 52 others who were injured in a shelter that was supposed to be protected according to the international law, an UNRWA facility, they fully understand now that it is just a talk 'til something tangible happens, 'til some safety -- sense of safety happens to them, until they can retrieve some normalcy to their life.\n\nThey made -- the statements that are made by commissioner-general of the UNRWA are appreciated by the Palestinians. They have been seeing the UNRWA struggling for the sake of providing them with the life-saving medication, food, water and nonfood items. However, they understand that the Israeli occupation is not listening to any call, except the call of war and fighting. And they understand on the ground that they have been the prime target of that unleashed power and fire that is targeting them. As you can hear in the background, more injured people, presumably, are coming to the hospital, and the bombardment is still ongoing. People are still killed. And they understand that nothing serious has been done to stop that, neither by the international community, nor by the different U.N. agencies that are mandated to condemn the atrocities and to stop them, as well, and hold accountable the perpetrator of those.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I want to thank you so much for being with us, Akram al-Satarri, journalist based right now, speaking to us outside the Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. Please be safe yourself.\n\nThe latest news out of Gaza when it comes to journalists, well, the Gaza government media office says over 150 Palestinian journalists have been killed -- most recently, Palestinian journalists Saadi Madoukh and Ahmad Sukar killed Friday, following an Israeli raid that targeted a home of the Madoukh family in the Daraj neighborhood of Gaza City. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists says well over 100 media workers have died since October 7th. They are saying, the Committee to Protect Journalists, that the killing of journalists in Gaza makes it the deadliest period since CPJ, the Committee to Protect Journalists, began gathering data in 1992.\n\nThis is Democracy Now!

Hamas militants have been regrouping in areas that Israel targeted in the earliest weeks of the war.\n\n\"Unfortunately, today we are at the 278th day of Israel's savage aggression on Gaza,\" Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said.\n\n\"Israel has committed unprecedented war crimes in modern history, from killing of children to killing United Nations relief workers, then the destruction of a whole community, targeting schools, hospitals, mosques and churches as well as turning Gaza to an unsafe place for any of our people in Gaza whether children, men, women or the elderly,\" he added.\n\nHeavy Israeli bombardment throughout the territory could be aimed at increasing pressure on Hamas during negotiations for a cease-fire. U.S., Egyptian and Qatari mediators are meeting with Israeli officials in Qatar for talks trying to push through a deal.\n\nIn nine months of bombardment and offensives in Gaza, Israel has killed more than 38,200 people and wounded more than 88,000, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Nearly the entire population has been driven from their homes. Many have been displaced multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are packed into sweltering tent camps.\n\nIsrael's onslaught was triggered by Hamas' cross-border raid on Oct. 7, during which militants killed 1,200 people in southern Israel, most of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities. The militants took roughly 250 people hostage. About 120 are still in captivity, with about a third said to be dead.", "source": {"uri": "africanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Africanews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_for_peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Land for peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayman_Safadi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ayman Safadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izz_ad-Din_al-Qassam_Brigades", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/56/58/74/1024x538_cmsv2_a09fa43b-d8eb-5772-b0be-0cba03c5a429-8565874.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721092", "eventUri": "eng-9721092", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2509, "textEnd": 2515}], "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

A thousand times? Where will we end up?\"\n\nThe upsurge in fighting, bombardment and displacement came as talks were to resume in Qatar towards a truce and hostage release deal in the war now grinding on into its 10th month.\n\nHamas official Hossam Badran, asked about the increased military operations, told AFP that Israel was \"hoping that the resistance will relinquish its legitimate demands\" in truce negotiations.\n\nBut \"the continuation of massacres compels us to adhere to our demands\", he said.\n\nHeavy fighting also raged in Gaza's far-southern Rafah, where witnesses told AFP that Israeli tanks had rumbled into the city centre and unleashed intense fire on buildings.\n\n'Unacceptable'\n\nAcross Gaza, deadly strikes have hit four schools used as shelters in four days, killing at least 49 people according to medics and officials in the Hamas-run territory, and sparking rebukes from France and Germany.\n\n\"It is unacceptable that schools, especially those housing civilians displaced by the fighting, should be targeted,\" said the French foreign ministry, urging an investigation.\n\nIsrael said the strikes had targeted militants hiding in schools.\n\nThe Israeli military concluded its operation in Gaza City's eastern district of Shujaiya, where major battles had raged since an Israeli evacuation order on June 27.\n\nA spokesman for Gaza's civil defence agency said there was widespread \"destruction\".\n\nShujaiya has become a \"ghost city\", said Mahmud Bassal.\n\nMeanwhile, an Israeli delegation led by spy chief David Barnea arrived in Doha for truce talks, said a source with knowledge of the sensitive negotiations.\n\nCIA director William Burns was also expected in the Qatari capital after holding talks in Cairo on Tuesday.\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile met US President Joe Biden's special envoy for the Middle East, Brett McGurk.\n\nNetanyahu \"emphasised his commitment\" to a proposed truce plan, \"as long as Israel's red lines

A thousand times? Where will we end up?\"\n\nThe upsurge in fighting, bombardment and displacement came as talks were to resume in Qatar towards a truce and hostage release deal in the war now grinding on into its 10th month.\n\nHamas official Hossam Badran, asked about the increased military operations, told AFP that Israel was \"hoping that the resistance will relinquish its legitimate demands\" in truce negotiations.\n\nBut \"the continuation of massacres compels us to adhere to our demands\", he said.\n\nHeavy fighting also raged in Gaza's far-southern Rafah, where witnesses told AFP that Israeli tanks had rumbled into the city centre and unleashed intense fire on buildings.\n\nAcross Gaza, deadly strikes have hit four schools used as shelters in four days, killing at least 49 people according to medics and officials in the Hamas-run territory, and sparking rebukes from France and Germany which both labelled the attacks \"unacceptable\".\n\n\"We call for these strikes to be fully investigated,\" said the French foreign ministry, highlighting a deadly strike on Tuesday on a school near the southern city of Khan Yunis.\n\n\"It is unacceptable that schools, especially those housing civilians displaced by the fighting, should be targeted.\"\n\nIsrael said the strikes had targeted militants hiding in schools.\n\nIn Gaza City's eastern district of Shujaiya, where major battles raged since an Israeli evacuation order on June 27, a spokesman for the civil defence agency said there was widespread \"destruction\".\n\nShujaiya has become a \"ghost city\", said Mahmud Bassal.\n\nBassal as well as witnesses said Israeli troops have withdrawn from the area, though the military told AFP its forces were \"still operating\" there.\n\nMeanwhile, an Israeli delegation led by spy chief David Barnea arrived in Doha for truce talks, said a source with knowledge of the sensitive negotiations.\n\nCIA director William Burns was also expected in the Qatari capital after holding talks in Cairo on Tuesday.\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile met US President Joe Biden's special envoy for the Middle East, Brett McGurk.\n\nNetanyahu \"emphasised his commitment\" to a proposed truce plan, \"as long as Israel's red lines are preserved\", his office said.\n\nHamas's October 7 attack on southern Israel that sparked the war resulted in the deaths of 1,195 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli figures.\n\nThe militants also seized 251 hostages, 116 of whom remain in Gaza, including 42 the military says are dead.\n\nIsrael responded with a military offensive that has killed at least 38,295 people in Gaza, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the territory's health ministry.\n\nDefence Minister Yoav Gallant told Israeli lawmakers that 60 percent of Hamas fighters had been \"eliminated or wounded\" during the war.\n\nIsrael has imposed a punishing siege on Gaza's 2.4 million people, eased only by sporadic aid deliveries.\n\nAid group Doctors Without Borders has warned of \"critical\" shortages of medical supplies in Gaza, with no resupply for more than two months.\n\nIndependent UN rights experts on Tuesday accused Israel of carrying out a \"targeted starvation campaign\", a claim strongly rejected by Israel.\n\nRelatives of Israeli hostages, who have piled pressure on Netanyahu demanding swift action to rescue their loved ones, began a four-day march from Tel Aviv to the seat of government in Jerusalem.\n\n\"We want all of Israel to come out with us\" and \"remind Netanyahu that... he needs to sign a deal to bring them back and stop this terrible war,\" said Ayala Metzger, daughter-in-law of hostage Yoram Metzger who died in captivity.\n\nSince the start of the Gaza war, Israeli forces have also traded regular fire with Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, allies of Hamas, sparking fears of a broader regional conflagration.\n\nAs the cross-border clashes have intensified, Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah said Wednesday his group would end the attacks if fighting in Gaza ends.\n\n\"If a ceasefire is reached, and we all hope for that... our front will cease fire without any discussion.\"", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas",

This number is now around 250,000, according to the BBC. A previous evacuation occurred early in the war, as the city was the opening target of the Israel Defense Forces's first offensive into Gaza in October. After largely clearing the city of Hamas fighters, the IDF withdrew. Using its extensive tunnel network, Hamas regrouped and reoccupied the area, despite much of it being destroyed.\n\nThe IDF now seems poised to invade the city again -- on Tuesday, it dropped leaflets by aircraft instructing \"everyone in Gaza City\" to leave, describing it as a \"dangerous combat zone.\" Civilians were asked to leave via two designated safe routes.\n\nThe IDF has already begun conducting clearing operations on Gaza City's outskirts, according to the Institute for the Study of War. Operations began over the past two weeks. Previously, the southern enclave of Rafah had been the primary target, where most of the population has taken refuge.\n\nThough previous evacuations have sent Gazans scrambling across the tiny enclave, the latest evacuation notice may prove more difficult. Many residents didn't take the notice to evacuate well.\n\n\"I will not leave Gaza. I will not make the stupid mistake that others have made. Israeli missiles do not differentiate between north and south,\" Gaza resident Ibrahim al-Barbari, 47, told the BBC. \"If death is my fate and the fate of my children, we will die with honour and dignity in our homes.\"\n\nA video published on social media showed two Gazan men mocking the evacuation leaflet before ripping it up and vowing not to leave.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"Where are we to go? After 300 days of torture they want us to go to the south?

You may opt out at any time.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ordered all residents of Gaza City on Wednesday to immediately evacuate the \"dangerous combat zone.\" Dropped leaflets instructed Palestinians to head south via two designated safe routes, marked as roads leading to shelters in Deir al-Balah and al-Zawaida in central Gaza, as Israel intensifies its combat operations in the north. The IDF claims that Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad have regrouped in Gaza City since the start of 2024.\n\nThis is the first time since last October that all residents of Gaza's largest city have been ordered to evacuate the area, where more than a quarter of a million people are currently living. Locals report that Israeli strikes began targeting the city before dawn on Monday and have continued with little reprieve, similar to how the IDF began its operation three months ago to retake Al-Shifa Hospital from Hamas militants.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Office has condemned the ongoing strikes. The U.N. is \"appalled\" by the IDF ordering Palestinians to flee to \"areas where Israeli military operations are ongoing and where civilians continue to be killed and injured,\" the agency said on Tuesday. The press release follows an Israeli missile hitting a school in southern Gaza where displaced Palestinians were watching a soccer game. At least 31 people were killed in Tuesday's strike, and more than 50 others were injured. The IDF said it used a \"precision munition\" there to target a militant who had taken part in Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.\n\nAdditional Israeli bombardments on Wednesday struck four houses in Deir al-Balah and the nearby Nuseirat refugee camp, killing at least 20 people. One of the homes hit was located in the \"humanitarian safe zone\" where Israel told Palestinians on Wednesday to flee to. \"Civilians, especially children, must not get caught in the crossfire,\" the German Foreign Ministry posted on X on Wednesday. \"The repeated attacks on schools by the Israeli army must stop and an investigation must come quickly.\"\n\nThe U.N. also warned of overcrowding in Deir al-Balah as well as limited humanitarian access across Gaza. The Palestinian Red Crescent announced on Tuesday that it will close all of its stations and clinics in Gaza City due to ongoing IDF operations there. Only 13 of the enclave's 36 hospitals are functioning -- and only partially.\n\nIsraeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told the Knesset on Wednesday that Israeli forces have killed or wounded 60 percent of all Hamas fighters since the war began last October. In the past nine months, more than 38,200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza. Cease-fire talks resumed in Doha, Qatar, this week between Egyptian, U.S., and Israeli intelligence chiefs. But Hamas said that Israel's renewed assault on Gaza City could \"reset the negotiation process to square one.\"\n\nNATO summit, day two. NATO members at the 2024 summit in Washington on Wednesday promised to unveil a series of new aid deals for Ukraine over the next few days. According to a joint communique seen by Reuters, NATO intends to provide Ukraine with at least 40 billion euros in funding within the next year as part of a one-year commitment. The group has so far failed to commit to a multiyear military package.\n\nThe proposals will also include air defense deliveries, such as F-16 fighter jets, to Kyiv to \"make sure that Ukraine can continue to effectively defend itself against the Russian aggression,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. The United States, Denmark, and the Netherlands announced on Wednesday that they have already sent their first batch of F-16 planes to Ukraine.\n\nNATO members reiterated on Wednesday that they promise to help Kyiv prepare for future accession to the alliance, which a joint communique called \"irreversible.\" The alliance maintains that Ukraine will not be allowed to join the group, though, until its war with Russia concludes. NATO also promised on Wednesday to establish a mechanism to help coordinate the provision of military equipment and training to Ukraine.\n\nMetals tariffs on Mexico. The Biden administration announced new tariffs on Wednesday against Mexican metals that are partially made in China. This includes a 25 percent tariff on Mexican steel that is melted or poured outside of North America as well as a 10 percent tariff on Mexican aluminum that contains metals that have been smelted or cast in China, Belarus, Iran, or Russia.\n\nThe tariffs, which go into effect immediately, aim to close a trade loophole allowing cheap, state-subsidized Chinese metals to circumvent existing U.S. tariffs by traveling through Mexico. Beijing produces more than half of the world's steel. According to the White House, around 13 percent of Mexican steel imports and roughly 6 percent of Mexican aluminum imports last year came from outside of North America.\n\nBlocked membership bid. The European Union formally halted Georgia's accession bid on Tuesday over last month's passage of a foreign agents law. The bloc also froze $32.5 million in financial support earmarked for Georgia's Defense Ministry in 2024. \"This is only the first step,\" EU Ambassador to Georgia Pawel Herczynski said. \"It is sad to see EU-Georgia relations at such a low point, when they could have been at an all-time high.\"\n\nUnder Georgia's foreign agents law, civil society organizations and media outlets that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from abroad must register as \"agents of foreign influence.\" Rights activists have argued that the legislation mimics a Russian-styled effort to limit free speech and stymie dissent. Brussels previously warned Tbilisi that enacting the policy would be incompatible with EU membership.\n\nResidents of Barcelona are up in arms over excessive tourism -- that is, if you count water guns as \"arms.\" Thousands of Spaniards took to the streets over the weekend to protest inflated costs of living due to overtourism, with some marchers spraying tourists with water guns. The demonstration's organizer, the Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth, said it did not instruct protesters to use water guns but recognized that the method is \"not violent.\" Among the group's demands, it seeks restrictions on tourist accommodations, fewer cruise terminals, and an end to tourism advertisements using public money.", "source": {"uri": "foreignpolicy.com", "dataType":

This number is now around 250,000, according to the BBC. A previous evacuation occurred early in the war, as the city was the opening target of the Israel Defense Forces's first offensive into Gaza in October. After largely clearing the city of Hamas fighters, the IDF withdrew. Using its extensive tunnel network, Hamas regrouped and reoccupied the area, despite much of it being destroyed.\n\nThe IDF now seems poised to invade the city again -- on Tuesday, it dropped leaflets by aircraft instructing \"everyone in Gaza City\" to leave, describing it as a \"dangerous combat zone.\" Civilians were asked to leave via two designated safe routes.\n\nThe IDF has already begun conducting clearing operations on Gaza City's outskirts, according to the Institute for the Study of War. Operations began over the past two weeks. Previously, the southern enclave of Rafah had been the primary target, where most of the population has taken refuge.\n\nThough previous evacuations have sent Gazans scrambling across the tiny enclave, the latest evacuation notice may prove more difficult. Many residents didn't take the notice to evacuate well.\n\n\"I will not leave Gaza. I will not make the stupid mistake that others have made. Israeli missiles do not differentiate between north and south,\" Gaza resident Ibrahim al-Barbari, 47, told the BBC. \"If death is my fate and the fate of my children, we will die with honour and dignity in our homes.\"\n\nA video published on social media showed two Gazan men mocking the evacuation leaflet before ripping it up and vowing not to leave.\n\n\"Where are we to go? After 300 days of torture they want us to go to the south? We would rather die than surrender a house,\" one of the residents said.\n\nArab leaders have already expressed outrage over the new evacuation order. Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said in a joint news conference with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry that the order is a \"red line\" for Jordan and Egypt.\n\nThe United Nations expressed deep concern about the new evacuation.\n\nThe new move may further complicate ceasefire negotiations, which saw a recent breakthrough after Hamas dropped the demand that Israel commit to a complete end to the war.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nDespite Hamas's ability to regroup and retake the initial target of the IDF's offensive, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told the Knesset that more than 60% of Hamas's fighting force had been killed.\n\n\"The action of the IDF that has so far led to the elimination of over 14,000 terrorists and the collapse of the military frameworks of Hamas is, in fact, the testimony of what I am saying -- everything will be done in accordance with the law and in accordance with the operational need,\" he declared.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brady_knox@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Brady Knox", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibrahim_Pasha_of_Egypt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayman_Safadi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayman Safadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sameh_Shoukry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sameh Shoukry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knesset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knesset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24190575820655.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721092", "eventUri": "eng-9721092", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

He embraced the lifeless body, and kissed his boy on the forehead between moments of anguish.\n\n\"They were little kids who were playing.... They didn't do anything,\" he told CBC freelance videographer Mohamed El Saife on Tuesday. \"They were just playing.\"\n\n\"We've been dying for 10 months,\" Al-Baghdadi screamed from the hospital. \"It's enough.\"\n\nAl-Baghdadi said his son was killed in an Israeli air strike that hit the Abu Rassas roundabout in the Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza.\n\nA series of deadly strikes over the past two days has killed dozens in the territory. More than 40 Palestinians were killed on Tuesday, in Gaza City in the north, Bureij, Deir al-Balah and Nuseirat in central Gaza and in Rafah in the south, according to medics.\n\nIsrael says it is pursuing Hamas fighters that are regrouping in various parts of Gaza, nine months into the war. But the recent heavy strikes across the territory could also be aimed at further pressuring the militant group in ceasefire talks.\n\nIn a visit Wednesday to central Gaza, Israel's military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, said forces were operating in different ways, in multiple parts of the territory, \"to carry out a very important mission: pressure. We will continue operating to bring home the hostages.\"\n\nOn Monday, Hamas posted on Telegram saying the latest attacks would lead to \"disastrous repercussions.\" The post said Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas's political bureau, warned the attacks would bring negotiations to \"point zero,\" with Israel bearing \"full responsibility.\"\n\nTalks between Hamas and Israel have been underway for some time, with representatives meeting with mediators from Egypt and Qatar to discuss the possibility of a ceasefire.\n\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society said all of its medical clinics were out of service in Gaza City, after Israel urged all Palestinians to leave the city on Wednesday, driving thousands of people westward and to the south.\n\nNine months of war and displacement have caused a hunger crisis throughout the Gaza Strip. The recent deaths of several more children from malnutrition indicate that famine has spread throughout the coastal enclave, a group of independent human rights experts mandated by the United Nations said.\n\nIsrael launched its invasion of Gaza after a Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, which saw some 1,200 killed and 250 hostages taken, by Israeli figures. By the Palestinian count, Israel's subsequent ground offensive has killed more than 38,000 in the territory.\n\nOn Tuesday, hospital staff wrapped Omar's injuries in bandages before placing him in a white shroud in front of family members, who would lead a funeral prayer for him.\n\nStaff laid bodies outside the hospital and lined up for prayer behind the local sheikh, the tiny shrouds revealing the children who are the latest victims of the war.\n\n\"No one can help us,\" said Al-Baghdadi, in a final cry of misery.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"},

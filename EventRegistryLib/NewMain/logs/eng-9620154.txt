There are more than 4.6 billion Bank of England notes in circulation, worth about \u00a382 billion.\n\nREAD MORE: 'I went to Home Bargains and came out with a beauty haul that would have cost me \u00a330 in Boots'\n\nIn line with guidance from the Royal Household, the new notes will only be printed to replace those that are worn and to meet any overall increase in demand. The approach aims to minimise the environmental and financial impact of the change.\n\nPeople will be able to snap up the new-look currency at selected Post Office branche but they will only initially have \u00a35, \u00a310 and \u00a320 denominations of the new banknotes.\n\nFor Royal fans in Manchester, you can head to the Piccadilly Plaza Post Office (M2 1BB) to get your hands on one if you so wish.\n\nBank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said: \"We're very pleased to be issuing the new King Charles banknotes.\n\n\"This is a historic moment, as it's the first time we've changed the sovereign on our notes.\n\n\"We know that cash is important for many people, and we are committed to providing banknotes for as long as the public demand them. Bringing these new notes into circulation is a demonstration of that commitment.\"\n\nIn April, Charles was presented with the first banknotes bearing his portrait and he praised them as \"very well designed\". He also expressed his surprise at being only the second monarch to feature.\n\nRecent figures from Post Office revealed a significant increase in cash transactions at its branches in April, with cash deposits and withdrawals across counters totalling a record \u00a33.48 billion.\n\nRoss Borkett, banking director at the Post Office, said: \"This historic launch of the new banknotes featuring King Charles III comes as we experience the highest levels of cash withdrawals and deposits in Post Office branches.\n\n\"We're pleased to be able to mark this day by giving people the opportunity to withdraw the new notes from our branches.\"\n\nWhile banknotes featuring Queen Elizabeth II remain legal tender and there is no need to exchange them, people who are interested to see the new banknotes can now get their hands on them.\n\nThe Bank of England has put temporary facilities in place to allow people to obtain a limited amount of the King Charles III banknotes.\n\nIt has set up a postal exchange service, running from June 5 to 30, up to a limit of \u00a3300 per customer. An application form and further details are on the Bank of England's website.\n\nVisitors to the Bank of England Museum have been able to catch a first glimpse of the new banknotes, before they entered circulation, in its Future Of Money exhibition.\n\nGraham Mott, director of strategy at ATM and cash access network Link, said: \"While more people are paying for things online or using contactless cards, cash use remains popular, with over 70% of adults spending cash at least once a fortnight.\n\n\"As King Charles III banknotes begin to enter circulation, they will steadily be available through all cash machines as worn notes are withdrawn.\"\n\nHere are the locations and postcodes for the Post Office branches where the notes will be available first on launch day, with a gradual rollout to others in the coming weeks:", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "press_association@uk.news.yahoo.com",

Therefore, the printing of Rs 2000 banknotes was stopped in 2018-19.

all cash machines as worn notes are withdrawn.'\n\nA recent survey for Link indicated that nearly half (48%) of people expect to see a cashless society in their lifetime.\n\nBut, according to Link's data, the average UK adult still withdrew around \u00a31,500 from cash machines last year.\n\nIn 2023, legislation was passed as part of the Financial Services and Markets Act, to protect access to cash.\n\nMORE : Monarchy at 'make or break' moment on anniversary of late Queen's Coronation", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Bringing these new notes into circulation is a demonstration of that commitment.\"\n\nIn April, Charles was presented with the first banknotes bearing his portrait.\n\nHe praised them as \"very well designed\" and expressed his surprise at being only the second monarch to feature.\n\nAlthough the Bank of England started to produce banknotes in the 17th century, Charles's mother, Queen Elizabeth II, was the first British sovereign to be given the honour in 1960 on a \u00a31 paper note.\n\nPeople will be able to snap up the new-look currency at selected Post Office branches.\n\nOne of the branches where the new banknotes are being made available is situated in Poundbury in Dorset, an area reflecting the King's architectural principles.\n\nWork started on Charles's classically inspired extension to the Dorset town of Dorchester in the 1990s, to create an urban quarter of Dorchester where commercial buildings were mixed with residential areas, shops and leisure facilities for a walkable community.\n\nThe chosen Post Offices will initially have \u00a35, \u00a310 and \u00a320 denominations of the new banknotes.\n\nThousands of Post Offices will receive the new-look currency over the coming days and weeks.\n\nKrishna Thakeria, branch manager at the Broadway Post Office in central London, which is also stocking the new banknotes, said: \"The new-look notes hold a special significance for us at Broadway Post Office, given our proximity to Buckingham Palace and the historic Cabinet War Rooms.\"\n\nRecent figures from Post Office revealed a significant increase in cash transactions at its branches in April, with cash deposits and withdrawals across counters totalling a record \u00a33.48 billion.\n\nRoss Borkett, banking director at the Post Office, said: \"This historic launch of the new banknotes featuring King Charles III comes as we experience the highest levels of cash withdrawals and deposits in Post Office branches.\n\n\"We're pleased to be able to mark this day by giving people the opportunity to withdraw the new notes from our branches.\"\n\nCollectors and the general public will also be able to puchase the new bank notes at a charity auction hosted by Spink & Son on behalf of the Bank of England.\n\nThe auction will take place on June 13 for a lot of 122 \u00a35 notes, followed by an auction for \u00a310 notes on June 27, according to MailOnline. The \u00a320 and \u00a350 pound note auctions will take place on July 11 and 25 July 25 respectively.\n\nWhile banknotes featuring Queen Elizabeth II remain legal tender and there is no need to exchange them, people who are interested to see the new banknotes can now get their hands on them.\n\nThe Bank of England has put temporary facilities in place to allow people to obtain a limited amount of the King Charles III banknotes.\n\nIt has set up a postal exchange service, running from June 5 to 30, up to a limit of \u00a3300 per customer. An application form and further details are on the Bank of England's website.\n\nThe Bank of England counter at Threadneedle Street in central London will also be issuing new notes featuring the King from June 5 to 11 and the same limit of \u00a3300 per customer applies.\n\nVisitors to the Bank of England Museum have been able to catch a first glimpse of the new banknotes, before they entered circulation, in its Future Of Money exhibition.\n\nGraham Mott, director of strategy at ATM and cash access network Link, said: \"While more people are paying for things online or using contactless cards, cash use remains popular, with over 70% of adults spending cash at least once a fortnight.\n\n\"As King Charles III banknotes begin to enter circulation, they will steadily be available through all cash machines as worn notes are withdrawn.\"\n\nA recent survey for Link indicated that nearly half (48%) of people expect to see a cashless society in their lifetime.\n\nBut, according to Link's data, the average UK adult still withdrew around \u00a31,500 from cash machines last year.\n\nIn 2023, legislation was passed as part of the Financial Services and Markets Act, to protect access to cash.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England_note_issues", "type": "wiki",

However, people may only start to see the new notes appear in their change very gradually.\n\nThere are more than 4.6 billion Bank of England notes in circulation, worth about \u00a382 billion. In line with guidance from the Royal Household, the new notes will only be printed to replace those that are worn, and to meet any overall increase in demand. The approach aims to minimise the environmental and financial impact of the change.\n\nRead more: They share the same MP, but people in these two Greater Manchester towns could not be more divided\n\nBank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said: \"We're very pleased to be issuing the new King Charles banknotes.

We know that cash is important for many people, and we are committed to providing banknotes for as long as the public demand them. Bringing these new notes into circulation is a demonstration of that commitment.\"\n\nIn April, Charles was presented with the first banknotes bearing his portrait. He praised them as \"very well designed\" and expressed his surprise at being only the second monarch to feature.\n\nThe Bank of England has been issuing banknotes since the 17th century, but it wasn't until 1960 that Queen Elizabeth II became the first British monarch to be featured on a \u00a31 paper note. Now, the public can get their hands on the new currency featuring King Charles III at select Post Office locations.\n\nOne notable branch offering the updated banknotes is located in Poundbury, Dorset, which embodies the architectural vision of King Charles. Poundbury, an extension of the town of Dorchester, was developed in the 1990s to integrate commercial and residential spaces with shops and leisure facilities, promoting a community-centric, walkable environment.\n\nInitially, the participating Post Offices will stock the new \u00a35, \u00a310, and \u00a320 notes. Over the next few days and weeks, thousands of Post Offices across the country will start circulating the redesigned currency.\n\nCommenting on the release, Karen Stonham, the branch manager at Portsmouth Post Office, also among the first to offer the new notes, said: \"Our local customers come into our branch every day to withdraw or deposit cash for their daily needs, so we were excited to be one of the first branches to have the new banknotes available.\"\n\nWhile current banknotes bearing Queen Elizabeth II's image are still valid, those eager to see the new King Charles III banknotes can now do so. The Bank of England has made arrangements for the public to access a limited quantity of these new banknotes.\n\nThe Bank of England has initiated a postal exchange service, operational from June 5 to 30, with a cap of \u00a3300 for each customer. Those interested can find an application form and additional information on the Bank of England's website.\n\nAdditionally, the Bank of England counter at Threadneedle Street in central London will start distributing new notes featuring King Charles III from June 5 to 11, adhering to the same \u00a3300 limit per individual.\n\nBelow is a list of locations and postcodes for Post Office branches where the new notes will initially be accessible on the launch day, with a broader distribution to other branches anticipated in the subsequent weeks:\n\nPiccadilly Plaza (Manchester), M2 1BB. Sunderland City, SR1 1RR. Portsmouth, PO1 1AB. Birmingham, B2 4AA. The City of London, EC2M 5TE. Moorgate, EC2M 5TE. Broadway, SW1H 0AX. Great Massingham, PE31 6HP. Tetbury, GL8 8DB. Minchinhampton, GL6 9BN. Windsor, SL4 1AA. Houndsditch, E1 7BS. Woodstock, OX20 1SP. Poundbury, DT1 3AZ.\n\nVisitors to the Bank of England Museum have already had the opportunity to preview the new banknotes as part of its 'Future Of Money' exhibition. Graham Mott, director of strategy at ATM and cash access network Link, commented: \"While more people are paying for things online or using contactless cards, cash use remains popular, with over 70 per cent of adults spending cash at least once a fortnight.\n\n\"As King Charles III banknotes begin to enter circulation, they will steadily be available through all cash machines as worn notes are withdrawn.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_shaw@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Neil

"IN A historic moment for the United Kingdom, banknotes featuring the portrait of King Charles III have entered circulation today (June, 5).\n\nThe new banknotes, which include the \u00a35, \u00a310, \u00a320, and \u00a350 notes, maintain the existing designs with the only change being the replacement of Queen Elizabeth II's portrait with that of King Charles III.\n\nThis significant transition marks the first time since 1952 that a new monarch's portrait has appeared on British banknotes.\n\nBanknotes bearing the portrait of the late Queen Elizabeth II will continue to be legal tender and will circulate alongside the new King Charles III banknotes.\n\nThe Bank of England has stated that the introduction of the new notes will follow a natural process: they will be printed only to replace worn-out notes and to meet any increases in demand.\n\nThis strategy aims to minimise both environmental and financial impacts, adhering to guidance from the Royal Household.\n\nFor those eager to obtain the new notes, the Bank of England has introduced temporary facilities for exchanging current or old series banknotes for the King Charles III banknotes.\n\nFrom today until June, 30, people can use a postal exchange service to obtain up to \u00a3300 worth of the new notes by sending in their current banknotes along with a completed application form.\n\nAdditionally, from June, 5 to June, 11, the counter at the Bank of England on Threadneedle Street will issue new banknotes featuring King Charles III.\n\nThis service is available to both UK and non-UK residents, with a limit

An application form and further details are on the Bank of England's website.\n\nThe Bank of England counter at Threadneedle Street in central London will also be issuing new notes featuring the King from June 5 to 11 and the same limit of \u00a3300 per customer applies.\n\nVisitors to the Bank of England Museum have been able to catch a first glimpse of the new banknotes, before they entered circulation, in its Future Of Money exhibition.\n\nGraham Mott, director of strategy at ATM and cash access network Link, said: \"While more people are paying for things online or using contactless cards, cash use remains popular, with over 70% of adults spending cash at least once a fortnight.\n\n\"As King Charles III banknotes begin to enter circulation, they will steadily be available through all cash machines as worn notes are withdrawn.\"\n\nA recent survey for Link indicated that nearly half (48%) of people expect to see a cashless society in their lifetime.\n\nBut, according to Link's data, the average UK adult still withdrew around \u00a31,500 from cash machines last year.\n\nIn 2023, legislation was passed as part of the Financial Services and Markets Act, to protect access to cash.\n\nHere are the locations and postcodes for the Post Office branches where the notes will be available first on launch day, with a gradual rollout to others in the coming weeks:", "source":

These new banknotes will circulate alongside those bearing Queen Elizabeth II's image.\n\nThe image of Charles will grace all four denominations the \u00a35, \u00a310, \u00a320 and \u00a350 notes with no other changes made to the existing designs. However, the public may only gradually start seeing these new notes in their change.\n\nThe initial release of the new banknotes at selected Post Offices, including in the North East, will include \u00a35, \u00a310, and \u00a320 notes. Over the next few days and weeks, thousands of Post Offices across the country are set to receive the updated currency.\n\nRead more: Thousands of DWP claimants could be owed up to seven years backpay due to blunder Get all the latest money news and budgeting tips from Chronicle Live with our free newsletter\n\nCurrently, there are over 4.6 billion Bank of England notes in circulation, amounting to approximately \u00a382 billion. Following guidance from the Royal Household, these new notes will only be printed to replace worn-out ones and to cater to any increase in demand.\n\nThis approach is aimed at minimising both environmental and financial impacts of the change. Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England, expressed his pleasure at issuing the new King Charles banknotes, stating: \"We're very pleased to be issuing the new King Charles banknotes.\"\n\nHe described it as a historic moment, being the first time the sovereign on the banknotes has been changed. He emphasised the importance of cash for many people and the Bank's commitment to providing banknotes as long as there is public demand for them, reports Wales Online.\n\nThe introduction of these new notes, he said, is a testament to that commitment.\n\nIn April, Charles was presented with the first banknotes bearing his portrait. He commended them as \"very well designed\" and expressed his surprise at being only the second monarch to feature.\n\nWhile the Bank of England has been issuing banknotes since the 17th century, it was Charles's mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who first appeared on a \u00a31 note in 1960. The latest currency featuring King Charles III will be available at select Post Office branches for eager collectors.\n\nPoundbury in Dorset, an area that embodies the architectural vision of King Charles, is home to one of the branches distributing the new banknotes. Poundbury, an extension to Dorchester initiated in the 1990s, showcases a mix of commercial and residential spaces, shops, and leisure facilities designed for a walkable community, all influenced by Charles's classical design preferences.\n\nPortsmouth Post Office branch manager Karen Stonham, whose branch is among the first to offer the new notes, expressed excitement: \"Our local customers come into our branch every day to withdraw or deposit cash for their daily needs, so we were excited to be one of the first branches to have the new banknotes available.\"\n\nKrishna Thakeria, branch manager at the Broadway Post Office in central London, which is also stocking the new banknotes, commented: \"The new-look notes hold a special significance for us at Broadway Post Office, given our proximity to Buckingham Palace and the historic Cabinet War Rooms.\"\n\nRecent statistics from the Post Office have shown a marked rise in cash handling this April, with over \u00a33.48 billion in cash deposits and withdrawals recorded at their countersa new record. Ross Borkett, the banking director at the Post Office, remarked: \"This historic launch of the new banknotes featuring King Charles III comes as we experience the highest levels of cash withdrawals and deposits in Post Office branches.\"\n\n\"We're pleased to be able to mark this day by giving people the opportunity to withdraw the new notes from our branches.\"\n\nWhile current banknotes bearing Queen Elizabeth II's image are still valid and there's no requirement to swap them out, those eager to glimpse the new currency can now do so. The Bank of England has established temporary measures to facilitate access to a limited quantity of the new King Charles III banknotes.\n\nA postal exchange service has been established, running from 5 to 30 June, with a limit of \u00a3300 per customer. An application form and further details can be found on the Bank of England's website.\n\nThe Bank of England counter at Threadneedle Street in central London will also issue new notes featuring the King from 5 to 11 June, with the same \u00a3300 limit per customer.\n\nVisitors to the Bank of England Museum have had the opportunity to see the new banknotes before they enter circulation, as part of its Future Of Money exhibition. Graham Mott, director of strategy at ATM and cash access network Link, stated: \"While more people are paying for things online or using contactless cards, cash use remains popular, with over 70% of adults spending cash at least once a fortnight.\"\n\n\"As King Charles III banknotes begin to enter circulation, they will steadily be available through all cash machines as worn notes are withdrawn.\"\n\nA recent survey for Link suggested that nearly half (48%) of people expect to see a cashless society in their lifetime. However, according to Link's data, the average UK adult still withdrew around \u00a31,500 from cash machines last year.\n\nIn 2023, legislation was passed under the Financial Services and Markets Act to protect access to cash.\n\nHere are the locations and postcodes for the Post Office branches where the notes will first be available on launch day, with a gradual rollout to others in the coming weeks:.\n\nPiccadilly Plaza (Manchester), M2 1BB.\n\nSunderland City, SR1 1RR.\n\nPortsmouth, PO1 1AB.\n\nBirmingham, B2 4AA.\n\nThe City of London, EC2M 5TE.\n\nMoorgate, EC2M 5TE.\n\nBroadway, SW1H

cards, cash use remains popular, with over 70% of adults spending cash at least once a fortnight.\n\n\"As King Charles III banknotes begin to enter circulation, they will steadily be available through all cash machines as worn notes are withdrawn.\"\n\nBut, according to Link's data, the average UK adult still withdrew around \u00a31,500 from cash machines last year.\n\nIn 2023, legislation was

These will circulate alongside notes featuring his late mother, Queen Elizabeth II, who passed away in September 2022.\n\nCoins and stamps featuring Charles' image have already been introduced.\n\nThe newly designed notes may not be immediately noticeable in everyday transactions as many payments are now cashless.\n\nDespite a decline in cash payments, cash remains crucial for lower-income households and welfare recipients who use post offices for financial transactions. In 2023, legislation was enacted to protect access to cash.\n\nAccording to Royal Household guidelines, the new notes will be printed only to replace worn ones and to meet increased demand, minimizing environmental and financial impact.\n\nCurrently, over 4.6 billion Bank of England notes are in circulation, valued at approximately 82 billion pounds (USD 105 billion).\n\nBank of England Governor Andrew Bailey stated, \"This is a historic moment as it's the first time we've changed the sovereign on our notes.

The banknotes already in circulation bearing the late Queen Elizabeth's portrait will continue to be a legal tender, and unaffected by the introduction of the new notes.\n\nIt is to be noted that King Charles III is the second monarch to be featured on banknotes. His mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, was the first monarch to be featured on British banknotes, which contrasts with the traditional representation of kings and queens on English coins spanning over 1,000 years. Furthermore, the design for the King Charles III banknotes was unveiled in December 2022, following the introduction of coins featuring the monarch's likeness into circulation.

As reported in the press release, this strategy aims to mitigate the environmental and financial impacts associated with currency changes. Meaning that the transition to the new currency may occur gradually, with people gradually encountering these notes in their daily transactions.

However, people may only start to see the new notes appear in their change very gradually.\n\nThere are more than 4.6 billion Bank of England notes in circulation, worth about \u00a382 billion. In line with guidance from the Royal Household, the new notes will only be printed to replace those that are worn, and to meet any overall increase in demand.\n\nThe approach aims to minimise the environmental and financial impact of the change. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said: \"We're very pleased to be issuing the new King Charles banknotes.\n\n\"This is a historic moment, as it's the first time we've changed the sovereign on our notes. We know that cash is important for many people, and we are committed to providing banknotes for as long as the public demand them. Bringing these new notes into circulation is a demonstration of that commitment.\"\n\nIn April, Charles was presented with the first banknotes bearing his portrait. He praised them as \"very well designed\" and expressed his surprise at being only the second monarch to feature.\n\nAlthough the Bank of England started to produce banknotes in the 17th century, Charles's mother, Queen Elizabeth II, was the first British sovereign to be given the honour in 1960 on a \u00a31 paper note. People will be able to snap up the new-look currency at selected Post Office branches.\n\nOne of the branches where the new banknotes are being made available is situated in Poundbury in Dorset, an area reflecting the King's architectural principles. Work started on Charles's classically inspired extension to the Dorset town of Dorchester in the 1990s, to create an urban quarter of Dorchester where commercial buildings were mixed with residential areas, shops and leisure facilities for a walkable community.\n\nThe chosen Post Offices will initially have \u00a35, \u00a310 and \u00a320 denominations of the new banknotes. Thousands of Post Offices will receive the new-look currency over the coming days and weeks.\n\nKaren Stonham, branch manager at the Portsmouth Post Office, which is also among the initial branches to stock the new notes, said: \"Our local customers come into our branch every day to withdraw or deposit cash for their daily needs, so we were excited to be one of the first branches to have the new banknotes available.\"\n\nKrishna Thakeria, branch manager at the Broadway Post Office in central London, which is also stocking the new banknotes, said: \"The new-look notes hold a special significance for us at Broadway Post Office, given our proximity to Buckingham Palace and the historic Cabinet War Rooms.\"\n\nRecent figures from Post Office revealed a significant increase in cash transactions at its branches in April, with cash deposits and withdrawals across counters totalling a record \u00a33.48 billion. Ross Borkett, banking director at the Post Office, said: \"This historic launch of the new banknotes featuring King Charles III comes as we experience the highest levels of cash withdrawals and deposits in Post Office branches.\n\n\"We're pleased to be able to mark this day by giving people the opportunity to withdraw the new notes from our branches.\"\n\nWhile banknotes featuring Queen Elizabeth II remain legal tender and there is no need to exchange them, people who are interested to see the new banknotes can now get their hands on them. The Bank of England has put temporary facilities in place to allow people to obtain a limited amount of the King Charles III banknotes.\n\nIt has set up a postal exchange service, running from June 5 to 30, up to a limit of \u00a3300 per customer. An application form and further details are on the Bank of England's website. The Bank of England counter at Threadneedle Street in central London will also be issuing new notes featuring the King from June 5 to 11 and the same limit of \u00a3300 per customer applies.\n\nVisitors to the Bank of England Museum have been able to catch a first glimpse of the new banknotes, before they entered circulation, in its Future Of Money exhibition. Graham Mott, director of strategy at ATM and cash access network Link, said: \"While more people are paying for things online or using contactless cards, cash use remains popular, with over 70% of adults spending cash at least once a fortnight.\n\n\"As King Charles III banknotes begin to enter circulation, they will steadily be available through all cash machines as worn notes are withdrawn.\"\n\nA recent survey for Link indicated that nearly half (48%) of people expect to see a cashless society in their lifetime. But, according to Link's data, the average UK adult still withdrew around \u00a31,500 from cash machines last year.\n\nIn 2023, legislation was passed as part of the Financial Services and Markets Act, to protect access to cash.\n\nHere are the locations and postcodes for the Post Office branches where the notes will be available first on launch day, with a gradual rollout to others in the coming weeks:\n\nPiccadilly Plaza (Manchester), M2 1BB\n\nSunderland City, SR1 1RR\n\nPortsmouth, PO1 1AB\n\nBirmingham, B2 4AA\n\nThe City of London, EC2M 5TE\n\nMoorgate, EC2M 5TE\n\nBroadway, SW1H

The new banknotes will co-circulate alongside those featuring Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe portrait of Charles will appear on all four banknotes - the \u00a35, \u00a310, \u00a320 and \u00a350 - with no other alterations to the existing designs. However, people may only start to see the new notes appear in their change very gradually.\n\nThere are more than 4.6 billion Bank of England notes in circulation, worth about \u00a382 billion. In line with guidance from the Royal Household, the new notes will only be printed to replace those that are worn, and to meet any overall increase in demand.\n\nREAD MORE: These are the 10 Midlands GP surgeries where it's hardest to get an appointment\n\nThe approach aims to minimise the environmental and financial impact of the change. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said: \"We're very pleased to be issuing the new King Charles banknotes.\n\n\"This is a historic moment, as it's the first time we've changed the sovereign on our notes. We know cash is important for many people, and we are committed to providing banknotes for as long as the public demand them. Bringing these new notes into circulation is a demonstration of that commitment.\"\n\nIn April, Charles was presented with the first banknotes bearing his portrait. He praised them as \"very well designed\" and expressed his surprise at being only the second monarch to feature.\n\nAlthough the Bank of England started to produce banknotes in the 17th century, Charles's mother, Queen Elizabeth II, was the first British sovereign to be given the honour in 1960 on a \u00a31 paper note.\n\nPeople will be able to snap up the new-look currency at selected Post Office branches, including the Pinfold Street outlet in birmingham -city-centre>Birmingham city centre, postcode B2 4AA. The chosen Post Offices will initially have \u00a35, \u00a310 and \u00a320 denominations of the new banknotes.\n\nThousands of Post Offices will receive the new-look currency over the coming days and weeks. Karen Stonham, branch manager at the Portsmouth Post Office, which is also among the initial branches to stock the new notes, said: \"Our local customers come into our branch every day to withdraw or deposit cash for their daily needs, so we were excited to be one of the first branches to have the new banknotes available.\"\n\nKrishna Thakeria, branch manager at the Broadway Post Office in central London, which is also stocking the new banknotes, said: \"The new-look notes hold a special significance for us at Broadway Post Office, given our proximity to Buckingham Palace and the historic Cabinet War Rooms.\"\n\nRecent figures from Post Office revealed a significant increase in cash transactions at its branches in April, with cash deposits and withdrawals across counters totalling a record \u00a33.48 billion.\n\nRoss Borkett, banking director at the Post Office, said: \"This historic launch of the new banknotes featuring King Charles III comes as we experience the highest levels of cash withdrawals and deposits in Post Office branches.\n\n\"We're pleased to be able to mark this day by giving people the opportunity to withdraw the new notes from our branches.\" While banknotes featuring Queen Elizabeth II remain legal tender and there is no need to exchange them, people who are interested to see the new banknotes can now get their hands on them.\n\nThe Bank of England has put temporary facilities in place to allow people to obtain a limited amount of the King Charles III banknotes. It has set up a postal exchange service, running from June 5 to 30, up to a limit of \u00a3300 per customer. An application form and further details are on the Bank of England's website.\n\nThe Bank of England counter at Threadneedle Street in central London will also be issuing new notes featuring the King from June 5 to 11 and the same limit of \u00a3300 per customer applies. Visitors to the Bank of England Museum have been able to catch a first glimpse of the new banknotes, before they entered circulation, in its Future Of Money exhibition.\n\nGraham Mott, director of strategy at ATM and cash access network Link, said: \"While more people are paying for things online or using contactless cards, cash use remains popular, with over 70 per cent of adults spending cash at least once a fortnight.\n\n\"As King Charles III banknotes begin to enter circulation, they will steadily be available through all cash machines as worn notes are withdrawn.\" A recent survey for Link indicated that nearly half (48 per cent) of people expect to see a cashless society in their lifetime.\n\nBut, according to Link's data, the average UK adult still withdrew around \u00a31,500 from cash machines last year. In 2023, legislation was passed as part of the Financial Services and Markets Act, to protect access to cash.", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham

The back of the banknotes will still feature Winston Churchill on the \u00a35, Jane Austen on the \u00a310, JMW Turner on the \u00a320 and Alan Turing on the \u00a350, and the design will continue to follow the existing colour scheme.\n\nFrom this morning, 14 Post Offices across the country will stock the new currency and thousands will soon receive the new-look currency over the coming days and weeks. However, with the new notes many will want to know what will happen to their old ones. For those concerned, they should not worry as the old banknotes featuring the portrait of Her late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will remain legal tender and co-circulate alongside the new King Charles III notes. This is to reduce the environmental and financial impacts of the change.\n\nThe Bank of England explained: \"The new banknotes will only be printed to replace those that are worn and to meet any overall increase in demand for banknotes. Our approach is in line with guidance from the Royal Household, to minimise the environmental and financial impact of this change.\"\n\nSo, you can continue to use notes featuring the portrait of Her Majesty and there is no specific need to go and swap them all for ones featuring King Charles. However, if you are something of an enthusiast when it comes to the Royal Family, then there are ways to get your hands on one sooner rather than later.\n\nThe Bank of England is allowing you to exchange an old note with one of the new ones from today. The Bank of England counter at Threadneedle Street in London will also be doling them out until 11 June, before they will then revert to issuing Queen Elizabeth II banknotes only on 12 June.

He said he took him a cup of tea at 5.30am, as he waited for the doors to open.\n\nMike and Susan Harrison were also among the first to get the notes at the Bank of England.\n\n\"We've travelled up from York yesterday for today, purely to get the new bank notes for my own collection and for my grandson's collection,\" Mr Harrison told the Standard.\n\n\"They're the new bank notes with the new King on...that's big.

I think it'll be a nice keepsake for when he's older. Aren't they lovely?\"\n\nThose visiting the Bank of England were not able to withdraw the notes, but instead exchange them for older cash, up to the value of \u00a3300.\n\nThe notes were also available at some Post Office branches on Wednesday.\n\nRuss Barnes, 50, travelled an hour-and-a-half from his home in Maidstone to Moorgate Post Office - one of the select few due to receive them - only to find it had not received its delivery.\n\n\"I've arrived here for 8am so I can get them straight away and unfortunately they've got none available,\" he told the Standard.\n\n\"I just wanted to get them as a gift for my children. I was going to get the full set.

Bringing these new notes into circulation is a demonstration of that commitment.\"\n\nAlthough the Bank of England started to produce banknotes in the 17th century, Charles's mother, Queen Elizabeth II, was the first British sovereign to be given the honour in 1960 on a \u00a31 paper note.\n\nIn April, Charles was presented with the first banknotes bearing his portrait.\n\nHe praised them as

Other than the new monarch, the design of the banknotes is unchanged.\n\nCash usage has fallen sharply in Britain in recent years as consumers favor debit cards and other electronic payments.\n\nAccording to the British Retail Consortium, cash accounted for more than half of transactions in shops in 2014, but had fallen to 15% by 2021 -- partly due to COVID-19 restrictions -- before rising to 19% in 2022.\n\n\"We are committed to providing banknotes for as long as the public demand them.

Britain's government passed legislation last year to require banks to ensure ready access to cash.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknotes_of_the_pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Banknotes of the pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknote", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Banknote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Households_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Households of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bailey_(banker)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bailey (banker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Retail_Consortium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Retail Consortium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Debit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper Money", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Coins", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Coins", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Paper Money", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Cash_Registers", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Cash Registers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/01_05_2024_08_11_26_5310426.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620154", "eventUri": "eng-9620154", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The King's portrait will appear on all four banknotes - \u00a35, \u00a310, \u00a320 and \u00a350 - with no other changes being made to the designs.\n\nKing Charles has already had a sneak peek at how the notes look after he was presented with the first low-numbered note of each denomination with 01 000001 serial numbers at Buckingham Palace by the Governor of the Bank of England. In what will be a surprise to many, the King will only be the second British monarch to grace the Bank of England's notes.\n\nDespite banknotes being in use since the late 17th Century, it was Queen Elizabeth II who was the first monarch to feature on a banknote when in 1960 her portrait was used on a \u00a31 paper note. Before this, Britannia was the only character to have appeared.\n\nREAD MORE: Red Arrows flypast for King's birthday as Spitfires and Lancaster bombers join iconic jets over London\n\nThe new money, with Charles's portrait featuring on the front of the banknotes as well as being visible on the front and back in cameo in the see-through security window, will gradually come into circulation from June 5. The reverse side characters remain unchanged from previous editions - with Sir Winston Churchill on the \u00a35, Jane Austen on the \u00a310, JMW Turner on the \u00a320 and Alan Turing on the \u00a350.\n\nWhen he got a first look at the notes, King Charles was clearly impressed with how they look saying of the \u00a35: \"It's a very good photograph of Sir Winston.\" And he took a particular liking to the back of the \u00a320 and the \u00a350. \"They're very elegant these ones, I must say,\" he said.\n\nWhat happens to banknotes featuring Queen Elizabeth II\n\nExisting notes featuring the portrait of the late Queen will continue to be legal tender, so the Elizabeth II and King Charles III notes will co-circulate and both will be available to be used. New notes of the King will only be printed to replace worn-out notes and to meet any overall increase in demand.\n\nThis is based on the Royal Family's request to minimise the environmental and financial impact of the change. There is no need to exchange current banknotes for the new King Charles III notes if you don't want to.\n\nCan old banknotes be swapped for banknotes featuring King Charles III?\n\nThe Bank of England is aware there is likely to be a lot of interest from people wanting to use the new notes. As a result, for a short time only people can exchange up to \u00a3300 for the new King Charles III banknotes.\n\nThis will be done via the Bank of England's postal exchange service and by filling out an application form. The exchanged notes can only be sent to a UK address.\n\nThis service will only run for a little more than three weeks from Wednesday, June 5 through to Sunday, June 30. There is a strict \u00a3300 limit per customer, any money sent in excess of this amount will be returned in the older form of notes featuring Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe Bank of England counter at Threadneedle Street will only be issuing new banknotes featuring King Charles III from Wednesday, June 5 to Tuesday, June 11. The counter is open to UK and non-UK residents. The same limit of \u00a3300 per customer applies. From June 12, the Bank's counter will revert to issuing Queen Elizabeth II banknotes only.\n\nRare King Charles III banknotes to be sold at auctions\n\nThe renowned auctioneers Spink & Son, known for sales of coins, banknotes and medals, is hosting a series of charity auctions of new King Charles III low-serial numbered banknotes. An auction of \u00a35 notes is taking place at 2pm on Thursday, June 13, with the auction for \u00a310 notes being held two weeks later on June 27 at 2pm. The \u00a320 notes auction is taking place on Thursday, July 11 at 2pm and the final auction for \u00a350 notes is on Wednesday, July 24 at 2pm.\n\nIn addition to the auctions, members of the public will be able to enter a ballot to purchase a set of notes. The money raised will be donated to charity.\n\nGet the biggest stories from around London straight to your inbox.

The proportion of payments made in cash edged lower to 14%.\n\nThe BoE has committed to carry on providing cash for as long as it's wanted by the public after beginning work on the design of a \"digital pound\".\n\nThe work on a central bank digital currency has stoked concerns that cash is being rapidly phased out.\n\nCharles became King in September 2022 after the death of his mother, who was the longest serving monarch in British history.

He said he made the journey simply because he needed the cash rather than to collect a souvenir, even if the polymer banknotes felt like \"Monopoly money\" compared with the paper euros in his wallet.\n\n\"For me, who cares?\" said Benson, who had first considered keeping an old bill featuring Queen Elizabeth. \"For what? I'm not related to history of England.\"\n\nIf a visit to the Bank was good fortune for some, for others, it was a calculated decision to snap up some of the collectible new currency.\n\nMany queued outside the Bank in the early hours of Wednesday, according to staff, some eager to get their hands on the new notes.\n\nBy midday, listings of \"authentic\" King Charles banknotes started appearing on eBay, for double or in some cases triple their value.\n\nThe king's portrait features on all four UK banknotes - the \u00a35, \u00a310, \u00a320 and \u00a350 - on the front and also in the see-through security windows. However, the other design and security features will remain the same, and no other changes have been made to the existing look of the notes.\n\n\"We're very pleased to be issuing the new King Charles banknotes. This is a historic moment, as it's the first time we've changed the sovereign on our notes,\" said Andrew Bailey, the Bank's governor.\n\nFor others, such as Ian Casey, the change was a good opportunity for gifts. After seeing news of the notes' release on X, formerly Twitter, he paid a visit to the Bank in order to send cash to his four nieces in north Wales.\n\n\"I imagine it'll probably take a little while for money to get out there, the new notes, so I thought I'd come and change them,\" said the digital video journalist with the BBC, who plans to send \u00a310 to each niece, keeping \u00a370 for himself.\n\nIt's also historic, he said: \"It's just a significant change in the times because most people in my family that are alive now have all known the Queen to be on notes. We've got in my family some notes that had the Queen's father.\"\n\nPaul Whiting, 60, who expressed great affection for the late Queen, wanted to commemorate the day by exchanging his old banknotes on the first day of issue. \"It's kind of like a new era in a sense. It's just nice to have some new money,\" he said, after withdrawing notes of each denomination but stopping short of the \u00a3300 limit.\n\nWhiting, a retired school teacher who lives in London, intends to keep the cash and show it to his elderly parents in Birmingham. \"The country's going through a lot of change and I think the monarchy offers a huge amount of stability and continuity but also change at the same time, and I think that's a very special thing in this country,\" he said.\n\n\"It's just a change, isn't it? I've still got this idea of the Queen and I suppose we're moving into a new era - into the Charles era.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "geneva_abdul@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Geneva Abdul", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknote", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banknote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer_banknote", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polymer banknote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threadneedle_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Threadneedle Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bailey_(banker)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bailey (banker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EBay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper Money", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Paper Money", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Armored_Car_Service", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Armored Car Service", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/c8c76a7641049bdac7adc60c5865f998", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620154", "eventUri": "eng-9620154", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

These will be printed solely to replace worn-out notes, in an effort to minimise costs and environmental repercussions.\n\nNonetheless, the release has incited a wave of enthusiasm among fans, with some forming queues outside the Bank of England from early morning, eager to secure some of the first-edition notes. An excited fan shared their experience on X, previously known as Twitter, stating (@ianvisits): \"That was actually silly good fun.\n\n\"Once the doors open, there's the usual security checks and then straight into the bank counter where they'll swap your old banknotes for equivalent new ones.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nRoyal enthusiasts have been eagerly lining up to acquire the first-ever banknotes featuring King Charles, signalling the dawn of a new era.\n\nFor many years, Queen Elizabeth II's portrait has adorned British currency and stamps, reflecting her tenure as the nation's longest-serving monarch. However, her passing in 2022 prompted the Bank of England to start making new banknotes bearing the likeness of King Charles III, which have today entered circulation.\n\nIn line with previous designs, the visage of His Majesty graces the \u00a35, \u00a310, \u00a320 and \u00a350 polymer notes. These will be printed only as replacements for worn-out notes to minimise costs and environmental impact associated with the transition.\n\nNonetheless, the release has stirred considerable excitement among royal fans, with numerous individuals eagerly queuing outside the Bank of England from early morning to secure some of the first edition notes. Sharing their experience on X, previously known as Twitter, one enthusiast (@ianvisits) commented: \"That was actually silly good fun.\n\n\"Once the doors open, there's the usual security checks and then straight into the bank counter where they'll swap your old banknotes for equivalent new ones. The queue is quite short (at the moment) so if you fancy doing something a bit different, they will swap up to \u00a3300 of QEII banknotes for CRIII equivalents for the next five days.\"\n\nWhile the user enjoyed his experience, he suggested that those hoping to sell the new notes on eBay for a profit might be disappointed, as the ones available weren't of low serial numbers. However, some may go under the hammer at Spink & Son next month.\n\nHe also mentioned: \"Just bring the notes and proof ID. And you get to see a small bit of the grand interior of the Bank of England as well.\"\n\nBased on Threadneedle Street in London, the Bank of England's walk-in service will run from June 5 to June 11, and is open to UK and non-UK residents. Royal fans can also receive new notes in the post using the bank's exchange service running from June 5 to June 30.\n\nTo do this, you'll need to fill in an application form before sending off the worn down notes. The exchanged currency can only be sent to a UK address.", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_haughey@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Lauren Haughey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknote", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banknote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_III_of_Spain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles III of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majesty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Majesty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spink_&_Son", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spink & Son"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threadneedle_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Threadneedle Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EBay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper Money", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Paper Money", "wgt": 21}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article32969173.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GPSuDHNXQAAAb0q.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620154", "eventUri": "eng-9620154", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "dateEnd": "2024-06-11", "textStart": 2027, "textEnd": 2044}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "dateEnd": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 2183, "textEnd": 2200}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

He said he made the journey simply because he needed the cash rather than to collect a souvenir, even if the polymer banknotes felt like \"Monopoly money\" compared with the paper euros in his wallet.\n\n\"For me, who cares,\" said Benson, who had first considered keeping an old bill featuring Queen Elizabeth. \"For what? I'm not related to history of England.\"\n\nIf the visit to the Bank was good fortune for some, for others it was a calculated decision to snap up some of the collectible new currency.\n\nMany queued outside the Bank in the early hours of Wednesday, according to staff, some eager to get their hands on the new notes.\n\nBy midday, listings of \"authentic\" King Charles banknotes started appearing on eBay, for double or, in some cases, triple their value.\n\nThe king's portrait features on all four UK banknotes - the \u00a35, \u00a310, \u00a320 and \u00a350, on the front and also in the see-through security windows. However, the other design and security features will remain the same, with no other changes to the existing look of the notes.\n\n\"We're very pleased to be issuing the new King Charles banknotes. This is a historic moment, as it's the first time we've changed the sovereign on our notes,\" said Andrew Bailey, the Bank's governor.\n\nFor others, such as Ian Casey, the change was a good opportunity for gifts. After seeing news of the notes' release on X, formerly Twitter, he paid a visit to the Bank in order to send cash to his four nieces in north Wales.\n\n\"I imagine it'll probably take a little while for money to get out there, the new notes, so I thought I'd come and change them,\" said the digital video journalist from BBC, who plans on sending \u00a310 to each niece. He plans to keep \u00a370 for himself.\n\nIt's also historic, he said. \"It's just a significant change in the times because most people in my family that are alive now have all known the Queen to be on notes, we've got in my family some notes that had the Queen's father,\" said Casey.\n\nPaul Whiting, 60, who expressed great affection for the late Queen, wanted to commemorate the day by exchanging his old banknotes on the first day of issue.\n\n\"It's kind of like a new era in a sense, it's just nice to have some new money,\" said Whiting, who took out each denomination but did not reach the \u00a3300 limit.\n\nAs for his spending plans, Whiting, a retired school teacher who lives in London, intends to keep the cash and show it to his elderly parents in Birmingham.\n\n\"The country's going through a lot of change and I think the monarchy offers a huge amount of stability and continuity but also change at the same time, and I think that's a very special thing in this country,\" he said.\n\n\"It's just a change isn't it. I've still got this idea of the Queen and suppose we're moving into a new era, into the Charles era.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "geneva_abdul@theguardian.com", "name": "Geneva Abdul", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknote", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Banknote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer_banknote", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polymer banknote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threadneedle_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Threadneedle Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly (game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bailey_(banker)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bailey (banker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EBay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper Money", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Paper Money", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f25b6022ca695a52a5113964393067591d419c1/0_27_2224_1334/master/2224.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=962d1fe2a42f17f870f3f94eb7d645db", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620154", "eventUri": "eng-9620154", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

This is because under guidance from the Royal Household, new notes can only be printed to replace those that are worn and to meet any overall increase in demand.\n\nAs of this morning, 14 Post Offices across the country will stock the new currency today with these branches providing \u00a35, \u00a310 and \u00a320 notes. Thousands of Post Offices will then receive the new-look currency over the coming days and weeks.\n\nIt's important to remember that old banknotes with pictures of the late Queen Elizabeth II will remain legal tender, which means you'll still be able to spend them in stores alongside the new ones. The back of the banknotes will still feature Winston Churchill on the \u00a35, Jane Austen on the \u00a310, JMW Turner on the \u00a320 and Alan Turing on the \u00a350, and the design will continue to follow the existing colour scheme.\n\nKaren Stonham, branch manager at the Portsmouth Post Office, and Krishna Thakeria, branch manager at the Broadway Post Office both said it would be \"exciting\" to be part of the launch.\n\nKaren said: \"Our local customers come into our branch every day to withdraw or deposit cash for their daily needs, so we were excited to be one of the first branches to have the new banknotes available. It's been a significant day for Portsmouth, with the King also in the area for the D-Day anniversary celebrations.\"\n\nKrishna added: \"We are delighted to be able to offer customers a chance to get their hands on these new designs from the day they launch. Not only that but the new-look notes hold a special significance for us at Broadway Post Office, given our proximity to Buckingham Palace and the historic Cabinet War Rooms, which hold strong connections to Winston Churchill who continues to feature on the reverse of the \u00a35 note.\"\n\nIf you want to get your hands on a new note sooner rather than later, you can also exchange an old note with one of the new at the Bank of England from today. However, this will only be for a \"limited\" time only. The Central Bank has also set up a postal exchange service, running from June 5 to 30, up to a limit of \u00a3300 per customer. An application form and further details are on the Bank of England's website.\n\nThe launch is a historic moment as it is only the second time a monarch has been featured on a note, as previously banknotes have only used a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.

But following her passing in 2022, the Bank of England began producing new banknotes of King Charles III - these have entered circulation today.\n\nIn keeping with the previous currency, His Majesty's face is depicted on the \u00a35, \u00a310, \u00a320 and \u00a350 polymer notes. These will only be printed to replace those that are worn down, to reduce the costs and environmental impacts of this change.\n\nEven still, their release has sparked a frenzy of excitement among monarchists, with many quick to queue up outside the Bank of England this morning in hopes of grabbing some first edition currency. Taking to X, formerly Twitter, one fan wrote (@ianvisits): \"That was actually silly good fun.\n\n\"Once the doors open, there's the usual security checks and then straight into the bank counter where they'll swap your old banknotes for equivalent new ones. The queue is quite short (at the moment) so if you fancy doing something a bit different, they will swap up to \u00a3300 of QEII banknotes for CRIII equivalents for the next five days.\"\n\nWhile, the X user enjoyed his experience, he implied that anyone hoping to sell them for a bit of cash on eBay may be a bit disappointed. The new notes available here weren't of low serial numbers, but it appears that some may be auctioned at Spink & Son next month.\n\nHe added: \"Just bring the notes and proof ID. And you get to see a small bit of the grand interior of the Bank of England as well.\"\n\nBased on Threadneedle Street, the Bank of England's walk-in service will run from June 5 to June 11, and is open to UK and non-UK residents. However, if this doesn't take your fancy, Royal fans can also receive new notes in the post using the bank's exchange service running from June 5 to June 30.\n\nTo do this, you'll need to fill in an application form before sending off the worn down notes. The exchanged currency can only be sent to a UK address.\n\nHave you got a story to tell?

Existing notes featuring Elizabeth will continue to circulate.\n\n\"This approach is in line with guidance from the Royal Household, to minimise the environmental and financial impact of this change,\" the BoE said. \"This means the public will begin to see the new King Charles III notes very gradually.\"\n\nElizabeth was the first monarch to feature on British banknotes, in contrast to coins in England which have carried images of kings and queens for more than 1,000 years.\n\nThe design of the new banknotes was revealed in December 2022, shortly after coins featuring Charles entered circulation. Other than the new monarch, the design of the banknotes is unchanged.\n\nCash usage has fallen sharply in Britain in recent years as consumers favour debit cards and other electronic payments.\n\nAccording to the British Retail Consortium, cash accounted for more than half of transactions in shops in 2014, but had fallen to 15% by 2021 - partly due to COVID-19 restrictions - before rising to 19% in 2022.\n\n\"We are committed to providing banknotes for as long as the public demand them. Bringing these new notes into circulation is a demonstration of that commitment,\" BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said on Wednesday.\n\nBritain's government passed legislation last year to require banks to ensure ready access to cash.

Bringing these new notes into circulation is a demonstration of that commitment.\"\n\nIn April, Charles was presented with the first banknotes bearing his portrait, which he described as \"very well designed\".\n\nBanknotes featuring Queen Elizabeth II remain legal tender and there is no need to exchange them.\n\nBut if you want to get your hands on a King Charles III bank note the Bank of England has put temporary facilities in place to allow people to obtain a limited amount.\n\nA postal exchange service will run from June 5 to June 30 allowing customers to exchange up to \u00a3300 of notes.\n\nAn application form and further details are on the Bank of England's website.\n\nThe Bank of England counter at Threadneedle Street in central London will also be issuing new notes featuring the King from June 5 to June 11. The same limit of \u00a3300 per customer applies.\n\nKaren Stonham, branch manager at Portsmouth Post Office, which is among the initial branches to stock the new notes, said: \"Our local customers come into our branch every day to withdraw or deposit cash for their daily needs, so we were excited to be one of the first branches to have the new banknotes available.\"\n\nWhen Queen Elizabeth II came to power, coins with her father's image, George VI remained in circulation for almost 20 years after his death.\n\nThey were eventually removed when decimalisation was introduced in 1971.\n\nBut after one monarch has died and another lined up to take their place, it means a whole host of other things need to change.\n\nCoins with the new King on entered circulation at the beginning of December 2023.\n\nThe 50p officially entered circulation and is available from Post Offices around the UK.\n\nIn keeping with tradition, The King's portrait faces to the left - in the opposite direction to the late Queen.\n\nOn the new 50p coin featuring King Charles III, the Monarch is not wearing a crown.\n\nThis is because Kings are not often depicted wearing a crown on coins, although Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II had one.\n\nAll UK coins bearing the effigy of Queen Elizabeth II will remain legal tender and in active circulation.\n\nThey will be replaced over time as they become damaged or worn and to meet demand for additional coins - much like with notes.\n\nHistorically it is the case that coins featuring different monarchs do co-circulate, ensuring a smooth transition with minimal environmental impact and cost.\n\nRare coins and notes hiding down the back of your sofa could sell for hundreds of pounds.\n\nIf you are lucky enough to find a rare \u00a310 note you might be able to sell it for multiple times its face value.\n\nYou can spot rare notes by keeping an eye out for the serial numbers.\n\nThese numbers can be found on the side with the Monarch's face, just under the value \u00a310 in the corner of the note.\n\nAlso if you have a serial number on your note that is quite quirky you could cash in thousands.\n\nFor example, one seller bagged \u00a33,600 after spotting a specific serial number relating to the year Jane Austen was born on one of their notes.\n\nYou can check if your notes are worth anything on eBay, just tick \"completed and sold items\" and filter by the highest value.\n\nIt will give you an idea of what people are willing to pay for some notes.\n\nBut do bear in mind that yours is only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it.\n\nThis is also the case for coins, you can determine how rare your coin is by looking a the latest scarcity index.\n\nThe next step is to take a look at what has been recently sold on eBay.\n\nExperts from Change Checker recommend looking at \"sold listings\" to be sure that the coin has sold for the specified amount rather than just been listed.\n\nPeople can list things for any price they like, but it doesn't mean it will sell for that amount.\n\nWe explain further how you can find out if you have a rare coin worth thousands sitting around the house.", "source":

Existing notes that carry a portrait of Elizabeth will continue to circulate.\n\nHowever, it will take some time before the new notes are commonly seen in people's wallets and purses.

This means the public will begin to see the new King Charles III notes very gradually.\n\nElizabeth was the first monarch to feature on banknotes in 1960, in contrast to coins in England which have carried images of kings and queens for more than 1,000 years.\n\nThe reverse side of Bank of England polymer banknotes are unchanged, featuring Sir Winston Churchill, Jane Austen, JMW Turner and Alan Turing.

The Bank of England will gradually introduce these notes as replacements for damaged ones or in response to increased demand.\n\nAccording to the BBC, King Charles III is only the second monarch to appear on Bank of England notes, following Queen Elizabeth II, who first featured in 1960. Despite the new release, shoppers can still use the existing \u00a35, \u00a310, \u00a320, and \u00a350 notes bearing the late Queen's portrait. The reverse sides of the current polymer notes, which feature Sir Winston Churchill, Jane Austen, JMW Turner, and Alan Turing, remain unchanged. Banknotes issued in Scotland and Northern Ireland continue to feature different images and not the monarch.\n\nThe introduction of King Charles III's image on various items has been gradual. In December 2022, millions of 50p coins with the King's portrait entered circulation. By the end of 2023, new coin designs, including a bee on the pound coin, were introduced. In March 2023, Royal Mail issued the first King Charles stamps as part of a special set, followed by regular first and second-class stamps showing the King without his crown. British passports began to be issued in the name of \"His Majesty\" in July 2023.\n\nPublic buildings, such as town halls and courts, were offered an official portrait of the monarch in January 2024, taken at Windsor Castle. In February 2024, King Charles's preferred design of the Tudor crown was introduced on the gov.uk website and official buildings. Finally, in June 2024, the Bank of England released \u00a35, \u00a310, \u00a320, and \u00a350 banknotes featuring the King's portrait, based on a photograph taken in 2013.

The BOE expects the \u00a35 and \u00a310 polymer notes to last at least five years, while the average lifespan of \u00a320 notes could be in excess of 20 years due to how the public uses them.\n\nGiven their gradual introduction into circulation, the BOE is offering members of the public a temporary service where they will be able to exchange their old notes.\n\nBritons can send up to \u00a3300 in the post and receive new Charles banknotes, a service that will be offered only until June 30. Alternatively, they can exchange up to \u00a3300 of notes at the BOE counter on Threadneedle Street in London until June 11. However, the central bank warned that long waiting times are possible.\n\nThey will also be available from a select group of Post Office branches before being rolled out to others in the coming weeks.\n\nThe BOE said that charity auctions of low-serial numbered notes will be held over the summer.\n\nThe reverse side of the polymer banknotes -- featuring former Prime Minister Winston Churchill, author Jane Austen, painter JMW Turner and World War II codebreaker Alan Turing -- will be unchanged.\n\nBOE Governor Andrew Bailey said it's \"a historic moment, as it's the first time we've changed the sovereign on our notes.\" Queen Elizabeth II was the first monarch depicted on BOE banknotes in 1960.\n\n\"We know that cash is important for many people, and we are committed to providing banknotes for as long as the public demand them,\" Bailey added.\n\nWhile cash is being replaced in everyday transactions by online and card payments, some 4.6 billion BOE notes worth \u00a382 billion remain in circulation. The volume of notes in circulation has leveled off and even declined slightly in recent years.\n\nUK Finance data found that half of all payments in the UK were made using debt cards for the first time in 2022.

The volume of notes in circulation has leveled off and even declined slightly in recent years.\n\nUK Finance data found that half of all payments in the UK were made using debt cards for the first time in 2022.

However, the change poses challenges for vending machine replacements.\n\nThe new 5,000 yen note features Tsuda Umeko: 'We will soon be the faces on the banknotes.'\n\nThe new 1,000 yen note features Kitasato Shibasaburo: 'It's exciting to see a new design after 20 years.'\n\nThe new 10,000 yen note features Shibusawa Eiichi: 'The new notes will be issued starting from the 3rd of next month.'\n\nThe 1,000 yen note honors Kitasato Shibasaburo for his contributions to medical science. The 5,000 yen note commemorates Tsuda Umeko, a pioneer in women's education.

where the same \u00a3300 limit applies for those keen to get their hands on the new design.\n\nFrom June 12 the bank's counter will revert to issuing Queen Elizabeth II notes only.\n\nThe Bank of England says it expects 'high volumes' of customers will want to get their hands on the new-look notes which may lead to longer wait times.\n\nIt is also appealing to anyone with old series bank notes to exchange -

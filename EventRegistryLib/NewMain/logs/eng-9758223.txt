But the timeline has been slipping as leadership has punted plans for votes on legislation funding the Department of Agriculture and financial services amid concerns about riders related to reproductive rights.\n\nLate Tuesday, a planned vote on the bill to fund the Department of Energy was abruptly canceled.\n\nAnd now, Republicans say leaders are planning to start August recess early this week, despite previous plans to hold votes into next week on their outstanding funding legislation.\n\nOne House Republican who spoke to The Hill said that a leadership office told them \"point blank\" that the House will not return for votes next week. Several others said they have heard votes are likely to be canceled, too.\n\nThat would be a change from Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-La.) vow when he first took the gavel that the House wouldn't recess without passing all 12 bills.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) told The Hill on Tuesday that leadership will \"make a formal announcement about next week's schedule by tomorrow.\"\n\nAsked about plans for the House to tackle its outstanding funding bills, Scalise defended the House's work so far, while noting the challenges staunch Democratic opposition and defections on the GOP side pose to party efforts to approve the remaining measures.\n\n\"When you have a situation where the Democrats all vote no on every appropriations bill, you eventually hit a wall because, you know, we have a few of our own members that vote against some of these bills.\"\n\n\"We've passed about 70 percent of all government funding over to the Senate. At some point, it's time for the Senate to start doing their work,\" he said. The Senate has yet to pass any of its funding bills for fiscal 2025.\n\nRepublicans are pushing to get their annual spending bills covering the departments of Energy, Interior and other related programs across the floor this week. If they pass, Republicans will have approved half of their annual government funding plans.\n\nThe bills are much more partisan in nature than those being crafted in the Democratic-led Senate, where a 60-vote threshold is required for most legislation.\n\nHowever, there is much uncertainty about the House Republicans' chances of passing the remaining funding bills. The divisions that derailed the conference's efforts to pass its fiscal 2024 funding plans have made a reemergence.\n\nEarlier this month, a small faction of Republicans tanked the party's attempt to pass a bill to fund the legislative branch.\n\nIn remarks to reporters this week, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), chair of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, said he'd heard some \"pro-life\" concerns over changes to the agriculture funding bill, which Republicans were previously expected to vote on this week.\n\nEarlier this year, Republicans notably left out language in the funding bill that would have limited access to the abortion pill mifepristone, after a similar push helped doom their fiscal 2024 plan following pushback from moderates.\n\nRep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), chair of the subcommittee that crafts the bill, expressed confidence in the measure's chances of passage in comments to The Hill on Monday. He noted the legislation \"decreases funding\" and cited the House's schedule, as Congress prepares for an address by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week, as explanation for the punted vote this week.\n\n\"I think that the major objections that often go for the reason it didn't pass last year have been removed, so I don't see a problem with it,\" Harris, who is a member of the House Freedom Caucus, also said when pressed about the bill not including the mifepristone language.\n\nBut that hasn't stopped others from taking issue with the move.\n\n\"That's one of the issues that I identified,\" Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), another member of the House Freedom Caucus, said when pressed on the matter, as well as his support for other measures.\n\n\"My belief is you got to figure that stuff out, and you got to know in the aggregate what you're trying to accomplish,\" he said. \"So, I think that bill's currently stuck, and then we'll have to kind of see what the deal is.\"\n\nAt the same time, a bill that covers funding for Washington, D.C. -- including emergency planning, security costs and other programs -- is also seeing resistance from some moderates over a party-backed effort to target a Washington, D.C., law aimed at protecting employees' reproductive rights.\n\nThe proposal was among the reasons the party struggled to pass the same funding bill measure last year. And if it stays as is, the bill could lose support from moderates again this time around.\n\n\"Last year, I voted against the bill for a few reasons, including that, and I still continue to oppose that provision,\" Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.) told The Hill on the matter earlier this year. \"If it remains in the bill, I'll vote against the bill again.\"\n\nAn earlier schedule floated by House GOP leadership also aimed for a vote on the annual Justice Department funding bill this week, but pressed on that measure, Cole said \"that's always tough,\" while noting funding for the FBI's headquarters \"has been a big bone of contention.\"\n\nHis comments come months after hard-line conservatives fumed over the inclusion of dollars for a new FBI headquarters tucked into a larger fiscal 2024 government funding package that eventually passed Congress, despite immense backlash from the conference's right flank.\n\nBut that doesn't mean leadership isn't facing some pressure to move forward trying to pass the measures.\n\nRep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) said leadership ought to \"hash\" out agreement on the remaining funding bills in \"as much time as it takes to get hashed out,\" while speculating leadership is punting votes on some of the outstanding bills because they lack sufficient support.\n\n\"But that's not how you do in the business arena. If you've got a problem, you face it,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aris_folley@thehill.com", "name": "Aris Folley",

Tom Cole (R-Okla.), chair of the powerful House Appropriations Committee that crafts the annual funding bills, cited lawmakers' tight schedule this week when asked about the scrapped plans.\n\n\"Apparently, there's other stuff coming on the floor,\" he said Monday afternoon. \"I mean, there's going to be a bipartisan bill on a commission to look at the attempted assassination of President Trump.\"\n\n\"But yeah, we'll see what happens. We're still moving. We've still got four across the floor. If these happen, we'll get six,\" he said, while noting the House is still \"well ahead of the Senate.\"\n\nHowever, he and other Republicans acknowledge other concerns that could pose hurdles for the party as it works to get its remaining partisan funding bills across the finish line.\n\nSo far, the House has passed four of their 12 funding bills, and members have been optimistic about them approving the remaining funding bills by the time Congress heads home for their August recess.\n\nBut members were caught off guard earlier this month when they saw their annual legislative branch funding bill fail on the floor, after a group of conservatives defected amid concerns over spending levels and other issues.\n\nDiscussing the funding bills coming down the pike this week, Cole noted some worries from members about the funding levels in the fiscal 2025 energy and water funding bill, arguing: \"That's all additional money, honestly, for the nuclear triad, and it makes a lot of sense.\"\n\n\"I think they're good bills, are very solid, but we'll see,\" he said. \"I mean, it didn't take much to lose the [legislative] branch bill and, you know, five, six, seven members go south on you, you're in trouble.\"\n\nHis comments underscore the challenges leadership face in pushing all 12 funding bills across the floor with a tight majority, particularly as partisan policy riders in areas like abortion and lower spending levels than those pursued in the Senate turn off most Democrats from supporting the legislation.\n\nSome Republicans have also been tempering expectations about other funding bills on the horizon, including measures to fund the FBI, as members acknowledge intraparty rifts on spending and policy that derailed efforts to pass similar legislation last year continue to persist.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aris_folley@thehill.com", "name": "Aris Folley", "type": "author", "isAgency":

The House is scheduled to return in early September.\n\nLeaders have partly pointed to the next week's funeral for Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) to explain the schedule change, but the canceled votes also come as the party has seen challenges in getting several of its remaining funding bills across the finish line this month.\n\nRepublicans had previously been hopeful of passing all 12 annual funding plans by next week. But the ambitious timeline began to quickly slip this week as leadership punted votes for multiple bills amid concerns about spending levels and riders related to reproductive rights.\n\n\"When you have a situation where the Democrats all vote no on every appropriations bill, you eventually hit a wall because, you know, we have a few of our own members that vote against some of these bills,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.) told The Hill this week when pressed about the path forward for outstanding funding bills.\n\n\"We've passed about 70 percent of all government funding over to the Senate. At some point, it's time for the Senate to start doing their work,\" he said.\n\nHis comments came just hours before the House canceled plans for a vote on the bill to fund the Department of Energy later Tuesday evening amid concerns from some members about the price tag.\n\n\"I'm kind of undecided on the [energy and water bill] because it increases spending,\" Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said when asked about his position on the measure ahead of the planned vote. \"So, I gotta kind of look at that in the context of the whole package.\"\n\nAt the same time, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) also expressed concerns about money being short in one area in remarks to The Hill.\n\n\"I wanted to see more funding there for the port in Savannah, Georgia,\" she said. \"This is the third largest port in the country, extremely important to our critical infrastructure, as well as shipping for supplies for Americans.\"\n\n\"That port, we need to dig it eight feet deeper for big ships to be able to easily move in and out without relying on the tide, and I was disappointed there's not enough money in there for them to do that,\" she said.\n\nThere is also uncertainty as to how the annual Department of Interior funding plan will fare ahead of a planned vote later on Wednesday, with conservatives like Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) saying they're also undecided about the bill for not going far enough to curb spending.\n\nThe House has so far passed four of its annual funding plans, while the Senate has yet to pass any funding bills for fiscal year 2025.\n\nHowever, the House bills are much more partisan in nature than those being crafted in the Democratic-led Senate, where a 60-vote threshold is required for most legislation. That means that while Republicans can pass the bills in the House with a simple majority, the measures test the limits of the party's tight margin as Democrats have out in strong opposition against the legislation.\n\n\"I've got concerns about all of them right now,\" Rep. Steve Womack (R-Ark.), a spending cardinal, told The Hill this week when discussing the outstanding funding legislation. \"We're struggling to get it passed.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aris_folley@thehill.com", "name": "Aris Folley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheila_Jackson_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheila Jackson Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_Roy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chip Roy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriations_bill_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Appropriations bill (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Scalise", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Scalise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Womack", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Womack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Interior", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Interior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Majority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Norman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Norman"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer Management", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/scalisesteve_062624jg01_w.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758223", "eventUri": "eng-9758223", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Drew Ferguson of Georgia told CNN, referencing such a stopgap measure known as a continuing resolution, or CR.\n\nRep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, argues it's the only option.\n\n\"In September, they'll be a continuing resolution,\" DeLauro told CNN.\n\nLost in the shuffle of a historic news cycle is the House GOP's face plant on a series of spending bill over the last few weeks that leaves them in a very similar posture to last summer when then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy struggled to pass even GOP-authored spending bills because of divisions within his ranks.\n\nAppropriations Chairman Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican who has worked to get all the bills out of his committee, told reporters Wednesday that he has been saying from the beginning the most likely outcome in September was always destined to be a stopgap measure.\n\n\"I expected a CR,\" he said.\n\n\"We'd get as far down the process as we could go. We'll see what the Senate can do,\" Cole said. \"We are where we're at. They'll be a CR.\"\n\nThis week alone, GOP leaders had to pull down two votes on spending bills from the schedule: financial services and agriculture. Then, on Tuesday night, as they attempted to pass a funding bill for energy and water, leaders had to pull the bill at the last minute because the votes weren't expected to be there. This comes after a bill to fund the US Legislative Branch failed earlier this month and as leadership announced to members Wednesday morning they will go home early, meaning they won't consider the remaining bills: Commerce Justice and Science, Labor, Health and Human Services or Housing before the August recess.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson downplayed the decision about sending members home earlier being a sign they'd reached a stalemate in their spending process.\n\n\"It's not related to that,\" Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, told reporters. \"We've had a tumultuous couple of weeks in American politics, and everybody is, to be honest, still tired from our convention, and it's just a good time to give everybody time to go home to their districts and campaign a little bit. We'll come back and regroup.\"\n\nHe said that no decisions have been made about a stopgap spending bill.\n\nWhen they return, House lawmakers will have just a matter of weeks to act and, by then, focus will have to turn to making sure the government is funded with little time for Republicans to continue pursuing partisan bills, especially if they know the votes aren't there anyway.\n\nThe next fight conservatives are gearing up for is a push for how long that short-term spending bill goes. Some want to avoid a holiday crunch and are hoping to push the deadline for another spending bill to the spring.\n\n\"I'm advocating for a CR that takes us into March,\" GOP Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, a member of the House Freedom Caucus told CNN. \"So we don't get jammed with a terrible (omnibus spending package), lame duck thing ... it doesn't matter if Trump wins or loses, we don't want an omni jammed down our throats right before Christmas.\"\n\nCole argued that it will be up to the winner of the November presidential election to decide if they want to kick the can down the road for spending bill deadline, or have it dealt with in the lame duck so the decks are cleared when they come into office.\n\n\"I would do it into November and get the deal done,\" Cole said. \"That would be my advice to whoever wins, but again, I recognize I don't make that call, the incoming President will make that call.\"\n\nThe Senate for its part has not passed any of the 2025 appropriations bills on the floor. They have passed three in committee unanimously with bipartisan support, however.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news",

That means lawmakers will go home to their districts for six weeks before returning on Sept. 9, when they'll have just three weeks to pass some sort of spending bill to keep the government open before fiscal 2024 ends.\n\nThe decision comes after the House has struggled to pass its remaining appropriations bills despite unveiling an ambitious schedule earlier this year that sought to advance all 12 by the end of July.\n\nHowever, lawmakers have only managed to pass four so far, with the others either failing on the floor or being pulled from consideration because of a lack of support from House Republicans.\n\nThe House will continue voting on amendments and two of its spending bills funding the departments of Interior and Energy before adjourning Thursday. That schedule has left some lawmakers upset with the lack of progress, especially as it becomes increasingly likely Congress will drop plans to pass a budget and will instead punt the deadline until past the November election.\n\n\"[We're] trying to pass 12 separate Republican appropriation bills, that the Democrat-controlled Senate will NEVER vote on.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) said in a post on X. \"When the reality that we ALL know is that we will be forced to vote on a CR by Sept 30th which is the government funding deadline.

Those policies, such as a ban on mail-delivery abortion pills and cuts to Democrats' signature climate bill, have split GOP lawmakers, particularly those seeking reelection in competitive districts.\n\nEven if the House did manage to pass all of its appropriations bills before the annual recess, it's not clear whether the Senate would have acted with such haste. The Senate has yet to pass any of its spending bills as Democratic leaders and the White House have indicated they would delay the process until after the November election when it's more clear who will be president in 2025 and which party will be in control of the upper chamber.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cami_mondeaux@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Cami Mondeaux", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriations_bill_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Appropriations bill (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation_bill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Appropriation bill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upper house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mike-johnson-close-up.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9758223", "eventUri": "eng-9758223", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-09", "textStart": 466, "textEnd": 473}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-30", "textStart": 1651, "textEnd": 1660}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 1846, "textEnd": 1852}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The last votes are now scheduled to occur tomorrow, after which lawmakers will adjourn for a six-week break.\n\nThe House will not return until September 9, just three weeks before the end of the fiscal year. The failure of the House to pass the full suite of 12 spending bills for fiscal year 2025, along with the Senate's failure to pass any of them, all but guarantees that Congress will need to provide some kind of short-term funding at the start of the new fiscal year on October 1, or face a government shutdown.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said earlier this year that he'd like to pass as many of the 12 appropriations bills as possible by August 1, sending them to the Senate before the long summer recess begins. But the House GOP pulled the plug on that ambitious timeline after internal disagreements led to failed and canceled votes. A planned vote to fund the Department of Energy was canceled late Tuesday, though it could get a last-minute vote on Thursday, along with a bill funding the Interior Department.\n\nFamiliar problems: The Republican efforts to pass the 12 spending bills hit some familiar speed bumps. Right-wing lawmakers insisted on adding culture war amendments to some of the bills, touching on issues such as abortion, gender status and climate change, weakening support from moderates while guaranteeing the bills would fail should they make it to the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nSome Republicans questioned the wisdom of their leadership's approach. \"Trying to pass 12 separate Republican appropriation bills, that the Democrat controlled Senate will NEVER vote on.

But with no breakthrough on controversial appropriations measures in sight, leadership may be making the dreams of some lawmakers and aides come true with an extra week of August recess.\n\nThe House is set to take up two spending bills this week: Energy-Water and Interior-Environment. The Rules Committee is meeting Monday afternoon to consider which amendments members will be allowed to offer. If the House can pass those two, it will have passed half of the dozen annual appropriations bills, worth nearly 75 percent of next year's total $1.6 trillion funding allotment.\n\nBut the remaining six bills -- Agriculture, Commerce-Justice-Science, Financial Services, Legislative Branch, Labor-HHS-Education and Transportation-HUD -- all have provisions that make them difficult to pass. Republicans were already unsuccessful in their attempt to pass the Legislative Branch bill earlier this month.\n\nThe Agriculture and Financial Services bills were set to hit the floor this week. But conservative concerns that the Agriculture spending levels were too high and moderate worries over an abortion-related provision in the Financial Services bill muddied the chances of passage of those two bills.\n\nA busy schedule this week also played a role in those two bills getting punted. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to address a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday, and Biden administration officials will be appearing at a series of security-related hearings following the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump. The House is out on Friday.\n\nAn extra week of recess will also allow members more time to campaign after the major shake-up in the presidential race, with President Joe Biden announcing Sunday that he will no longer seek reelection.

The latest WRDA update bill, which passed the House on Monday, would change that, but that measure still has a ways to go before reaching the president's desk.\n\n\"For some, they felt they wanted some things on the water side that they didn't get and we're going to take a look at those things. Some of the things under law we could not get. We could not authorize on an appropriations bill,\" Fleischmann said. \"But we're going to have a good, furtive conversation and give it another shot in September.\"\n\nRepublicans were still hoping to pass their Interior-Environment bill Wednesday night after considering amendments earlier in the day. But it was also possible they will forgo a final vote on the bill so as not to risk another defeat.\n\nHouse Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., said the Interior-Environment vote was \"too close to call\" at the moment, but he's not ruling out passage later on Wednesday evening. \"We wouldn't be proceeding today if they didn't think they were in the ballpark,\" Cole said.\n\nThe House two weeks ago voted down its Legislative Branch bill, mostly because of a provision blocking a pay raise for members.\n\nWhile the House has passed four of its 12 annual spending bills, totaling more than two-thirds of annual agency budgets, other GOP-written measures increasingly appear out of reach. Democrats oppose the deep cuts to nondefense spending and conservative policy riders included in the bills, and just a few GOP defections can be enough to sink a bill on the floor, given the slim majority.\n\nDwindling agenda\n\nThe only two remaining legislative items on the docket this month include a bipartisan resolution to establish a task force to investigate the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, and a more partisan one attacking the border enforcement record of Vice President Kamala Harris, the expected Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nIt appears House GOP leaders want to send members home to campaign Thursday after the Harris resolution vote -- something that unites the party -- rather than continue to suffer through divisive spending bill debates.\n\nGOP leaders all week had been mulling the possibility of sending members home early rather than remain in session next week as previously scheduled. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Wednesday that the decision to cancel votes next week wasn't a direct result of problems with the appropriations bills.\n\n\"It's not related to that. We've had a tumultuous couple of weeks in American politics and everybody's, to be honest, still tired from our convention, and it's just a good time to give everybody time to go home to their districts and campaign a little bit. We'll come back and regroup and continue to work on this.\"\n\nJohnson also said funeral arrangements for Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, who died last weekend after a battle with pancreatic cancer, would pose logistical challenges next week. Johnson said a lot of members would want to attend the events, to be held in Houston, which could keep members away from Washington for three days.\n\nThe outlook is similarly grim come September, the focus will shift to passing a stopgap funding measure to avoid a partial government shutdown when the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1. Cole also said a supplemental disaster relief package would be on the September docket. \"There are discussions going on,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "m.arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

This defeat comes after their Legislative Branch funding bill failed on the House Floor and House Republican leadership scrapped plans to complete all 12 funding bills before August.\n\nThe breakdown of the appropriations process is not due to competing priorities or running out of time. It is a direct result of Republicans being unable to pass their extreme bills that harm American families. Here are examples of the many shortcomings in the bills that do not have sufficient support to be put up for a vote on the House floor:\n\nThe House was scheduled to consider every one of these bills in July, but instead of debating their extreme, partisan bills on the House floor and putting them up for a vote, Republicans chose to leave Washington early. Not only did Republicans adjourn without voting on the Energy and Water Development bill, but they left town a week early after Members of Congress submitted 860 amendments to the five bills that will never be debated on the House floor for a single minute.\n\nWhen Congress reconvenes in September, it is time for Republicans to join Democrats to quickly adopt bipartisan spending bills continuing vital government operations, helping communities affected by disasters, and ensuring veterans continue to receive the benefits they earned.\n\n\"This week, the Republican Majority failed to even hold a vote on their shortsighted partisan Energy and Water bill, which was dead upon arrival on the House Floor. The bill would have cut vital energy and climate programs, shortchanged the Department of Energy, and pushed our nation backwards. This doomed legislation failed to meet the moment at a time when we need to modernize our nation's electrical grid, advance innovation to counter economic warfare waged by our global adversaries, and strengthen our domestic supply chains which proved to be a vital need throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We need to deliver more jobs in the new energy economy -- not less,\" said Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee Ranking Member Marcy Kaptur (OH-09). \"The devastating cuts to nuclear nonproliferation programs that reduce nuclear risks would have made all Americans and people around the world less safe. The controversial poison pill policy riders put into this toxic bill by extremists weighed it down heavily. We need real bipartisan compromise for an Energy and Water funding bill to become law. America can do better, and we must do better, as our future greatly relies on advancements and investments in energy and water development. I am sad we could not hold a vote on legislation that meets this moment, but hold out hope that a bipartisan proposal will come forward before funding expires this fall.\"\n\nCongresswoman Kaptur's full remarks as prepared for delivery are here.\n\n\"House Republicans are unable and unwilling to govern. House Democrats are at the table ready to negotiate. The quicker House Republicans realize their extremist agenda cannot become law, the quicker we can get down to the business of the American people,\" said Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro (CT-03). \"This year should have been easier than last. We began the 2025 process -- weeks after successfully passing the final 2024 bills -- with a topline in place, yet Republicans reneged on it. They wrote partisan bills to further their Trump MAGA Project 2025 Agenda instead of working with Democrats to pass bills that could become law. At every turn, the Republicans are making abortion illegal, eliminating federal support for public education, undermining workers, and disarming America in the face of the climate crisis. Their policies make communities less safe and threaten national security. The majority knows their vote margins. They knew these bills could never pass because House Democrats will not support funding bills that harm children, working families, seniors, and veterans. This charade to appease Republican extremists must end. It is time for Republicans to govern.\"\n\nCongresswoman DeLauro's full remarks here and here.\n\n\"The Republican-led 118th Congress will go down in history as one of the most dysfunctional, unaccomplished Congressional sessions our nation has ever seen. House Republicans have proven time and again that they are the party of extremism and chaos, refusing to work with Democrats to pass bipartisan legislation,\" said Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee Ranking Member Chellie Pingree (ME-01). \"Their Interior Appropriations bill is just the latest example. The drastic cuts they proposed -- including cutting funding for the Environmental Protection Agency by a staggering 20 percent -- are irresponsible and severely impact necessary investments to fight climate change and protect our communities. Having just spent hours on the floor defending the scientific fact that climate change is real and endangers the lives and livelihoods of Americans across the country, it's clear to me that even these proposed cuts do not go far enough for some Members. It's my hope that we can ultimately pass a bipartisan bill that rejects these ridiculous cuts and takes the threat of climate change seriously. Our children, our grandchildren, and our planet depend on it.\"\n\nCongresswoman Pingree's full remarks as prepared for delivery are here.\n\nAdditional information on the 12 fiscal year 2025

Democrats have come out in staunch opposition to the measure over proposed cuts to the EPA and other areas like the National Park Service, the Smithsonian and National Gallery of Art.\n\nThe bill's narrow passage comes as House Republicans' ambitious hopes of passing all 12 annual government funding bills by the August recess have crumbled. House leadership canceled votes on three other funding bills this week, including yanking one off the floor at the last minute Tuesday night, and announced Wednesday they would begin their annual summer recess a week early.\n\nThe bill faces tough odds in the Democratic-led Senate in its current form. But it helps provide a starting place for Republicans ahead of eventual funding negotiations with the upper chamber.\n\nIn remarks from the House floor this week, Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), head of the subcommittee that crafted the bill, acknowledged that \"cutting funding is never easy, but with the national debt totaling nearly $35 trillion and inflation at an unacceptable level, we had to make tough choices in this bill to rein in unnecessary discretionary spending.\"\n\n\"This legislation prioritizes critical needs and addresses specific interests and concerns brought to our attention through more than 8,800 Member requests,\" he said, while also noting that the bill \"takes critical steps to reduce regulatory burdens imposed by the EPA and promote domestic energy production.\"\n\nHe also defended the bill as a measure that \"permanently fixes wildland firefighter pay, helps manage our public lands wisely, upholds our commitments to Indian country, and restores the fiscal responsibility necessary to get our economy back on track.\"\n\nThe bill's funding levels called for an overall decrease compared to current spending levels, with a GOP summary outlining a 20 percent cut to EPA funding, cuts upwards of 8 percent for the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, while also eliminating funding for the Presidio Trust and slashing dollars for the Council on Environmental Quality.\n\nAt the same time, Republicans have pointed to funding boosts for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Wildland Fire Management and the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund.\n\nDemocrats sharply criticized the proposed cuts and argued the bill inadequately addresses climate change.\n\n\"Climate change is a clear and present danger, and experts agree that we must take bold action to avoid major, irreversible catastrophe,\" Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), top Democrat on Simpson's subcommittee, said on the floor this week. \"So, I am greatly disappointed and frustrated by the bill before us that completely disregards the reality of a warming planet and ignores the need for us to do more, not less.\"\n\n\"This bill abandons our most vulnerable groups that currently bear a disproportionate share of negative environmental impacts, which includes large swaths of rural communities that I, and many of my colleagues across the aisle, represent,\" she added.\n\nShe also pointed to what she and Democrats have described as \"poison pill\" riders in the bill, as Republicans have pursued a list of partisan provisions to lock down support in the conference across their 12 funding bills -

The measure, which passed 210 to 205, would impose a 20% cut to the EPA and includes several conservative provisions that are likely to doom it in the Senate.\n\nThe fiscal 2025 spending bill proposes $38.5 billion in discretionary funding, $72 million below fiscal 2024 funding levels, and includes steep cuts to various agencies. The measure would roll back a number of Biden administration regulatory efforts, such as the Department of Energy's fuel economy standards and its rules curtailing emissions from power plants, as well as an EPA rule regulating industry emissions that affect downwind states.\n\n\"With good stewardship as our compass, the FY25 Interior bill ensures every resource is used wisely and effectively,\" Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK), the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said.\n\nThe funding measure will be stalled in the Democratic-controlled Senate. The White House issued a veto threat earlier this week.\n\n\"The Administration strongly opposes the nearly 100 harmful policy provisions in the bill that interfere with DOI's scientific and evidence-based decision-making,\" the White House wrote of the Interior bill. \"Among other negative impacts, these provisions would slow the Nation's progress in growing the clean energy economy by restricting or modifying DOI's energy and mineral development programs, and overturn science-based rulemakings that protect public lands and help to prevent numerous species from extinction.\"\n\nNotably, the bill cuts $464 million from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education, and Bureau of Trust Fund Administration. The bill also cuts $210 million from the National Park Service, along with millions in cuts across other offices.\n\nA notable rider in the measure would require an issuance of a new five-year offshore oil and gas lease plan, following criticism that the Biden administration's plan would offer the lowest number of offshore lease sales in history.\n\nThe measure also has a number of riders that are not related to energy or the environment, such as prohibiting funds for diversity and equity efforts.\n\nHouse Republicans had also scheduled a separate vote on a measure funding the Energy Department and water development. But that bill was pulled from the voting schedule after Republican leadership hesitated to force members from competitive districts to vote on controversial amendments for a bill that will never pass into law, Politico reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nMembers offered nearly 200 amendments to the bill for consideration. One that was approved was a measure from Rep. Rich McCormick (R-GA) that would reduce funding for the EPA's Environmental Programs and Management account by $7 million and reallocate the funds to the inspector general's office. Another rider, offered by Rep. Harriet Hageman (R-WY), would prevent the Bureau of Land Management from finalizing and implementing a plan to expand the rollout of solar in Western states.\n\nThe House has passed four appropriation bills, but it's unlikely that more will pass before the August recess. A bill funding the legislative branch, a measure that's long been considered easier to pass, failed earlier this month over disagreements regarding member pay and higher spending.

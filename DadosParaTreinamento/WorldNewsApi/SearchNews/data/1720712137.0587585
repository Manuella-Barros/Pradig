{"id": 231946348, "title": "Calls for sustainable fishing must include Asia to be truly effective", "text": "Among numerous stark markers of the Anthropocene era, in which humans are radically reshaping the Earth, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) declared a significant new milestone last week. For the first time in history, more of the fish we consume came from aquaculture than from wild capture in the open oceans. The FAO\u2019s 2024 State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture Report revealed that of the 185.4 million tonnes of aquatic animal production worldwide in 2022, 94 million tonnes was from aquaculture and 91 million tonnes was accounted for by wild catch. The report reminded us of a rarely recognised reality: as the world population has surged and per capita fish consumption has risen \u2013 doubling from 9.1kg per capita in 1961 to 20.7kg in 2022 \u2013 it is only because of the astonishing emergence of aquaculture that we have managed to keep pace with demand. Wild capture surged from about 20 million tonnes a year in 1950 to nearly 83 million tonnes in 1990, but as more of the world\u2019s fisheries have come under stress from overfishing, it has more or less flatlined since. In the same time frame, aquaculture \u2013 including aquatic animals and algae has increased from about 18 million tonnes in 1990 to around 132 million tonnes in 2022. And, as the FAO report predicted, our reliance on aquaculture will continue to grow, with a 10 per cent rise in aquatic consumption by 2032 to around 205 million tonnes. If we are to meet global demand in 2050, when the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, production must rise 22 per cent. This hectic growth makes fisheries one of the most important contributors to the global economy. It accounts for more than 60 million jobs worldwide, with an output value amounting to more than US $470 billion and global trade valued at about US$195 billion. Perhaps predictably, the report\u2019s predictions raised alarms among hundreds of global environmental advocacy groups. Most notable was an open letter to Manuel Barange, the FAO\u2019s assistant director general for fisheries and aquaculture, from 160 experts and civil society groups, including leaders from the Global Salmon Fishing Resistance, Katheti and Don\u2019t Cage Our Oceans. Noting the FAO\u2019s call for a 75 per cent growth in sustainable aquaculture by 2040 compared to 2020 levels, the authors said they were \u201cdeeply concerned about how [the FAO plans] to achieve it\u201d. Acknowledging the FAO\u2019s efforts to tackle the negative environmental impacts of aquaculture through its Blue Transformation in Action sustainability road map, it focused in particular on the need to remove \u201ccarnivorous fin fish\u201d such as salmon, shrimp, sea bass, sea bream and tuna from its \u201csustainable aquaculture\u201d list. Barange admitted that 20 per cent of the world\u2019s wild catch was used to feed farmed fish. Financial Times research recently identified the Norwegian company Mowi to be the world\u2019s biggest salmon producer, as well as a supplier to big supermarket groups like Tesco, Aldi and Lidl. The letter identifies other areas of significant damage such as algal blooms, damage to posidonia \u2013 also known as seagrass meadows, fish die-offs, the use of the carcinogen formaldehyde to tackle fungal problems for farmed fish, microplastics and antibiotic use. \u201cThe bottom line is that, in our current world, there is no farming of carnivorous fin fish which is environmentally sustainable\u201d, they said, calling for \u201cconcrete, enforceable international standards for the remediation of damaged environments, and the expansion of genuinely sustainable aquacultural options\u201d. The open letter makes some good points. However, any honest effort must emphasise that the Asia-Pacific region accounts for most of the world\u2019s aquaculture. China alone accounts for 36 per cent of aquaculture production, and Indonesia, India and Vietnam for another 20 per cent. China is by far the world\u2019s largest producer, exporter and processor of aquatic life \u2013 whether it is from the ocean, inland fisheries, aquaculture, or even marine life such as molluscs and seaweed. The Chinese word for seaweed can be translated as \u201csea vegetables\u201d. What some in the West have historically regarded as a weed, many in China have long seen as an important source of nutrition. The FAO says that, of 4.1 million fishing vessels worldwide, China is home to 564,000, the largest fleet in the world by far, even though it has halved from more than 1 million boats in 2013. It is also noteworthy that, in 2019, China accounted for about 21 per cent of global fisheries subsidies \u2013 providing US$7.2 billion\u2019s worth. These kind of subsidies play such a large role in sustaining unsustainable fishing practices. Quite how this open letter can expect any traction when it does not pay explicit attention to the Asia-Pacific region creates a troubling conundrum. In practical terms, the environmentalists\u2019 cannons are turned to regions of the world that are playing a negligible role in the problems they describe. Only if the problems are tackled across Asia \u2013 and specifically in China, India and Indonesia \u2013 are we likely to see material progress towards sustainable aquaculture. The FAO, through its Blue Transformation in Action sustainability road map, seems to be forming an intelligible plan. In contrast, the well-meaning environmental lobbies seem to be pointing their guns in an ineffectual direction, and will need to gather allies in the Asia-Pacific region if they are to make a meaningful contribution.

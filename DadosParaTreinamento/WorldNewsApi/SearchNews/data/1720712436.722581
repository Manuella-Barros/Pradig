Then one day, something strange occurred. \u201cI heard a voice in my ear, as if someone was leaning over, saying\u201d \u2013 here, she breaks into a whisper \u2013 \u201care you afraid of me?\u201d Yes, said Aitken, out loud. \u201cThen I got the sense of her walking around and standing in front of me. She was almost like a child. And she [said], \u2018I\u2019m afraid of me too\u2019.\u201d Okay, thought Aitken. I think I understand you now. \u201cAnd that was my key. That\u2019s not how I usually write. That\u2019s not an experience I would usually have. But I felt like, because she was a person who lived, I wanted to make sure that she would want this story written by me.\u201d Set in medieval Kilkenny, Bright I Burn is a fictional reimagining of the life of Alice Kyteler, the first recorded person in Ireland to be condemned as a witch. Beginning in Alice\u2019s childhood, the novel depicts the life of a fierce and ambitious woman \u2013 a banker, a mother, a wife many times over \u2013 whose notorious reputation becomes a dangerous force. Aitken says it was an Irish Times article that first sparked the idea for the book. She had been thinking about the history of witch burnings in Perth, Scotland, where she lived until she was eight (Aitken\u2019s father is Scottish, her mother Irish). At the same time, she was interested in \u201cIrish women and the stories we hadn\u2019t really heard\u201d. She googled Irish witches, and came across an article by Jennifer O\u2019Connell. Witchipedia. It listed \u201cIreland\u2019s reputed witches\u201d, including one Alice Kyteler. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get her out of my mind. In some ways, it felt a little bit like a haunting ... In my first book, I loved the narrator, and I loved hearing her voice. This was a much more uncomfortable experience.\u201d [ Witchipedia: Ireland\u2019s most famous witches ] The book vividly recreates medieval Ireland, its challenges and customs, its increasingly influential clergy, its gossiping townspeople. There\u2019s an ever-encroaching sense of death and violence, whether in the harsh natural world or the brutal world of men. Amid this, Alice is a driven and often ruthless woman. \u201cGiven some of the morally suspect things that she does, I was just fascinated,\u201d says Aitken. \u201cWhy would a woman do this? What was her motivation? How did she feel about it? It\u2019s quite interesting writing about someone where you know all the facts about what happened, but not the why. So, you still have that thing of getting into their head and figuring that out.\u201d Along with Alice Kyteler, the novel brings to life several other figures from 13th- and 14th-century Ireland, including Petronilla de Meath, Alice\u2019s young maidservant, accused of being her accomplice. References to these women recur in writings and artwork throughout the ages, for example \u201cLady Kyteler\u201d features in Yeats\u2019s poem Nineteen Hundred and Nineteen, while Petronilla de Meath is one of the 39 mythical and historical women in Judy Chicago\u2019s 1970s feminist art installation, The Dinner Party. One of the most damaging accounts of what happened was authored by Bishop Richard Ledrede, who brought forward the trial against Alice. \u201cHis account, I feel, is extremely sexist and misogynistic,\u201d says Aitken. \u201cFrom my reading of it, he really got off on torture and had weird sexual complexes about women. [I think] he had a real problem with who [Alice] was, being such a powerful woman in a time and place where he wanted to be powerful and influential. I feel the narrative we have around her is based on his perception and his lens.\u201d Through Aitken\u2019s lens, the narrative is about \u201ca woman\u2019s rage\u201d. \u201cWomen\u2019s rage is something that\u2019s still not really accepted,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is changing, but not fast enough. I wanted to write a book that really celebrated and sought to understand the rage of a woman. Alice Kyteler\u2019s rage, and her ambition, was a big part of why she was vilified. I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve come as far as we\u2019d like to think in allowing women to express all emotions or to be visibly ambitious. Medieval Ireland is not really so distant [in this sense].\u201d The book also leans into Alice\u2019s mercenary nature. She is a shrewd banker who will resort to any means to protect her wealth. I would be breastfeeding and also writing with one hand. I think that affected the writing itself. The chapters are quite short. Some people have described it as sort of feverish, and I\u2019m like: \u2018I wasn\u2019t sleeping.\u2019 \u201cI just loved the idea that she was obsessed with money. I feel like we don\u2019t read about women like that, who are just quite greedy. I feel that was quite a positive thing about her, actually. I think maybe we feel like you shouldn\u2019t want money. But at the time, it meant freedom and being able to relax and enjoy your life instead of dying at age 16.\u201d I meet Aitken over coffee in a Dublin hotel. She\u2019s on a flying visit from Sheffield, where she lives with her husband and young son. When I arrive, she\u2019s sitting reading Claire Keegan\u2019s Small Things Like These. She wears vintage clothes, including a green velvet jacket she bought as a present to herself when she published her first novel, The Island Child (Canongate, 2020). Later, she\u2019ll head to west Cork for a friend\u2019s wedding \u2013 Ballydehob is where she spent most of her young life. But home is not a straightforward topic for Aitken. She was born in Scotland, moved to Ireland when she was eight, spent some time in Kildare, before moving to the rebel county around the time she started secondary school. She was educated through the Steiner system (which has a strong focus on storytelling), then studied English and Classics in Galway, before completing an MFA in creative writing in Bath Spa. \u201cI\u2019ve always had a bit of a complicated relationship with my identity as an Irish person,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I come home, I don\u2019t fully feel I fit in, but I really don\u2019t fit in Scotland, which is where my dad is from and where I was born. Perhaps that\u2019s the curse of a lot of artists. We don\u2019t feel we fit anywhere, really.\u201d Both of Aitken\u2019s books to date have been set in Ireland. The Island Child, a folkloric tale set on a fictional island off the west coast, was longlisted for the Authors Club First Novel Award. It was written during Aitken\u2019s MFA, and an early draft won her representation from the literary agency Janklow and Nesbit. The following year was spent shaping and editing the manuscript, while also working in advertising. Soon after, she landed a book deal. All fairly plain sailing by publishing standards. But with Bright I Burn, it was another story. \u201cWhat happened was, I wrote a second novel, which I sent to my editor, and she was like: \u2018Great. It\u2019s too different from your first.\u2019\u201d Aitken had written a contemporary retelling of Cupid and Psyche, but it didn\u2019t fit with the brand she had begun to build as an author. \u201cWe had a conversation. We were like: \u2018We could do it.\u2019 But it being so early on, and because my first book came out in such a weird time [during lockdown], we decided I should keep on a similar track.\u201d It must have been a big blow, to have to start again after all that work. \u201cI had a week where I was, like, devastated,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m a person who, I understand the industry, how it works. We love books, but we\u2019re also here to make money. I don\u2019t know if people talk about that much, but it is what it is.\u201d At the time, Aitken was expecting her son, Orion. We need to find different ways of giving voices to people in the past who weren\u2019t able to write things down, or the writing was destroyed \u201cI was quite pregnant. I was like: \u2018I\u2019m not going to be able to write a whole other novel before I have this baby.\u2019\u201d In the end, much of Bright I Burn was written after her son was born. \u201cI would be breastfeeding and also writing with one hand. I think that affected the writing itself. The chapters are quite short. Some people have described it as sort of feverish, and I\u2019m like: \u2018I wasn\u2019t sleeping.\u2019 ... But I think motherhood is something I\u2019m always drawn to in my writing. Almost every short story I write, and my first novel, were all about motherhood.\u201d Aitken\u2019s own mother is an artist. Her creative life, and her way of seeing the world, have impacted Aitken\u2019s practice. \u201cShe notices the beauty in everything, and I think I bring that to my writing. My mother is also keenly aware of colour. In my novels and short stories, I often use a single colour over and over. Bright I Burn is red. The Island Child was blue. The one I\u2019m currently working on is yellow. It\u2019s an odd thing to do, I know, but it helps me have a focus when writing can take you in wild directions.\u201d This new novel explores the story of Romulus and Remus\u2019s mother. Aitken is working on it as part of her PhD at Sheffield Hallam University. Her focus is creative approaches to writing history. \u201cThe way that history is written is very, I would say, old school,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat we have in the archive is mostly written from male perspectives, and often richer male perspectives. It often means that history is very one note, and it gives us a kind of skewed impression. I\u2019m arguing that we need to find different ways of giving voices to people in the past who weren\u2019t able to write things down, or the writing was destroyed. Creative writing is a way of revoicing the past.\u201d Bright I Burn by Molly Aitken is published by Canongate", "summary": "Molly Aitken\u2019s Bright I Burn tells the story of the fierce and ambitious Alice Kyteler, and how \u2018creative writing is a way of revoicing the past\u2019", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/2024/06/08/womens-rage-is-something-thats-still-not-really-accepted/", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/q14vtAOFoOje7jikwA8-uLs3ccM=/1600x900/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/V3XCDQPWJZC3LIAJBGQLABVOOQ.JPG", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:34:34", "author": "Niamh Donnelly", "authors": ["Niamh Donnelly"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.114}

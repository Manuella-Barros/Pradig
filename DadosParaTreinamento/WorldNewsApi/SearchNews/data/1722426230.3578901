{"id": 243312938, "title": "The brutal killing of a Detroit man in 1982 inspires decades of Asian American activism nationwide", "text": "Two white autoworkers bludgeoned 27-year-old Chinese American Vincent Chin to death with a baseball bat during his bachelor party in Detroit in 1982, but his loved ones\u2019 cries for justice fell on deaf ears. Twelve days passed before any media outlets reported Chin\u2019s killing by men who blamed Asian manufacturers for the downfall of the city\u2019s mainstay auto industry, and none acknowledged the racism in his killing at the time. The defendants pleaded guilty to manslaughter and were sentenced to three years\u2019 probation. Circuit Judge Charles Kaufman reasoned, \u201cThese aren\u2019t the kind of men you send to jail.\u201d The injustice spurred Asian Americans to unite across ethnic and cultural lines. Hundreds protested the trial\u2019s outcome in downtown Detroit. Chin\u2019s mother traveled the country sharing his story and pushing for a federal civil rights prosecution. More than four decades later, activists still fight to ensure Chin is not forgotten, saying his story inspires advocacy nationwide. Law students reenact his trial, Hollywood adapted his story into a movie and Asian Americans remember the impact of his killing on their struggle for racial justice and equality. \u201cFor a whole generation of Asian American activists, the Vincent Chin case was the case that got them involved,\u201d says writer and filmmaker Curtis Chin. \u201cIt was the thing that brought them to the table.\u201d A chorus of Asian American voices After the judge spared Vincent Chin\u2019s killers, Curtis Chin \u2014 then 14 \u2014 grabbed his parents\u2019 typewriter and wrote outraged letters to newspaper editors. He had found his calling. Instead of taking over his family\u2019s Chinese restaurant, Curtis Chin \u2014 who is not related to the man killed on June 23, 1982 \u2014 spent the next 30 years elevating Asian American voices, and recounting Vincent Chin\u2019s story and the racism of 1980s Detroit. For Helen Zia, an Asian American activist who moved to Detroit in the 1970s, Chin\u2019s case laid bare the glaring injustices that her community faced. Lacking any local organizations to advocate for Asian American civil rights, Zia co-founded the American Citizens for Justice, which helped to secure a federal trial against Chin\u2019s killers. One was acquitted of civil rights violations and the other was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison. His conviction was overturned on appeal. On June 20, the FBI released a 602-page file on Chin\u2019s death, revealing previously unseen witness interviews with descriptions of his final moments and the anti-Asian slurs his attackers used, among other details. Activists told the Detroit Free Press, which first reported on the FBI documents, that they were not notified about the file, and the agency did not provide a reason for its release. Last year, Zia launched the Vincent Chin Institute, an advocacy organization to counter hatred against Asian Americans. Chin\u2019s case has had an impact beyond advocacy. Students at Harvard Law School have reenacted the trials of his attackers to highlight shortcomings in the legal system. And his killing has inspired documentaries, a podcast and a movie, \u201cWho Killed Vincent Chin?\u201d Vincent Chin was a victim of brutal, racial violence, but from that tragedy emerged \u201ca chorus of Asian American voices,\u201d Curtis Chin says. Considerable work ahead The autoworkers who attacked Chin blamed foreign vehicle manufacturers for hardships in the U.S. auto industry. This fear of foreign economic threat parallels modern \u201canti-China hysteria and scapegoating,\u201d says Stop AAPI Hate co-founder Cynthia Choi, pointing to attacks on Asians by people accusing them of culpability in the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cWhat\u2019s different for our community today is that we are speaking out. We are speaking out loudly,\u201d Choi says. Established in 2020, Stop AAPI Hate advocates for policy change and collects comprehensive data on acts of hatred against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The group has documented thousands of cases nationwide, including verbal and physical abuse, and discrimination in business and education. \u201cClose to 50% of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders reported that they experienced some form of race-based hate in the past year,\u201d Choi says. Advocates say there\u2019s still considerable work to be done. No comprehensive history of Asian Americans is included in core K-12 curricula. Asked to name a prominent Asian American in a recent survey, most Americans responded \u201cI can\u2019t think of one\u201d or Jackie Chan, who is not American. \u201cWe don\u2019t even exist to most Americans,\u201d Zia says, citing lack of visibility as a key driver in the perpetuation of Asian American stereotypes. John Yang, the president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, underscores the damage of stereotypes. \u201cIn terms of job opportunities, we are pigeonholed as perpetual foreigners,\u201d Yang says. \u201cAsian Americans don\u2019t get promoted at the same rate. We don\u2019t occupy C-suites. We don\u2019t occupy boards in the same way that other Americans do.\u201d Discrimination also extends to housing. The Urban Institute, a think tank that conducts economic and policy research, reports that Asian American buyers are shown 18.8% fewer properties overall compared to white buyers. Yet the stereotype of Asian Americans as the model minority leads some fair housing advocates to exclude Asian Americans from their efforts. \u201cEveryone is concerned about whether an Asian American is truly an American, and so they\u2019re not being shown the same houses,\u201d Yang says. \u201cThey\u2019re not being afforded the same opportunities.\u201d Standing on the shoulders of giants On Sunday, dozens of residents stood with their heads bowed beneath Boston\u2019s Chinatown gate to remember Chin. Wearing T-shirts reading \u201cSTOP ASIAN HATE,\u201d they arranged candles in the shape of a heart and displayed a portrait of Chin with his name written in Chinese and \u201cMay 18, 1955 \u2013 June 23, 1982.\u201d Wilson Lee, co-founder of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance Boston Lodge and the Chinese American Heritage Foundation, said he and his wife have organized a vigil for Chin every June 23 for six years. Even as media attention faded, their dedication to Chin\u2019s memory has not wavered. \u201cWe\u2019re in it for the long haul,\u201d Lee says. \u201cBecause it\u2019s the right thing to do, not because it\u2019s the popular thing to do.\u201d A collection of local dignitaries joined the remembrance, as did 16 Asian American elementary and high school students whom Lee described as \u201cstakeholders.\u201d They held orange lilies and yellow flowers pressed to their chests. \u201cWe need to make sure that future generations, especially our young people, know about the experience that he went through,\u201d Lee says. \u201cThey are standing on the shoulders of giants, and Vincent Chin was a giant.\u201d ___ The Associated Press receives financial support from the Sony Global Social Justice Fund to expand certain coverage areas.

Check out this list and support Catholic-owned businesses and families with your purchases. St. Joseph-themed books: Check out these great titles from TAN, including The Imitation of Saint Joseph (with a beautiful green leatherette cover) and The Life of Saint Joseph as Seen by the Mystics. Not St. Joseph-themed, but another new favorite from TAN that I\u2019m gifting my husband for Father\u2019s Day is the newly released Manual of Prayers: For the Use of the Catholic Laity. It\u2019s rife with prayers and devotions for use throughout the year and from the same council that issued the Baltimore Catechism. Use code KatieCatholic-15 for a discount on your purchase. Bonus way to buy: THE IMITATION OF SAINT JOSEPH | EWTN Religious Catalogue Catholic jewelry for men: Telos Art Shop has some great choices for men, including my favorite St. Benedict leather bracelet and the Sts. Michael and Benedict medals. Use code KATIE5 at checkout for a discount. Illuminated Liturgical Year Posters: These gorgeous illustrated liturgical year posters grace our own hallways and would make a stunning and unique gift for any man interested in the traditional liturgy and Catholic artwork.

The women's competition also is scheduled that day, but both will only happen if water tests show acceptable levels of E. coli and other bacteria. Friday is also planned as a backup date.\n\nHowever, storms or rain are forecast Tuesday night through Thursday, which could complicate rescheduling because rain generally causes bacteria levels in the Seine to rise.\n\n\"It's disappointing that there's this negative aspect now with the delay,\" American triathlete Seth Rider said. \"But I hope we can have a triathlon and I can accomplish this dream that I've had since I was a little kid.\"\n\nAur\u00e9lie Merle, the Paris 2024 director of sports, told reporters Tuesday that water samples are taken 21 and a half hours before decisions are made about the swim, leaving uncertainty about its accuracy the day of the race.\n\nParis spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) to improve the water quality in the Seine so the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming event next week could be held in the famed river that runs through the city center. But bacteria levels have remained in flux.\n\nOrganizers were asked if they put the aesthetics of the triathlon over the best interests of athletes.\n\n\"We're living in the 21st century where, unfortunately, there are far more meteorological events that happen that are beyond the control of the organizers,\" Merle said. \"We've seen that we go from heavy rain to extreme heat like today in very few days. So it's actually hard to control how it can affect the quality of a river.\"\n\nParis experienced a downpour during the Olympic opening ceremony Friday, with rain persisting into Saturday. The swimming portion of training events meant to let the triathletes familiarize themselves with the course was canceled on both Sunday and Monday because of concerns over water quality.\n\nOrganizers had expressed confidence in recent days that bacteria levels would improve as skies cleared and temperatures warmed this week, but that apparently wasn't sufficient to ensure the athletes' safety. The sun's ultraviolet rays can kill the bacteria and lower levels, and the early part of the week has been hot and sunny.\n\nThe sport's governing body, World Triathlon, its medical team, the IOC and city officials met early Tuesday and decided to postpone.\n\nRider, the triathlete, was on a 4 a.m. run when the delay was announced. A fellow triathlete also out running waved him down.\n\n\"We had a little chat there in the pitch black, at 4 a.m., in the middle of the street, no one around,\" Rider said. \"I just went back to the room and went back to bed.\"\n\nParis Deputy Mayor Pierre Rabadan said \"the trend is improving\" but did not rule out further delays \"if there is an issue tomorrow after the results of the analysis.\"\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive give a range of E. coli levels from \"excellent\" to \"sufficient.\" Anything beyond 900 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters is not considered safe or \"sufficient.\"\n\nBut experts stressed that these numbers are simply guidelines used to assess risk. \"There's nothing magic about 900,\" said Dr. Nicole Iovine, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Florida.\n\nOne of four test sites was below the threshold for E. coli on Tuesday, said Merle of Paris 2024. Two other sites were just above the limit and one was more elevated, she said, citing a range of 980 to 1,553.\n\nHigh levels of E. coli in water can indicate contamination from sewage. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous. Even a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and the germ can cause illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or in the intestines.\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo very publicly took a swim in the river two weeks ago, along with Paris 2024 chief Tony Estanguet. Data released last week show that E. coli levels at the Bras Marie were at 985 units per 100 milliliters that day, slightly above the threshold.\n\nThe men's triathlon is now scheduled to start at 10:45 a.m. Wednesday, which may make heat more of a factor with the event finishing at the hottest part of the day. World Triathlon is planning to provide ice and water stations along the course for the athletes. The women's race is set to go forward at 8 a.m. as originally planned.\n\nIf the river isn't safe for swimming after delays, that part of the race would be scrapped and only the cycling and running portions would go forward. That happened last year at the European Championships when the triathlon format was switched because of water quality issues.\n\n\"It's just another situation of the competition,\" said World Triathlon president Marisol Casado, pushing back against the idea that a switch would be unfair to triathletes who excel in the water.\n\nOther swimming events planned in the Seine are the triathlon mixed relay on Monday and the women's and men's marathon swimming events on Aug. 8 and Aug. 9. Marathon swimming could be relocated, if needed, to the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium in the greater Paris region, which already hosts rowing and canoeing competitions and can accommodate up to 15,000 spectators.\n\nBut it's a logistical challenge for triathlon to switch swimming locations given that routes are already set up for cycling and running.\n\n\"We are sympathetic,\" Merle said. \"Let's see how it goes.\"", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pat_graham@santamariatimes.com", "name": "Pat Graham",

Officials undertook an ambitious plan, including 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in infrastructure improvements, to clean up the long-polluted Seine and have been steadfast in their insistence that the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming events next week could safely be held in the river.\n\nThe organizers said early Wednesday the latest tests of the water showed compliance with quality standards.\n\nElevated levels of bacteria in the river pushed the men's race originally planned for Tuesday to Wednesday, when the women's competition had been scheduled. Test events meant to allow the athletes to familiarize themselves with the course had already been canceled for the same reason on Sunday and Monday.\n\nThe water quality in the Seine directly affected by rainfall that can lead to wastewater runoff flowing into the river. Heavy rains fell during Friday's Olympic opening ceremony, and rain continued for most of the day Saturday.\n\nEvery day since Sunday, even as organizers announced cancellations or postponements, they continued to express confidence that the swims in the Seine would go forward as planned the next day. For several days they did not publicly release the data on levels of E. coli and other bacteria that contributed to their decisions.\n\nHigh levels of E. coli in water can indicate contamination from sewage. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous. Even a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and the germ can cause illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or in the intestines.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive give a range of E. coli levels from \"excellent\" to \"sufficient.\" Anything beyond 900 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters is not considered safe or \"sufficient.\" But experts stressed that these numbers are simply guidelines used to assess risk.\n\nPlus, Aur\u00e9lie Merle, the Paris 2024 director of sports, told reporters Tuesday that water samples are taken 21 and a half hours before decisions are made about the swim. That leaves uncertainty about their accuracy the day of the race.\n\nMerle said Tuesday that testing results showed \"we're very close to the threshold of triathlon.\" She noted that one of four test sites along the triathlon course was below the threshold for E. coli.

The women's competition also is scheduled that day, but both will only happen if water tests show acceptable levels of E. coli and other bacteria. Friday is also planned as a backup date.\n\nHowever, storms or rain are forecast Tuesday night through Thursday, which could complicate rescheduling because rain generally causes bacteria levels in the Seine to rise.\n\n\"It's disappointing that there's this negative aspect now with the delay,\" American triathlete Seth Rider said. \"But I hope we can have a triathlon and I can accomplish this dream that I've had since I was a little kid.\"\n\nAur\u00e9lie Merle, the Paris 2024 director of sports, told reporters Tuesday that water samples are taken 21 and a half hours before decisions are made about the swim, leaving uncertainty about its accuracy the day of the race.\n\nParis spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) to improve the water quality in the Seine so the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming event next week could be held in the famed river that runs through the city center. But bacteria levels have remained in flux.\n\nOrganizers were asked if they put the aesthetics of the triathlon over the best interests of athletes.\n\n\"We're living in the 21st century where, unfortunately, there are far more meteorological events that happen that are beyond the control of the organizers,\" Merle said. \"We've seen that we go from heavy rain to extreme heat like today in very few days. So it's actually hard to control how it can affect the quality of a river.\"\n\nParis experienced a downpour during the Olympic opening ceremony Friday, with rain persisting into Saturday. The swimming portion of training events meant to let the triathletes familiarize themselves with the course was canceled on both Sunday and Monday because of concerns over water quality.\n\nOrganizers had expressed confidence in recent days that bacteria levels would improve as skies cleared and temperatures warmed this week, but that apparently wasn't sufficient to ensure the athletes' safety. The sun's ultraviolet rays can kill the bacteria and lower levels, and the early part of the week has been hot and sunny.\n\nThe sport's governing body, World Triathlon, its medical team, the IOC and city officials met early Tuesday and decided to postpone.\n\nRider, the triathlete, was on a 4 a.m. run when the delay was announced. A fellow triathlete also out running waved him down.\n\n\"We had a little chat there in the pitch black, at 4 a.m., in the middle of the street, no one around,\" Rider said. \"I just went back to the room and went back to bed.\"\n\nParis Deputy Mayor Pierre Rabadan said \"the trend is improving\" but did not rule out further delays \"if there is an issue tomorrow after the results of the analysis.\"\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive give a range of E. coli levels from \"excellent\" to \"sufficient.\" Anything beyond 900 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters is not considered safe or \"sufficient.\"\n\nBut experts stressed that these numbers are simply guidelines used to assess risk. \"There's nothing magic about 900,\" said Dr. Nicole Iovine, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Florida.\n\nOne of four test sites was below the threshold for E. coli on Tuesday, said Merle of Paris 2024. Two other sites were just above the limit and one was more elevated, she said, citing a range of 980 to 1,553.\n\nHigh levels of E. coli in water can indicate contamination from sewage. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous. Even a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and the germ can cause illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or in the intestines.\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo very publicly took a swim in the river two weeks ago, along with Paris 2024 chief Tony Estanguet. Data released last week show that E. coli levels at the Bras Marie were at 985 units per 100 milliliters that day, slightly above the threshold.\n\nThe men's triathlon is now scheduled to start at 10:45 a.m. Wednesday, which may make heat more of a factor with the event finishing at the hottest part of the day. World Triathlon is planning to provide ice and water stations along the course for the athletes. The women's race is set to go forward at 8 a.m. as originally planned.\n\nIf the river isn't safe for swimming after delays, that part of the race would be scrapped and only the cycling and running portions would go forward. That happened last year at the European Championships when the triathlon format was switched because of water quality issues.\n\n\"It's just another situation of the competition,\" said World Triathlon president Marisol Casado, pushing back against the idea that a switch would be unfair to triathletes who excel in the water.\n\nOther swimming events planned in the Seine are the triathlon mixed relay on Monday and the women's and men's marathon swimming events on Aug. 8 and Aug. 9. Marathon swimming could be relocated, if needed, to the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium in the greater Paris region, which already hosts rowing and canoeing competitions and can accommodate up to 15,000 spectators.\n\nBut it's a logistical challenge for triathlon to switch swimming locations given that routes are already set up for cycling and running.\n\n\"We are sympathetic,\" Merle said. \"Let's see how it goes.\"\n\nAP writers Barbara Surk in Nice and Devna Bose in Jackson, Mississippi, contributed.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri":

The women's competition also is scheduled that day, but both will only happen if water tests show acceptable levels of E. coli and other bacteria. Friday is also planned as a backup date.\n\nHowever, storms or rain are forecast Tuesday night through Thursday, which could complicate rescheduling because rain generally causes bacteria levels in the Seine to rise.\n\n\"It's disappointing that there's this negative aspect now with the delay,\" American triathlete Seth Rider said. \"But I hope we can have a triathlon and I can accomplish this dream that I've had since I was a little kid.\"\n\nRead More: Inside the Billion-Dollar Effort to Clean Up the World's Most Romantic River\n\nAur\u00e9lie Merle, the Paris 2024 director of sports, told reporters Tuesday that water samples are taken 21 and a half hours before decisions are made about the swim, leaving uncertainty about its accuracy the day of the race.\n\nParis spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) to improve the water quality in the Seine so the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming event next week could be held in the famed river that runs through the city center. But bacteria levels have remained in flux.\n\nOrganizers were asked if they put the aesthetics of the triathlon over the best interests of athletes.\n\n\"We're living in the 21st century where, unfortunately, there are far more meteorological events that happen that are beyond the control of the organizers,\" Merle said. \"We've seen that we go from heavy rain to extreme heat like today in very few days. So it's actually hard to control how it can affect the quality of a river.\"\n\nParis experienced a downpour during the Olympic opening ceremony Friday, with rain persisting into Saturday. The swimming portion of training events meant to let the triathletes familiarize themselves with the course was canceled on both Sunday and Monday because of concerns over water quality.\n\nOrganizers had expressed confidence in recent days that bacteria levels would improve as skies cleared and temperatures warmed this week, but that apparently wasn't sufficient to ensure the athletes' safety. The sun's ultraviolet rays can kill the bacteria and lower levels, and the early part of the week has been hot and sunny.\n\nThe sport's governing body, World Triathlon, its medical team, the IOC and city officials met early Tuesday and decided to postpone.\n\nRead More: How Dangerous Is the Seine for Olympic Athletes?\n\nRider, the triathlete, was on a 4 a.m. run when the delay was announced. A fellow triathlete also out running waved him down.\n\n\"We had a little chat there in the pitch black, at 4 a.m., in the middle of the street, no one around,\" Rider said. \"I just went back to the room and went back to bed.\"\n\nParis Deputy Mayor Pierre Rabadan said \"the trend is improving\" but did not rule out further delays \"if there is an issue tomorrow after the results of the analysis.\"\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive give a range of E. coli levels from \"excellent\" to \"sufficient.\" Anything beyond 900 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters is not considered safe or \"sufficient.\"\n\nBut experts stressed that these numbers are simply guidelines used to assess risk. \"There's nothing magic about 900,\" said Dr. Nicole Iovine, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Florida.\n\nOne of four test sites was below the threshold for E. coli on Tuesday, said Merle of Paris 2024. Two other sites were just above the limit and one was more elevated, she said, citing a range of 980 to 1,553.\n\nHigh levels of E. coli in water can indicate contamination from sewage. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous. Even a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and the germ can cause illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or in the intestines.\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo very publicly took a swim in the river two weeks ago, along with Paris 2024 chief Tony Estanguet. Data released last week show that E. coli levels at the Bras Marie were at 985 units per 100 milliliters that day, slightly above the threshold.\n\nThe men's triathlon is now scheduled to start at 10:45 a.m. Wednesday, which may make heat more of a factor with the event finishing at the hottest part of the day. World Triathlon is planning to provide ice and water stations along the course for the athletes. The women's race is set to go forward at 8 a.m. as originally planned.\n\nIf the river isn't safe for swimming after delays, that part of the race would be scrapped and only the cycling and running portions would go forward. That happened last year at the European Championships when the triathlon format was switched because of water quality issues.\n\n\"It's just another situation of the competition,\" said World Triathlon president Marisol Casado, pushing back against the idea that a switch would be unfair to triathletes who excel in the water.\n\nOther swimming events planned in the Seine are the triathlon mixed relay on Monday and the women's and men's marathon swimming events on Aug. 8 and Aug. 9. Marathon swimming could be relocated, if needed, to the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium in the greater Paris region, which already hosts rowing and canoeing competitions and can accommodate up to 15,000 spectators.\n\nBut it's a logistical challenge for triathlon to switch swimming locations given that routes are already set up for cycling and running.\n\n\"We are sympathetic,\" Merle said. \"Let's see how it goes.\"\n\n___\n\nAP writers Barbara Surk in Nice and Devna Bose in Jackson, Mississippi, contributed.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"},

The risky levels of E. coli have already led to swim training to be canceled and on Tuesday the men's competition being pushed back.\n\nOfficials remain hopeful the swimming portion of the race will be able to go forward in the long-polluted river Wednesday -- or in the coming days. The women's competition also is scheduled for Wednesday, but both will only happen if water tests show safe levels of E. coli and other bacteria in the river.\n\nAnother potential hiccup: A forecast of rain beginning Tuesday night and running through Thursday could complicate efforts to reschedule the events. Rain generally causes bacteria levels in the Seine to rise.\n\nIf the river isn't safe for swimming, that portion of the race could potentially be scrapped and only the cycling and running parts would be staged to determine the medal winners.\n\nThere are three triathlon races that will be held at the Paris Games -- the men's and women's competitions, along with a mixed relay. In the triathlon world, the order of events is swimming, biking and running primarily out of safety concerns. The Olympic triathlon distance for the men and women is slightly less than a mile (1.5 kilometers) for the swim, 25 miles (40 kilometers) for cycling and then a 6.2-mile (10K) run.\n\nIt's been part of the Olympic program since the 2000 Sydney Olympics.\n\n\"Pretty crazy to be here after dreaming of it for so long,\" said 27-year-old U.S. triathlete Seth Rider, who took up the sport when he was 6 years old.\n\nLike everyone, triathletes are just waiting on the water-quality reports to come back favorable. In the meantime, they still need to train.\n\nThere are plenty of places to run, of course, even through the busy side streets around the Arrondissements of Paris. High-speed cycling has places, too. But to train for an open-water swim, one option could be the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium in the greater Paris region.\n\nOr, possibly even a hotel pool. But of course that would mean lots and lots and lots of laps to get in the work they need.\n\nThe women's and men's marathon swimming events are set for Aug. 8 and Aug. 9. For those competitions, backup plans could include relocating, if needed, to the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium. It already hosts rowing and canoeing competitions and can accommodate up to 15,000 spectators.\n\nThat said, it's not easy to just pick up and move the triathlon. One part is predicated on another.\n\nAfter the swim, racers go through a transition area to get to their bikes. After cycling, another transition to prepare for the run. The routes are already set up for cycling and running.\n\nShould the river not clear up, the swimming part could always be nixed and the race feature only cycling and running. That was the case last year at the European Championships when the format was switched to a \"duathlon\" because of water-quality issues.\n\nAsked if that might be unfair to triathletes who excel in the water, World Triathlon president Marisol Casado responded: \"It's just another situation of the competition.\"", "source": {"uri": "seattlepi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Seattle Pi"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pat_graham@seattlepi.com", "name": "Pat Graham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Escherichia coli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cycle sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Waterway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaires-sur-Marne", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaires-sur-Marne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vaires-sur-Marne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00cele-de-France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00cele-de-France"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "\u00cele-de-France"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrondissements_of_Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arrondissements of Paris"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_water_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open water swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoeing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canoeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowing_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rowing (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Swimming_and_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Swimming and Diving", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://s.hdnux.com/photos/01/41/12/36/25470905/3/rawImage.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776638", "eventUri": "eng-9776638", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "dateEnd": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 2385, "textEnd": 2402}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Officials undertook an ambitious plan, including 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in infrastructure improvements, to clean up the long-polluted Seine and have been steadfast in their insistence that the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming events next week could safely be held in the river.\n\nThe organizers said early Wednesday the latest tests of the water showed compliance with quality standards.\n\nElevated levels of bacteria in the river pushed the men\u00b4s race originally planned for Tuesday to Wednesday, when the women\u00b4s competition had been scheduled. Test events meant to allow the athletes to familiarize themselves with the course had already been canceled for the same reason on Sunday and Monday.\n\nThe water quality in the Seine directly affected by rainfall that can lead to wastewater runoff flowing into the river. Heavy rains fell during Friday\u00b4s Olympic opening ceremony, and rain continued for most of the day Saturday.\n\nEvery day since Sunday, even as organizers announced cancellations or postponements, they continued to express confidence that the swims in the Seine would go forward as planned the next day. For several days they did not publicly release the data on levels of E. coli and other bacteria that contributed to their decisions.\n\nA man wipes his face as he walks past reproductions of artworks decorating the banks of the River Seineat the 2024 Summer Olympics, Tuesday, July 30, 2024, in Paris, France.

(AP Photo/Vadim Ghirda)\n\nHigh levels of E. coli in water can indicate contamination from sewage. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous. Even a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and the germ can cause illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or in the intestines.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria E. coli. World Triathlon\u00b4s water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive give a range of E. coli levels from \"excellent\" to \"sufficient.\" Anything beyond 900 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters is not considered safe or \"sufficient.\" But experts stressed that these numbers are simply guidelines used to assess risk.\n\nPlus, Aur\u00e9lie Merle, the Paris 2024 director of sports, told reporters Tuesday that water samples are taken 21 and a half hours before decisions are made about the swim. That leaves uncertainty about their accuracy the day of the race.\n\nMerle said Tuesday that testing results showed \"we\u00b4re very close to the threshold of triathlon.\" She noted that one of four test sites along the triathlon course was below the threshold for E. coli.

Officials undertook an ambitious plan, including 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in infrastructure improvements, to clean up the long-polluted Seine and have been steadfast in their insistence that the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming events next week could safely be held in the river.\n\nThe organizers said early Wednesday the latest tests of the water showed compliance with quality standards.\n\nElevated levels of bacteria in the river pushed the men's race originally planned for Tuesday to Wednesday, when the women's competition had been scheduled. Test events meant to allow the athletes to familiarize themselves with the course had already been canceled for the same reason on Sunday and Monday.\n\nThe water quality in the Seine directly affected by rainfall that can lead to wastewater runoff flowing into the river. Heavy rains fell during Friday's Olympic opening ceremony, and rain continued for most of the day Saturday.\n\nEvery day since Sunday, even as organizers announced cancellations or postponements, they continued to express confidence that the swims in the Seine would go forward as planned the next day. For several days they did not publicly release the data on levels of E. coli and other bacteria that contributed to their decisions.\n\nHigh levels of E. coli in water can indicate contamination from sewage. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous. Even a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and the germ can cause illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or in the intestines.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive give a range of E. coli levels from \"excellent\" to \"sufficient.\" Anything beyond 900 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters is not considered safe or \"sufficient.\" But experts stressed that these numbers are simply guidelines used to assess risk.\n\nPlus, Aur\u00e9lie Merle, the Paris 2024 director of sports, told reporters Tuesday that water samples are taken 21 and a half hours before decisions are made about the swim. That leaves uncertainty about their accuracy the day of the race.\n\nMerle said Tuesday that testing results showed \"we're very close to the threshold of triathlon.\" She noted that one of four test sites along the triathlon course was below the threshold for E. coli. Two other sites were just above the limit and one was more elevated, she said, citing a range of 980 to 1,553.\n\n\"We know the sun and the heat have a very strong impact on the quality of the water,\" she said, hoping that a heat wave that hit most of France on Tuesday would help improve water quality enough for the swims to go ahead.\n\nOrganizers have said the marathon swimming races, scheduled for Aug. 8 and 9, could be relocated, if needed, to the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium in the greater Paris region, which already hosts rowing and canoeing competitions and can accommodate up to 15,000 spectators.\n\nEfforts to make the river suitable for swimming included the construction of a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from flowing into the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo very publicly took a swim in the river two weeks ago, along with Paris 2024 chief Tony Estanguet; Marc Guillaume, the top government official for the Paris region; and swimmers from local swimming clubs. Data released last week show that E. coli levels at the Bras Marie were at 985 units per 100 milliliters that day, slightly above the established threshold.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000.

The risky levels of E. coli have already led to swim training to be canceled and on Tuesday the men's competition being pushed back.\n\nOfficials remain hopeful the swimming portion of the race will be able to go forward in the long-polluted river Wednesday -- or in the coming days. The women's competition also is scheduled for Wednesday, but both will only happen if water tests show safe levels of E. coli and other bacteria in the river.\n\nAnother potential hiccup: A forecast of rain beginning Tuesday night and running through Thursday could complicate efforts to reschedule the events. Rain generally causes bacteria levels in the Seine to rise.\n\nIf the river isn't safe for swimming, that portion of the race could potentially be scrapped and only the cycling and running parts would be staged to determine the medal winners.\n\nHow big is swimming in the triathlon competition?\n\nThere are three triathlon races that will be held at the Paris Games -- the men's and women's competitions, along with a mixed relay. In the triathlon world, the order of events is swimming, biking and running primarily out of safety concerns. The Olympic triathlon distance for the men and women is slightly less than a mile (1.5 kilometers) for the swim, 25 miles (40 kilometers) for cycling and then a 6.2-mile (10K) run.\n\nIt's been part of the Olympic program since the 2000 Sydney Olympics.\n\n\"Pretty crazy to be here after dreaming of it for so long,\" said 27-year-old U.S. triathlete Seth Rider, who took up the sport when he was 6 years old.\n\nWhat can the athletes do during the delays?\n\nLike everyone, triathletes are just waiting on the water-quality reports to come back favorable. In the meantime, they still need to train.\n\nThere are plenty of places to run, of course, even through the busy side streets around the Arrondissements of Paris. High-speed cycling has places, too. But to train for an open-water swim, one option could be the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium in the greater Paris region.\n\nOr, possibly even a hotel pool. But of course that would mean lots and lots and lots of laps to get in the work they need.\n\nCould the swimming location change?\n\nThe women's and men's marathon swimming events are set for Aug. 8 and Aug. 9. For those competitions, backup plans could include relocating, if needed, to the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium. It already hosts rowing and canoeing competitions and can accommodate up to 15,000 spectators.\n\nThat said, it's not easy to just pick up and move the triathlon. One part is predicated on another.\n\nAfter the swim, racers go through a transition area to get to their bikes. After cycling, another transition to prepare for the run. The routes are already set up for cycling and running.\n\nIf no swimming leg, then what?\n\nShould the river not clear up, the swimming part could always be nixed and the race feature only cycling and running. That was the case last year at the European Championships when the format was switched to a \"duathlon\" because of water-quality issues.\n\nAsked if that might be unfair to triathletes who excel in the water, World Triathlon president Marisol Casado responded: \"It's just another situation of the competition.\"\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pat_graham@register-herald.com", "name": "Pat Graham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Escherichia coli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cycle sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Waterway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaires-sur-Marne", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaires-sur-Marne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vaires-sur-Marne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00cele-de-France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00cele-de-France"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "\u00cele-de-France"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrondissements_of_Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arrondissements of Paris"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_water_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open water swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoeing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canoeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowing_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rowing (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Swimming_and_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Swimming and Diving", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/88/488101ce-bca7-55dd-838b-8d32d1cb8d69/66a8836f65d4c.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776638", "eventUri": "eng-9776638", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "dateEnd": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 2518, "textEnd": 2535}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The women's race began under gray skies, with steady rain tapering off just as the athletes splashed into the water. Some dunked their swim goggles in the Seine before putting them on and heading into the river with the Eiffel Tower in the background.\n\nThe decision to go ahead with the swim for the triathlon competitions was a big deal for the city, Olympics organizers and the athletes. Officials undertook an ambitious plan, including 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in infrastructure improvements, to clean up the long-polluted Seine and have been steadfast in their insistence that the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming events next week could safely be held in the river.\n\nThe organizers said early Wednesday the latest tests of the water showed compliance with quality standards. That came after days of uncertainty following heavy rains on Friday and Saturday.\n\n\"The problem is always worse when there's a heavy rainfall, because it kind of overwhelms the pipes and you also get all the runoff from the street. All that lands in the Seine,\" explained Dr. Nicole Iovine, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Florida. \"They've done a lot to try to improve the quality of the water. But the truth is you're at the mercy of Mother Nature.\"\n\nAs they swam, the triathletes stayed close to the barges and boats that line the banks of the river. Spectators watched and cheered form the stands set up along the side and from the bridges spanning the waterway.\n\nAfter swimming two laps in the Seine, a 1.5-kilometer course, the athletes emerged from the water and ran up a set of stairs to jump on their bikes for a ride through the rain-soaked streets of Paris, including the iconic Champs-Elysees.\n\nDuring the women's race, the biking portion saw numerous crashes and wipeouts along wet roads, but skies were blue by the time the triathletes began the final leg of the race, a 10-kilometer run. By the time the men's race started, the sun was beating down.\n\nFrance's Cassandre Beaugrand won gold in the women's event, while Switzerland's Julie Derron took silver and Great Britain's Beth Potter got the bronze medal.\n\nParis organizers couldn't contain their delight that their gamble of holding Olympic events in the long-toxic river was paying off, with the astounding scenes of athletes swimming in the Seine's waters.\n\nThe massive infrastructure investment to better manage wastewater has paved the way for Paris' ultimate goal: Allowing Parisians to enjoy the waterway again after more than a century of it being off-limits, with plans to open public pools in its waters from 2025.\n\n\"It's magic,\" said chief Paris Games organizer Tony Estanguet, speaking to French television. \"It's a very important legacy for Parisians to be able to swim from next year in the Seine.\"\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who took a much publicized dip in the Seine two weeks ago along with Estanguet and others to ease fears about water quality, said after Beaugrand won the first Olympic gold in the river: \"How special to see her swimming in the Seine, thank you for making us so proud!\"\n\n\"I wasn't very worried about the Seine River because we swam last year and no one was sick after that, so I was confident we could swim today and it would have been a shame if we didn't,\" Beaugrand said. Olympic triathletes participated in a test event in the river last August.\n\nElevated levels of bacteria in the river pushed the men's race originally planned for Tuesday to Wednesday, when the women's competition had been scheduled. The women began their race at 8 a.m., while the men started at 10:45 a.m. Test events meant to allow the athletes to familiarize themselves with the course had already been canceled for the same reason on Sunday and Monday.\n\nThe water quality in the Seine is directly affected by rainfall that can lead to wastewater runoff flowing into the river.

scheduled for 8 and 9 August, could be relocated, if needed, to the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium in the greater Paris region, which already hosts rowing and canoeing competitions.\n\nEfforts to make the river suitable for swimming included the construction of a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from flowing into the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo very publicly took a swim in the river two weeks ago, along with Paris 2024 chief Tony Estanguet, as well as Marc Guillaume, the top

The steady rain tapered off just as the athletes splashed into the water. Some dunked their swim goggles in the Seine before putting them on and heading into the river with the Eiffel Tower in the background.\n\nThe decision to go ahead with the swim for the triathlon competitions was a big deal for the city, Olympics organizers and the athletes. Officials undertook an ambitious plan, including 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in infrastructure improvements, to clean up the long-polluted Seine and have been steadfast in their insistence that the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming events next week could safely be held in the river.\n\nThe organizers said early Wednesday the latest tests of the water showed compliance with quality standards. That came after days of uncertainty following heavy rains on Friday and Saturday.\n\n\"The problem is always worse when there's a heavy rainfall, because it kind of overwhelms the pipes and you also get all the runoff from the street. All that lands in the Seine,\" explained Dr. Nicole Iovine, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Florida. \"They've done a lot to try to improve the quality of the water. But the truth is you're at the mercy of Mother Nature.\"\n\nAs they swam, the triathletes stayed close to the barges and boats that line the banks of the river. Spectators watched and cheered form the stands set up along the side and from the bridges spanning the waterway.\n\nAfter swimming two laps in the Seine, a 1.5-kilometer course, the athletes emerged from the water and ran up a set of stairs to jump on their bikes for a ride through the rain-soaked streets of Paris, including the iconic Champs-Elysees.\n\nDuring the women's race, the biking portion saw numerous crashes and wipeouts along wet roads, but skies were blue by the time the triathletes began the final leg of the race, a 10-kilometer run.\n\nFrance's Cassandre Beaugrand won gold in the women's event, while Switzerland's Julie Derron took silver and Great Britain's Beth Potter got the bronze medal.\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who took a much publicized dip in the Seine two weeks ago to ease fears about water quality, celebrated Beaugrand's victory.\n\n\"The incredible Cassandre Beaugrand has made history!\" she said in a statement. \"How emotional to see her swimming in the Seine, thank you for making us so proud.\"\n\nElevated levels of bacteria in the river pushed the men's race originally planned for Tuesday to Wednesday, when the women's competition had been scheduled. The women began their race at 8 a.m., while the men started at 10:45 a.m. Test events meant to allow the athletes to familiarize themselves with the course had already been canceled for the same reason on Sunday and Monday.\n\nThe water quality in the Seine is directly affected by rainfall that can lead to wastewater runoff flowing into the river. Heavy rains fell during Friday's Olympic opening ceremony, and rain continued for most of the day Saturday.\n\nEvery day since Sunday, even as organizers announced cancellations or postponements, they continued to express confidence that the swims in the Seine would go forward as planned the next day.

The women's race began under a gray sky, with steady rain tapering off just as the athletes splashed into the water. Some dunked their swim goggles in the Seine before putting them on and heading into the river with the Eiffel Tower in the background.\n\nThe decision to go ahead with the swim for the triathlon competitions was a big deal for the city, Olympics organizers and the athletes. Officials undertook an ambitious plan, including 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in infrastructure improvements, to clean up the long-polluted Seine and have been steadfast in their insistence that the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming events next week could safely be held in the river.\n\nThe organizers said early Wednesday the latest tests of the water showed compliance with quality standards. That came after days of uncertainty following heavy rain on Friday and Saturday.\n\n\"The problem is always worse when there's a heavy rainfall, because it kind of overwhelms the pipes and you also get all the runoff from the street. All that lands in the Seine,\" explained Dr. Nicole Iovine, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Florida. \"They've done a lot to try to improve the quality of the water. But the truth is you're at the mercy of Mother Nature.\"\n\nAs they swam, the triathletes stayed close to the barges and boats that line the banks of the river. Spectators watched and cheered from the stands set up along the side and from the bridges spanning the waterway.\n\nAfter swimming two laps in the Seine, a 1.5-kilometer course, the athletes emerged from the water and ran up a set of stairs to jump on their bikes for a ride through the rain-soaked streets of Paris, including the iconic Champs-Elysees.\n\nDuring the women's race, the biking portion saw numerous crashes and wipeouts along wet roads, but skies were blue by the time the triathletes began the final leg of the race, a 10-kilometer run. By the time the men's race started, the sun was beating down.\n\nCassandre Beaugrand of France won gold in the women's event, while Julie Derron of Switzerland took silver and Beth Potter of Britain got the bronze medal. Alex Yee of Britain won gold in the men's race, with Hayden Wilde of New Zealand winning silver and L\u00e9o Berg\u00e8re of France taking bronze.\n\nParis organizers couldn't contain their delight that their gamble of holding Olympic events in the long-toxic river was paying off, with the astounding scenes of athletes swimming in the Seine's waters.\n\nThe massive infrastructure investment to better manage wastewater has paved the way for Paris' ultimate goal: allowing Parisians to enjoy the waterway again after more than a century of it being off-limits, with plans to open public pools in its waters from 2025.\n\n\"It's magic,\" said chief Paris Games organizer Tony Estanguet, speaking to French television. \"It's a very important legacy for Parisians to be able to swim from next year in the Seine.\"\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who took a much-publicized dip in the Seine two weeks ago along with Estanguet and others to ease fears about water quality, said after Beaugrand won the first Olympic gold in the river: \"How special to see her swimming in the Seine, thank you for making us so proud!\"\n\n\"I wasn't very worried about the Seine River because we swam last year and no one was sick after that, so I was confident we could swim today and it would have been a shame if we didn't,\" Beaugrand said. Olympic triathletes participated in a test event in the river last August.\n\nElevated levels of bacteria in the river pushed the men's race originally planned for Tuesday to Wednesday, when the women's competition had been scheduled. The women began their race at 8 a.m., while the men started at 10:45 a.m. Test events meant to allow the athletes to familiarize themselves with the course had already been canceled for the same reason on Sunday and Monday.\n\nThe water quality in the Seine is directly affected by rainfall that can lead to wastewater runoff flowing into the river. Heavy rain fell during Friday's opening ceremony, and rain continued for most of the day Saturday.\n\nEvery day since Sunday, even as organizers announced cancellations or postponements, they continued to express confidence that the swims in the Seine would go forward as planned the next day. For several days they did not publicly release the data on levels of E. coli and other bacteria that contributed to their decisions.\n\nHigh levels of E. coli in water can indicate contamination from sewage. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous. Even a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and the germ can cause illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or in the intestines.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive give a range of E. coli levels from \"excellent\" to \"sufficient.\" Anything beyond 900 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters is not considered safe or \"sufficient.\" But experts stressed that these numbers are simply guidelines used to assess risk.\n\nPlus, Aur\u00e9lie Merle, the Paris 2024 director of sports, told reporters Tuesday that water samples are taken 21 1/2 hours before decisions are made about the swim. That leaves uncertainty about their accuracy the day of the race.\n\nMerle said Tuesday that testing results showed \"we're very close to the threshold of triathlon.\" She noted that one of four test sites along the triathlon course was below the threshold for E. coli. Two other sites were just above the limit and one was more elevated, she said, citing a range of 980 to 1,553.\n\n\"We know the sun and the heat have a very strong impact on the quality of the water,\" she said, hoping that a heat wave that hit most of France on Tuesday would help improve water quality.\n\nOrganizers have said the marathon swimming races, scheduled for Aug. 8-9, could be relocated, if needed, to the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium in the greater Paris region, which already hosts rowing and canoeing competitions and can accommodate up to 15,000 spectators.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer John Leicester contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "kurv.com",

The risky levels of E. coli have already led to swim training to be canceled and on Tuesday the men's competition being pushed back.\n\nOfficials remain hopeful the swimming portion of the race will be able to go forward in the long-polluted river Wednesday - or in the coming days. The women\u00b4s competition also is scheduled for Wednesday, but both will only happen if water tests show safe levels of E. coli and other bacteria in the river.\n\nAnother potential hiccup: A forecast of rain beginning Tuesday night and running through Thursday could complicate efforts to reschedule the events. Rain generally causes bacteria levels in the Seine to rise.\n\nIf the river isn\u00b4t safe for swimming, that portion of the race could potentially be scrapped and only the cycling and running parts would be staged to determine the medal winners.\n\nThere are three triathlon races that will be held at the Paris Games - the men\u00b4s and women\u00b4s competitions, along with a mixed relay. In the triathlon world, the order of events is swimming, biking and running primarily out of safety concerns. The Olympic triathlon distance for the men and women is slightly less than a mile (1.5 kilometers) for the swim, 25 miles (40 kilometers) for cycling and then a 6.2-mile (10K) run.\n\nA boat sails past reproductions of artworks decorating the banks of the River Seineat the 2024 Summer Olympics, Tuesday, July 30, 2024, in Paris, France.

(AP Photo/ Dar Yasin)\n\nIt\u00b4s been part of the Olympic program since the 2000 Sydney Olympics.\n\n\"Pretty crazy to be here after dreaming of it for so long,\" said 27-year-old U.S. triathlete Seth Rider, who took up the sport when he was 6 years old.\n\nLike everyone, triathletes are just waiting on the water-quality reports to come back favorable. In the meantime, they still need to train.\n\nThere are plenty of places to run, of course, even through the busy side streets around the Arrondissements of Paris. High-speed cycling has places, too. But to train for an open-water swim, one option could be the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium in the greater Paris region.\n\nOr, possibly even a hotel pool. But of course that would mean lots and lots and lots of laps to get in the work they need.\n\nThe women\u00b4s and men\u00b4s marathon swimming events are set for Aug. 8 and Aug. 9. For those competitions, backup plans could include relocating, if needed, to the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium. It already hosts rowing and canoeing competitions and can accommodate up to 15,000 spectators.\n\nThat said, it's not easy to just pick up and move the triathlon. One part is predicated on another.\n\nAfter the swim, racers go through a transition area to get to their bikes. After cycling, another transition to prepare for the run. The routes are already set up for cycling and running.\n\nShould the river not clear up, the swimming part could always be nixed and the race feature only cycling and running. That was the case last year at the European Championships when the format was switched to a \"duathlon\" because of water-quality issues.\n\nAsked if that might be unfair to triathletes who excel in the water, World Triathlon president Marisol Casado responded: \"It\u00b4s just another situation of the competition.\"\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games\n\nA man wipes his face as he walks past reproductions of artworks decorating the banks of the River Seineat the 2024 Summer Olympics, Tuesday, July 30, 2024, in Paris, France.

Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous. Even a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and the germ can cause illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or in the intestines.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive give a range of E. coli levels from \"excellent\" to \"sufficient.\" Anything beyond 900 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters is not considered safe or \"sufficient.\" But experts stressed that these numbers are simply guidelines used to assess risk.\n\nPlus, Aur\u00e9lie Merle, the Paris 2024 director of sports, told reporters Tuesday that water samples are taken 21 and a half hours before decisions are made about the swim. That leaves uncertainty about their accuracy the day of the race.\n\nMerle said Tuesday that testing results showed \"we're very close to the threshold of triathlon.\" She noted that one of four test sites along the triathlon course was below the threshold for E. coli. Two other sites were just above the limit and one was more elevated, she said, citing a range of 980 to 1,553.\n\n\"We know the sun and the heat have a very strong impact on the quality of the water,\" she said, hoping that a heat wave that hit most of France on Tuesday would help improve water quality enough for the swims to go ahead.\n\nOrganizers have said the marathon swimming races, scheduled for Aug. 8 and 9, could be relocated, if needed, to the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium in the greater Paris region, which already hosts rowing and canoeing competitions and can accommodate up to 15,000 spectators.\n\nEfforts to make the river suitable for swimming included the construction of a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from flowing into the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo very publicly took a swim in the river two weeks ago, along with Paris 2024 chief Tony Estanguet; Marc Guillaume, the top government official for the Paris region; and swimmers from local swimming clubs. Data released last week show that E. coli levels at the Bras Marie were at 985 units per 100 milliliters that day, slightly above the established threshold.\n\n___\n\nAP Olympics:

World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive give a range of E. coli levels from \"excellent\" to \"sufficient.\" Anything beyond 900 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters is not considered safe or \"sufficient.\" But experts stressed that these numbers are simply guidelines used to assess risk.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nPlus, Aur\u00e9lie Merle, the Paris 2024 director of sports, told reporters Tuesday that water samples are taken 21 and a half hours before decisions are made about the swim. That leaves uncertainty about their accuracy the day of the race.\n\nMerle said Tuesday that testing results showed \"we're very close to the threshold of triathlon.\" She noted that one of four test sites along the triathlon course was below the threshold for E. coli. Two other sites were just above the limit and one was more elevated, she said, citing a range of 980 to 1,553.\n\n\"We know the sun and the heat have a very strong impact on the quality of the water,\" she said, hoping that a heat wave that hit most of France on Tuesday would help improve water quality enough for the swims to go ahead.\n\nOrganizers have said the marathon swimming races, scheduled for Aug. 8 and 9, could be relocated, if needed, to the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium in the greater Paris region, which already hosts rowing and canoeing competitions and can accommodate up to 15,000 spectators.\n\nEfforts to make the river suitable for swimming included the construction of a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from flowing into the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo very publicly took a swim in the river two weeks ago, along with Paris 2024 chief Tony Estanguet; Marc Guillaume, the top government official for the Paris region; and swimmers from local swimming clubs. Data released last week show that E. coli levels at the Bras Marie were at 985 units per 100 milliliters that day, slightly above the established threshold.\n\nAP Olympics:

30 (UPI) -- Following days of uncertainty over the water quality of Paris' famed Seine River, Olympic organizers said recent tests showed that the triathlon events set for Wednesday morning can go ahead as planned.\n\nThe women's triathlon event is scheduled for 8 a.m. Wednesday followed by the men's triathlon at 10:45 a.m.\n\n\"We will swim,\" World Triathlon said Wednesday morning in a post on X.\n\nThe announcement comes after water analyses received at 3:20 a.m. local time Wednesday showed levels compliant with World Triathlon standards, the sport's governing body and Paris Olympics organizers said in a statement.\n\nThe men's triathlon was originally scheduled for 8 a.m. Tuesday but was postponed following failed water quality tests of the Seine River where athletes are to compete in the swim portion of the three-leg race.\n\nConcerns over whether the triathlons would take place had long been stoked heading into the Olympics as swimming in the Seine has been banned for a century.\n\nOver the course of nearly a decade, some $1.5 billion has been spent to improve the environmental and sanitary quality of the water in the Seine to make it swimmable in the long term and, on the short term, an Olympic venue this week.\n\nAs recently as last month, a report was published showing the river was still too unsafe for swimming.\n\nBut efforts continued, and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip in the river two weeks ago to show it was on track for good showing at the Olympics.\n\nHowever, heavy rains on Friday and Saturday resulted in a drop in the river's water quality, forcing organizers to postpone the men's race on Tuesday.\n\nFriday was slated as a contingency date.\n\nThe triathlon is not the only event using the Seine for Olympic competition.\n\nThe women's 10-km marathon swimming event is scheduled to take place 7:30 a.m. on Aug. 8, with the men's event scheduled for the same time the following day.\n\nFor both events, athletes are to swim a 1.67-km loop of the Seine.", "source": {"uri": "bnd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belleville News-Democrat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darryl_coote@bnd.com", "name": "Darryl Coote", "type":

The steady drizzle tapered off just as the athletes for the women's triathlon splashed into the water. Some of the triathletes dunked their swim goggles in the Seine before putting them on and heading into the river with the Eiffel Tower in the background.\n\nCassandre Beaugrand of France won the women's race -- and the country's first-ever Olympic medal in the individual triathlon -- finishing the run on top of the Pont Alexandre III bridge and collapsing to the ground in exhaustion and exhilaration.\n\n\"I have no doubts about the quality of the Seine. We've swum in worse water,\" Beaugrand said after her victory, adding that scrapping the swim and holding a duathlon -- the organizers' last resort if the river had been too dirty -- would have been \"shameful\" for the sport.\n\nBeaugrand's time of 1 hour, 54 minutes, 55 seconds edged Julie Derron of Switzerland by six seconds. Britain's Beth Potter captured bronze.\n\nBritain's Alex Yee won gold in the men's triathlon. New Zealand's Hayden Wilde won silver, and Leo Bergere of France took the bronze.\n\nThe decision to go ahead with the swim for the triathlon competitions was a big win for the city, Olympics organizers and the athletes. Officials undertook an ambitious plan, including $1.5 billion in infrastructure improvements, to clean up the long-polluted Seine and have been steadfast in their insistence that the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming events next week could safely be held in the river.\n\nThe organizers said early Wednesday that the latest tests of the water showed compliance with quality standards. But the early morning rain could have altered those figures.\n\n\"The problem is always worse when there's a heavy rainfall, because it kind of overwhelms the pipes and you also get all the runoff from the street. All that lands in the Seine,\" said Dr. Nicole Iovine, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Florida. \"They've done a lot to try to improve the quality of the water. But the truth is you're at the mercy of Mother Nature.\"\n\nAs they swam, the women stayed close to the barges and boats that line the banks of the river. Spectators watched and cheered form the stands set up along the side and from the bridges spanning the waterway. Reigning Olympic champion Flora Duffy of Bermuda was the first out of the water, taking about 22 minutes to complete the 1.5-kilometer course.\n\nAfter swimming two laps in the Seine, the athletes emerged from the water and ran up a set of stairs to jump on their bikes for a ride through the rain-soaked streets of Paris, including the iconic Champs-Elysees. There were several wipeouts and spills early in the bike race.\n\nElevated levels of bacteria in the river pushed the men's race originally planned for Tuesday to Wednesday, when the women's competition had been scheduled. Test events meant to allow the athletes to familiarize themselves with the course were canceled Sunday and Monday due to the water conditions.\n\nEvery day since Sunday, even as organizers announced cancellations or postponements, they continued to express confidence that the swims in the Seine would go forward as planned the next day. For several days they did not publicly release the data on levels of E. coli and other bacteria that contributed to their decisions.\n\nHigh levels of E. coli in water can indicate contamination from sewage. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals, but others can be dangerous. Even a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and the germ can cause illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or in the intestines.\n\nWorld Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive give a range of E. coli levels from \"excellent\" to \"sufficient.\" Anything beyond 900 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters is not considered safe or \"sufficient.\" But experts stressed that these numbers are simply guidelines used to assess risk.\n\nAur\u00e9lie Merle, the Paris 2024 director of sports, told reporters Tuesday that water samples are taken 21\u00bd hours before decisions are made about the swim. That leaves uncertainty about their accuracy the day of the race.\n\nMerle said Tuesday that testing results showed \"we're very close to the threshold of triathlon.\" She noted that one of four test sites along the triathlon course was below the threshold for E. coli. Two other sites were just above the limit, and one was more elevated, she said, citing a range of 980 to 1,553.\n\n\"We know the sun and the heat have a very strong impact on the quality of the water,\" she said, hoping that a heat wave that hit most of France on Tuesday would help improve water quality enough for the swims to go ahead.\n\nOrganizers have said the marathon swimming races, scheduled for Aug. 8 and 9, could be relocated, if needed, to the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium in the greater Paris region, which already hosts rowing and canoeing competitions and can accommodate up to 15,000 spectators.\n\nThe Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "ktbb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBB"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Heavy rains fell during Friday's Olympic opening ceremony, and rain continued for most of the day Saturday.\n\nEvery day since Sunday, even as organisers announced cancellations or postponements, they continued to express confidence that the swims in the Seine would go forward as planned the next day.\n\nFor several days they did not publicly release the data on levels of E. coli and other bacteria that contributed to their decisions.\n\nHigh levels of E. coli in water can indicate contamination from sewage. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous.\n\nEven a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhoea, and the germ can cause illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or in the intestines.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria E. coli.\n\nWorld Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive give a range of E. coli levels from \"excellent\" to \"sufficient.\"\n\nAnything beyond 900 colony-forming units per 100 millilitres is not considered safe or \"sufficient.\" But experts stressed that these numbers are simply guidelines used to assess risk.\n\nPlus, Aur\u00e9lie Merle, the Paris 2024 director of sports, told reporters Tuesday that water samples are taken 21-and-a-half hours before decisions are made about the swim.\n\nThat leaves uncertainty about their accuracy the day of the race.\n\nMerle said Tuesday that testing results showed \"we're very close to the threshold of triathlon.\"\n\nShe noted that one of four test sites along the triathlon course was below the threshold for E. coli. Two other sites were just above the limit and one was more elevated, she said, citing a range of 980 to 1,553.\n\nOrganisers have said the marathon swimming races, scheduled for August 8 and 9, could be relocated if needed to the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium in the greater Paris region, which already hosts rowing and canoeing competitions and can accommodate up to 15,000 spectators.\n\nEfforts to make the river suitable for swimming included the construction of a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from flowing into the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo very publicly took a swim in the river two weeks ago, along with Paris 2024 chief Tony Estanguet; Marc Guillaume, the top government official for the Paris region; and swimmers from local swimming clubs.\n\nData released last week show that E. coli levels at the Bras Marie were at 985 units per 100 millilitres that day, slightly above the established threshold.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tuesday.\n\nImage: Reuters/Fabrizio Bensch\n\nOrganisers cleared the Olympic women's and men's triathlons to go ahead on Wednesday after the latest Seine river water tests showed lower levels of bacteria, ending days of uncertainty over whether the central Paris swim was viable after heavy rains.\n\nThe men's triathlon had been scheduled to take place on Tuesday but was postponed until Wednesday after the river failed water quality tests.\n\nNews that the races would go ahead on Wednesday came as a relief for teams and athletes, as well as for Paris authorities who have promised residents a swimmable Seine as a long-term legacy of the Games, with the triathlon a very public test.\n\n\"It is with great joy that we received this news,\" Benjamin Maze, technical director for France's triathlon federation, told Reuters. \"Now that we know we will race, we can mentally switch fully into competition mode.\"\n\nFifty-five women representing 34 countries will kick off the contest at 8am Paris time, with France's Cassandre Beaugrand and Britain's Beth Potter, two of the top contenders for gold, set to dive into the river side by side.\n\nThe men's event will take place at 10:45am, immediately after the women's race.\n\n\"The results of the latest water analyses, received at 3.20am, have been assessed as compliant by World Triathlon allowing for the triathlon competitions to take place,\" Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a statement.\n\nParis has spent \u20ac1.4bn of public money on wastewater infrastructure to contain sewage and minimise spillage into the river, and Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip earlier this month in a bid to convince doubters that the water will not make them ill.\n\nThe decision to postpone the men's race at the last minute on Tuesday had triggered anger among some athletes.\n\n\"If the priority was the health of the athletes this event would have been moved to another location a long time ago,\" Belgium's Marten Van Riel wrote on World Triathlon's Instagram page.\n\n\"We are just puppets in a puppet show.\"\n\nThe gamble that the river would be clean enough for the triathlon was never guaranteed to pay off as water quality varies widely day-to-day, with rainfall causing concentrations of infection-causing bacteria like E. coli to rise.\n\nWednesday's races were given the green light despite rain overnight and forecasts for showers around midday which could hit towards the end of the men's event.\n\nOrganisers make the call based on analysis of river samples taken the previous day at 5am combined with a

The steady rain tapered off just as the athletes splashed into the water. Some of the triathletes dunked their swim goggles in the Seine before putting them on and heading into the river with the Eiffel Tower in the background.\n\nThe decision to go ahead with the swim for the triathlon competitions was a big deal for the city, Olympics organizers and the athletes. Officials undertook an ambitious plan, including 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in infrastructure improvements, to clean up the long-polluted Seine and have been steadfast in their insistence that the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming events next week could safely be held in the river.\n\nThe organizers said early Wednesday the latest tests of the water showed compliance with quality standards. That came after days of uncertainty following heavy rains on Friday and Saturday.\n\n\"The problem is always worse when there's a heavy rainfall, because it kind of overwhelms the pipes and you also get all the runoff from the street.

But the truth is you're at the mercy of Mother Nature.\"\n\nAs they swam, the women stayed close to the barges and boats that line the banks of the river.

Reigning Olympic champion Flora Duffy of Bermuda was the first out of the water, taking about 22 minutes to complete the 1.5-kilometer course.\n\nAfter swimming two laps in the Seine, the athletes emerged from the water and ran up a set of stairs to jump on their bikes for a ride through the rain-soaked streets of Paris, including the iconic Champs-Elysees. There were numerous crashes and wipeouts along the wet roads. There were blue skies when the triathletes began the final portion of the race, a 10-kilometer run.\n\nFrance's Cassandre Beaugrand won gold in the women's event, while Switzerland's Julie Derron took silver and Great Britain's Beth Potter got the bronze medal.\n\nElevated levels of bacteria in the river pushed the men's race originally planned for Tuesday to Wednesday, when the women's competition had been scheduled. The men were slated to start about three hours after the women's race. Test events meant to allow the athletes to familiarize themselves with the course had already been canceled for the same reason on Sunday and Monday.\n\nThe water quality in the Seine is directly affected by rainfall that can lead to wastewater runoff flowing into the river. Heavy rains fell during Friday's Olympic opening ceremony, and rain continued for most of the day Saturday.\n\nEvery day since Sunday, even as organizers announced cancellations or postponements, they continued to express confidence that the swims in the Seine would go forward as planned the next day. For several days they did not publicly release the data on levels of E. coli and other bacteria that contributed to their decisions.\n\nHigh levels of E. coli in water can indicate contamination from sewage. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous. Even a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and the germ can cause illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or in the intestines.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive give a range of E. coli levels from \"excellent\" to \"sufficient.\" Anything beyond 900 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters is not considered safe or \"sufficient.\" But experts stressed that these numbers are simply guidelines used to assess risk.\n\nPlus, Aurelie Merle, the Paris 2024 director of sports, told reporters Tuesday that water samples are taken 21 and a half hours before decisions are made about the swim. That leaves uncertainty about their accuracy the day of the race.\n\nMerle said Tuesday that testing results showed \"we're very close to the threshold of triathlon.\" She noted that one of four test sites along the triathlon course was below the threshold for E. coli. Two other sites were just above the limit and one was more elevated, she said, citing a range of 980 to 1,553.\n\n\"We know the sun and the heat have a very strong impact on the quality of the water,\" she said, hoping that a heat wave that hit most of France on Tuesday would help improve water quality.\n\nOrganizers have said the marathon swimming races, scheduled for Aug. 8 and 9, could be relocated, if needed, to the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium in the greater Paris region, which already hosts rowing and canoeing competitions and can accommodate up to 15,000 spectators.",

The steady drizzle tapered off just as the athletes splashed into the water. Some of the triathletes dunked their swim goggles in the Seine before putting them on and heading into the river with the Eiffel Tower in the background.\n\nThe decision to go ahead with the swim for the triathlon competitions is a big win for the city, Olympics organizers and the athletes. Officials undertook an ambitious plan, including 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in infrastructure improvements, to clean up the long-polluted Seine and have been steadfast in their insistence that the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming events next week could safely be held in the river.\n\nThe organizers said early Wednesday the latest tests of the water showed compliance with quality standards. But the early morning rain could have altered those figures.\n\n\"The problem is always worse when there's a heavy rainfall, because it kind of overwhelms the pipes and you also get all the runoff from the street. All that lands in the Seine,\" explained Dr. Nicole Iovine, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Florida. \"They've done a lot to try to improve the quality of the water. But the truth is you're at the mercy of Mother Nature.\"\n\nAs they swam, the women stayed close to the barges and boats that line the banks of the river. Spectators watched and cheered form the stands set up along the side and from the bridges spanning the waterway. Reigning Olympic champion Flora Duffy of Bermuda was the first out of the water, taking about 22 minutes to complete the 1.5-kilometer course.\n\nAfter swimming two laps in the Seine, the athletes emerged from the water and ran up a set of stairs to jump on their bikes for a ride through the rain-soaked streets of Paris, including the iconic Champs-Elysees. There were several wipeouts and spills early in the bike race.\n\nElevated levels of bacteria in the river pushed the men's race originally planned for Tuesday to Wednesday, when the women's competition had been scheduled. The men were slated to start about three hours after the women's race. Test events meant to allow the athletes to familiarize themselves with the course had already been canceled for the same reason on Sunday and Monday.\n\nThe water quality in the Seine is directly affected by rainfall that can lead to wastewater runoff flowing into the river. Heavy rains fell during Friday's Olympic opening ceremony, and rain continued for most of the day Saturday.\n\nEvery day since Sunday, even as organizers announced cancellations or postponements, they continued to express confidence that the swims in the Seine would go forward as planned the next day. For several days they did not publicly release the data on levels of E. coli and other bacteria that contributed to their decisions.\n\nHigh levels of E. coli in water can indicate contamination from sewage. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous. Even a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and the germ can cause illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or in the intestines.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive give a range of E. coli levels from \"excellent\" to \"sufficient.\" Anything beyond 900 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters is not considered safe or \"sufficient.\" But experts stressed that these numbers are simply guidelines used to assess risk.\n\nPlus, Aur\u00e9lie Merle, the Paris 2024 director of sports, told reporters Tuesday that water samples are taken 21 and a half hours before decisions are made about the swim. That leaves uncertainty about their accuracy the day of the race.\n\nMerle said Tuesday that testing results showed \"we're very close to the threshold of triathlon.\" She noted that one of four test sites along the triathlon course was below the threshold for E. coli. Two other sites were just above the limit and one was more elevated, she said, citing a range of 980 to 1,553.\n\n\"We know the sun and the heat have a very strong impact on the quality of the water,\" she said, hoping that a heat wave that hit most of France on Tuesday would help improve water quality enough for the swims to go ahead.\n\nOrganizers have said the marathon swimming races, scheduled for Aug. 8 and 9, could be relocated, if needed, to the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium in the greater Paris region, which already hosts rowing and canoeing competitions and can accommodate up to 15,000 spectators.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "mynorthwest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My Northwest"}, "authors":

Officials hope the swimming portion of the event can soon proceed following the expensive cleanup effort.\n\nOrganizers plan to hold the men's triathlon on Wednesday instead. The women's competition is also scheduled for the same day, but both events will only happen if water tests show acceptable levels of E. coli and other bacteria. Friday is the backup date.\n\nHeavy rain and thunderstorms are in the forecast from Tuesday night through Thursday, which could complicate the rescheduling. Rain, like the downpour that dampened Friday's Opening Ceremony, generally causes bacteria levels in the Seine to rise.\n\n\"It's disappointing that there's this negative aspect now with the delay,\" American triathlete Seth Rider told the Associated Press. \"But I hope we can have a triathlon, and I can accomplish this dream that I've had since I was a little kid.\"\n\nSwimming has been off-limits in the long-polluted Seine for more than a century. In preparation for the Games, the city promised to clean its famed river to demonstrate that hosting the Olympics would provide benefits to skeptical Parisians.\n\nThe city invested millions in building a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and prevent untreated waste from flowing into the Seine, renovating the sewage system, and upgrading water treatment plants.\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo has been a vocal advocate for the cleanup, even taking a symbolic swim in the Seine to demonstrate her confidence in the project's success.\n\n\"Our objective is an Olympic legacy,\" said Pierre Rabadan, the deputy mayor overseeing the project. \"That you and I or whoever happens to be in Paris can swim in the Seine.\"\n\nSwimming could be scrapped\n\nDespite those best efforts, Mother Nature intervened at the worst possible time, delivering torrential rain to central Paris all day on Friday, before and during the Opening ceremony and persisting into Saturday. Training events meant to let the triathletes familiarize themselves with the course were canceled on both Sunday and Monday due to water quality concerns.\n\nOrganizers had expressed confidence in recent days that bacteria levels would improve as skies cleared and temperatures warmed this week, but that was not sufficient to ensure the athletes' safety on Tuesday.\n\n\"Despite the improvement in water quality levels in the last hours, the readings at some points of the swim course are still above the acceptable limits,\" organizers said, stressing that their \"priority is the health of the athletes.\"\n\nIf the river isn't safe for swimming after continued delays, that part of the race would be scrapped and only the cycling and running portions would go forward. Something similar happened last year at the European Championships in Madrid, when the triathlon format was switched due to water quality issues in the Casa de Campo lake.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure E. coli levels, which indicate sewage contamination. While most E. coli strains are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy people and animals, some can be dangerous. Swallowing contaminated water can cause diarrhea and illnesses like urinary tract or intestinal infections.\n\nWorld Triathlon, the international governing body for the multi-discipline sport, has water safety guidelines that, along with a 2006 European Union directive, set the safe limit for E. coli at 900 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters. On Tuesday, one of the four test sites was below this threshold. However, two sites were just above the limit, and one site had much higher levels, ranging from 980 to 1,553.\n\nSome experts and residents remain skeptical.

the Olympic women's and men's triathlons to go ahead on Wednesday after the latest Seine river water tests showed lower levels of bacteria, ending days of uncertainty over whether the central Paris swim was viable after heavy rains.\n\nThe men's triathlon had been scheduled to take place today but was postponed until Wednesday after the river failed water quality tests.\n\nNews that the races would go ahead on Wednesday came as a relief for teams and athletes, as well as for Paris authorities who have promised residents a swimmable Seine as a long-term legacy of the Games, with the triathlon a very public test.\n\n\"It is with great joy that we received this news,\" Benjamin Maze, technical director for France's triathlon federation, told Reuters. \"Now that we know we will race, we can mentally switch fully into competition mode.\"\n\nFifty-five women representing 34 countries will kick off the contest at 8 a.m. (0600 GMT), with France's Cassandre Beaugrand and Britain's Beth Potter, two of the top contenders for gold, set to dive into the river side by side.\n\nThe men's event will take place at 10:45 a.m., immediately after the women's race.\n\n\"The results of the latest water analyses, received at 3.20 a.m., have been assessed as compliant by World Triathlon allowing for the triathlon competitions to take place,\" Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a statement.\n\nParis has spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.52 billion) of public money on wastewater infrastructure to contain sewage and minimise spillage into the river, and Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip earlier this month in a bid to convince doubters that the water will not make them ill.\n\nThe decision to postpone the men's race at the last minute today had triggered anger among some athletes.\n\n\"If the priority was the health of the athletes this event would have been moved to another location a long time ago,\" Belgium's Marten Van Riel wrote on World Triathlon's Instagram page.\n\n\"We are just puppets in a puppet show.\"\n\nThe gamble that the river would be clean enough for the triathlon was never guaranteed to pay off as water quality varies widely day-to-day, with rainfall causing concentrations of infection-causing bacteria like E. coli to rise.\n\nWednesday's races were given the green light despite rain overnight and forecasts for showers around midday which could hit towards the end of the men's event.\n\nOrganisers make the call based on analysis of river samples taken the previous day at 5 a.m. combined with a discussion between experts on overnight weather, according to Paris 2024.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@staradvertiser.com", "name":

Friday is also planned as a backup date.\n\nBut Meteo-France, the French weather service, was forecasting storms Tuesday night, light rain Wednesday afternoon and storms Thursday, which could complicate rescheduling the events.\n\nHeavy rains generally cause levels of E. coli and other bacteria in the Seine to rise. Paris experienced a downpour during the Olympic opening ceremony Friday, with rain continuing into Saturday.\n\nThe swimming portion of training events, meant to let the triathletes familiarize themselves with the course, was cancelled on both Sunday and Monday because of concerns over water quality.\n\nThe decision to postpone the men's triathlon followed a meeting early Tuesday morning that included the sport's governing body, World Triathlon, its medical team and city officials.\n\nTriathlon Canada high performance director Phil Dunne noted safety as the top priority when dealing with uncontrollable variables in any open water event.\n\nWe have full confidence in World Triathlon and Paris 2024's mitigation plans to prioritize the health and safety of our athletes, while continuously monitoring the water conditions in Paris and developing appropriate plans that ensure the events are executed safely and as anticipated, he said.\n\nCanadians Tyler Mislawchuk and Olympic rookie Charles Paquet are among 55 athletes scheduled to race.\n\nMislawchuk of Oak Bluff, Man., would be making his third Olympic appearance after placing 15th in 2016 (Rio) and 2021 (Tokyo). Paquet, who hails from Port-Cartier, Que., was seventh in an Olympic qualification race in Italy two months ago after placing a career-best fifth in a World Triathlon Championship Series race in Yokohama, Japan.\n\nSimon Whitfield earned Canada's only two Olympic triathlon medals, when the sport made its 2000 Olympic debut in Sydney and eight years later in Beijing.\n\nOrganizers and city officials had expressed confidence that bacteria levels would improve as skies cleared and temperatures warmed in the days that followed, but that apparently wasn't sufficient to ensure the athletes' safety.\n\nWATCH | Flushing the Seine of fecal bacteria before Olympic athletes dive in:\n\nSome strains of E. coli can be dangerous\n\nParis made an enormous effort to improve the water quality in the long-polluted Seine so the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming event in August could be held in the famed river that runs through the city centre. But bacteria levels have remained in flux.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of fecal bacteria known as E. coli, with a safe limit of 900 colony-forming units per 100 millilitres determined by European rules. Monitoring group Eau de Paris releases data each Friday, but it is updated only through the previous Tuesday.\n\nHigh levels of E. coli in water can indicate contamination from sewage. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous. Even a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and the germ can cause illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or in the intestines.\n\nEfforts to make the river suitable for swimming cost just over $2 billion. They include the construction of a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from flowing into the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo very publicly took a swim in the river two weeks ago, along with Paris 2024 chief Tony Estanguet, and the top government official for the Paris region, Marc Guillaume, along with swimmers from local swimming clubs.\n\nData released last week shows that E. coli levels at the Bras Marie area of the Seine were at 985 units per 100 millilitres that day, slightly above the established threshold.\n\nOther swimming events planned in the Seine are the triathlon mixed relay on Aug. 5 and women's and men's marathon swimming events Aug. 8 and Aug. 9.",

Officials invested \u20ac1.4 billion in infrastructure to clean the Seine, insisting it would be safe for both the triathlon and next week's marathon swimming events.\n\nLatest tests, as of early Wednesday, confirmed the water meets quality standards. Elevated bacteria levels had postponed the men's race, initially scheduled for Tuesday, to Wednesday, the same day as the women's race. Rainfall had exacerbated wastewater runoff into the river, complicating efforts to maintain water quality.\n\nHigh levels of E. coli, a bacteria indicating sewage contamination, were a primary concern. While most E. coli strains are harmless, some can cause serious illness if ingested through contaminated water. Water quality tests measured fecal bacteria levels, with safe swimming conditions set at below 900 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters.\n\nDespite uncertainties, confidence remained high among organizers, even as they withheld detailed public data on bacteria levels. Results indicated some test sites were near acceptable thresholds, and organizers hoped that recent heat would improve water quality.\n\nThe marathon swimming events could be moved to another venue if needed. Significant investments included a basin to manage rainwater, infrastructure renovation, and wastewater treatment upgrades. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo and other officials recently swam in the Seine to demonstrate their confidence in the river's safety, though data showed E. coli levels slightly above the threshold.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Waterway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marathon swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wastewater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_runoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surface runoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Escherichia coli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater_treatment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wastewater treatment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hidalgo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anne Hidalgo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Disabled", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/15_06_2024_08_06_52_403123.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776638", "eventUri": "eng-9776638", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The steady drizzle tapered off just as the athletes splashed into the water. Some of the triathletes dunked their swim goggles in the Seine before putting them on.\n\nThe decision to go ahead with the swim for the triathlon competitions is a big win for the city, Olympics organizers and the athletes. Officials undertook an ambitious plan, including 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in infrastructure improvements, to clean up the long-polluted Seine and have been steadfast in their insistence that the swimming portion of the triathlon and the marathon swimming events next week could safely be held in the river.\n\nThe organisers said early Wednesday the latest tests of the water showed compliance with quality standards.\n\nElevated levels of bacteria in the river pushed the men's race originally planned for Tuesday to Wednesday, when the women's competition had been scheduled.

Spectators watched and cheered from stands along the side and from bridges spanning the waterway. Reigning Olympic champion Flora Duffy of Bermuda was the first out of the water, completing the 1.5-kilometer course in about 22 minutes.\n\nAfter swimming two laps in the Seine, the athletes ran up a set of stairs to transition to their bikes for a ride through the rain-soaked streets of Paris, including the iconic Champs-Elysees. Several wipeouts and spills occurred early in the bike race.\n\nElevated levels of bacteria in the river pushed the men's race, originally scheduled for Tuesday, to Wednesday, the same day as the women's competition. The men were slated to start about three hours after the women's race. Test events meant to familiarize athletes with the course had already been canceled for the same reason on Sunday and Monday.\n\nThe water quality in the Seine is directly affected by rainfall, which can lead to wastewater runoff into the river. Heavy rains fell during Friday's Olympic opening ceremony and continued through Saturday.\n\nEven as organizers announced cancellations or postponements, they expressed confidence that the swims would proceed as planned the following day. For several days, they did not publicly release data on E. coli and other bacteria levels that influenced their decisions.\n\nHigh levels of E. coli can indicate sewage contamination. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals, but others can be dangerous. Even a mouthful of contaminated water can cause diarrhea and infections in the urinary tract or intestines.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure E. coli levels. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive provide a range from \"excellent\" to \"sufficient.\" Anything beyond 900 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters is not considered safe. Experts emphasize that these numbers are guidelines used to assess risk.\n\nAur\u00e9lie Merle, Paris 2024's director of sports, said Tuesday that water samples are taken 21.5 hours before decisions are made about the swim, leaving some uncertainty about their accuracy on the day of the race.\n\nMerle noted that testing results showed \"we're very close to the threshold for triathlon.\" She mentioned that one of four test sites along the triathlon course was below the E. coli threshold, while two sites were just above the limit, and one was more elevated, with levels ranging from 980 to 1,553.\n\n\"We know the sun and heat have a strong impact on water quality,\" she said, hoping that a heat wave affecting much of France on Tuesday would improve water quality enough for the swims to proceed.\n\nOrganizers have said that if needed, the marathon swimming races, scheduled for Aug. 8 and 9, could be relocated to the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium in the greater Paris region, which already hosts rowing and canoeing competitions and can accommodate up to 15,000 spectators.", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In the cycling portion of the race, several athletes fell after slipping on the slippery roads. Vittoria Lopes of Brazil was among the leaders when she fell but fell out of contention.\n\nFrance's Cassandre Beaugrand eventually was crowned women's triathlon Olympic champion on home soil, roared across the finish line by a boisterous French crowd that broke out into a rendition 'La Marseillaise.'\n\nThe men's race is set to begin at 4:45 a.m. ET.\n\nRains impacting water quality\n\nHeavy rains battered Paris over the weekend, drenching Friday's opening ceremony and raising concerns about water quality in the river, which usually declines after rainfall.\n\nTraining was canceled for a second straight day on Monday after water quality testing deemed the water unsafe for athletes, but organizers were confident at the time that Tuesday's race would go ahead as planned.\n\nThe decision to hold some swimming events in the famous river that splits Paris raised eyebrows when it was first announced. Swimming in the Seine has been illegal for a century but, in their desire to put the host city on full display, organizers worked up a plan to clean up the river so the world's best athletes could use it during Paris 2024.\n\nAbout $1.5 billion (1.4 billion Euros) has been spent trying to clean up the river ahead of the Games and Paris officials have made a big show of displaying its suitability. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo swam in the river earlier this month to display her confidence in the river's water quality and promised to put a swimming pool in the river after the Games. The French sports minister has also gone for a dip in the Seine.\n\nOne of the key infrastructure projects designed to help tackle pollution has been a new rainwater storage basin - called the Austerlitz basin - which can hold 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water, according to a statement from Paris 2024.\n\nFollowing rainy weather on June 17 and 18, the basin filled to 80% capacity, successfully preventing 40,000 cubic meters (40 million liters) of wastewater and rainwater from being discharged into the Seine, according to the city of Paris.\n\nBut the water quality can change fast. Official data shows one-off rainfall events can quickly cause E. coli levels to spike again, and as recently as June 30 - following rain the previous day - E. coli levels increased to around 2000 CFU/100mL at Alexandra III Bridge, where the race is set to begin.\n\nThat's double the level needed for \"good\" water quality, as per World Triathlon standards.\n\nFor much of the month before the games, E. coli levels were above acceptable levels, which could expose athletes to serious health concerns. If E. Coli levels are above 1000 CFU/100mL, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to World Triathlon competition rules, unless the organization's medical committee decides the race can go ahead.\n\nThe individual triathlon races begin with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race - passing by the Le Grand Palais and the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es - before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city.\n\nA mixed team relay race involving four athletes - two men and two women - will start with each team member completing a 300-meter swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run.\n\nCNN's Homero De La Fuente, Kevin Dotson and Chris Liakos contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",

the Seine on Wednesday for the Olympic women's triathlon after water tests showed lower levels of bacteria, ending days of uncertainty over whether the central Paris swim was viable after heavy rains.\n\nThe triathlon, conceived as a central showpiece of the Paris Olympics, starts and finishes at the Alexandre III bridge at the heart of the French capital and takes athletes along a section of the Champs-Elysees and past monuments including the Musee d'Orsay.\n\nJust as overnight rain was easing, the women began their competition at 8 a.m. (0600 GMT), the triathlon offering spectacular views as they swam in the Seine before racing their bikes into the very heart of Paris.\n\nA handful of athletes, however, crashed off their bicycles after slipping on the wet cobblestones of the Champs-Elysees.\n\nThe men's triathlon had been scheduled to take place on Tuesday but, after the river failed water quality tests, it was postponed to 10:45 a.m. (0845 GMT) on Wednesday, immediately after the women's race.\n\nThe races going ahead will be a relief for teams and athletes, as well as for Paris authorities who have promised residents a swimmable Seine as a long-term legacy of the Games, with the triathlon a very public test.\n\nThe gamble that the river would be clean enough for the triathlon was never guaranteed to pay off as water quality varies widely day-to-day, with rainfall causing concentrations of infection-causing bacteria like E. coli to rise.\n\n\"It is with great joy that we received this news,\" Benjamin Maze, technical director for France's triathlon federation, told Reuters. \"Now that we know we will race, we can mentally switch fully into competition mode.\"\n\nGREEN LIGHT\n\nWednesday's races were given the green light despite rain

again around 5:45 a.m. on Wednesday, making racing conditions more difficult for the bike stage which features some sharp turns and a quarter of the course on cobbled roads.\n\nFifty-five women

take place,\" Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a statement.\n\nParis has spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.52 billion) of public money on wastewater infrastructure to contain sewage and minimise spillage into the river, and Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip earlier this month in a bid to convince doubters that the water will not make them ill.\n\nThe decision to postpone the men's race at the last minute on Tuesday had triggered anger among some athletes.\n\n\"If the priority was the health of the athletes this event would have been moved to another location a long time ago,\" Belgium's

So it's actually hard to control how it can affect the quality of a river.\"\n\nThe postponement is an embarrassing setback for Paris officials who had promoted a cleaned up Seine as a centerpiece of what they and the IOC had described as the most environmentally friendly Games in Olympic history.\n\nFrance spent $1.5 billion on a nine-year clean up the Seine which had been closed to swimmers for 100 years because of the flow of industrial waste and sewage into the river.\n\nParis mayor Anne Hidalgo in particular was champion of the Seine clean up. Hidalgo was supposed to swim in the Seine on June 23 as a sign of confidence in the cleanliness of the river only to have the event scrapped because of high bacteria levels. A June 30 swim was postponed again, this time because of France's snap election.\n\nHidalgo finally got to take the plunge on July 17, pronouncing the Seine \"exquisite.\"\n\n\"The water is very, very good,\" the mayor said. \"A little cool, but not so bad.''\n\nBut local and IOC and international sports officials remain concerned that heavy rains could once again raise bacteria in the river to unsafe levels jeopardizing the marathon swimming and triathlon competitions. Sure enough, Paris received a downpour during last Friday's opening ceremony.\n\n\"Unfortunately, meteorological events beyond our control, such as the rain which fell over Paris on 26 and 27 July, can alter water quality and compel us to reschedule the event for health reasons. Despite the improvement of water quality levels over the last hours, the readings at some points of the swim course are still above the acceptable limits,\" Paris officials said in the communication.Officials had earlier canceled practice swims for the triathletes on Sunday and Monday.Water samples are taken 21 1/2 hours before race decisions have to be made, according to Merle, raising further concerns about the race day water conditions.\n\nAthletes and their coaches were informed of Tuesday's postponement just as they were waking up.\n\n\"The athletes got up a bit before 4 am, they were having breakfast when we received the information from the international federation,\" Bernard Maze, the France Triathlon Federation's technical director, told FranceInfo radio. \"Obviously, there's a bit of anger and a lot of disappointment.\"\n\nThe men's race was moved to 10:45 a.m. (local time), shortly after the completion of the women's race which is scheduled to start at 8 a.m.\n\n\"Both triathlons are subject to the forthcoming water tests complying with the established World Triathlon thresholds for swimming,\" Paris 2024 officials said.\n\nBut both races were threatened by forecasts of thunder storms for the Paris area later Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "dailybreeze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Breeze"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_m_reid@dailybreeze.com", "name": "Scott M.

In the cycling portion of the race, several athletes fell after slipping on the slippery roads. Vittoria Lopes of Brazil was among the leaders when she fell but fell out of contention.\n\nFrance's Cassandre Beaugrand eventually was crowned women's triathlon Olympic champion on home soil, roared across the finish line by a boisterous French crowd that broke out into a rendition 'La Marseillaise.'\n\nThe men's race is set to begin at 4:45 a.m. ET.\n\nRains impacting water quality\n\nHeavy rains battered Paris over the weekend, drenching Friday's opening ceremony and raising concerns about water quality in the river, which usually declines after rainfall.\n\nTraining was canceled for a second straight day on Monday after water quality testing deemed the water unsafe for athletes, but organizers were confident at the time that Tuesday's race would go ahead as planned.\n\nThe decision to hold some swimming events in the famous river that splits Paris raised eyebrows when it was first announced. Swimming in the Seine has been illegal for a century but, in their desire to put the host city on full display, organizers worked up a plan to clean up the river so the world's best athletes could use it during Paris 2024.\n\nAbout $1.5 billion (1.4 billion Euros) has been spent trying to clean up the river ahead of the Games and Paris officials have made a big show of displaying its suitability. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo swam in the river earlier this month to display her confidence in the river's water quality and promised to put a swimming pool in the river after the Games. The French sports minister has also gone for a dip in the Seine.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback\n\nCNN reporter goes swimming in the Seine after $1.5B cleanup. See how it went\n\n01:23 - Source: CNN\n\nOne of the key infrastructure projects designed to help tackle pollution has been a new rainwater storage basin - called the Austerlitz basin - which can hold 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water, according to a statement from Paris 2024.\n\nFollowing rainy weather on June 17 and 18, the basin filled to 80% capacity, successfully preventing 40,000 cubic meters (40 million liters) of wastewater and rainwater from being discharged into the Seine, according to the city of Paris.\n\nBut the water quality can change fast. Official data shows one-off rainfall events can quickly cause E. coli levels to spike again, and as recently as June 30 - following rain the previous day - E. coli levels increased to around 2000 CFU/100mL at Alexandra III Bridge, where the race is set to begin.\n\nThat's double the level needed for \"good\" water quality, as per World Triathlon standards.\n\nFor much of the month before the games, E. coli levels were above acceptable levels, which could expose athletes to serious health concerns. If E. Coli levels are above 1000 CFU/100mL, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to World Triathlon competition rules, unless the organization's medical committee decides the race can go ahead.\n\nThe individual triathlon races begin with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race - passing by the Le Grand Palais and the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es - before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city.\n\nA mixed team relay race involving four athletes - two men and two women - will start with each team member completing a 300-meter swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run.\n\nCNN's Homero De La Fuente, Kevin Dotson and Chris Liakos contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"},

The postponement came following assurances that the Seine River would be safe for participants.\n\nAur\u00e9lie Merle, executive director of sports for Paris 2024, told reporters that the decision to postpone on Tuesday was made after conducting four river tests and finding that three of the tests indicated unsafe pollution levels.

She spent 22 minutes and 32 seconds in the water.\n\nThe men's triathlon competition got underway soon after the women's event ended. Great Britain's Alex Yee earned gold in the men's event. Yee's final time was 1 hour, 43 minutes and 33 seconds. He spent 20 minutes and 37 seconds swimming the Seine.\n\nSwimming in Paris' most famed waterway has been banned for over 100 years due to pollution from factory wastewater, sewage, and rain runoff.\n\nHowever, the government has spent nearly $1.5 billion to prepare the Seine for the Olympics by fixing old pipes, limiting the amount of untreated wastewater going into the river, and building a wastewater and rainwater storage basin.\n\nThe triathlon involves a 1,500-meter swim, a 40-kilometer cycle and a 10-kilometer run.

The men's triathlon was to take place on Tuesday but was postponed to Wednesday after the Seine River failed quality tests.\n\nThe races will take place on Wednesday. This has come as a big relief for the organisers and the athletes but it will also be a big test for Paris authorities who have promised residents the swimmable Seine as a long-term legacy of the Games, with the triathlon a very public test.\n\nOlympics 2024: India Day 5 schedule\n\n\"It is with great joy that we received this news,\" Benjamin Maze, technical director for France's triathlon federation, told Reuters. \"Now that we know we will race, we can mentally switch fully into competition mode.\"\n\nFifty-five women representing 34 countries will kick off the contest at 8 a.m. (0600 GMT), with France's Cassandre Beaugrand and Britain's Beth Potter, two of the top contenders for gold, set to dive into the river side by side.\n\nThe men's event will take place at 10:45 a.m.,

take place,\" Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a statement.\n\nParis has spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.52 billion) of public money on wastewater infrastructure to contain sewage and minimise spillage into the river, and Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip earlier this month in a bid to convince doubters that the water will not make them ill.\n\nThe decision to postpone the men's race at the last minute on Tuesday had triggered anger among some athletes.\n\n\"If the priority was the health of the athletes this event would have been moved to another location a long time ago,\" Belgium's Marten Van Riel wrote on World Triathlon's Instagram page.\n\n\"We are just puppets in a puppet show.\"\n\nThe gamble that the river would be clean enough for the triathlon was never guaranteed to pay off as water quality varies widely day-to-day, with rainfall causing concentrations of infection-causing bacteria like E. coli to rise.\n\nWednesday's races were given the green light despite rain overnight and forecasts for showers around midday which could hit towards the end of the men's event.\n\nOrganisers make the call based on analysis of river samples taken the previous day at 5 a.m.

Officials hope the swimming portion of the event can soon proceed following the expensive cleanup effort.\n\nOrganizers plan to hold the men's triathlon on Wednesday instead. The women's competition is also scheduled for the same day, but both events will only happen if water tests show acceptable levels of E. coli and other bacteria. Friday is the backup date.\n\nHeavy rain and thunderstorms are in the forecast from Tuesday night through Thursday, which could complicate the rescheduling. Rain, like the downpour that dampened Friday's Opening Ceremony, generally causes bacteria levels in the Seine to rise.\n\n\"It's disappointing that there's this negative aspect now with the delay,\" American triathlete Seth Rider told the Associated Press. \"But I hope we can have a triathlon, and I can accomplish this dream that I've had since I was a little kid.\"\n\nSwimming has been off-limits in the long-polluted Seine for more than a century. In preparation for the Games, the city promised to clean its famed river to demonstrate that hosting the Olympics would provide benefits to skeptical Parisians.\n\nThe city invested millions in building a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and prevent untreated waste from flowing into the Seine, renovating the sewage system, and upgrading water treatment plants.\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo has been a vocal advocate for the cleanup, even taking a symbolic swim in the Seine to demonstrate her confidence in the project's success.\n\n\"Our objective is an Olympic legacy,\" said Pierre Rabadan, the deputy mayor overseeing the project. \"That you and I or whoever happens to be in Paris can swim in the Seine.\"\n\nDespite those best efforts, Mother Nature intervened at the worst possible time, delivering torrential rain to central Paris all day on Friday, before and during the Opening ceremony and persisting into Saturday. Training events meant to let the triathletes familiarize themselves with the course were canceled on both Sunday and Monday due to water quality concerns.\n\nOrganizers had expressed confidence in recent days that bacteria levels would improve as skies cleared and temperatures warmed this week, but that was not sufficient to ensure the athletes' safety on Tuesday.\n\n\"Despite the improvement in water quality levels in the last hours, the readings at some points of the swim course are still above the acceptable limits,\" organizers said, stressing that their \"priority is the health of the athletes.\"\n\nIf the river isn't safe for swimming after continued delays, that part of the race would be scrapped and only the cycling and running portions would go forward. Something similar happened last year at the European Championships in Madrid, when the triathlon format was switched due to water quality issues in the Casa de Campo lake.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure E. coli levels, which indicate sewage contamination. While most E. coli strains are harmless and live in the intestines of healthy people and animals, some can be dangerous. Swallowing contaminated water can cause diarrhea and illnesses like urinary tract or intestinal infections.\n\nWorld Triathlon, the international governing body for the multi-discipline sport, has water safety guidelines that, along with a 2006 European Union directive, set the safe limit for E. coli at 900 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters. On Tuesday, one of the four test sites was below this threshold. However, two sites were just above the limit, and one site had much higher levels, ranging from 980 to 1,553.\n\nSome experts and residents remain skeptical. A recent poll by the French market-research firm Ifop found that 70% of respondents viewed the Seine negatively, describing it as dirty, polluted and smelly.\n\nDo you have a story Newsweek should be covering?

The risky levels of E. coli have already led to swim training to be canceled and on Tuesday the men's competition being pushed back.\n\nOfficials remain hopeful the swimming portion of the race will be able to go forward in the long-polluted river Wednesday -- or in the coming days. The women's competition also is scheduled for Wednesday, but both will only happen if water tests show safe levels of E. coli and other bacteria in the river.\n\nAnother potential hiccup: A forecast of rain beginning Tuesday night and running through Thursday could complicate efforts to reschedule the events. Rain generally causes bacteria levels in the Seine to rise.\n\nIf the river isn't safe for swimming, that portion of the race could potentially be scrapped and only the cycling and running parts would be staged to determine the medal winners.\n\nHow big is swimming in the triathlon competition?\n\nThere are three triathlon races that will be held at the Paris Games -- the men's and women's competitions, along with a mixed relay. In the triathlon world, the order of events is swimming, biking and running primarily out of safety concerns. The Olympic triathlon distance for the men and women is slightly less than a mile (1.5 kilometers) for the swim, 25 miles (40 kilometers) for cycling and then a 6.2-mile (10K) run.\n\nIt's been part of the Olympic program since the 2000 Sydney Olympics.\n\n''Pretty crazy to be here after dreaming of it for so long,'' said 27-year-old U.S. triathlete Seth Rider, who took up the sport when he was 6 years old.\n\nWhat can the athletes do during the delays?\n\nLike everyone, triathletes are just waiting on the water-quality reports to come back favorable. In the meantime, they still need to train.\n\nThere are plenty of places to run, of course, even through the busy side streets around the Arrondissements of Paris. High-speed cycling has places, too. But to train for an open-water swim, one option could be the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium in the greater Paris region.\n\nOr, possibly even a hotel pool. But of course that would mean lots and lots and lots of laps to get in the work they need.\n\nCould the swimming location change?\n\nThe women's and men's marathon swimming events are set for Aug. 8 and Aug. 9. For those competitions, backup plans could include relocating, if needed, to the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium. It already hosts rowing and canoeing competitions and can accommodate up to 15,000 spectators.\n\nThat said, it's not easy to just pick up and move the triathlon. One part is predicated on another.\n\nAfter the swim, racers go through a transition area to get to their bikes. After cycling, another transition to prepare for the run. The routes are already set up for cycling and running.\n\nIf no swimming leg, then what?\n\nShould the river not clear up, the swimming part could always be nixed and the race feature only cycling and running. That was the case last year at the European Championships when the format was switched to a ''duathlon'' because of water-quality issues.\n\nAsked if that might be unfair to triathletes who excel in the water, World Triathlon president Marisol Casado responded: ''It's just another situation of the competition.\"\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Escherichia coli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cycle sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Waterway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaires-sur-Marne", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vaires-sur-Marne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vaires-sur-Marne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00cele-de-France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "\u00cele-de-France"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "\u00cele-de-France"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Athletics_Championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Athletics Championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrondissements_of_Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arrondissements of Paris"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_water_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open water swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoeing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canoeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowing_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rowing (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1721939393", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776638", "eventUri": "eng-9776638", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "dateEnd": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 2515, "textEnd": 2532}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

The opening ceremony was hit by heavy rain on Friday that persisted well into Saturday evening, prompting the cancellation of the rehearsals of two water portions of the swim-bike-run race.\n\nRain started falling in Paris early Wednesday morning, but the forecast calls for dry conditions during racing hours, according to M\u00e9t\u00e9o France.", "source": {"uri": "luxtimes.lu", "dataType": "news", "title": "Luxembourg Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewerage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sewerage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wastewater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.luxtimes.lu/public/luxembourg/v5lguq-triathlon-oly-paris-2024-swim-32521808.jpeg/alternates/BASE_SIXTEEN_NINE/triathlon-oly-paris-2024-swim-32521808.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776638", "eventUri": "eng-9776638", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "dateEnd": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 1065, "textEnd": 1079}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 971, "textEnd": 979}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

In the cycling portion of the race, several athletes fell after slipping on the slippery roads. Vittoria Lopes of Brazil was among the leaders when she fell but fell out of contention.\n\nFrance's Cassandre Beaugrand eventually was crowned women's triathlon Olympic champion on home soil, roared across the finish line by a boisterous French crowd that broke out into a rendition 'La Marseillaise.'\n\nThe men's race is set to begin at 4:45 a.m. ET.\n\nRains impacting water quality\n\nHeavy rains battered Paris over the weekend, drenching Friday's opening ceremony and raising concerns about water quality in the river, which usually declines after rainfall.\n\nTraining was canceled for a second straight day on Monday after water quality testing deemed the water unsafe for athletes, but organizers were confident at the time that Tuesday's race would go ahead as planned.\n\nThe decision to hold some swimming events in the famous river that splits Paris raised eyebrows when it was first announced. Swimming in the Seine has been illegal for a century but, in their desire to put the host city on full display, organizers worked up a plan to clean up the river so the world's best athletes could use it during Paris 2024.\n\nAbout $1.5 billion (1.4 billion Euros) has been spent trying to clean up the river ahead of the Games and Paris officials have made a big show of displaying its suitability. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo swam in the river earlier this month to display her confidence in the river's water quality and promised to put a swimming pool in the river after the Games. The French sports minister has also gone for a dip in the Seine.\n\nOne of the key infrastructure projects designed to help tackle pollution has been a new rainwater storage basin - called the Austerlitz basin - which can hold 20 Olympic swimming pools worth of water, according to a statement from Paris 2024.\n\nFollowing rainy weather on June 17 and 18, the basin filled to 80% capacity, successfully preventing 40,000 cubic meters (40 million liters) of wastewater and rainwater from being discharged into the Seine, according to the city of Paris.\n\nBut the water quality can change fast. Official data shows one-off rainfall events can quickly cause E. coli levels to spike again, and as recently as June 30 - following rain the previous day - E. coli levels increased to around 2000 CFU/100mL at Alexandra III Bridge, where the race is set to begin.\n\nThat's double the level needed for \"good\" water quality, as per World Triathlon standards.\n\nFor much of the month before the games, E. coli levels were above acceptable levels, which could expose athletes to serious health concerns. If E. Coli levels are above 1000 CFU/100mL, the swimming leg of the triathlon will have to be cancelled, according to World Triathlon competition rules, unless the organization's medical committee decides the race can go ahead.\n\nThe individual triathlon races begin with a 1.5-kilometer swim, followed by a 40K bike race - passing by the Le Grand Palais and the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es - before finishing with a 10K run through the heart of the city.\n\nA mixed team relay race involving four athletes - two men and two women - will start with each team member completing a 300-meter swim, followed by a 5.8K bike ride and 1.8K run.\n\nCNN's Homero De La Fuente, Kevin Dotson and Chris Liakos contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Beaugrand wins gold after Seine passes water quality tests", "body": "France's Cassandre Beaugrand won gold in the women's triathlon at the Paris Olympics on Wednesday, cheered on by a delighted crowd as the hosts' gamble to hold the swim stage of the race in the Seine paid off after days of uncertainty.\n\nThe triathlon, a central showpiece of the Paris Games, started and finished at the Alexandre III bridge at the heart of the French capital, taking athletes along a section of the Champs-Elysees and past more Parisian landmarks including the Musee d'Orsay.\n\nThe men's triathlon had been scheduled to take place on Tuesday but, after the river failed water quality tests, it was postponed to 10:45 a.m. on Wednesday, immediately after the women's race.\n\nThe women began their competition at 8 a.m., just as overnight rain was easing, the triathlon offering spectacular views as they swam in the Seine before racing their bikes and running into central Paris.\n\nA handful of athletes crashed off their bicycles after slipping on the wet cobblestones of the Champs-Elysees.\n\nWorld number one Beaugrand broke away on the last lap of the run stage and was fueled to the finish line by ecstatic cheers from crowds lining the streets.\n\nSwitzerland's Julie Derron won silver and Britain's Beth Potter took bronze.\n\nThe races going ahead will have come as a relief for teams and athletes, as well as for Paris authorities who have promised residents a swimmable Seine as a long-term legacy of the Games, with the triathlon a very public test.\n\nThe gamble that the river would be clean enough for the triathlon was never guaranteed to pay off as water quality varies widely day-to-day, with rainfall causing concentrations of infection-causing bacteria like E. coli to rise.\n\n\"It is with great joy that we received this news,\" Benjamin Maze, technical director for France's triathlon federation, told Reuters. \"Now that we know we will race, we can mentally switch fully into competition mode.\"\n\nWednesday's races were given the green light despite rain overnight.\n\nOrganizers make the call based on analysis of river samples taken the previous day at 5 a.m. and after discussions with experts on weather, according to Paris 2024.\n\nShowers started up again around 5:45 a.m. on Wednesday, making racing conditions more difficult for the bike stage which features some sharp turns and a quarter of the course on cobbled roads.\n\nFifty-five women representing 34 countries kicked off the contest at 8 a.m., with Beaugrand and Potter diving into the river side by side from a floating pontoon next to the bridge.\n\n\"The results of the latest water analyses, received at 3.20 a.m., have been assessed as compliant by World Triathlon allowing for the triathlon competitions to take place,\" Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a statement.\n\nParis has spent 1.52 billion of public money on wastewater infrastructure to contain sewage and minimize spillage into the river, and Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip earlier this month in a bid to convince doubters that the water will not make them ill.\n\nThe decision to postpone the men's race at the last minute on Tuesday had triggered anger among some athletes.\n\n\"If the priority was the health of the athletes this event would have been moved to another location a long time ago,\" Belgium's

What are the risks of swimming in polluted water?\n\nThe men's Olympic triathlon planned for Tuesday has been postponed over concerns about water quality in Paris' Seine river, where the swimming portion of the race was supposed to take place.\n\nThe event has been postponed to Wednesday, which is the same day the women's competition is also scheduled to take place. However, both events are subject to water tests desmonstrating that the Seine is safe to swim in.\n\nQuestions also remain about the women's and men's 10-kilometer (6.21-mile) marathon swimming races, which are due to be held in the Seine on August 8 and 9.\n\nALSO READ: Olympic women triathletes begin swim in Seine River after days of concerns about water quality\n\nWater contamination in the Seine has been a controversial topic in recent weeks. A triathlon training session due to be held in the Seine was cancelled on Monday, which is the latest event to be scuttled by water pollution.\n\nPollution in the Seine is no new controversy -- swimming in the river has been illegal for more than 100 years due to health concerns. The first ban came into effect in 1923, causing swimmers during the 1924 Paris Olympic games to compete in swimming pools.\n\nMost of the city's wastewater has been flowing into the Seine since the ban came into effect. Leaking and overflowing sewage systems are the main source of pollution.\n\nFrench authorities have been working to clean up the water for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, spending \u20ac1.4 billion ($1.5 billion) on improving water quality.\n\nThe goal was to cut bacterial contamination by 75% before the first Olympic swimming event, but the city has so far been unsuccessful in quelling the concerns of athletes and local Parisians.\n\nParisians disgruntled at the project's costs pledged to protest poo in the Seine en masse, led by #JeChieDansLaSeineLe23Juin, which tranlastes as # I shit in the Seine on June 23.\n\nDespite this campaign, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo swam in the river earlier in July in a bid to demonstrate the Seine's cleanliness first-hand.\n\nALSO READ: Paris Olympics 2024: Men's triathlon race postponed to Wednesday due to Seine pollution levels\n\nWater tests from the Eau de Paris monitoring group showed levels of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in the river were significantly higher than is safe to humans over the last weeks.\n\nRecent rainfall over Paris has made the issue worse -- heavy rains often cause levels of E. coli and other bacterial colonies in rivers and lakesto rise.\n\nIn a statement, organizers said that the heavy rain over Paris on Friday and Saturday had compelled them to \"reschedule the event for health reasons.\"\n\nE. coli is often linked to fecal matter in water and can indicate contamination from sewage. Even a mouthful of contaminated water containing high levels of E.coli can lead to diarrhea, urinary tract infections, pneumonia or sepsis. Skin rashes and ear or eye pain are also common.\n\nE. coli infections are not the only concern, however. Leptospira, transmitted by rodent urine, can be found in contaminated water and can cause severe kidney disease.\n\nInfections from other waterborne bacteria like cyanobacteria and enterococci can also cause gut-related health problems.\n\nAnd then there are parasites like cercarial larvae, often found in water populated by waterfowl, which can cause itchy skin rashes.\n\nSeth Rider, one of 55 triathletes entered in the men's race, has been taking unconventional measures to prepare for exposure to bacteria.\n\n\"We know that there's going to be some E. coli exposure, so I just try to increase my E. coli threshold by exposing myself to a bit of E. coli in your day-to-day life,\" the US athlete said in a press conference on Saturday.\n\nALSO READ: Cholera, dysentery and more in rainy season: Tips to protect vulnerable family members from monsoon waterborne diseases\n\n\"Just little things throughout your day, like, not washing your hands after you go to the bathroom and stuff like this,\" he said.\n\nOther Olympic athletes have suffered long-term from swimming in contaminated waters, however.

The men's race had originally been scheduled for Tuesday but got postponed after the Seine failed water quality tests.\n\n\"The results of the latest water analyses, received at 3:20 a.m., have been assessed as compliant by World Triathlon allowing for the triathlon competitions to take place,\" said a news release from Paris organizers and World Triathlon, the sport's governing body.\n\nWater quality on the Seine became something of a saga leading up to the Games, as organizers raced to prepare the polluted waterway for prime-time attention. For months, the French have been testing river samples for E. Coli and enterococci bacteria, which are indicators of fecal matter, as well as other pathogens. When E.Coli levels are high, swimmers risk developing gastrointestinal illness.\n\nThe Seine had been failing those tests after rainy weather, since storms can send runoff, and sometimes sewage, into the river.\n\nSwimming had been disallowed on the Seine for more than a century because it was too polluted, but the city of Paris led a $1.5 billion effort to clean up the river and shore up waste treatment systems in the lead-up to the Olympics.\n\nAs the first events approached, organizers had hoped for clear, sunny weather to reduce overall pollution and allow ultraviolet light to inactivate some bacteria.\n\nBut the weather has rarely cooperated.\n\nLast year, some test events to rehearse the triathlon had to be canceled because of water quality concerns after rainfall.\n\nThen the opening ceremony, which involved a boat parade on the Seine, took place amid some downpours on Friday, and the showers lasted into Saturday.\n\nThat rainfall caused pollution and forced organizers to cancel two days of swim training on Sunday and Monday. Then they postponed the men's triathlon, which was originally slated for Tuesday morning.\n\n\"I'm just trying to focus on what I can control,\" Kirsten Kasper, an American triathlete, told NBC News on Tuesday. \"We swim in a lot of city locations, and it's common for water quality to be a question. But I just have to trust that the race organizers are doing the testing and what they need to do to make sure it's safe.\"\n\nWater quality experts said the difficulties in ensuring that the Seine was sufficiently clean could draw needed attention to broader issues of environmental contamination, which are common worldwide.\n\n\"It's just very hard to manage, in large cities, the amount of human waste that we see,\" said Katy Graham, an assistant professor at Georgia Tech's College of Engineering. \"The public thinks a lot of these issues have been completely solved.

The men's race had originally been scheduled for Tuesday but got postponed after the Seine failed water quality tests.\n\n\"The results of the latest water analyses, received at 3:20 a.m., have been assessed as compliant by World Triathlon allowing for the triathlon competitions to take place,\" said a news release from Paris organizers and World Triathlon, the sport's governing body.\n\nWater quality on the Seine became something of a saga leading up to the Games, as organizers raced to prepare the polluted waterway for prime-time attention. For months, the French have been testing river samples for E. Coli and enterococci bacteria, which are indicators of fecal matter, as well as other pathogens. When E.Coli levels are high, swimmers risk developing gastrointestinal illness.\n\nThe Seine had been failing those tests after rainy weather, since storms can send runoff, and sometimes sewage, into the river.\n\nSwimming had been disallowed on the Seine for more than a century because it was too polluted, but the city of Paris led a $1.5 billion effort to clean up the river and shore up waste treatment systems in the lead-up to the Olympics.\n\nAs the first events approached, organizers had hoped for clear, sunny weather to reduce overall pollution and allow ultraviolet light to inactivate some bacteria.\n\nBut the weather has rarely cooperated.\n\nLast year, some test events to rehearse the triathlon had to be canceled because of water quality concerns after rainfall.\n\nThen the opening ceremony, which involved a boat parade on the Seine, took place amid some downpours on Friday, and the showers lasted into Saturday.\n\nThat rainfall caused pollution and forced organizers to cancel two days of swim training on Sunday and Monday. Then they postponed the men's triathlon, which was originally slated for Tuesday morning.\n\n\"I'm just trying to focus on what I can control,\" Kirsten Kasper, an American triathlete, told NBC News on Tuesday. \"We swim in a lot of city locations, and it's common for water quality to be a question. But I just have to trust that the race organizers are doing the testing and what they need to do to make sure it's safe.\"\n\nWater quality experts said the difficulties in ensuring that the Seine was sufficiently clean could draw needed attention to broader issues of environmental contamination, which are common worldwide.\n\n\"It's just very hard to manage, in large cities, the amount of human waste that we see,\" said Katy Graham, an assistant professor at Georgia Tech's College of Engineering. \"The public thinks a lot of these issues have been completely solved.

Test events meant to allow the athletes to familiarize themselves with the course had already been canceled for the same reason on Sunday and Monday.\n\nThe water quality in the Seine directly affected by rainfall that can lead to wastewater runoff flowing into the river. Heavy rains fell during Friday's Olympic opening ceremony, and rain continued for most of the day Saturday.\n\nEvery day since Sunday, even as organizers announced cancellations or postponements, they continued to express confidence that the swims in the Seine would go forward as planned the next day. For several days they did not publicly release the data on levels of E. coli and other bacteria that contributed to their decisions.\n\nHigh levels of E. coli in water can indicate contamination from sewage. Most strains are harmless and some live in the intestines of healthy people and animals. But others can be dangerous. Even a mouthful of contaminated water can lead to diarrhea, and the germ can cause illnesses such as infections in the urinary tract or in the intestines.\n\nDaily water quality tests measure levels of the fecal bacteria E. coli. World Triathlon's water safety guidelines and a 2006 European Union directive give a range of E. coli levels from \"excellent\" to \"sufficient.\" Anything beyond 900 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters is not considered safe or \"sufficient.\" But experts stressed that these numbers are simply guidelines used to assess risk.\n\nPlus, Aur\u00e9lie Merle, the Paris 2024 director of sports, told reporters Tuesday that water samples are taken 21 and a half hours before decisions are made about the swim. That leaves uncertainty about their accuracy the day of the race.\n\nMerle said Tuesday that testing results showed \"we're very close to the threshold of triathlon.\" She noted that one of four test sites along the triathlon course was below the threshold for E. coli. Two other sites were just above the limit and one was more elevated, she said, citing a range of 980 to 1,553.\n\n\"We know the sun and the heat have a very strong impact on the quality of the water,\" she said, hoping that a heat wave that hit most of France on Tuesday would help improve water quality enough for the swims to go ahead.\n\nOrganizers have said the marathon swimming races, scheduled for Aug. 8 and 9, could be relocated, if needed, to the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium in the greater Paris region, which already hosts rowing and canoeing competitions and can accommodate up to 15,000 spectators.\n\nEfforts to make the river suitable for swimming included the construction of a giant basin to capture excess rainwater and keep wastewater from flowing into the river, renovating sewer infrastructure and upgrading wastewater treatment plants.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Authorities spent \u20ac1.4bn on a years-long infrastructure push to make the Seine clean enough for the competition, but the plan remains entirely weather dependent.\n\nWhen it rains heavily, as it did on Friday and Saturday, the city's antique sewers overflow into the river so as to avoid flooding the streets with sewage. Paris sought to mitigate that risk by building a massive underground storage tank that could capture up to 46,000 cubic metres of wastewater to avoid it going into the river after storms.\n\nBut the system was overwhelmed by the bad weather last week, putting at risk organisers' often repeated promises that the river would be ready for the triathlon and marathon swimming. For several days tests showed E. coli and other bacteria levels were higher than the level of 900 colony-forming units limit set by World Triathlon as safe for competitions.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron celebrated the long-awaited moment with a reminder of the state's financial commitment. \"Here we are! The Seine is swimmable,\" he said on social media on Wednesday.\n\nThe triathlon was supposed to be a highlight of the Paris Olympics given that the course was set against the dramatic backdrop of the Seine and well-known monuments -- the swimming starting at the Pont Alexandre III bridge, followed by cycling and running along the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es and past the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay.\n\nInstead, it began a flashpoint for criticism that the organisers had put their desire for postcard perfect event backdrops ahead of the needs of athletes who train for years to be able to compete in the Olympics. There was no back-up site for the triathlon to be held if the river was too dirty to swim, although one was set for marathon swimming, the other event to be held in the Seine.\n\nWith more summer storms forecast in the coming days, it remains unclear if the mixed triathlon relay and marathon swimming can be held next week.\n\nOn Wednesday, tens of thousands of fans were lined up along the Seine and the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es to cheer on the triathletes.\n\nFrench athlete Cassandre Beaugrand broke through the finish line first to win the country's first gold medal in the event.

Photograph: Aleksandra Szmigiel/Reuters\n\nFrance's Cassandre Beaugrand won gold in the women's triathlon at the Paris Olympics on Wednesday, cheered on by a delighted crowd as the hosts' gamble to hold the swim stage of the race in the Seine paid off after days of uncertainty.\n\nThe triathlon, a central showpiece of the Paris Games, started and finished at the Alexandre III bridge at the heart of the French capital, taking athletes along a section of the Champs-Elysees and past more Parisian landmarks including the Musee d'Orsay.\n\nThe men's triathlon had been scheduled to take place on Tuesday but, after the river failed water quality tests, it was postponed to 10:45 a.m. (0845 GMT) on Wednesday, immediately after the women's race.\n\nThe women began their competition at 8 a.m., just as overnight rain was easing, with the triathlon offering spectacular views as they swam in the Seine before racing their bikes and running into central Paris.\n\nA handful of athletes crashed off their bicycles after slipping on the wet cobblestones of the Champs-Elysees.\n\nWorld number one Beaugrand broke away on the last lap of the run stage and was fuelled to the finish line by ecstatic cheers from crowds lining the streets. Switzerland's Julie Derron won silver and Britain's Beth Potter took bronze.\n\nThe races going ahead will have come as a relief for teams and athletes, as well as for Paris authorities who have promised residents a swimmable Seine as a long-term legacy of the Games, with the triathlon a very public test.\n\n\"We have achieved in four years what has been impossible for a century: the Seine is swimmable,\" President Emmanuel Macron tweeted after the race.\n\nThe gamble that the river would be clean enough for the triathlon was never guaranteed to pay off as water quality varies widely day-to-day, with rainfall causing concentrations of infection-causing bacteria such as E. coli to rise.\n\n\"I have no doubts about the quality of the Seine, we've swum in worse water,\" Beaugrand said after her victory, adding that scrapping the swim and holding a duathlon -- the organisers' last resort if the river had been too dirty -- would have been \"shameful\" for the sport.\n\nWednesday's races were given the green light despite rain overnight.\n\nOrganisers make the call based on analysis of river samples taken the previous day at 5 a.m. and after discussions with experts on weather, according to Paris 2024.\n\nShowers started again around 5:45 a.m. on Wednesday, making racing conditions more difficult for the bike stage which features some sharp turns and a quarter of the course on cobbled roads.\n\nFifty-five women representing 34 countries kicked off the contest at 8 a.m., with Beaugrand and Potter diving into the river side by side from a floating pontoon next to the bridge.\n\n\"The results of the latest water analyses, received at 3.20 a.m., have been assessed as compliant by World Triathlon allowing for the triathlon competitions to take place,\" Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a statement.\n\nParis has spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.52 billion) of public money on wastewater infrastructure to contain sewage and minimise spillage into the river, and Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip earlier this month in a bid to convince doubters that the water would not make them ill.\n\nTHE OLYMPICS, 2024", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com",

The risky levels of E. coli have already led to swim training to be canceled and on Tuesday the men's competition being pushed back.\n\nOfficials remain hopeful the swimming portion of the race will be able to go forward in the long-polluted river Wednesday -- or in the coming days. The women's competition also is scheduled for Wednesday, but both will only happen if water tests show safe levels of E. coli and other bacteria in the river.\n\nAnother potential hiccup: A forecast of rain beginning Tuesday night and running through Thursday could complicate efforts to reschedule the events. Rain generally causes bacteria levels in the Seine to rise.\n\nIt's been part of the Olympic program since the 2000 Sydney Olympics.\n\nThere are plenty of places to run, of course, even through the busy side streets around the Arrondissements of Paris.

Switzerland's Julie Derron won silver and Britain's Beth Potter took bronze.\n\nThe races going ahead will have come as a relief for teams and athletes, as well as for Paris authorities who have promised residents a swimmable Seine as a long-term legacy of the Games, with the triathlon a very public test.\n\nThe gamble that the river would be clean enough for the triathlon was never guaranteed to pay off as water quality varies widely day-to-day, with rainfall causing concentrations of infection-causing bacteria like E. coli to rise.\n\n\"It is with great joy that we received this news,\" Benjamin Maze, technical director for France's triathlon federation, told Reuters. \"Now that we know we will race, we can mentally switch fully into competition mode.\"\n\nGREEN LIGHT\n\nWednesday's races were given the green light despite rain overnight.\n\nOrganisers make the call based on analysis of river samples taken the previous day at 5 a.m. and after discussions with experts on weather, according to Paris 2024.\n\nShowers started up again around 5:45 a.m. on Wednesday, making racing conditions more difficult for the bike stage which features some sharp turns and a quarter of the course on cobbled roads.\n\nFifty-five women representing 34 countries kicked off the contest at 8 a.m., with Beaugrand and Potter diving into the river side by side from a floating pontoon next to the bridge.\n\n\"The results of the latest water analyses, received at 3.20 a.m., have been assessed as compliant by World Triathlon allowing for the triathlon competitions to take place,\" Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a statement.\n\nParis has spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.52 billion) of public money on wastewater infrastructure to contain sewage and minimise spillage into the river, and Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip earlier this month in a bid to convince doubters that the water will not make them ill.\n\nThe decision to postpone the men's race at the last minute on Tuesday had triggered anger among some athletes.\n\n\"If the priority was the health of the athletes this event would have been moved to another location a long time ago,\" Belgium's Marten Van Riel wrote on World Triathlon's Instagram page.", "source": {"uri": "sabcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SABC News - Breaking news, special reports, world, business, sport coverage of all South African current events.

Switzerland's Julie Derron won silver and Britain's Beth Potter took bronze.\n\nALSO READ:\n\nThe races going ahead will have come as a relief for teams and athletes, as well as for Paris authorities who have promised residents a swimmable Seine as a long-term legacy of the Games, with the triathlon a very public test.\n\nThe gamble that the river would be clean enough for the triathlon was never guaranteed to pay off as water quality varies widely day-to-day, with rainfall causing concentrations of infection-causing bacteria like E. coli to rise.\n\n\"It is with great joy that we received this news,\" Benjamin Maze, technical director for France's triathlon federation, said. \"Now that we know we will race, we can mentally switch fully into competition mode.\"", "source": {"uri": "khaleejtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khaleej times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@khaleejtimes.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archery_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_individual", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Archery at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's individual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandre_Beaugrand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cassandre Beaugrand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobblestone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cobblestone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_Potter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beth Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://image.khaleejtimes.com?uuid=3608b0c0-185c-5d09-bd4f-a8488034b642&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.8427&width=1200&height=675&x=1.0E-5&y=0.05618.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776638", "eventUri": "eng-9776638", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

men's and women's Olympic triathlons will be allowed take place on Wednesday after tests showed the River Seine to be clean enough for competition.\n\nIt follows concerns they could follow the same fate as Tuesday's men's event, which was postponed due to the Seine's water quality.\n\nOrganisers had previously said the events only had a 60% chance of going ahead after that was postponed.\n\nResults from the latest water analyses, received at 03:20 on Wednesday, were deemed compliant by World Triathlon.\n\nGreat Britain's Alex Yee is one of the favourites for gold in the men's race, while team-mate Beth Potter is the reigning women's world champion.\n\nThe event going ahead removes previous concerns it may have had to have been contested as a duathlon - with just swimming and cycling - as a last resort.\n\nDaily tests of the Seine's quality are carried out, with recent heavy rain causing the river to be too dirty for competition.\n\nEarlier in the games, swimming training sessions were cancelled because of the water quality, but organisers were confident the triathlon events would go ahead as scheduled.\n\nTests are being carried out daily on the water quality in the Seine, which is also due to host the triathlon mixed relay on 5 August, the Olympic marathon swimming on 8 and 9 August, and the Para-triathlon event at the Paralympics, which start on 28 August.\n\nSwimming in the river has been prohibited for over 100 years because of its high levels of pollution and the risk of disease - but French authorities have invested heavily to make the Seine swimmable as part of the Games' legacy.\n\nOrganisers said about 1.4bn euros (\u00a31.2bn) had been spent on a regeneration project to make the Seine safe.\n\nParis mayor Anne Hidalgo recently swam in the river to highlight the clean-up efforts which have been undertaken and, earlier this month, tests showed the river was clean enough for swimming.\n\nHowever, heavy rain in Paris on Friday and Saturday has caused the water quality to decline.\n\nThundery showers are forecast for Wednesday morning, following predicted high temperatures of up to 35C on Tuesday.\n\nFrance currently lags behind the European Union's average score for top-quality bathing water conditions.\n\nBetween 17-23 July, data showed that the river that dissects the French capital was suitable for swimming on six days out of seven.\n\nAs recently as June, levels of E coli were 10 times more than the acceptable level imposed by sports federations.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com",

Paris swim was viable after heavy rains.\n\nThe men's triathlon had been scheduled to take place yesterday but was postponed after the river failed water quality tests.\n\nNews that the races would go ahead came as a relief for teams and athletes, as well as for Paris authorities who have promised residents a swimmable Seine as a long-term legacy of the Games, with the triathlon a very public test.\n\nFifty-five women representing 34 countries will kick off the contest at 8am Paris time (7am Irish time), with France's Cassandre Beaugrand and Britain's Beth Potter, two of the top contenders for gold, set to dive into the river side by side.\n\nThe men's event will take place at 10:45 am Paris time, immediately after the women's race.\n\nParis has spent 1.4 billion euros of public money on wastewater infrastructure to contain sewage and minimise spillage into the river, and Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a dip earlier this month in a bid to convince doubters that the water will not make them ill.\n\nThe decision to postpone the men's race at the last minute had triggered anger among some athletes.\n\n\"If the priority was the health of the athletes this event would have been moved to another location a long time ago,\" Belgium's Marten Van Riel wrote on World Triathlon's Instagram page.\n\n\"We are just puppets in a puppet show.\"\n\nThe gamble that the river would be clean enough for the triathlon was never guaranteed to pay off as water quality varies widely day-to-day, with rainfall causing concentrations of infection-causing bacteria like E. coli to rise.\n\nToday's races were given the green light despite rain overnight and forecasts for showers around midday which could hit towards the end of the men's event.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title":

Switzerland's Julie Derron and Great Britain's Beth Potter rounded-out the podium.\n\nThe swim in the Seine comes as a historic moment for the nation of France. Deemed \"unswimmable\" for years, the Seine has long been a topic of debate amongst the French public. When the government, in combination with Paris 2024 Organizers, announced a $1.5 billion clean-up effort, many were skeptical about the ability to make the Seine safe to swim in. Despite the clean-up, tests taken just a month from the Olympics showed E. coli levels at 10 times the acceptable limit for swimming. However, reduced rainfall levels throughout the month of July contributed to a sharp decline in bacteria levels, leading Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo to take a plunge into the river before the start of the Games.\n\nWith conditions in the river improving, organizers were optimistic that the triathlon and open water events would be able to occur without issue, but recent downpours increased bacteria levels once-again. As a result, several triathlon training sessions were canceled early in the week, along with the men's race being postponed. Despite the hiccups, it appears as through bacteria levels have returned back under safe-swimming levels.\n\nWorld Aquatics requirements for inland waterways:\n\nWorld Triathlon requirements for inland waterways:\n\nThe men's triathalon will also occur today, with athletes slated for a 10:45 AM start in Paris.

However, organizers maintained optimism that the triathlon events would occur as planned.\n\nContinuous monitoring of the Seine's water quality is crucial, especially with the upcoming mixed relay triathlon on August 5, the marathon swimming events scheduled for August 8 and 9, and the Para-triathlon at the Paralympics beginning August 28.\n\nHistorically, swimming in the Seine has been banned for over a century owing to its severe pollution and hazards to public health. Nonetheless, substantial investments have been made by local authorities to improve the river's condition, aimed at making it safe for swimming as part of the Olympic legacy.\n\nApproximately 1.4 billion euros has been allocated to various regeneration projects aimed at restoring the Seine's ecosystem. In a show of confidence regarding the efforts, Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo recently swam in the river, emphasizing the improvements made.\n\nDespite these advances, rain over the weekend has adversely affected the water quality, and further thundershowers are anticipated for Wednesday morning, following heatwave conditions that could reach up to 35\u00b0C on Tuesday.\n\nCurrently, France's water quality ratings fall short of the European Union's standards for top recreational water quality. Data from July 17-23 indicated that the Seine met swimming standards for six out of the seven days, yet just last June, E. coli levels were found to exceed acceptable limits by a significant margin.", "source": {"uri": "theglobalherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Global Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Yee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Yee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_Potter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beth Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Mixed_relay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed relay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_renewal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urban renewal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hidalgo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anne Hidalgo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776638", "eventUri": "eng-9776638", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "dateEnd": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 1653, "textEnd": 1667}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-17", "dateEnd": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 2661, "textEnd": 2671}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 1600, "textEnd": 1608}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-28", "textStart": 1721, "textEnd": 1730}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

The men's triathlon event, which was supposed to take place on Tuesday, has now been moved to Wednesday due to the alarming quantity of E. coli and other bacteria in the water body.\n\nThis will make the men's competition clash with the women's event, which is also scheduled to take place the same day.

However, there has been little to no effect on the bacteria levels in the waterway that runs through France's capital. The swimming portion of the triathlon is not the only event under threat, as the river is also in line to host the marathon swimming competition next week.\n\nThe weather Paris has experienced in recent days has only made matters worse, with rain accentuating the overflow of the city's domestic water system, leading to the impurity levels in the Seine compounding. To make matters worse, there is a rain forecast predicted in the city from Tuesday night through Thursday.\n\nThe Olympics officials are hoping for clear skies and hot and dry weather in the upcoming days, which might lead to water tests showing a tolerable amount of E. coli and other bacteria.

Both the women's and men's races are going ahead today, ending a long saga involving daily water tests measuring levels of a faecal bacteria known as E. coli.\n\n\"Following a meeting on water quality held on 31 July at 3.30am attended by Paris 2024, representatives of World Triathlon and their Technical and Medical Delegates, M\u00e9t\u00e9o France, the City of Paris and the Prefecture of the \u00cele-de-France Region involved in carrying out water quality tests, the stakeholders involved have confirmed that the women's and the men's triathlons will go ahead as planned on 31 July at 8am and 10.45am respectively,\" read the official statement released by Paris 2024 organizers.\n\n\"The results of the latest water analyses, received at 3.20am, have been assessed as compliant by World Triathlon allowing for the triathlon competitions to take place,\" the statement continued.\n\nThe subject of a running joke since the release of Xavier Gens' hit shark movie \"Under Paris\" on Netflix, the Seine was supposed to be clean enough for the Triathlon and Marathon competitions since the beginning the Games. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo had pledged to make the water quality safe enough for athletes and locals to swim in it many months ago. The ambitious project to clean the notoriously toxic river cost more than $1.5 billion, but it was soon plagued by scorn and even a social media campaign #JeChieDansLaSeine, which encouraged Parisians to defecate in the water earlier this month.\n\nThe Paris mayor took a swim in the Seine (wearing a wetsuit and goggles) on July 17 alongside Tony Estanguet, the gold medal-winning French slalom canoeist who presides over the Olympics organizing committee, to drum up enthusiasm and show that it was safe enough. But it turns out that the Seine was still highly polluted.\n\nLocal media outlets have reported that the heavy rains on July 26 - mainly during the opening ceremony -- have ramped up the levels of E. coli and other bacteria in the Seine. That had already caused two training days (on Sunday and Monday) to be canceled. The mixed team relay is set for Aug. 5.\n\nThe pouring rain during the opening ceremony also forced Lady Gaga to pre-tape her performance for safety reasons. Maud le Pladec, the choreographer and head of dance for the Olympics and Paralympics who worked with Gaga for many months, said her show was nearly called off due to the weather conditions.", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Supper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Last Supper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Escherichia coli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefectures_in_France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prefectures in France"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Feces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00cele-de-France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u00cele-de-France"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "\u00cele-de-France"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hidalgo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anne Hidalgo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoe_slalom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canoe slalom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Estanguet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Estanguet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goggles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goggles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wetsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2164085315.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776638", "eventUri": "eng-9776638", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 508, "textEnd": 515, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-17", "textStart": 1845, "textEnd": 1852}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 2152, "textEnd": 2159}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 2383, "textEnd": 2389}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

This decision ended days of uncertainty over whether the central Paris swim would be viable after heavy rainfall.\n\nThe men's event, originally scheduled for Tuesday, was postponed due to failed water quality tests. The announcement that both races would go ahead on Wednesday brought relief to teams, athletes, and Paris authorities who have promised a swimmable Seine as a long-term Olympic legacy.\n\nDespite overnight rain, organisers approved the races based on river samples taken the previous day and after discussions with weather experts. The triathlon, a central feature of the Paris Olympics, starts and finishes at the Alexandre III bridge, taking athletes along the Champs-Elysees and past landmarks like the Musee d'Orsay.\n\nThe women's race, featuring 55 athletes from 34 countries, began earlier, with top contenders Cassandre Beaugrand of France and Beth Potter of Britain starting side by side. The men's event followed later.\n\nParis has invested 1.4 billion euros in wastewater infrastructure to improve river water quality. However, the decision to hold the triathlon in the Seine has been criticised by some athletes, with Belgium's Marten Van Riel expressing frustration over the last-minute changes and questioning the prioritisation of athlete health.", "source": {"uri": "thewillnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "THEWILL NEWS MEDIA - Nigeria News, Nigeria Politics, Breaking News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jude_obafemi@thewillnews.com", "name": "Jude Obafemi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marten_Van_Riel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marten Van Riel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_Potter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beth Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandre_Beaugrand", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cassandre Beaugrand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://thewillnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_1431.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776638", "eventUri": "eng-9776638", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 7}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

The mixed team relay and para-triathlon both became duathlons.\n\nAfter that, World Triathon said that the contingency plan for Paris, if water quality was poor, was to make the triathlon a duathlon but insisted that was \"an unlikely event\".\n\nMayor Anne Hidalgo, and a few dozen volunteers, felt comfortable swimming in the Seine before the Games began to showcase the improved water quality but heavy storms such as the ones witnessed in Paris last week always threatened to be disruptive.\n\nCompletely.\n\nAn Olympic triathlon consists of a 1,500m open-water swim followed by a 40-kilometre cycle and ending with a 10km run. Typically a duathlon would entail a 40km cycle and a 10km run, but if the triathlon was to become a duathlon, there would be a 5km run in place of the 1.5km swim to start, with the rest remaining the same.\n\n\"Physiologically, you're coming onto the bike with more fatigued legs (after a run instead of a swim),\" says Andrew Woodroffe, a performance triathlon coach. \"Swimming tires you out before you get on the bike but it's not the same speed or intensity which these athletes will be running at.\n\n\"If you remove the swim, it completely changes the dynamic of the event. Running is what damages the legs. The men will run well under 15 minutes, they're running so fast. When it comes to the final run, their legs will be fried.\n\n\"The fastest swimmers don't tend to win because they're not as good runners. Stopping the swim makes it more of a race and maybe makes it more of a level playing field. But it's simply a different sport.\"\n\nMark Buckingham, a triathlon coach and former duathlon world medallist who is the national coach for Triathlon Ireland, agrees. \"Not many athletes go in with the mindset that it might be a duathlon, so it'll catch people off guard,\" he said. \"Quite a few will have trained specifically so their swim will be on point.\n\n\"In a typical triathlon, the strongest swimmers would swim as hard as they can, jump on the bike, get a small group working together and try to create a gap and hang on in the run.\n\n\"In a duathlon, the best runners will be at the front and there will be a bigger pack on the bike because the fast runners have already outrun the slower runners and they have no incentive to break away because they might as well sit in the pack wheel-to-wheel (and expend less energy than breaking away) and just wait for the second run.\"\n\n\"It's a mess,\" says Woodroffe. \"This is the Olympic triathlon. It will make it a bit of a mockery and it's brutal for the athletes. It's very amateur. You wouldn't expect it at the Olympic Games. It'll be talked about for a very long time, but it won't make duathlon a more popular sport.\"\n\nBuckingham says it would be \"sad\" if it becomes a duathlon and points out that it would ensure this year's Olympic event would \"forever have an asterisk next to it.\"\n\nAfter the success of the Tokyo Games three years ago, when a mixed relay event was added to the triathlon programme, there are fears this would set the sport back and anger over the damage to the sport's image.\n\n\"It's terrible for triathlon,\" Buckingham added. \"We want to see it in the Olympic Games. Moving forward, it might wake up organisers to the potential water quality at other events and make them plan more effectively. It seems like every other week we hear of dirty water athletes have to swim in. A duathlon is not even close to a reasonable contingency.\"\n\nWorld Triathlon president Marisol Casado has suggested there is a \"60-40\" chance of the triathlon events taking place on Wednesday.\n\n\"We really want this to happen. But, of course, we really thought that this recuperation [the improvement in the water quality] would be faster than it was,\" she said. \"We were shocked this morning when we saw that it was not as fast as we wanted.\"\n\nAurelie Merle, executive director of sports competitions at Paris 2024, added: \"The priority of the IOC, of Paris 2024, is for the health of the athletes, and the tests that were carried out on the Seine were not sufficient on the entirety of the course.\"\n\nChanging the race's format could dramatically alter the prospects of who comes away with gold medals.\n\n\"Hayden Wilde from New Zealand and Morgan Pearson from the USA run well,\" says Woodroffe. \"Alex Yee and Kristian Blummenfelt will take the run out very fast. It could be a lot closer on the bike. The difference will be whose legs are cooked for the 10km.\n\n\"On the women's side, the race would split up a lot more because the running times are much wider apart. It would be less of a spectacle for the women.\"\n\nBuckingham says, inevitably, the stronger runners in the triathlon would benefit from the elimination of the swimming event.\n\n\"Yee, Blummenfelt and Wilde -- the medallists from Tokyo -- it wouldn't affect them as much because they are all strong runners,\" he said. \"The same with Beth Potter and Cassandre Beaugrand in the women's race -- they finished first and second in the test event last year and are exceptional runners.\n\n\"Pearson from the USA runs really well. He might make it into the mix. He might soak up that first run better and may not have quite the same problems with cramp, heat stress and fatigue, which they will all suffer from. It subtly brings one or two people into it more. Of the top 10, about 70 per cent would be the same with a duathlon or a triathlon.\n\n\"It will change the result but the favourites will still be favourites. In the women's triathlon, Leonie Periault, who is a class athlete, would be more in contention for a medal. The athletes who can soak up the first run tend to do the best.\"\n\nSort of. The heating of the planet due to human-induced climate change is increasing the intensity of rainfall and that results in more polluted rivers.\n\n\"The climate has changed that we are facing. In some cases we have waves that are too high, in other moments we have electrical storms,\" Casado said.\n\nMerle also pointed to the unusually large total rainfall. \"We had meteorological events beyond our control,\" she said. \"The equivalent to July's rainfall fell in just 36 hours. It's taken time for the river to get back to normal.\"\n\nThat could not be accounted for in a matter of days, but the state of the Seine over time is something that was within the control of the city, hence the decision to spend so much trying to clean up the river and prevent discharges from reaching it in the first place.\n\nMany athletes, present and former, have been dismayed at the lack of a contingency plan involving another venue.\n\n\"If the priority was the health of the athletes this event would have been moved to another location a long time ago,\" Belgian triathlete Marten Van Riel wrote on Instagram.\n\nHe added that organisers had been \"disrespectful to the years of preparation of the athletes and to all our fans that were going to watch live or on TV. What an appearance for triathlon on the biggest scene.\"\n\nThose sentiments were echoed by Vicky Holland, who won bronze for Great Britain at the 2016 Olympics.\n\n\"A duathlon would be the worst-case scenario,\" Holland told the BBC. \"That would be a really disappointing outcome. It is disappointing that there wasn't another contingency in place, but a backup venue feels like an obvious option.\"\n\nThe marathon swimming event may be relocated to the rowing course at Vaires-sur-Marne should the Seine still be considered unsafe, but that would be less practical for a triathlon.\n\n\"There's a spot 40km from Paris where they've done open-water swimming,\" says Woodroffe. \"There's a big triathlon series -- the French Grand Prix -- who do an event a few kilometres from Paris with an open swim. A lot of talk within triathlon circles has been, 'Why didn't they just use this venue?'\n\n\"They could swim there, then cycle into the city centre, because they want the city-centre thing. The Seine seems to have been a passion project. If you've got the surfing in Tahiti and French Polynesia, then you can probably do the triathlon a few kilometres outside Paris.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

He is absolutely furious with how this entire sewage-based saga has gone down over the last few days, weeks and months.\n\nThe athletes are forced to sit around and wait for an event that may or may not happen as planned -- or at all.\n\nFrance spent $1.5 billion (!!) to clean up the Seine in Paris ahead of the Olympics. Not only did the famous \"river\" play a huge role in the Opening Ceremonies, it is supposed to host then swimming leg of the men's and women's triathlon as well as the swimming marathon.\n\nHowever, swimming in the Seine has been illegal for more than 120 years due to fecal bacteria. Heavy rains overwhelm Paris' infrastructure and literal sewage leaks into the city's most famous body of water.\n\nThe expensive cleanup effort was an epic failure. Open water swing practice was canceled on Sunday and Monday due to unsafe conditions. The men's triathlon on Tuesday was also postponed to Wednesday.\n\nIf bumping it back by one day doesn't work, which it certainly seems like it will not based on the forecast for the week, they'll hold the men's and women's competitions on Friday. If it is not safe to swim in the Seine by Friday, the Olympics will hold the triathlon as a duathlon -- with only biking and running.\n\nParis officials refused to apologize to the athletes and blamed conditions outside of their control, weather and climate change, for the high levels of E. coli. They also said that a downgrade to a duathlon would not be unfair to any athletes, even though they prepared for a triathlon and some athletes are better in the water than on land.\n\nMarten Van Riel had/has hopes to podium in the men's triathlon after finishing sixth in Rio and fourth in Tokyo.

The tests revealed that bacterial levels had decreased, putting an end to the uncertainty surrounding the feasibility of the central Paris swim after heavy rainfall.\n\nOriginally slated for Tuesday, the men's triathlon was rescheduled to Wednesday due to the river failing to meet the required water quality standards.\n\nPARIS OLYMPICS LIVE UPDATES: DAY 5\n\nThe confirmation that the races will take place on Wednesday has brought relief to the teams, athletes and Paris authorities. The city has made a commitment to its residents to ensure a swimmable Seine as a lasting legacy of the Olympic Games, with the triathlon serving as a highly visible assessment of this promise.\n\n\"It is with great joy that we received this news,\" Benjamin Maze, technical director for France's triathlon federation, told Reuters. \"Now that we know we will race, we can mentally switch fully into competition mode.\"\n\nThe triathlon races scheduled for Wednesday were allowed to proceed despite the overnight rainfall. The decision to continue with the event was made by the organizers after analyzing river samples collected at 5 a.m. the previous day and consulting with weather experts, as stated by Paris 2024.\n\nHowever, the weather conditions took a turn for the worse as showers resumed around 5:45 a.m. on Wednesday. The rainfall made the cycling stage more challenging for the athletes, as the course includes sharp turns and a significant portion on cobbled roads.\n\nThe triathlon, which is considered a centerpiece event of the Paris Olympics, commences and concludes at the Alexandre III bridge. The route takes the competitors along the famous Champs-Elysees and past iconic landmarks such as the Musee d'Orsay.\n\nThe women's race, featuring 55 athletes from 34 nations, is set to begin at 8 a.m. (0600 GMT). Two of the top contenders for the gold medal, Cassandre Beaugrand from France and Beth Potter from Britain, will start the race side by side, diving into the river from a floating pontoon adjacent to the bridge.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the women's race, the men's event will commence at 10:45 a.m.\n\n\"The results of the latest water analyses, received at 3.20 a.m., have been assessed as compliant by World Triathlon allowing for the triathlon competitions to take place,\" Paris 2024 and World Triathlon said in a statement.\n\nThe city of Paris has invested a substantial sum of 1.4 billion euros ($1.52 billion) in public funds to upgrade its wastewater infrastructure. The goal is to effectively manage sewage and reduce spillage into the river. In an effort to allay concerns about water quality, Mayor Anne Hidalgo recently took a swim, aiming to reassure skeptics that the water poses no health risks.\n\nHowever, the last-minute decision to postpone the men's race on Tuesday sparked frustration and disappointment among some of the participating athletes.\n\n\"If the priority was the health of the athletes, this event would have been moved to another location a long time ago,\" Belgium's Marten Van Riel wrote on World Triathlon's Instagram page.\n\n\"We are just puppets in a puppet show.\"\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

In the run-up to the Games, organisers had spent over a billion dollars to improve the river's condition. The Seine has long been polluted, so much so, that swimming in the Seine had been banned since 1923.\n\nParis' aged sewage system is designed such that rainwater and wastewater flow through the same pipes. During heavy rain, these pipes reach their capacity and overflow, leading to untreated sewage being directly discharged into the Seine instead of first going to a treatment plant.\n\nMoreover, rains also lead the Seine to be inundated with wildlife like rodents. \"When it rains a lot, all of that from those animals can end up in the Seine,\" Dr Nicole Iovine, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Florida Health in Gainesville, told the Associated Press.\n\nA major issue is the concentration of the bacteria E. coli in the river. Found in the faecal waste of humans and other animals, some strains of the bacteria can cause severe illness, including gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections (UTIs). E. coli concentration levels are measured in colony-forming units (cfu). Up to 900 cfu per 100 ml of water is considered safe for competitions, per standards set by the European Union and the World Triathlon Federation. Following heavy rains, the Seine's E. coli levels often exceeded this threshold, sometimes by a factor of two.\n\nA billion-dollar plan\n\nTo fix the Seine's pollution problem, Paris has spent 1.4 billion euros ($1.53 billion). In fact, key to Paris' winning bid for the 2024 Games was a major environmental overhaul of the city. This included a promise to ensure that Olympic athletes could swim in the iconic river, much like they had done in 1900 -- the last time Paris hosted the Olympics.\n\nCentral to the city's efforts to fix the Seine was the creation of a giant underground rainwater storage tank in southeastern Paris, capable of holding enough water to fill 20 Olympic-size swimming pools. Planners believed this would hold runoff water during heavy rains, the sewage system from getting overwhelmed.\n\nThe city also attempted to renovate the sewage system and upgrade its water treatment plants. But heavy rains can still overwhelm the system and contaminate the river -- as we see now.\n\nThe alternatives\n\nThe triathlon swimming events were scheduled for July 30 and 31, and August 5, while the marathon swimming events (also to be held in the Seine) are to be held on August 8 and 9. Water quality tests are mandatory 48 hours before each race. Reserve days have been kept for the water quality to improve.\n\nFor marathon swimming, the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium near Paris has been kept as an alternative venue. If the Seine remains, the swimming leg of the triathlons may be cancelled.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "saima_mehta@indianexpress.com", "name": "Saima Mehta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony-forming_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colony-forming unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Escherichia coli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_tract_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Urinary tract infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewerage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sewerage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wastewater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wastewater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sewage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gastrointestinal tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Feces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gainesville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gainesville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gainesville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic-size_swimming_pool", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic-size swimming pool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_treatment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Water treatment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_runoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surface runoff"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Swimming_and_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Swimming and Diving", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/07/explained-sports.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776638", "eventUri": "eng-9776638", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "dateEnd": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 2464, "textEnd": 2478}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "dateEnd": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 2578, "textEnd": 2592}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 2484, "textEnd": 2492}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

We are not going to let them swim unless the water is good quality.\"\n\nFurther down the river from the Pont Alexandre III Bridge start and finish line, at the offices of water analysts Fluidion, we found water intelligence experts testing the latest batch from the Seine as part of constant monitoring.\n\nIn the laboratory, samples from three different spots on the river were there, ready for rapid tests.\n\nFluidion chief executive Dan Angelescu showed us two samples being incubated.\n\n\"They develop optical signals that allow us to obtain a signal curve,\" he explained to Sky News. \"And by analysing the signal curve, we can actually determine after how long the fluorescence appears in the samples. And this is what's related to the number of bacteria in there.\n\n\"By looking at the sample over time and collecting plenty of data on multiple optical channels, we can determine the number of bacteria that were there initially when we started the measurement.\"\n\nFar from a Paris-only problem\n\nThe quality of open waters for sports is far from a unique problem for Paris.\n\nRowers in the Oxford-Cambridge boat race in April this year complained about pollution in the River Thames and sickness was blamed on an outbreak of E.coli.\n\nBut there have been concerns about the Seine's water safety, with swimming banned in 1923 - a year before the Olympics were last staged in Paris.\n\n\"What is dangerous is that when you have sewage that overflows into the river, you'll get all the pathogens that are associated with it,\" Mr Angelescu said.\n\n\"So it's not the bacteria we measure that are necessarily dangerous, but it is all the pathogens that are coming with it.\n\n\"And those could be viruses, other types of bacteria, they could be protozoa, etc.\n\n\"So this is where the danger comes from. And what we measure is a way to quantify the risk by looking at E. coli, which is one of the bacteria that you find in the human digestive tract. But the danger comes from pretty much everything else that's out there associated with it.\"\n\nParis tried to clean up the contaminated water to provide a triathlon venue giving landmarks and monuments even greater prominence in the coverage.\n\nBut was scenery prioritised over safety considerations in trying to secure a route?\n\n\"This is very important specifically for our athletes - it's very important just to showcase,\" Ms Casado said. \"It is very important because for me ours are the best athletes in the village, let's say. And they require a wonderful space.\"\n\nToday, the Seine was too risky to swim in.

Will Ivan Puskovitch get to swim the Seine?", "body": "By Mike Sielski, The Philadelphia Inquirer The Tribune Content Agency\n\nPARIS - In the wake of a rainstorm Friday that dampened the Olympics' opening ceremony and deteriorated the Seine River's water quality, Olympic organizers postponed the men's triathlon on Tuesday, raising doubts about when and whether the outdoor swimming events at the Games will be contested.\n\nThe triathlon was scheduled to go off at 8 a.m. Paris time. But 4 1/2 hours earlier, after testing the Seine's water, representatives from the International Olympic Committee, World Triathlon and the City of Paris, among other determining bodies, decided early that the race needed to be pushed back to 10:45 a.m. Wednesday. The women's triathlon remains scheduled for 8 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nBoth of those competition dates, however, \"are subject to the forthcoming water tests complying with the established World Triathlon thresholds for swimming,\" according to a statement released by World Triathlon. The original contingency date of Friday for both triathlon events remains in place.\n\n\"Paris 2024 and World Triathlon reiterate that their priority is the health of the athletes,\" World Triathlon's statement read in part. \"The tests carried out in the Seine today revealed water quality levels that did not provide sufficient guarantees to allow the event to be held.\"\n\nThe postponement is hardly surprising, given the challenges that the Seine's conditions posed and the spotty history of the Olympics' open-water events. Paris spent a reported $1.5 billion (in American dollars) to try to clean the Seine, but swimming has been illegal in the river for more than a century, and rain often leads to rising levels of E. coli and other contaminants. Problems related to pollution and water impurity plagued previous Summer Games in Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro and Sydney.\n\nIvan Puskovitch is scheduled to compete in the men's marathon swimming event on Aug. 9. Weeks before the Summer Games began, he, his family and his coaches expressed concerns about the quality of the Seine's water and the possibility that the Olympics' open-water events would either have to be moved indoors or prove altogether unsafe.\n\n\"I think about that a lot,\" Puskovitch said in May. \"I would really love to race in the Seine. It's so iconic. That said, I'm a little bit disappointed they've had so much time to get this thing cleaned up, and there's still no certainty.\"", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kansas City Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_sielski@kansascity.com", "name": "Mike Sielski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Philadelphia_Inquirer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_water_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open water swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marathon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marathon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Water_Sports/Swimming_and_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Water Sports/Swimming and Diving", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.kansascity.com/wps/build/images/kansascity/facebook.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776638", "eventUri": "eng-9776638", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 1914, "textEnd": 1920}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Coli Crisis After $1.5 Billion Seine River Cleanup; Triathletes and Sports World Raises Concern", "body": "Jul 30, 2024; Paris, France; A general view of the Seine river after the men\u00eds triathlon was postponed during the Paris 2024 Olympic Summer Games at Grand Palais-Pont Alexandre III. Mandatory Credit: Andrew Nelles-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe lead-up to the Paris Olympics was filled with excitement among competing athletes and sports fans worldwide. The French government invested $1.5 billion to clean up the Seine River for the triathlon events.\n\nHowever, as reported by Joe Pompliano in his LinkedIn newsletter, these activities have recently been canceled due to elevated E. coli levels. This issue represents one of the most significant setbacks in Olympic history and a major disaster for the organizers.\n\nThe Seine River clean-up was no simple task, given Paris's age and the difficulty of updating older infrastructure. A project was implemented to collect sewer waste in a giant basin before it could contaminate the river. However, this system proved vulnerable to overflow during rainfall, leading to direct contamination of the Seine.\n\nInitially, the project seemed successful, with Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo even swimming in the river to demonstrate confidence in the clean-up efforts. Unfortunately, rain during the opening ceremony caused the river to become contaminated once again.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) has been testing the water daily, but with consistently poor results and upcoming rains predicted, they are now considering modifying the triathlon to a duathlon, eliminating the swimming portion.\n\nThis situation has sparked outrage online, with athletes and fans criticizing the mishandling of the event preparations.\n\nFans and athletes alike were looking forward to the Paris Olympics. However, due to the government's negligence, everyone is forced to endure this difficult moment, causing widespread outrage.\n\nWhen World Triathlon shared an Instagram post about the matter, one of Belgium's biggest triathletes, Marten Van Riel, expressed his dissatisfaction, stating:\n\n\"If the priority was the health of the athletes this event would have been moved to another location a long time ago. We are just puppets in a puppetshow.\"\n\nHe continued, writing:\n\n\"Duathlon is no triathlon and changing the day like that in the middle of the night is disrespectful to the years of preparation of the athletes and to all (y)our fans that were going to watch live or on tv. What an appearance for triathlon on the biggest scene!\"\n\nBob Babbitt, a veteran of the sport, recalls another incident in triathlon competitions and compares how the surfing association decided to relocate the event from Paris.\n\n\"In the last Olympics somehow a huge boat was in the way and for the first time in my 40 + years in the sport there was a false start. This time around World Triathlon had four years to come up with a Plan B. The leaders of Surfing, which is only in it's second Olympic Games, made the decision to move to Tahiti to showcase their sport and their athletes in the best light possible.\"\n\nHe continued, writing:\n\n\"World Triathlon decided to put their athletes at risk and pray that a disgusting body of water would somehow clean itself up overnight. I feel awful for these amazing athletes who have spent their lives preparing for these Olympic Games and now have to hope and pray that they actually get to race a triathlon tomorrow!\"\n\nBritish triathlete Max Stapley has also expressed his dissatisfaction with the management.\n\n\"Pathetic, 0 respect for athlete welfare and investment. Not being able to hold a triathlon in the country with the most tried and tested venues in the world is inexcusable.\"\n\nNew Zealand's Chris Dunn also expressed the same emotion as his fellow triathletes.\n\n\"The river has been un-swimmable for 100 years. One more day will fix it [facepalm emoji]\"\n\nThe World Triathlon will convene with the organizers to determine the fate of the events as soon as possible, with an official statement to follow.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rahul_goutam_hoom@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Rahul Goutam Hoom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_France", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitary_sewer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sanitary sewer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor of Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marten_Van_Riel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marten Van Riel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hidalgo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anne Hidalgo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surfing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emoji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahiti", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tahiti"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tahiti"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "French Polynesia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Duathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/07/5af62159-seine-river.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776638", "eventUri": "eng-9776638", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Organizers had postponed the men's race on Tuesday and cancelled practice sessions on Monday and Sunday because the level of E.coli bacteria in the river was above the allowable limit.\n\nOvernight showers raised concerns that there might be another postponement or even cancellation of the swimming legs, turning the event into a duathlon of cycling and running. Persistent rainfall this spring and last weekend have overwhelmed treatment centers and allowed contaminated water to runoff into the river.\n\nAfter more testing and an analysis of weather forecasts, World Triathlon gave the go ahead early Wednesday for both the men's and women's events to take place that morning. \"We will swim\", the governing body declared on X.\n\nThe layout of the course offered spectacular views of the city and organizers had faced questions about whether they had put aesthetics above the safety of the athletes by sticking to their plan to use the Seine as a venue. But officials insisted that the health of competitors had always been paramount.\n\nBoth races began with athletes swimming two laps in the river near the bridge in the shadow of the Effiel Tower, where swift currents also posed challenge. The 40 kilometer cycling course involved seven circuits through the wet streets of central Paris including some slippery cobblestone sections that caused several crashes in the women's race. And the 10 kilometer run covered part of the same route for four laps.\n\nBermuda's Flora Duffy, who won gold in Tokyo, got out of the water first in the women's race followed by Bianca Seregni of Italy and Vittoria Lopes from Brazil. That trio was quickly overhauled in the cycling leg which was led by a pack of nine riders.\n\nThe lead group dwindled to four in the run; Julie Derron of Switzerland, Beth Potter of Britain and two French triathletes -- Cassandre Beaugrand and Emma Lombardi -- which sent fans lining the streets and bridges into a frenzy. Beaugrand pulled away in the final lap to win gold in 1:54:55, followed by Derron six seconds back and Potter who was nine seconds behind her. Canada's Emy Legault finished 35th.\n\nThe water quality of the Seine has been an issue for months and officials had been at pains to demonstrate that the river would be clean enough for the triathlon and the marathon swimming event next week. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo took a highly-publicized swim earlier this month and the city remains determined to open three sites along the river for public swimming next summer.\n\nFrench authorities have also invested \u20ac1.4-billion ($2.1-billion) on a variety of clean-up initiatives. One of the biggest is a new rainwater-retention basin that's capable of collecting 50,000 cubic metres of water, the equivalent of roughly 20 Olympic-sized swimming pools. The basin is supposed to handle runoff from summer storms.\n\nBut weeks of testing this spring have shown that levels of E. coli and enterococci, an intestinal bacteria, fluctuated wildly and soared as high as 10 times above the allowable limits some days this spring. Even on Tuesday, officials were saying the levels were still slightly above limits set by World Triathlon.\n\nAur\u00e9lie Merle, Paris 2024 executive director of sports, said Tuesday that testing showed results of between 980 colony-forming units/100 mL of water and 1,553 CFU/100 mL.

But in an embarrassing turn of events, the men's triathlon had to be postponed on Tuesday after water tests revealed that the river was too contaminated for safe swimming. The decision came despite the World Triathlon president, Marisol Casado, saying there was an 80% chance the event would happen on Tuesday. Concerns grew to the point that officials were suggesting the race might be turned into a duathlon if the situation does not get better.\n\nAfter much suspense, both the men's and the women's triathlon are going ahead this morning. \"We will swim,\" World Triathlon said in a post on X. Though the news will be heartening to athletes, there are still questions about long-term solutions for keeping sewage out of the Seine.\n\nFor today's newsletter, I spoke with Guardian environment reporter Helena Horton about why it has been so difficult to clean up the Seine. That's right after the headlines.\n\nOfficials have been discussing cleaning up the Seine since the late 1980s. The latest iteration of the plans began in earnest eight years ago and the government seemed optimistic that the notoriously murky river could be transformed in time for the Olympics. The hope was that the scheme would make it clean enough for Olympians to compete and, later, for citizens to take a dip during the increasingly hot Parisian summers. (Pictured above, athletes testing the waters in 2023.)\n\nIn the months running up to the Games, water quality testing results were persistently negative but officials blamed the findings on a particularly wet spring. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, promised to go for a swim himself, to show confidence in the scheme, but the fallout from the snap election seems to have kept him occupied.\n\nParis's mayor, Anne Hidalgo, and the French sports minister, Am\u00e9lie Oud\u00e9a-Cast\u00e9ra, have, in fact, taken the plunge - although it has since been revealed that pollution levels were too high on the day that Hidalgo got in the water.\n\nThe optimism from officials was not pure hubris - water quality in the Seine can change quickly because of rain, which can make pollution levels spike. Hot and dry summer weather was expected to keep these problems at bay, but heavy rainfall last weekend scuppered hopes.\n\n\"At the beginning, it seemed to be a crazy and not very serious idea,\" Macron said. \"But we decided it was the right moment to deliver this crazy idea and make it real.\" Maybe it was a bit too left-field after all.\n\nIt has been illegal to swim in the Seine for a century, but once Paris was chosen as a host for the Games, French officials became taken with the idea of showing off the capital as much as possible. The river became the centrepiece of the Paris Olympics' PR machine.\n\nUltimately, though, there was not enough time or money put into the project to make it failsafe. While \u20ac1bn to clean it up seems big, the plan was executed \"relatively cheaply\" in the context of huge infrastructure projects, Helena says. The state-funded project has included investment in managing wastewater, filtering stations, treatment plants and storm basins to keep bacteria at bay.\n\nThe most important part of the clean water project is the cavernous runoff basin, which can hold 50,000 cubic metres of storm overflow water. That is about 20 Olympic swimming pools' worth of water, according to Paris 2024.\n\nThe plan was never to purify the Seine, it was \"to keep untreated water from being dumped\" into the river, according to the lead engineer on the project. But even that goal was always going to be difficult to achieve, because older cities such as London and Paris have what is known as a combined sewage system. Countries with newer sewage systems tend to have two systems of pipes: one for all household wastewater, and one for stormwater from roofs, gutters, road runoff and the like.\n\nBut Paris's historic system means there is only one system where all the water is mixed together. When it rains and the pipes are at risk of overflow, instead of backing up into people's homes it flows into rivers and the sea. \"This happens quite frequently,\" Helena adds. This pollution makes it unsafe to swim in the river, and chokes out wildlife that might otherwise live there. Building the basin ensures that wastewater does not enter the river, so long as it's not at capacity. The problem arises when it rains too much and the basin gets full. The overflows still happen, and there is no way of guaranteeing that the river is safe to swim in.\n\nForecasting is notoriously difficult, but the impact of the climate crisis on weather patterns is well known. \"Because of the climate breakdown, we are getting heavier rain in northern Europe than we are used to at strange times of the year,\" Helena says. \"We've had that in the UK this year, and it was part of the reason we have had record sewage overflows. So, in some ways, the problem holding the triathlon [in the river] should have been predicted.\"\n\nAfter months of boasting about the scheme, \"the way things have panned out is not going to really raise confidence in the Parisians who might want to go swimming in the river in the next few years\", Helena says.\n\nBut it is not all doom and gloom. Even gradual improvements in the river have brought wildlife slowly back to the Seine - French authorities have counted more than 30 species of fish, compared with three in 1970.\n\nRealistically, a long-term strategy to transform the Seine would need far more intervention, investment and, crucially, foresight. It is a major undertaking: the sewage systems are so vast and so old that fixing the problem will require building new sewers.\n\n\"They really should have been replaced incrementally over time,\" Helena says. \"To build the super-sewers that you would need under cities like Paris and London to completely reduce sewage pollution, the French government would need to dig up the city and probably spend tens of billions over decades - but they are not incentivised to do that.\"\n\nParis 2024 | Team GB have bagged two more gold medals with a win in the 4x200m freestyle race ahead of the US and Australia, and a Games record in the men's trap shooting final from Nathan Hales, together doubling Great Britain's gold medal haul.\n\nFootball | Former footballer Joey Barton has pleaded not guilty to an offence of malicious communications in relation to posts directed at the pundit Eni Aluko.

Valerie Labi is the founder of Wahu, producers of Ghana's first electric bicycle, founded to combat unsustainable, unreliable and expensive transport in the country. During the Covid pandemic, Labi began buying secondhand pushbikes to convert into ebikes. Four years on, the company has launched a platform for delivery riders, opened an assembly plant in the country's capital, Accra, and is about to close on an $8m investment round. Wahu plans to eventually produce 50,000 ebikes a year across Africa, making huge cuts to carbon emissions. It's good for drivers' pockets, too: each bike costs just $13.60 a month to power, compared with $250 for a petrol vehicle. \"If I see a problem and I think it can be solved, I follow that thread,\" says Labi.\n\nSign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday\n\nAnd finally, the Guardian's puzzles are here to keep you entertained throughout the day.

But in an embarrassing turn of events, the men's triathlon had to be postponed on Tuesday after water tests revealed that the river was too contaminated for safe swimming. The decision came despite the World Triathlon president, Marisol Casado, saying there was an 80% chance the event would happen on Tuesday. Concerns grew to the point that officials were suggesting the race might be turned into a duathlon if the situation does not get better.\n\nAfter much suspense, both the men's and the women's triathlon are going ahead this morning. \"We will swim,\" World Triathlon said in a post on X. Though the news will be heartening to athletes, there are still questions about long-term solutions for keeping sewage out of the Seine.\n\nFor today's newsletter, I spoke with Guardian environment reporter Helena Horton about why it has been so difficult to clean up the Seine. That's right after the headlines.\n\nFive big stories\n\nIsrael-Gaza war | Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, has been targeted and killed in Tehran, the group said in a statement early on Wednesday morning. Iran's Revolutionary Guard confirmed the assassination, which was reported on Iranian state TV early on Wednesday morning, with analysts also claiming Israel killed Haniyeh, the Associated Press said.\n\nUK news | Keir Starmer has said those who rioted in Southport on Tuesday night will \"feel the full force of the law\" after police vehicles were set alight and missiles hurled at officers. It came after far-right protesters pelted police with glass bottles and bricks and attacked a mosque following a knife attack that killed three children and left five other children and two adults in a critical condition.\n\nConservatives | Kemi Badenoch, the frontrunner to be the next Conservative party leader, has been accused of creating an intimidating atmosphere in the government department she used to run, with some colleagues describing it as toxic, the Guardian can reveal.\n\nUS election 2024 | Donald Trump has repeated his weekend remarks to Christian summit attendees that they would never need to vote again if he returns to the presidency in November.\n\nHealth | The hidden cost of rising workplace sickness in the UK has increased to more than \u00a3100bn a year, largely caused by a loss of productivity amid \"staggering\" levels of presenteeism, a report warns.\n\nIn depth: Could France still someday make its 'crazy idea' work?\n\nOfficials have been discussing cleaning up the Seine since the late 1980s. The latest iteration of the plans began in earnest eight years ago and the government seemed optimistic that the notoriously murky river could be transformed in time for the Olympics. The hope was that the scheme would make it clean enough for Olympians to compete and, later, for citizens to take a dip during the increasingly hot Parisian summers. (Pictured above, athletes testing the waters in 2023.)\n\nIn the months running up to the Games, water quality testing results were persistently negative but officials blamed the findings on a particularly wet spring. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, promised to go for a swim himself, to show confidence in the scheme, but the fallout from the snap election seems to have kept him occupied.\n\nParis's mayor, Anne Hidalgo, and the French sports minister, Am\u00e9lie Oud\u00e9a-Cast\u00e9ra, have, in fact, taken the plunge - although it has since been revealed that pollution levels were too high on the day that Hidalgo got in the water.\n\nThe optimism from officials was not pure hubris - water quality in the Seine can change quickly because of rain, which can make pollution levels spike. Hot and dry summer weather was expected to keep these problems at bay, but heavy rainfall last weekend scuppered hopes.\n\n\"At the beginning, it seemed to be a crazy and not very serious idea,\" Macron said. \"But we decided it was the right moment to deliver this crazy idea and make it real.\" Maybe it was a bit too left-field after all.\n\n***\n\nThe stinky Seine\n\nIt has been illegal to swim in the Seine for a century, but once Paris was chosen as a host for the Games, French officials became taken with the idea of showing off the capital as much as possible. The river became the centrepiece of the Paris Olympics' PR machine.\n\nUltimately, though, there was not enough time or money put into the project to make it failsafe. While \u20ac1bn to clean it up seems big, the plan was executed \"relatively cheaply\" in the context of huge infrastructure projects, Helena says. The state-funded project has included investment in managing wastewater, filtering stations, treatment plants and storm basins to keep bacteria at bay.\n\nThe most important part of the clean water project is the cavernous runoff basin, which can hold 50,000 cubic metres of storm overflow water. That is about 20 Olympic swimming pools' worth of water, according to Paris 2024.\n\nThe plan was never to purify the Seine, it was \"to keep untreated water from being dumped\" into the river, according to the lead engineer on the project. But even that goal was always going to be difficult to achieve, because older cities such as London and Paris have what is known as a combined sewage system. Countries with newer sewage systems tend to have two systems of pipes: one for all household wastewater, and one for stormwater from roofs, gutters, road runoff and the like.\n\nBut Paris's historic system means there is only one system where all the water is mixed together. When it rains and the pipes are at risk of overflow, instead of backing up into people's homes it flows into rivers and the sea. \"This happens quite frequently,\" Helena adds. This pollution makes it unsafe to swim in the river, and chokes out wildlife that might otherwise live there. Building the basin ensures that wastewater does not enter the river, so long as it's not at capacity. The problem arises when it rains too much and the basin gets full. The overflows still happen, and there is no way of guaranteeing that the river is safe to swim in.\n\n***\n\nWas this inevitable?\n\nForecasting is notoriously difficult, but the impact of the climate crisis on weather patterns is well known. \"Because of the climate breakdown, we are getting heavier rain in northern Europe than we are used to at strange times of the year,\" Helena says. \"We've had that in the UK this year, and it was part of the reason we have had record sewage overflows. So, in some ways, the problem holding the triathlon [in the river] should have been predicted.\"\n\nAfter months of boasting about the scheme, \"the way things have panned out is not going to really raise confidence in the Parisians who might want to go swimming in the river in the next few years\", Helena says.\n\nBut it is not all doom and gloom. Even gradual improvements in the river have brought wildlife slowly back to the Seine - French authorities have counted more than 30 species of fish, compared with three in 1970.\n\n***\n\nIs there a long-term solution?\n\nRealistically, a long-term strategy to transform the Seine would need far more intervention, investment and, crucially, foresight. It is a major undertaking: the sewage systems are so vast and so old that fixing the problem will require building new sewers.\n\n\"They really should have been replaced incrementally over time,\" Helena says. \"To build the super-sewers that you would need under cities like Paris and London to completely reduce sewage pollution, the French government would need to dig up the city and probably spend tens of billions over decades - but they are not incentivised to do that.\"\n\nWhat else we've been reading\n\nDo you believe a man can fly?

During the Covid pandemic, Labi began buying secondhand pushbikes to convert into ebikes. Four years on, the company has launched a platform for delivery riders, opened an assembly plant in the country's capital, Accra, and is about to close on an $8m investment round. Wahu plans to eventually produce 50,000 ebikes a year across Africa, making huge cuts to carbon emissions. It's good for drivers' pockets, too: each bike costs just $13.60 a month to power, compared with $250 for a petrol vehicle. \"If I see a problem and I think it can be solved, I follow that thread,\" says Labi.\n\nSign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday\n\nBored at work?\n\nAnd finally, the Guardian's puzzles are here to keep you entertained throughout the day.

But in an embarrassing turn of events, the men's triathlon had to be postponed on Tuesday after water tests revealed that the river was too contaminated for safe swimming. The decision came despite the World Triathlon president, Marisol Casado, saying there was an 80% chance the event would happen on Tuesday. Concerns grew to the point that officials were suggesting the race might be turned into a duathlon if the situation does not get better.\n\nAfter much suspense, both the men's and the women's triathlon are going ahead this morning. \"We will swim,\" World Triathlon said in a post on X. Though the news will be heartening to athletes, there are still questions about long-term solutions for keeping sewage out of the Seine.\n\nFor today's newsletter, I spoke with Guardian environment reporter Helena Horton about why it has been so difficult to clean up the Seine. That's right after the headlines.\n\nOfficials have been discussing cleaning up the Seine since the late 1980s. The latest iteration of the plans began in earnest eight years ago and the government seemed optimistic that the notoriously murky river could be transformed in time for the Olympics. The hope was that the scheme would make it clean enough for Olympians to compete and, later, for citizens to take a dip during the increasingly hot Parisian summers. (Pictured above, athletes testing the waters in 2023.)\n\nIn the months running up to the Games, water quality testing results were persistently negative but officials blamed the findings on a particularly wet spring. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, promised to go for a swim himself, to show confidence in the scheme, but the fallout from the snap election seems to have kept him occupied.\n\nParis's mayor, Anne Hidalgo, and the French sports minister, Am\u00e9lie Oud\u00e9a-Cast\u00e9ra, have, in fact, taken the plunge - although it has since been revealed that pollution levels were too high on the day that Hidalgo got in the water.\n\nThe optimism from officials was not pure hubris - water quality in the Seine can change quickly because of rain, which can make pollution levels spike. Hot and dry summer weather was expected to keep these problems at bay, but heavy rainfall last weekend scuppered hopes.\n\n\"At the beginning, it seemed to be a crazy and not very serious idea,\" Macron said. \"But we decided it was the right moment to deliver this crazy idea and make it real.\" Maybe it was a bit too left-field after all.\n\nThe stinky Seine\n\nIt has been illegal to swim in the Seine for a century, but once Paris was chosen as a host for the Games, French officials became taken with the idea of showing off the capital as much as possible. The river became the centrepiece of the Paris Olympics' PR machine.\n\nUltimately, though, there was not enough time or money put into the project to make it failsafe. While \u20ac1bn to clean it up seems big, the plan was executed \"relatively cheaply\" in the context of huge infrastructure projects, Helena says. The state-funded project has included investment in managing wastewater, filtering stations, treatment plants and storm basins to keep bacteria at bay.\n\nThe most important part of the clean water project is the cavernous runoff basin, which can hold 50,000 cubic metres of storm overflow water. That is about 20 Olympic swimming pools' worth of water, according to Paris 2024.\n\nThe plan was never to purify the Seine, it was \"to keep untreated water from being dumped\" into the river, according to the lead engineer on the project. But even that goal was always going to be difficult to achieve, because older cities such as London and Paris have what is known as a combined sewage system. Countries with newer sewage systems tend to have two systems of pipes: one for all household wastewater, and one for stormwater from roofs, gutters, road runoff and the like.\n\nBut Paris's historic system means there is only one system where all the water is mixed together. When it rains and the pipes are at risk of overflow, instead of backing up into people's homes it flows into rivers and the sea. \"This happens quite frequently,\" Helena adds. This pollution makes it unsafe to swim in the river, and chokes out wildlife that might otherwise live there. Building the basin ensures that wastewater does not enter the river, so long as it's not at capacity. The problem arises when it rains too much and the basin gets full. The overflows still happen, and there is no way of guaranteeing that the river is safe to swim in.\n\nWas this inevitable?\n\nForecasting is notoriously difficult, but the impact of the climate crisis on weather patterns is well known. \"Because of the climate breakdown, we are getting heavier rain in northern Europe than we are used to at strange times of the year,\" Helena says. \"We've had that in the UK this year, and it was part of the reason we have had record sewage overflows. So, in some ways, the problem holding the triathlon [in the river] should have been predicted.\"\n\nAfter months of boasting about the scheme, \"the way things have panned out is not going to really raise confidence in the Parisians who might want to go swimming in the river in the next few years\", Helena says.\n\nBut it is not all doom and gloom. Even gradual improvements in the river have brought wildlife slowly back to the Seine - French authorities have counted more than 30 species of fish, compared with three in 1970.\n\nIs there a long-term solution?\n\nRealistically, a long-term strategy to transform the Seine would need far more intervention, investment and, crucially, foresight. It is a major undertaking: the sewage systems are so vast and so old that fixing the problem will require building new sewers.\n\n\"They really should have been replaced incrementally over time,\" Helena says. \"To build the super-sewers that you would need under cities like Paris and London to completely reduce sewage pollution, the French government would need to dig up the city and probably spend tens of billions over decades - but they are not incentivised to do that.\"\n\nParis 2024 | Team GB have bagged two more gold medals with a win in the 4x200m freestyle race ahead of the US and Australia, and a Games record in the men's trap shooting final from Nathan Hales, together doubling Great Britain's gold medal haul.\n\nFootball | Former footballer Joey Barton has pleaded not guilty to an offence of malicious communications in relation to posts directed at the pundit Eni Aluko.

Valerie Labi is the founder of Wahu, producers of Ghana's first electric bicycle, founded to combat unsustainable, unreliable and expensive transport in the country. During the Covid pandemic, Labi began buying secondhand pushbikes to convert into ebikes. Four years on, the company has launched a platform for delivery riders, opened an assembly plant in the country's capital, Accra, and is about to close on an $8m investment round. Wahu plans to eventually produce 50,000 ebikes a year across Africa, making huge cuts to carbon emissions. It's good for drivers' pockets, too: each bike costs just $13.60 a month to power, compared with $250 for a petrol vehicle. \"If I see a problem and I think it can be solved, I follow that thread,\" says Labi.\n\nSign up here for a weekly roundup of The Upside, sent to you every Sunday\n\nAnd finally, the Guardian's puzzles are here to keep you entertained throughout the day.

The river was front and center for the opening ceremony, but now the debate over water quality is coming to the forefront as competitions are underway.\n\nThe plan for the triathlon is to feature the Seine for the swimming portion of the race. However, the men's event was postponed on Tuesday because of water quality issues. Other training events were also canceled earlier this week. The men's and women's events are both scheduled for Wednesday, but that will depend on further water quality tests. Friday is an additional backup day.\n\nSwimmers in the Seine is certainly a unique idea, but the water quality has always been the biggest potential issue. Organizers have poured $1.5 billion into improving the quality of the water in preparation for the Olympics. While they've made significant investments, they can't control the entire river or the weather that can impact the water quality.\n\nThe entire Seine River is nearly 470 miles long, starting in Dijon and ending at the English Channel. Paris is over halfway down the river. The entire basin drainage area is over 29,000 square miles. It is impossible to control that much surface area, even just the half or so that is upriver from Paris. Around 62% of the drainage area is agriculture, which means high potential for runoff from fields to get into the water. There are also numerous drainage systems that lead to the Seine.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: Get the day's top headlines sent to your inbox each weekday morning with the free 3News to GO! newsletter\n\nThe rain that fell during the opening ceremony was the second heaviest daily rainfall measured since early April in Paris. Rain also fell for basically all of the drainage basin on Friday and Saturday. That rain makes its way through the system and into the river, picking up runoff along the way. The runoff from that rain can cause significant changes in the pollution in the river. All that to say, there's been a lot going into the river over the last few days. And the organizers can't really do anything about it. The boats and activity on the river for the opening ceremony could have also contributed to higher pollution because of changing currents and activity that stirred up the riverbed.\n\nWater sampling and testing have been ongoing multiple times per day. The quality limit is 1000 E.coli/100mL. Readings were looking good up to and through the opening ceremony. Since then, the effects of the rain have increased levels above that threshold and that is why the events have been postponed this week.\n\nConditions have generally been drier since Saturday which has allowed a lot of the runoff to work through. Much of the rain that fell Tuesday night will enter the Seine downstream of Paris. Other than a few widely scattered rain chances, they are expecting a good amount of warmth and some sunshine this week in Paris. That should hopefully help improve the water quality as the week goes on. The drier conditions are or have been, the healthier the river is.\n\nFurther testing will determine if the levels meet the criteria for competition before Wednesday and/or Friday.\n\nThe Seine isn't the only body of water to have issues with drainage and runoff. In northeast Ohio we deal with similar issues for Lake Erie all of the time, especially for areas like Edgewater beach with its proximity to rivers emptying into the lake. E.coli levels are measured frequently through the summer and swim advisories are issued as needed. Here's a few instances of issues we've experienced locally in the past. You can also find updates on local beach and water quality through the Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District.", "source": {"uri": "wkyc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "wkyc.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "assets@wkyc.com", "name": "assets", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Water quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_runoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Surface runoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage_basin", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drainage basin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_in_Paris_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "April in Paris (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drainage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drainage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Channel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dijon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dijon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northeast Ohio"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Erie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lake Erie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Escherichia coli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_of_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Body of water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_bed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stream bed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lake"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Paddling", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Paddling", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Sanitary Engineering", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Quality_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Quality Engineering", "wgt": 19}], "image": "https://media.wkyc.com/assets/CCT/images/c6a95df2-fb0a-4e35-9c2f-dbdb1315622a/20240730T035633/c6a95df2-fb0a-4e35-9c2f-dbdb1315622a_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776638", "eventUri": "eng-9776638", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

Despite a $1.5 billion investment to rid the river of pollutants and make it safe for swimming, practice sessions were canceled and the men's event postponed a day, thanks to high levels of E. coli, a bacteria indicating fecal contamination, in the water. Rain in Paris during the opening ceremonies and most of the day Saturday caused wastewater to flow into the river, pushing E. coli beyond acceptable levels.\n\nRider said before the triathlon that to build immunity against E. coli, he was intentionally exposing himself to the bacteria before the race. \"It's actually backed by science,\" he said. \"Proven methods. Just little things throughout your day, like not washing your hands after you go to the bathroom.\"\n\nRead More: What to Know About the Chinese Swimming Doping Scandal\n\nMany people took him seriously. But after finishing the Paris triathlon in 29th place, Rider clarified. \"Yeah, it was a joke,\" he said. \"Hopefully I can handle some E. coli because I think I swallowed so much water out there. Probably everyone did.\"\n\nThe swimming finally went off in the Seine without incident -- for now at least. \"I'm not [dead]!\" China's Xinyu Lin assured reporters on Pont Alexandre III, the site of the start and finish. Symptoms, though -- like diarrhea, stomach cramping, and vomiting -- may creep in over the next few hours and days. \"Let's see tonight,\" says Verena Steinhauser of Italy. \"I hope I will be OK. But I am a little bit nervous.\"\n\nLocal fans lining the streets in the heart of Paris for the triathlon were treated to home-team gold, as Cassandre Beaugrand of France won the race in 1 hour, 50 minutes, 7 seconds, beating Julie Derron of Switzerland by 6 seconds. Beth Potter of Great Britain took the bronze.\n\nBeaugrand finished 30th in the Rio Games and did not finish the individual event in Tokyo. Following her victory, she spotted her brother and two cousins near a security barrier, and the guards let them in to share a tearful group hug.\n\nRead More: Ireland Has Its Own Olympic Hero Who Wears Glasses\n\n\"I was not worried about the Seine river, because we swam last year and no one was sick after that,\" said Beaugrand, referring to the triathlon test event held in 2023. \"I was confident we could swim today, and that would have been a shame if we didn't.\"\n\nGreat Britain's Alex Yee won the men's race, which was rescheduled to start after the women's on Wednesday at 10:45 a.m. local time, in 1 hour, 43 minutes, 33 seconds, also 6 seconds ahead of the second-place finisher Hayden Wilde of New Zealand. France's Leo Bergere won bronze.\n\nA more pressing concern than pollution was the water current. \"There was one point where I thought they would have to pull us all out,\" says American Taylor Spivey, who finished in 10th place. \"I come from a surfing background, I've surfed 6-ft. waves before,\" says South African triathlete Jamie Riddle, who finished 25th. \"I've been in massive currents. That was far more hectic than anything I've ever experienced in any sort of waves.\"\n\nAthletes offered gripes about the race. But they had little to do with pollution. Argentina's Romina Biagioli, who did not compete in the test event last year, felt cheated by the lack of practice time in the water. \"I think it's the right of an athlete,\" said Biagioli, expressing the need for proper warm-up sessions. The men's race was originally scheduled for 8 a.m. on Tuesday; the 10:45 start time on Wednesday created more humid conditions than expected for the men. \"I don't think it's very fair that they changed the time one day before the race,\" said Lasse Luhrs of Germany, who finished in 21st place and looked drained, water and sweat droplets falling from his forehead. \"There are guys who can race better in the heat, and guys who are not very used to it.\" Luhrs puts himself in the latter camp. He insisted he would have altered his pre-Games training routine, swimming, cycling, and running in higher temperatures for a month, if he had known about the later start.\n\nRead More: Welcome to the Summer of Summer (McIntosh) at the Paris Olympics\n\nAmerican Morgan Pearson was livid about the humans, not the microbes, in the water. During the swimming portion, he accused certain opponents of impeding his progress. \"These guys are pushing me under the water, and we f-cking lose 15 seconds,\" says Pearson, who finished in a disappointing 31st place. \"So, [Shachar] Sagiv [of Israel], [Adrien] Briffod [of Switzerland], learn how to f-cking race.\"\n\n\"These guys are losers,\" added Pearson. \"And then they are attacking me on the bike ... sick, dude. For like 50th place? What are we trying to do here?\" (Sagiv came in 37th, while Briffod finished in 49th. TIME reached out to the Israeli and Swiss federations for comment and will provide any updates.)\n\nSome athletes thought the pollution concern was a bit overblown. \"We race all around the world and in all different bodies [of water],\" said Tyler Mislawchuk of Canada, the ninth-place finisher. \"If you stress every race about the water quality, I mean, I'm 29, I'd probably look like I was 75. I've lost a little bit of hair, but not that much.\" And some are clearly sick of addressing the water issue, which is understandable. You've just fulfilled an Olympic dream and finished one of humanity's more difficult athletic endeavors -- 1500 m (a near mile) in the Seine, 40 km (25 miles) on the bike, and a 10-km (6.2 miles) run through the streets of an historic city, finishing near the Grand Palais -- and you're grilled about fecal matter.\n\nA journalist asked Taylor Knibb of the U.S. how the water tasted. \"I've been drinking a lot of bottled water so that tastes very good,\" Knibb replied. No, the journalist clarified: He meant the Seine water. \"I'm not really thinking about that in the race,\" she said. \"But you know, I think I can grab you a cup if you want to taste it.\"\n\nMany of these triathletes will be jumping back in the Seine on August 5 for the mixed relay. And the open-water swimmers have their 10k marathon race on August 8 and August 9. They'll all be watching the water tests, to see if there's cause for postponement or more concern. \"Doctors out there, if there's anything I can take to kill these, I'd love to know,\" says Riddle, the South African. \"But racing today, as skeptical as it was, I do take my hat off to Paris. That was incredible.\"", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_gregory@time.com", "name": "Sean Gregory", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

A Facebook user claiming to be the cousin of a juror in former President Donald Trump\u2019s New York ... [+] hush money case thanked the court for a guilty verdict, prompting an outcry from Republicans. Getty Images Key Facts New York Judge Juan Merchan publicized the Facebook post in a Friday letter to defense attorneys and prosecutors in Trump\u2019s case\u2014quoting it in full: \u201cMy cousin is a juror and says Trump is getting convicted ? Thank you folks for all your hard work !!!!\u2764\ufe0f.\u201d \u2014sparking an immediate outcry from right-wing pundits and lawmakers. The post was made by a Facebook user identifying as Michael Anderson, who describes himself as \u201cprofessional s**tposter.\u201d Fox News anchor Sean Hannity, who has heavily criticized Merchan, focused his show on the post, calling it a \u201cvery alarming development,\u201d and \u201chas to be cause for a mistrial.\u201d Fox contributor and former Arkansas Republican Gov.

Merchan, in his letter, said the comment was on a post from May 29\u2014two days before Trump\u2019s conviction\u2014though he did not include a timestamp for the comment. The names of all 12 jurors\u2014and alternates\u2014were kept private throughout Trump\u2019s case, though the court released the occupations of those jurors, as well as their answers to a lengthy juror questionnaire that included questions such as where prospective jurors received their news and whether they had attended a Trump rally. In a follow-up post, a Facebook user also named Michael Anderson whose profile picture appears to be the same used in the original post, suggested the post was made ironically, calling himself a \u201cprofessional s**tposter,\u201d multiple outlets reported. That user also belongs to a Facebook group of Trump supporters, The Washington Post reported. Key Background Trump was convicted on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in his New York criminal case, one of four indictments the 2024 GOP nominee has faced since launching his presidential campaign. His New York trial began in April, with testimony from nearly two dozen former associates, including Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s former fixer at the center of the hush money payments, and Stormy Daniels, the adult film star who allegedly had a scandalous affair with Trump in 2006. Trump denied the affair, pleaded not guilty to all charges and pledged to appeal his conviction. He faces a maximum sentence of 136 years in prison and up to $170,000 in fines, though legal experts doubt Trump will see anywhere near a maximum penalty as a first-time offender.

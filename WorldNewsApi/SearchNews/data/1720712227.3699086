World number one Swiatek secured her third straight Roland Garros triumph, and a fourth in five years, with a 6-2 6-1 victory over Jasmine Paolini on Saturday. But the 23-year-old Queen of Clay has yet to master the grass and was knocked out in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon last year by Elina Svitolina. Swiatek will begin her preparations at the Berlin Open on June 17. She said: \u201cI felt last year that I could adapt quicker. I\u2019ll see what the plan is for this year, because last year it was the first time I was able to play this tournament before. \u201cI think to play some matches before Wimbledon is good, but on the other hand, I played basically almost every match in Stuttgart, Madrid, Rome and here, and so we need to take care of my physicality, as well. \u201cSo we\u2019ll see what the plans are. But I think the biggest progress I can make on grass right now is using my serves that was better, but also I don\u2019t expect a lot. \u201cThe balls are different. Overall tennis is different on grass. I\u2019ll just see and I\u2019ll work hard to play better there. \u201cLast year\u2019s result was pretty nice. I feel like every year it\u2019s easier for me to adapt to grass. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge challenge. If I lost here earlier, maybe I would be able to play two more weeks on grass and then be a better grass player, but if I would choose, I love playing on clay, so I\u2019m not going to give up that ever.\u201d Paolini, the 12th seed from Italy, was a surprise finalist having never progressed beyond the second round of a grand slam before this year. The 28-year-old also reached the doubles final with compatriot Sara Errani, but they were beaten 7-6 (5) 6-3 on Sunday morning by Coco Gauff and Katerina Siniakova.", "summary": "Swiatek secured her third straight Roland Garros triumph, and a fourth in five years, with a 6-2 6-1 victory over Jasmine Paolini on Saturday.", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/tennis/iga-swiatek-wimbledon-jasmine-paolini-french-open-clay-b2559436.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/09/14/09-c2207447573148a5913dbd11c4ec6909.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:06:34", "author": "Andy Sims", "authors": ["Andy Sims"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.042}

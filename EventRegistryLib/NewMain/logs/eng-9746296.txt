Sam is right in the middle.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the kids were expected to more or less raise themselves, and all were homeschooled.\n\nSam has a learning disability, which his parents ignored, and he has flunked out of college twice. He has lots of intelligence but not the tools to use it.\n\nLife has taught him that he is on his own and that few people can be trusted. He is not on good terms with his parents. But he loves my daughter, which counts for something with me.\n\nHe also dislikes me and our family because he learned that I was encouraging my daughter to get to know a guy who was interested in her who had a Ph.D. That guy turned out to be a real jerk, and Sam now bears a grudge against me for being \"elitist.\" (Shame on me for thinking a Ph.D has better job prospects than a high school grad.)\n\nSam currently works in a bar with hopes of learning how to be a bartender. His plan for the future is to marry my daughter and make a go of being a carpenter. I find myself not being crazy about the guy.\n\nAre we elitist for wanting our daughter to find a partner who has a decent relationship with his family and some kind of viable career path?\n\n- Protective Parent\n\nDear Parent: You refuse to accept Sam for who he is, so it doesn't take an educated guess to see why the foundation of your relationship with him is rotten. This not only negatively impacts your connection with him but has the potential to drive a wedge between you and your daughter.\n\nCould Sam, conceivably, make more money with a Ph.D? Sure, in theory, but which industry? How long will it take? He could also make more money as surgeon general or as an astronaut or a TikTok star. In theory.\n\nMoreover, the actual person with a Ph.D whom you encouraged your daughter to drop Sam for was a jerk. So, what are we doing here? You've created a series of what-ifs that are keeping you from seeing what-is.\n\nLet's drill down on what is:\n\nShould he choose to pursue it, carpentry is a viable career path. Per the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, there are, on average, about 79,500 new carpentry openings per year and, as an apprenticeship-based field, it doesn't have many barriers to entry.\n\nMore importantly, Sam loves your daughter; your daughter has chosen Sam. He doesn't have a good relationship with his family, but do you expect him to be on great terms with people who neglected him? Don't blame him for where he comes from. See him for what he's overcome and who he is trying to become.\n\nIf you want Sam to like your family, you need to make some amends. Acknowledge that you tried to undercut him and that it was wrong. If you're worried about his career prospects, what can you do to help him in his pursuits?\n\nYou can salvage this, but continuing to make Sam feel bad about himself because of things that are beyond his control will most likely backfire. Whereas, if you make this right and continue to build a healthy relationship with him, you may get a friend and family rate on future carpentry needs.

His plan for the future is to marry my daughter and make a go of being a carpenter. I find myself not being crazy about the guy.\n\nAre we elitist for wanting our daughter to find a partner who has a decent relationship with his family and a viable career path? -- Protective Parent\n\nDear Parent: You refuse to accept Sam for who he is, so it doesn't take an educated guess to see why the foundation of your relationship with him is rotten. This not only negatively impacts your connection with him but has the potential to drive a wedge between you and your daughter.\n\nCould Sam, conceivably, make more money with a Ph.D? Sure, in theory, but which industry? How long will it take? He could also make more money as surgeon general or as an astronaut or a TikTok star. In theory.\n\nMoreover, the actual person with a Ph.D whom you encouraged your daughter to drop Sam for was a jerk. So, what are we doing here? You've created a series of what-ifs that are keeping you from seeing what-is.\n\nLet's drill down on what is: Should he choose to pursue it, carpentry is a viable career path. Per the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, there are, on average, about 79,500 new carpentry openings per year and, as an apprenticeship-based field, it doesn't have many barriers to entry.\n\nMore importantly, Sam loves your daughter; your daughter has chosen Sam. He doesn't have a good relationship with his family, but do you expect him to be on great terms with people who neglected him? Don't blame him for where he comes from. See him for what he's overcome and who he is trying to become.\n\nIf you want Sam to like your family, you need to make some amends. Acknowledge that you tried to undercut him and that it was wrong. If you're worried about his career prospects, what can you do to help him in his pursuits?\n\nYou can salvage this, but continuing to make Sam feel bad about himself because of things that are beyond his control will most likely backfire. Whereas, if you make this right and continue to build a healthy relationship with him, you may get a friend and family rate on future carpentry needs.

Sam is right in the middle. As far as I can tell, the kids were expected to more or less raise themselves, and all were homeschooled.\n\nSam has a learning disability, which his parents ignored, and he has flunked out of college twice. He has lots of intelligence but not the tools to use it. Life has taught him that he is on his own and that few people can be trusted. He is not on good terms with his parents. But he loves my daughter, which counts for something with me.\n\nHe also dislikes me and our family because he learned that I was encouraging my daughter to get to know a guy who was interested in her who had a Ph.D. The Ph. D turned out to be a real jerk, but Sam now bears a grudge against me for being \"elitist.\" (Shame on me for thinking a Ph. D has better job prospects than a high school grad.)\n\nPeople are also reading...

His plan for the future is to marry my daughter and make a go of being a carpenter. I find myself not being crazy about the guy.\n\nAre we elitist for wanting our daughter to find a partner who has a decent relationship with his family and a viable career path? -- Protective Parent\n\nDear Parent: You refuse to accept Sam for who he is, so it doesn't take an educated guess to see why the foundation of your relationship with him is rotten. This not only negatively impacts your connection with him but has the potential to drive a wedge between you and your daughter.\n\nCould Sam, conceivably, make more money with a Ph.D? Sure, in theory, but which industry? How long will it take? He could also make more money as surgeon general or as an astronaut or a TikTok star. In theory.\n\nMoreover, the actual person with a Ph.D whom you encouraged your daughter to drop Sam for was a jerk. So, what are we doing here? You've created a series of what-ifs that are keeping you from seeing what-is.\n\nLet's drill down on what is: Should he choose to pursue it, carpentry is a viable career path. Per the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, there are, on average, about 79,500 new carpentry openings per year and, as an apprenticeship-based field, it doesn't have many barriers to entry.\n\nMore importantly, Sam loves your daughter; your daughter has chosen Sam. He doesn't have a good relationship with his family, but do you expect him to be on great terms with people who neglected him? Don't blame him for where he comes from. See him for what he's overcome and who he is trying to become.\n\nIf you want Sam to like your family, you need to make some amends. Acknowledge that you tried to undercut him and that it was wrong. If you're worried about his career prospects, what can you do to help him in his pursuits?\n\nYou can salvage this, but continuing to make Sam feel bad about himself because of things that are beyond his control will most likely backfire. Whereas, if you make this right and continue to build a healthy relationship with him, you may get a friend and family rate on future carpentry needs.

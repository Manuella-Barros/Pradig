Former Cleveland Browns WR Odell Beckham Jr. found a landing spot on a small contract with some upside, can his former team find that kind of veteran?\n\nI am just throwing this out as a suggestion. If you were to look at the free agents that are available currently, you would see some names that are surprising to a lot of people. Specifically, if you look at the safety position, aside from Justin Simmons and Quandre Diggs, there is one player that sticks out (to some degree): Jamal Adams.\n\nShould the Browns go after Adams? I would take a flier. Why not?\n\nMaking the case for Cleveland Browns going after Jamal Adams\n\nIt's not necessarily a priority that the Browns should go after Adams but it is something that should be a topic of conversation. The Seattle Seahawks decided to cut ties with both of their starting safeties this offseason, Diggs & Adams.\n\nAdams being cut was a combination of money and the simple fact that Adams couldn't stay on the field after only missing two games during his tenure with the Jets.\n\nHowever, despite being cut, Seattle and Adams remain in contact. But they aren't the only team interested in his services. NFC West rival San Francisco 49ers are interested in Adams.\n\nIf Cleveland were to look into Adams, it would be mainly to play in the box as a linebacer, not to be a safety. Despite what the narratives say regarding Adams, Adams can still be an impact player. Can he be an all-pro? Probably not, but he can contribute to a winning team if necessary.\n\nWhen you watch the tape, despite the issues that he has in coverage (which isn't his strong suit), his run defense and his ability to close out on screen plays is something that can't be ignored. Adams is also very adept at rushing the passer from the second level.\n\nDespite Seattle's defense having their fair share of issues last season, when he was on the field the defense looked different and somewhat cohesive despite finishing towards the bottom in defensive efficiency overall.\n\nLast year, in just nine games, Adams had 48 tackles, seven tackles for loss, two QB hits and two passes defended.\n\nWhere would Jamal Adams play and how much would it cost?\n\nIn terms of how much it would cost to get Adams, not a lot. A one-year prove-it deal with incentives could work for both parties. As for where he could play, as I've mentioned he would play primarily in the box, likely on the weakside as he's too undersized to be the Mike (middle) linebacker.\n\nJim Schwartz is one of the best defensive coordinators in the league and Adams would be utilized a bit better than he was in Seattle. Seattle would have him out of position at times and not using him to his strengths.

Days later, agents stopped Adams himself on the street, demanding access to his phones. The dramatic exchanges stemmed from a probe by federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York. The office, led by Damian Williams, is known for bringing high-profile public corruption cases.\n\nFollowing the raids, Adams acknowledged that he was cooperating with the U.S. Attorney's office.\n\nThe search warrants involved three individuals in the mayor's orbit: Suggs; Rana Abbasova, an aide who worked for Adams both at City Hall and Brooklyn Borough Hall; and Cenk \u00d6cal, an ex-Turkish Airlines executive who served on Adams' transition team.\n\nSuggs is no longer working as Adams' fundraiser and has been moved to a different, undisclosed role in the campaign. Abbasova, whose work included helping the mayor cultivate ties in the Turkish community, was placed on unpaid leave after City Hall said she had \"acted improperly.\"\n\nSo far, investigators appear to be exploring connections between Adams and Turkish government officials. FBI agents also raided the offices of a Brooklyn construction company with ties to the Turkish government and whose executives hosted an Adams fundraiser.\n\nOne of the questions has centered on whether the mayor helped expedite the opening of a Turkish consulate in Manhattan in exchange for donations. The consulate is part of a broader list of projects that federal prosecutors are said to be examining. Internal emails and documents shared with Gothamist last year show how top City Hall officials intervened on behalf of major companies, including several whose executives held fundraisers or bundled donations for the mayor.\n\nFire officials have claimed that the Adams administration does special favors for big developers with political influence by ushering them to the front of line for necessary fire safety inspections using an internal priority list.\n\nAdams has denied doing any special favors.\n\n\"Every New Yorker that comes to me is serviced,\" he said in November. \"Whoever calls us, whoever seeks assistance, we help them.\"\n\nA second federal investigation surfaced in late February, following an FBI raid on a senior adviser and member of the mayor's inner circle, Winnie Greco. The raid was part of a probe conducted by Brooklyn federal prosecutors, according to the New York Times.\n\nGreco, who reported directly to the mayor, has served as a key fundraiser within the Chinese community. Her relationship with Adams stretches back to his days as Brooklyn borough president. She is currently on sick leave, following a medical episode that occurred when her two homes were searched.\n\nBrooklyn prosecutors revealed another case in March involving Hui Qin, a Chinese billionaire who pleaded guilty to donating more than $10,000 in straw donations to political candidates including Adams, according to the Times.\n\nThe mayor has acknowledged knowing Qin. In April, the Daily News reported photos that showed Adams celebrating his 60th birthday at the magnate's penthouse at the Plaza Hotel.\n\nQin's ex-wife, Emma Liu, served on the mayor's Asian Affairs Advisory Council, a group led by Greco, according to reporting by The City and Documented.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg brought the first investigation into the mayor's campaign last June, when he indicted six men -- including a former NYPD colleague of Adams' -- with funneling illegal straw donations to the mayor's 2021 campaign. So far, four have pleaded guilty.\n\nThe same prosecutors previously charged Adams' former Buildings Commissioner Eric Ulrich with soliciting and accepting bribes from developers in September 2023. They are accusing Ulrich of trading favors such as rezoning approvals and building permits for a discount on a luxury apartment, artwork and a tailored suit.\n\nOne indictment details how Ulrich allegedly conspired with the developer leasing him the apartment to try to clear a homeless shelter for disaster victims across the street.\n\nUlrich has denied any wrongdoing, and it's unclear if the investigations are connected.\n\nAdams has repeatedly said he \"has nothing to hide,\" that he followed fundraising rules and encouraged those in his campaign to do so as well. He's hired the private white-shoe law firm WilmerHale, which employs his former chief counsel Brendan McGuire, to defend him. He's also set up a legal defense fund that has so far raked in more than $1.2 million in contributions. Donors include former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Adams' former chief of staff Frank Carone, and Brooklyn-based billionaire Alexander Rovt.\n\nBut the trust has also returned more than $22,000 from 11 contributors with business before the city, the Daily News first reported, and fired a prominent former detective who was supposed to vet donors shortly after he berated reporters with vulgar language.\n\nAdams has not been publicly accused of wrongdoing. He has also said he hasn't received indications that he's a target of the investigations. His chief counsel has said the mayor has been cooperating with prosecutors. Adams himself said he was not contacted by Brooklyn prosecutors regarding Greco.\n\nMeanwhile, federal and city prosecutors have declined to comment extensively on the ongoing investigations. But such probes are typically shrouded in secrecy and their full scope is often unknown until indictments are announced.\n\nThe mayor is facing a sexual assault lawsuit from a former transit police colleague over an alleged incident in 1993. In March, Lorna Beach-Mathura filed a civil complaint that accuses Adams of demanding oral sex and forcing her to touch his penis.\n\nAdams has vigorously denied the claims and said he does not recall the accuser. The city's Law Department is defending the mayor under a decision made by the city's corporation counsel, Sylvia Hinds-Radix. The Law Department has hired Alex Spiro, a high-profile celebrity attorney, to assist with the case.\n\nIn another legal maneuver, Adams has weighed replacing Hinds-Radix with Randy Mastro, a former City Hall aide and attorney known for aggressively representing conservative causes. The nomination has stalled amid heavy opposition from the City Council, which must approve the appointment.", "source": {"uri": "gothamist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gothamist"}, "authors":

It is to prevent crime, ensure timely police response, and enhance access to police services. Currently, the community relies on a police station in a neighbouring gewog. The gewog has been requesting a police station since 2013. Residents of Yoeseltse Gewog in Samtse are requesting the government to establish a police station within their locality. Currently, residents must depend on police stations in Norboogang Gewog which is about 20 kilometres away, leading to delayed response in times of need. \u201cMany shops, including mine, have been looted and burglarised. Since we are located near the border, it is easy for anyone to enter and exit the border. Despite having DeSuups and the Army, ensuring security is challenging. If we had a police station here, troublemakers would think twice, as they fear the police,\u201d said Sonam Wangmo, a resident. \u201cWe have been expressing the need for police services in our gewog for a very long time. Whenever there are problems in our gewog, we do not get a prompt response from the police because there is no police station here. The one in Chengmari is far away that by the time the police arrive, the damage is already done,\u201d said Wangmo, another resident. \u201cWe have many youths here who could not continue their studies and are without jobs. It would be better if we had a police station in our area because everyone fears the police. Currently, the police stations we rely on are located far away, and the services we receive are not timely,\u201d said Phuntsho Wangdi, also a resident. The matter was also discussed during the recent Dzongkhag Tshogdu. The Yoeseltse Gup pointed out that without police personnel, the gewog administration is burdened with policing duties, including attending to late-night calls and visits from residents needing police help. \u201cWe are tired of catching troublemakers and handing them over to the police. Law enforcement is the responsibility of the police, and it would be better if we had three to five police officers stationed in our region. Simply having a police station in the locality would help reduce the crime rate,\u201d said Tashi Jamtsho, Yoeseltse Gup. The Dzongkhag Tshogdu acknowledged the issue but cited the lack of office space and budget constraints as reasons for the absence of a police station in Yoeseltse. However, the Dzongkhag Tshogdu has directed the gewog heads to allocate the gewog budget to construct an office space and, if necessary, seek supplementary funding from the district administration. Meanwhile, the Royal Bhutan Police in Samtse said that they are willing to send police personnel if the gewog can manage office space for the officials. Yoeseltse Gewog today is home to over 5,000 residents of over 600 households.

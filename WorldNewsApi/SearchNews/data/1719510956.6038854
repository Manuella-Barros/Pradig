While consuming desserts occasionally is considered harmless, one should keep in mind that they can spike up blood sugar and cause several health issues. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Adeeba Ikram Saiyad (@dt.adeeba_ikramsaiyad) According to Dr Richa Chatturvedi, senior consultant of endocrinology, at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, \u201cSome common desserts that tend to cause significant spikes in blood sugar levels include sugary baked goods such as cakes, cookies, and pastries, as well as desserts with high concentration of added sugars like ice cream, milkshakes, and sweetened beverages.\" These desserts are typically high in simple carbohydrates, which are rapidly broken down and absorbed into the bloodstream, leading to a sharp rise in blood sugar levels, she says. Why do certain desserts have a more pronounced impact on blood sugar? Dr Chatturvedi explains that the physiological reasons why certain desserts have a more pronounced impact on blood sugar levels are related to their carbohydrate content and the type of carbohydrates they contain. \u201cSimple carbohydrates, such as glucose and fructose found in added sugars, are quickly digested and absorbed, causing a rapid increase in blood sugar levels. Conversely, complex carbohydrates found in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables take longer to digest, resulting in a slower and more gradual rise in blood sugar levels\u201d, she mentions. Worst offenders for spiking blood sugar levels? The primary factors that contribute to a dessert being classified as one of the worst offenders for spiking blood sugar levels, Dr Chatturvedi says, is a high concentration of added sugars, refined carbohydrates (e.g., white flour), and a lack of fibre, protein, or healthy fats that can help slow down the absorption of sugars.\u201d Long-term health implications of consuming desserts Dr Chatturvedi explains, \u201cFrequent and prolonged elevated blood sugar levels can increase the risk of developing insulin resistance, which is a precursor to type 2 diabetes and it can contribute to an increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic health conditions associated with poorly managed blood sugar levels.\u201d Advice to individuals with diabetes or pre-diabetes who still want to enjoy desserts Karishma Shah, integrative nutritionist and health psychologist says, \u201cIf you want to eat dessert have control over it. If you are eating dessert eat which have natural sugar instead of sweets or chocolates that promise they are sugar-free. So, that you will get mental satisfaction and then for a week don\u2019t eat any kind of dessert.\u201d Dr Chatturvedi adds, \u201cTiming does play a role in managing blood sugar levels when consuming desserts. Generally, it is recommended to consume desserts after a meal rather than on an empty stomach, as the presence of other nutrients can help slow down the absorption of sugars.\u201d", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/food-wine/sweet-temptations-sour-consequences-truth-desserts-9320521/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/delicious-donuts-arrangement.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:00:51", "author": "Lifestyle Desk", "authors": ["Lifestyle Desk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.17}

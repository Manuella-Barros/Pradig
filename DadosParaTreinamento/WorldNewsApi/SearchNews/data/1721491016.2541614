The Canadian singer-songwriter, 58, is set to take to the Pyramid Stage on Sunday June 30 for the coveted legends slot, filled by the likes of Johnny Cash and Diana Ross over the years. Speaking to Tuesday's Radio Times, the Man! I Feel Like A Woman! hitmaker revealed she was on the edge of her seat as she awaited confirmation of her slot. 'My manager said, \"I wouldn't be surprised if that comes up,\" but it's an invite that feels like a once-in-a-lifetime thing,' she said. 'I was on the edge of my seat until it became a reality.' Shania also opened up about starting out in the music industry at such a young age and recognised how male-dominated it is, as she admitted it can be intimating for women. Ahead of her Glastonbury performance, Shania referred to getting booked in the legends slot as an 'honour' and 'accolade'. 'Other people who have played the slot, like Lionel Richie and Dolly Parton, are musicians I'm heavily influenced by and look up to,' she said. Shania has never been to Glastonbury, so when asked how the gig came up she said: 'I'd been hearing about it for years.' She added: 'I'm excited but nervous. I'm going as a fan, too: I want to cheer on my fellow Canadian Avril Lavigne, and I've never seen Cyndi Lauper or Coldplay live.' Of starting out as a performer so young, Shania said: 'I began my career on a live stage so young \u2013 my first gig was when I was eight \u2013 that by the time I got my deal in Nashville, I was fearless about the music industry. 'I didn't open myself up to intimidation, but I recognise it is intimidating for most women. The industry is mostly men, not just in the higher positions, but also musicians. Shania said that not as many women pursue touring band jobs but vowed to 'show younger girls it's possible'. She revealed that she would like to inspire women coming through the industry to demand change and respect, rather than trying to change the minds of those in charge. 'I don't think we can convince people who don't want us there to change their minds \u2013 it's about inspiring those coming up to think differently,' she said. That's where change will happen.' The star praised global pop sensation Taylor Swift for the way she has navigated the music industry as a woman. She said: 'Taylor Swift has done a really good job hammering away and demanding respect as an artist. She's someone who I imagine is inspiring others.' Following the announcement that she would join the line-up in March, Shania wrote: 'The legends slot at GLASTONBURY 2024 - Another jewel in my crown!! I feel so honoured and so excited about this one! 'Thinking about what to wear already and tell me, what should we sing together?! Let\u2019s make history with this ultimate dream performance!!' Speaking to Gaby Roslin on Radio 2 Breakfast Show afterwards, she added: 'Oh my gosh, ok I\u2019m way up there at the top. I really am so excited. I mean the best part of it is being able to share it now. 'It\u2019s so exciting, it\u2019s been hard to keep it to myself to be honest. I\u2019m really glad that it\u2019s announced and I\u2019m just buzzing.'I feel like it\u2019s well, I don\u2019t know if this is the right language, but it feels like an accolade of sorts, really something that you have to earn, it\u2019s just very rewarding, it\u2019s a really beautiful feeling.' Dua Lipa admitted in March that headlining the Pyramid Stage at the event is her 'wildest dream' while the country music star, 58, said she is 'honoured' to play the coveted Legends slot. It marks the first time in the event's history that female acts have taken two of the three headline slots. Dua and Shania will be joined by Coldplay and SZA with festival co-organiser Emily Eavis announcing that the full line-up will be revealed over the coming months. The festival will be take place at Worthy Farm, near Pilton in Somerset from Wednesday June 26 to Sunday June 30. Sharing her excitement following the first announcement, Dua posted on Instagram: 'FRIDAY NIGHT PYRAMID STAGE HEADLINE!!!! I have dreamt of this moment all my life.' She continued: 'Something that lived only in my wildest dreams and highest manifestations!!! I am so excited to see you all in my favourite place on earth and make it a night to remember!!

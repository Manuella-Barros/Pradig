A father of four, Kumar had been working as a cab driver for over a decade now. A few hours later, his son Ravinder\u2019s phone rang. \u201cI got a call around 8.30am that my father had fainted. It was only around 4 in the evening that they told me that he is no more,\u201d says Ravinder. Kumar was killed, and eight others were injured, on Friday after a canopy at the old departure forecourt of T1 at Indira Gandhi International Airport partially collapsed in the record- breaking June showers in the capital. Kumar\u2019s car was among the four vehicles that came under the falling canopy. Ravinder said though his father died immediately, he was kept in the dark about it for hours. \u201cThey kept me at IGI police station till 4 pm. I didn't know till then where my father was,\u201d says Ravinder. Another driver, 28-year-old Santosh Yadav, had a narrow escape. \u201cI picked up a navy officer from Sena Bhawan, along with a flag officer. Around 5 am, I dropped the navy officer at the airport. The flag officer and I were waiting for another officer to arrive when out of nowhere, the roof fell. Both of us ran for our lives, leaving the car behind. A concrete part hit my head and it split,\u201d says Santosh. He works for a cab service called Sakshi Travels, a regular service provider for the ministry. He says he received first aid at Medanta hospital at T1 before being sent to Safdarjung Hospital. \u201cI got discharged around 2 pm,\u201d says the Lado Sarai resident. Among the injured is Arvind, 34, being treated at the ESI hospital, Basai Dhara. \u201cI work as a houseboy at the airport. My colleagues brought me here. I am not even able to talk as my head was hit,\u201d he says. Yogesh Dhawan, 44, a staff member with the airport management, says he has suffered minor injuries. Dashrath Ahirwar, 25, says, \u201cI am still at the hospital, getting treated.\u201d Ravinder, meanwhile, is yet to receive his father\u2019s body. \u201cThey have kept the body for post-mortem. I might receive it tomorrow,\u201d he says before disconnecting the call. Rs 20 lakh compensation for kin of deceased According to airport sources, those with minor injuries were taken to Medanta Centre at Delhi airport for immediate medical assistance, whereas those with serious injuries were shifted to ESI Hospital and Indian Spinal Injury Centre before being referred to Safdarjung Hospital. Later, a compensation package of Rs 20 lakh for the family of the deceased and Rs 3 lakh each for those who were injured was announced by Union Civil Aviation Minister Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu. Arrivals continued at T1 till 10.30am and subsequent flights till 2pm were cancelled before the rest of the day's flights were reallocated to T2 and T3 terminals. To investigate the cause of the collapse, a Technical Committee has been formed by the DIAL, which will submit a report as soon as possible. The DIAL is coordinating with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS), Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), Delhi Police, and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) to assess the situation and expedite the restoration of operations.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/was-told-he-fainted-son-of-airport-roof-collapse-victim-awaits-his-body-9421869/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/airport_bb33da.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:54:26", "author": "Pragynesh,Upasika Singhal", "authors": ["Pragynesh", "Upasika Singhal"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.657}

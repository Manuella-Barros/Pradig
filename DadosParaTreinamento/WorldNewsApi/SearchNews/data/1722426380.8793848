The Hawkeye actor appeared on the Smartless podcast earlier this week, and told hosts Will Arnett, Jason Bateman and Sean Hayes that he now avoids certain \u201cchallenging\u201d roles now after breaking nearly 40 bones and almost dying when his machinery ran over him. He also said that he was \u201cvery terrified\u201d to do \u201cfucking fiction\u201d when he returned to acting after his accident. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to live in reality, I\u2019m trying to live,\u201d the Mayor Of Kingstown actor said of his thought process when he was going back to work. \u201cIt was a hard line for me to cross. It was very, very challenging for me mentally to get over that hump.\u201d \u201cAnd I still struggle with it sometimes,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI don\u2019t take it super seriously. I\u2019m in a character that I can do very well, and I know the show very well, so it was easy for me to kind of slide back into it,\u201d he said of his current role on the Kingstown TV show. \u201cBut if it was a very challenging role, I wouldn\u2019t have \u2013 I couldn\u2019t have taken it,\u201d he explained. \u201cNot challenging in the sense that \u2013 because the show\u2019s challenging \u2015 but it\u2019s that, if I had to go play Dahmer or something, something so far from me, I don\u2019t have the energy for it. I don\u2019t have the fuel.\u201d \u201cI have so much fuel to put into this reality, this body, all this stuff \u2013 I can\u2019t just go play make-believe right now,\u201d the 53-year-old said. \u201cBecause it takes a lot of time to get right here every day just so I can have a positive thought, so I can progress, so I can always keep growing.\u201d Jeremy recently opened up about what was going through his mind during his gruesome snowplow accident, which occurred near his home in Reno, Nevada, on New Year\u2019s Day last year. \u201cI remember my head cracking on the thing and it just pressing on me \u2014 it\u2019s exactly like you think it would feel,\u201d he told Men\u2019s Health in an interview published on Tuesday. \u201cAn immovable object and a crushing force, and something\u2019s gotta give. But thank God my skull didn\u2019t fully give. And then it kept going. Undulate, undulate, undulate, undulate. Cheekbone broke, eye socket broke, and then from the crushing of getting run over by the machine, my eye bulged out.\u201d \u201cI could see my left eyeball with my right eyeball,\u201d he added, saying that he was \u201cscreaming for a breath.\u201d In addition to breaking 38 bones in total, Jeremy also suffered a pierced liver and a collapsed lung. He underwent multiple surgeries and spent months in recovery, and is now even able to talk about the \u201cwonderful lessons\u201d he learned from that experience. \u201cI can go on and on about what happened, and the 45 minutes being on the ice, but... there\u2019s so many great gifts,\u201d he told Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show last month. \u201cBeing tested to your limits. Your physical limits, your spiritual limits, right? Emotional limits.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like, I won\u2019t have a bad day for the rest of my life,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible.\u201d", "summary": "<div><img src=\"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/667df2292400003200a74531.jpeg?cache=kBDFnWFYnW&ops=scalefit_630_noupscale\" alt=\"Jeremy Renner in 2021\" data-caption=\"Jeremy Renner in 2021\" data-credit-link-back=\"\" data-credit=\"Jesse Grant via Getty Images\" />Jeremy Renner in 2021</div><div class=\"content-list-component text\"><p><a href=\"../../../../news/jeremy-renner/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jeremy Renner</a> has made major changes in his life after surviving a <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jeremy-renner-condition-weather-accident_n_63b25c0be4b0fe267ca9fcc4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nearly-fatal snow plough accident</a> last year.\u00a0</p><p>The Hawkeye actor appeared on the <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/3qkenVtehdfZsQ00UGGCqY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Smartless podcast</a>\u00a0earlier this week, and told hosts Will Arnett, Jason Bateman and Sean Hayes that he now avoids certain \u201cchallenging\u201d roles now after <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.co", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/jeremy-renner-avoids-these-roles-after-near-fatal-accident_uk_667ec820e4b04b5ab0726640", "image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/667df2292400003200a74531.jpeg?cache=kBDFnWFYnW&ops=1778_1000", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:00:41", "author": "Carly Ledbetter", "authors": ["Carly Ledbetter"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.324}

Despite yesterday's blue skies, today's forecast looks a lot more mixed, with rain expected throughout the day. It wouldn't be a British festival without some showers though, and this afternoon as the gates of Heaton Park swung open at 1pm, revellers donning cagoules, raincoats and even a bin bag or two, braved the wetter conditions for a slice of the festival action. Today will see some major musical acts take to the stage, with Doja Cat headlining The Valley this evening, while Kaytranada and TSHA will take to the Parklife stage. Fans can also expect performances from ANOTR, Rudimental, Anne Marie, Uncle Waffles and Children of Zeus.

You can find the full stage times for today here. The first day of Manchester's biggest festival brought with it plenty of bucket hats, cowboy boots and sparkling outfits, as thousands descended on Heaton Park for the annual celebration. With the sun making a timely appearance, musicians including Peggy Gou, Four Tet, Nia Archives, Mahalia and Sugababes all took to the stage. And as the sun set, headliners Becky Hill and Disclosure closed out the day with some of their biggest and most recognisable hits. Sunday's weather is not set to be as sunny as the day before and heavy rain is expected at times. The weather will remain overcast and cloudy with a chance of some rain throughout the day. Temperatures will start at 11\u00b0, peaking at 12\u00b0 between 3pm and 7pm and dropping to 10\u00b0 by the end of the night, hitting 9\u00b0 at midnight. Heavy rain is forecast again at 10pm and is expected to continue following the curfew with a 90% chance of rain as the festival comes to a close.", "summary": "A little bit of rain won't dampen spirts at Parklife 2024 as Kaytranada, Doja Cat and Anne Marie take to the stage", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/gallery/parklife-2024-pictures-heavy-rain-29321778", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29321840.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Parklife-arrivals-day-two.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:45:52", "author": "Jenna Campbell", "authors": ["Jenna Campbell"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.474}

In response, Gandhi questioned Modi's allegations and implied that Modi's own actions may involve undisclosed financial transactions. The Congress launched a counterattack, alleging a BJP-industrialist nexus and accusing Modi of favoring billionaires while accusing the Congress of corruption. The Congress demanded a JPC investigation into alleged wrongdoing involving Adani and Ambani, while Modi claimed the Congress had ceased criticizing them for suspicious reasons.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday for the first time during the Lok Sabha elections accused the Congress of having a ''deal'' with ''Ambani and Adani'', and asked if the party has received ''tempo loads of black money'' from the two industrialists for its leader Rahul Gandhi to stop ''abusing'' them.\n\nIn what appeared to be a change in the narrative on the 'Ambani-Adani' issue, which was until now used by the Congress to attack Modi and his government at the Centre, the Prime Minister also demanded that the party should explain to people why it has stopped raising the issue as its 'Shehzada' (Rahul Gandhi) used to do for the past five years and asked if it has struck a 'sauda' (deal).\n\nIn a sharp reaction full of sarcasm, Gandhi asked whether Modi was speaking from his ''personal experience'' when he mentioned ''money in a tempo'' being sent by Ambani and Adani. ''Modi ji, are you a little scared? Normally you talk about Adani and Ambani in closed doors, but for the first time you have talked about Adani and Ambani in public,'' Gandhi said in a 46-second video message, posted on X by the Congress.\n\nEarlier, addressing an election rally at Vemulawada in Telangana, Modi said:''Since his Rafale issue got grounded, he started chanting about 'five industrialists'. Then he started saying Ambani-Adani. But ever since elections have been announced, these people (Congress) have stopped abusing Ambani-Adani. ''I want to ask from Telangana soil, let the Shehzada announce, how much has been lifted from Ambani-Adani. Has tempo loads of money reached the Congress? What deal has been arrived at, that abusing Ambani-Adani has stopped overnight?'' The Prime Minister also said:''Certainly something is fishy. For five years, (they) abused Adani-Ambani and it stopped overnight. It means you have received some tempo loads of 'chori ka maal' (loot)...Kaale dhan ki kitni boriya bharkar ke rupaye maare hai (how many sacks of black money you have taken) You have to answer the nation.'' The Congress has been accusing the Prime Minister of favouring the top five industrialists in the country, including Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani.\n\nIn his message, Rahul also said: ''The money that PM Modi has given to the two businessmen, the Congress party will give the same amount of money to the people of India through the various schemes that the party has promised.'' ''You also know that they give money in a tempo. Is it your personal experience?'' Gandhi said.\n\n''Do one thing - send the CBI, ED to them and carry out a thorough investigation and don't be scared,'' he said.\n\n''The country knows who is the driver and helper of the BJP's tempo of corruption,'' he said in a post in Hindi on X.\n\nThe Congress also launched a fierce counterattack against Modi with party leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra charging that the BJP has a nexus with industrialists and the entire BJP machinery is engaged in spreading ''lies'' about Rahul Gandhi.\n\nCongress president Mallikarjun Kharge claimed that Modi's chair is ''shaking'' after three phases of the Lok Sabha polls as he has started attacking his own ''friends'' and this shows the ''real trend'' of the result.\n\n''The times are changing. Dost dost na raha...! (Friends are no longer friends...!) After the completion of three phases of elections, today the Prime Minister has started attacking his own friends. It is becoming clear that Modiji's chair is shaking. This is the real trend of the results,'' Kharge said in a post in Hindi on X.\n\nCongress general secretary Jairam Ramesh claimed that the tide of this election has turned so ''violently'' that the ''Pappa'' of ''Hum Do Hamare Do'' is turning on his own children.\n\n''Defeat is a foregone conclusion. The Prime Minister is now spooked even by his own shadow,'' he said in a post on X and shared a picture of Modi along with his shadow.\n\nThe Congress leader said: ''The man who collected Rs 8,200 crore of Electoral Bonds for his party - a scam so egregious that even the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional - is today levelling allegations on others.'' ''Remember that through his 'Chaar Raaste', the Prime Minister has given contracts and licenses worth Rs 4 lakh crore to his cronies in return for their donations. If today, 21 Indian billionaires have as much wealth as 70 crore Indians, it is all thanks to the PM's intentions and policies. It also goes without saying that 'Hamare Do' are key figures in those 21,'' Ramesh alleged.\n\nHe said that since January 28, 2023, the Congress party has repeatedly demanded the formation of a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to investigate the ''Modani scam''.\n\n''We reiterated this demand even after the elections began - on April 23, 2024, and just five days ago, on May 3, 2024. Since April 3, 2024, Rahul Gandhi has mentioned Adani 103 times and Ambani more than 30 times in his speeches. ''A JPC will be formed as soon as the India bloc comes to power on June 4, 2024, to investigate the Modani Scam - which has an estimated price tag of at least Rs. 2 lakh crores,'' the Congress leader said.\n\nPriyanka Gandhi Vadra also said the Prime Minister knows that people now understand the reality that he has handed over all wealth to big businessmen and he is clarifying after getting nervous.\n\n''Today he (Modi) is saying Rahul does not take the name of Adani, Ambani....He does so every day. He brings their truth in front of you every day. We say every day that they (BJP) have a nexus with industrialists. You must understand that Prime Minister Modi has waived loans worth Rs 16 lakh crore given to big billionaires. Whose money is this? This is not Modi ji's money. That is the country's money,'' she said at public meetings in Rae Bareli.\n\nAnother party leader Pawan Khera said PM Modi is disturbed after three phases of elections and realises that the ground is shaking. He claimed the Prime Minister has collected Rs 8,200 crore from his ''friends'' and when he was losing the polls, he has turned against them.\n\n''When you cannot be theirs, how can you be ours or anyone else's in the country,'' he posed, adding that the Congress does not fear anyone or anything.\n\nCongress leader Supriya Shrinate said the Prime Minister is making serious allegations of corruption against the two big industrialists and asked when would a CBI, ED or Income Tax raid happen against them.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from

Gandhi's response came after Modi accused the Congress of receiving money from these businessmen and questioned why Gandhi had stopped criticizing them. Gandhi denied the allegations and asked if Modi made the claims from personal experience. He also accused Modi of favoring Adani and Ambani and promised to help people instead of billionaires if the Congress wins. Congress leaders Jairam Ramesh and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also criticized Modi's statements. Modi had alleged a deal between the Congress and Adani-Ambani and accused Gandhi of getting black money from them.\n\nCongress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday dared Prime Minister Narendra Modi to hold a probe by the CBI or ED into whether businessmen Adani and Ambani sent black money to his party and taunted if Modi was speaking from his ''personal experience'' that they send their ''money in a tempo''. He also asked Modi if he was ''scared''.\n\nGandhi's strong retort to PM Modi came after the latter attacked him at an election rally, saying why he had stopped ''abusing'' Adani and Ambani in his attacks and whether his party received money from them in return.\n\n''Modi ji, are you a little scared? Normally you talk about Adani and Ambani behind closed doors, but for the first time you have talked about Adani and Ambani in public,'' Gandhi said in the video message.\n\n''You also know that they give money in a tempo. Is it your personal experience?'' Gandhi said while taking a swipe at PM Modi.\n\n''Do one thing - send the CBI, ED to them and carry out a thorough investigation and don't be scared,'' he said.\n\n''The country knows who is the driver and helper of the BJP's tempo of corruption,'' Gandhi said in a post in Hindi on X.\n\nHe said the money that PM Modi has ''given'' to the two businessmen, the Congress party will give the same amount of money to the people of India through the various schemes that the party has promised.\n\nThe Congress has been accusing the prime minister of favouring the top five industrialists in the country, including Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani.\n\nGandhi also said that while the prime minister has made 22 billionaires, the Congress will make crores of 'lakhpatis' in the country.\n\nAICC general secretary Jairam Ramesh also targeted Modi on his statement and said that the prime minister is bewildered as he is not getting a clear majority and is now attacking ''his own friends''.\n\n''What has the 'pappa' of 'Hum do, hamare do' said today. He is saying that his two friends Adani and Ambani have tempo full of black money.\n\n''Prime Minister, three questions arise from your sensational statement. The first is that you came on TV to announce the note ban on November 8, 2016. Today eight years later, you are saying these two businessmen have bags full of black money.\n\n''Secondly, if these two people have so much black money, why has ED, CBI action not been taken against them, even after you have put two chief ministers in jail for corruption? Is the ED, CBI sleeping like 'Kumbhakaran','' he asked.\n\nRamesh said that in the last 10 years there has been ''privatisation and everything has been sold out to them''.\n\n''Where is the black money coming from? You should answer.'' ''The real thing is that you are bewildered and are troubled and you know that you are not getting a clear majority on June 4 and that is why you are raising all kinds of things,'' the Congress leader alleged.\n\nCongress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also said, ''In the third phase itself, the people of the country have slowed down the tempo of Modi ji, hence he is missing the tempo of his friends.'' ''Modiji, please answer, the country wants to know,'' she said in a post on X.\n\nPrime Minister Modi on Wednesday accused the Congress of having a ''deal'' with Ambani and Adani, and asked if the party has received ''tempo loads of black money'' from the two businessmen for its leader Rahul Gandhi to stop ''abusing'' them.\n\n''Since his Rafale issue got grounded, he started chanting about 'five industrialists'. Then he started saying Ambani-Adani. But ever since elections have been announced, these people (Congress) have stopped abusing Ambani-Adani.\n\n''I want to ask from Telangana soil, let the Shehzada announce, how much has been lifted from Ambani-Adani. Has tempo loads of money reached the Congress? What deal has been arrived at that abusing Ambani-Adani has stopped overnight?'' he said while addressing an election rally at Vemulawada in Telangana.\n\n''Certainly something is fishy. For five years, (they) abused Adani-Ambani and it stopped overnight. It means you have received some tempo loads of 'chori ka maal' (loot)... Kaale dhan ki kitni boriya bharkar ke rupaye maare hai (how many sacks of black money you have taken). You have to answer the nation,'' the prime minister said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautam_Adani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gautam Adani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tempo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukesh_Ambani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mukesh Ambani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mahatma Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Black market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jairam_Ramesh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jairam Ramesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priyanka_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Priyanka Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Congress_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All India Congress Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privatization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_05_2019_12_11_15_3417518.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548578", "eventUri": "eng-9548578", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-11-08", "textStart": 2824, "textEnd": 2840}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 3465, "textEnd": 3471}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

After his tirade against Rafale failed, he started chanting 'five industrialists, five industrialists, five industrialists'. Later, he started chanting 'Ambani-Adani'. But after the election schedule was announced, he suddenly stopped abusing Ambani and Adani overnight,\" said Modi. \"Was there a deal? Why did you stop abusing Ambani and Adani overnight,\" he asked. \"There is something suspicious (daal mai kuch kaalaa hai),\" he said.\n\nIn a clear reference to the two industrialists, the PM alleged that \"chori ka maal (ill-gotten money)\" has been given to the Congress to stop Rahul Gandhi from targeting them.\n\nAlso read\n\nPitroda singes Congress with comments on how Indians look\n\n\"I want to ask from Telangana soil, let the Shehzada announce, how much has been lifted from Ambani-Adani.

She was speaking at Rae Bareli. Rahul Gandhi also responded with a sarcastic tweet. \"The country knows who is the driver and helper of BJP's tempo of corruption,\" he said.\n\nThe Congress has been accusing the Prime Minister of favouring the top five industrialists in the country, including Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani.\n\nIn a sharp response, Rahul Gandhi asked whether Modi was speaking from his \"personal experience\" when he mentioned \"money in a tempo\" being sent by Ambani and Adani. \"Modi ji, are you a little scared? Normally you talk about Adani and Ambani in closed doors, but for the first time you have talked about Adani and Ambani in public,\" Gandhi said in a 46-second video message, posted on X by the Congress.\n\n\"Do one thing - send the CBI, ED to them and carry out a thorough investigation and don't be scared,\" Gandhi said.\n\nAdani stocks drop\n\nMost Adani group stocks slipped marginally between 10.15 and 10.17 am when Modi made the startling statement. For instance, Adani Enterprises slipped from \u20b92,886.90 to \u20b92,855.50. However, the stock recovered after that to hit a high of \u20b92,880 before closing at \u20b92,860.17, up 0.87 per cent over previous day's close.\n\nPitroda's gaffe\n\nModi also used his two Telangana rallies to take a dig at Rahul's mentor Sam Pitroda's remarks that South Indians look like Africans. \"The prince's philosopher looks down on people with dark complexion. How can one judge people's abilities based on their skin colour,\" he said in his speech in Warangal.\n\nCongress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra during a roadshow for Lok Sabha elections, in Rae Bareli, Wednesday | Photo Credit: - SHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 8, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "@businessline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adani_Group", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adani Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhirubhai_Ambani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dhirubhai Ambani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Black market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priyanka_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Priyanka Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adani_Enterprises", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adani Enterprises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Pitroda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Pitroda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautam_Adani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gautam Adani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mukesh_Ambani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mukesh Ambani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mahatma Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warangal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warangal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warangal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/oy2m40/article68154349.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/20240508122L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548578", "eventUri": "eng-9548578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Is it your personal experience?\" Gandhi said.\n\n\"Do one thing - send the CBI, ED to them and carry out a thorough investigation and don't be scared,\" he said.\n\n\"The country knows who is the driver and helper of the BJP's tempo of corruption,\" he said in a post in Hindi on X.\n\nThe Congress also launched a fierce counterattack against Modi with party leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra charging that the BJP has a nexus with industrialists and the entire BJP machinery is engaged in spreading \"lies\" about Rahul Gandhi.\n\nCongress president Mallikarjun Kharge claimed that Modi's chair is \"shaking\" after three phases of the Lok Sabha polls as he has started attacking his own \"friends\" and this shows the \"real trend\" of the result.\n\n\"The times are changing. Dost dost na raha...! (Friends are no longer friends...!) After the completion of three phases of elections, today the Prime Minister has started attacking his own friends. It is becoming clear that Modiji's chair is shaking. This is the real trend of the results,\" Kharge said in a post in Hindi on X.\n\nCongress general secretary Jairam Ramesh claimed that the tide of this election has turned so \"violently\" that the \"Pappa\" of \"Hum Do Hamare Do\" is turning on his own children.\n\n\"Defeat is a foregone conclusion. The Prime Minister is now spooked even by his own shadow,\" he said in a post on X and shared a picture of Modi along with his shadow.\n\nThe Congress leader said: \"The man who collected Rs 8,200 crore of Electoral Bonds for his party - a scam so egregious that even the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional - is today levelling allegations on others.\" \"Remember that through his 'Chaar Raaste', the Prime Minister has given contracts and licenses worth Rs 4 lakh crore to his cronies in return for their donations. If today, 21 Indian billionaires have as much wealth as 70 crore Indians, it is all thanks to the PM's intentions and policies. It also goes without saying that 'Hamare Do' are key figures in those 21,\" Ramesh alleged.\n\nHe said that since January 28, 2023, the Congress party has repeatedly demanded the formation of a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to investigate the \"Modani scam\".\n\n\"We reiterated this demand even after the elections began - on April 23, 2024, and just five days ago, on May 3, 2024. Since April 3, 2024, Rahul Gandhi has mentioned Adani 103 times and Ambani more than 30 times in his speeches. \"A JPC will be formed as soon as the India bloc comes to power on June 4, 2024, to investigate the Modani Scam - which has an estimated price tag of at least Rs. 2 lakh crores,\" the Congress leader said.\n\nPriyanka Gandhi Vadra also said the Prime Minister knows that people now understand the reality that he has handed over all wealth to big businessmen and he is clarifying after getting nervous.\n\n\"Today he (Modi) is saying Rahul does not take the name of Adani, Ambani....He does so every day. He brings their truth in front of you every day. We say every day that they (BJP) have a nexus with industrialists. You must understand that Prime Minister Modi has waived loans worth Rs 16 lakh crore given to big billionaires. Whose money is this? This is not Modi ji's money. That is the country's money,\" she said at public meetings in Rae Bareli.\n\nAnother party leader Pawan Khera said PM Modi is disturbed after three phases of elections and realises that the ground is shaking. He claimed the Prime Minister has collected Rs 8,200 crore from his \"friends\" and when he was losing the polls, he has turned against them.\n\n\"When you cannot be theirs, how can you be ours or anyone else's in the country,\" he posed, adding that the Congress does not fear anyone or anything.\n\nCongress leader Supriya Shrinate said the Prime Minister is making serious allegations of corruption against the two big industrialists and asked when would a CBI, ED or Income Tax raid happen against them.

Gandhi's comments came after Modi alleged Congress received money from Adani and Ambani in exchange for stopping criticism. Congress leaders dismissed Modi's claims and accused him of avoiding accountability for alleged government favors to certain industrialists.\n\nCongress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday dared Prime Minister Narendra Modi to hold a probe by the CBI or ED into whether businessmen Adani and Ambani sent black money to his party and taunted if Modi was speaking from his ''personal experience'' that they send their ''money in a tempo''.

He is saying that his two friends Adani and Ambani have tempo full of black money.\n\n''Prime Minister, three questions arise from your sensational statement. The first is that you came on TV to announce the note ban on November 8, 2016. Today eight years later, you are saying these two businessmen have bags full of black money.\n\n''Secondly, if these two people have so much black money, why has ED, CBI action not been taken against them, even after you have put two chief ministers in jail for corruption? Is the ED, CBI sleeping like 'Kumbhakaran','' he asked.\n\nRamesh said that in the last 10 years there has been ''privatisation and everything has been sold out to them''.\n\n''Where is the black money coming from? You should answer.'' ''The real thing is that you are bewildered and are troubled and you know that you are not getting a clear majority on June 4 and that is why you are raising all kinds of things,'' the Congress leader alleged.\n\nCongress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also said, ''In the third phase itself, the people of the country have slowed down the tempo of Modi ji, hence he is missing the tempo of his friends.'' ''Modiji, please answer, the country wants to know,'' she said in a post on X.\n\nPrime Minister Modi on Wednesday accused the Congress of having a ''deal'' with Ambani and Adani, and asked if the party has received ''tempo loads of black money'' from the two businessmen for its leader Rahul Gandhi to stop ''abusing'' them.\n\n''Since his Rafale issue got grounded, he started chanting about 'five industrialists'.

At a rally in Telanganas Karimnagar, he questioned why Gandhi had stopped abusing Ambani-Adani ever since the Lok Sabha elections were announced, and also asked how many bags of black money the leader the opposition had received.\n\nYou must have seen that the Congress shehzada [prince]over the past five years, five businessmen, five businessmen had chanted. Since his Rafale deal was stalled, he has raised a new chant, PM Modi said, referring to the poll controversy five years ago over the delivery of Rafale fighter jets from France.\n\nThen he started saying Ambani-Adani, Ambani-Adani. But since the elections were announced, he has stopped abusing Ambani-Adani. I want to ask the land of Telangana today: how much shehzada took from Ambani-Adani in this election? How many bags of black money does he have? Has a tempo full of notes reached Congress? What deal was made that made you stop abusing Ambani-Adani overnight? For five years you abused Ambani-Adani, and [now you] stopped overnight. It means you have something. You will have to answer this to the people of the country, he said without naming Gandhi.\n\nAttacking the Congress party for corruption, PM Modi also said: The only glue that binds the Congress and BRS [Bharat Rashtra Samithi] together, it's corruption. The policy of appeasement is their program. Congress and BRS follow the zero governance model. Therefore, we must save Telangana from the corrupt clutches of these parties.\n\nReacting to the mockery, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi challenged PM Modi to conduct a probe by the CBI or ED to find out if businessmen Adani and Ambani had sent money to his party at a steady pace.\n\nThe money that Prime Minister Modi gave to the two businessmen, the Congress party will give the same amount to the people of India through the various programs promised by the party, Gandhi said.\n\nThe country knows who is the driving force and helper of the BJP's pace of corruption, he said in a Hindi article on X.\n\nModi ji, are you a little scared? Normally you talk about Adani and Ambani behind closed doors, but for the first time you talk about Adani and Ambani in public, Gandhi said in the video message.\n\nYou also know that they give money at a certain rate. Is this your personal experience? said Gandhi.\n\nDo one thing, send them CBI, ED and do a thorough investigation and don't be afraid, he added.\n\nCongress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also responded to Prime Minister Modis Adani-Ambani's hold on Rahul Gandhi and accused the BJP of having a nexus with industrialists and waived their loans worth Rs 16 lakh crore.\n\nShe also alleged that the entire BJP machinery was busy spreading lies about Rahul Gandhi.\n\nReferring to the Prime Minister's remarks at a rally in Telangana that the Congress should explain to people why it stopped raising the Ambani-Adani issue like its Shehzada was doing for the last five years, Priyanka Gandhi said: Today he (Modi) is saying that Rahul is not taking Adani's name, Ambani. He does it every day. He presents their truth before you every day.\n\nWe say every day that they (BJP) have a nexus with industrialists. You must understand that Prime Minister Modi has given away Rs 16 lakh crore from big billionaires. Whose money is this? This is not Modi Ji's money.

Gandhi on Wednesday mocked Modi's comments and asked him to order a federal investigation against the firms.\n\nThis is the first time in this general elections campaign that the PM has publicly named Ambani and Adani, a reference to Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, two of India's richest industrialists who run vast conglomerates spanning several sectors.\n\n\"Since his Rafale issue got grounded, he started chanting about 'five industrialists'. Then he started saying Ambani-Adani. But ever since elections have been announced, these people (Congress) have stopped abusing Ambani-Adani. I want to ask from Telangana soil, let the shehzada announce, how much has been lifted from Ambani-Adani? Has tempo loads of money reached the Congress?\" Modi said, referring to Gandhi as prince.\n\n\"What deal has been arrived at, that abusing Ambani-Adani has stopped overnight? Certainly something is fishy.\"\n\nOver the last few years, Gandhi has repeatedly accused the BJP of crony capitalism and said that it was providing undue benefits to some industrialists -- charges the ruling party has denied. But on Wednesday, Modi sought to flip the narrative.\n\n\"For five years, (they) abused Adani-Ambani and it stopped overnight. It means you have received some tempo loads of 'chori ka maal' (loot)...Kaale dhan ki kitni boriya bharkar ke rupaye maare hai (how many sacks of black money you have taken) You have to answer the nation,\" he said at Vemulawada in the Karimnagar parliamentary constituency in Telangana .\n\nRepresentatives of the two conglomerates didn't immediately respond to requests for a comment.\n\nHours later, Gandhi dared Modi to initiate investigations by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate against \"Ambani and Adani\" and questioned if Modi was scared.\n\nIn a video released by the Congress, Gandhi, sitting in front of a portrait of Mahatma Gandhi, said, \"Usually you talk about Ambani and Adani behind the doors. Today, for the first time you mentioned Ambani and Adani publicly. What happened? Are you scared? Do one thing. You initiate a CBI and ED enquiry against them as soon as possible.\"\n\nHe added: \"The country knows who is the driver and helper of the BJP's tempo of corruption.\"\n\nThe Congress also launched a fierce counter-attack with party leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra charging that the BJP ahd a nexus with industrialists and the entire BJP machinery was engaged in spreading \"lies\" about Rahul Gandhi.\n\nCongress president Mallikarjun Kharge said that Modi's chair was \"shaking\" after three phases of the Lok Sabha polls as he started attacking his own \"friends\".\n\n\"The times are changing. Dost dost na raha...! (Friends are no longer friends...!) After the completion of three phases of elections, today the Prime Minister has started attacking his own friends. It is becoming clear that Modiji's chair is shaking. This is the real trend of the results,\" Kharge said in a post in Hindi on X.\n\nThe Congress's allegations of crony capitalism against the BJP are old, but peaked last year after American short-seller Hindenberg Research alleged 'brazen accounting fraud' and 'stock manipulation' by the Gautam Adani-led group in a report. Adani Enterprises rejected the report as \"unresearched\" and \"maliciously mischievous\".\n\nThe report triggered a massive row, with the Opposition targeting the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party over alleged links between Modi, and his government, and Adani Group. It also triggered a massive, but temporary, rout of Adani stocks and market value.\n\nSeveral Opposition parties then disrupted the budget session of Parliament with a demand for a joint parliamentary probe, and held several protests in Delhi. At the time, the government distanced itself from the allegations and dismissed the Opposition's demand, saying that the Congress was attempting to derail parliamentary proceedings. The row even reached the Supreme Court, which in January upheld a probe by the Securities and Exchange Board of India.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan

He warned against a \"double RR game,\" accusing one 'R' of plundering Telangana and passing on the spoils to another 'R' in Delhi.\n\n\"Telangana mein ek R loot ta hai aur Delhi mein dusre R ko deta hai. (One R loots the public in Telangana and gives the collections to another R in Delhi). This double 'RR' game could potentially destroy Telangana,\" PM Modi added.\n\nPM Modi also lambasted the Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS), the former ruling party in Telangana, accusing them and Congress of prioritizing 'family first' over national interests.\n\n\"These (dynastic) parties run on the principle of 'by the family, for the family, of the family'. The only 'glue' that binds Congress and BRS together is corruption. Appeasement politics is in their DNA. It is their only agenda. The Congress and the BRS follow the 'zero governance model'. There is a desperate need to save Telangana from the corrupt clutches of such parties,\" he asserted.\n\nFurthermore, PM Modi reiterated his stance on reservation policies, alleging a conspiracy by the Congress against SCs, STs, and OBCs.\n\n\"The Constitution, as was envisioned and drafted by Babasaheb Ambedkar, is against the idea of reservation on the basis of religion. They want to steal from your quota, as guaranteed by the Constitution, and give it to their vote bank,\" PM Modi asserted.\n\nPM Modi also referenced expelled leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam's accusation against Rahul Gandhi and the Congress, claiming they aim to obstruct the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.\n\n\"This disclosure was made by none other than a former confidante of the Congress' royal family. He said the Congress conspired to stop the temple construction and overturn the Supreme Court decision (settling the age-old title dispute in favour of the Hindus),\" PM Modi concluded.\n\n(With inputs from PTI)", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karimnagar", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karimnagar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karimnagar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Rashtra_Samithi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharat Rashtra Samithi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revanth_Reddy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revanth Reddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hindus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reservation in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._R._Ambedkar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "B.

It means you have received some tempo loads of 'chori ka maal' [loot]...Kaale dhan ki kitni boriya bharkar ke rupaye maare hai [how many sacks of black money you have taken] You have to answer the nation,\" the Prime Minister added.\n\nTaking to X (formerly Twitter), Mr. Gandhi released a 46-second video in which he asked whether Mr. Modi was speaking from his \"personal experience\" about money being sent by businessmen.\n\nPriyanka campaigns for Rahul in Rae Bareli, slams PM for Adani-Ambani jibe\n\n\"Modi ji, are you little scared? Normally you talk about Adani and Ambani in closed doors, but for the first time you have talked about Adani and Ambani in public. You also know that they give money in a tempo.

Friends are no longer friends...! After completion of three phases of elections, today the Prime Minister has started attacking his own friends. It is becoming clear that Modi ji's chair is shaking. This is the real trend of the results,\" Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge said in a post on X.\n\nCongress general secretary (communication) Jairam Ramesh, in a post on X, said after April 3, Mr. Gandhi had mentioned \"Adani 103 times and Ambani more than 30 times in his speeches\".\n\n\"The tide of this election has turned so violently that the \"Pappa\" of \"Hum Do Hamare Do\" is turning on his own children. The man who collected \u20b98,200 crore of Electoral Bonds for his party -- a scam so egregious that even the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional -- is today levelling allegations on others,\" Mr. Ramesh said.\n\n\"Defeat is a foregone conclusion. The Prime Minister is now spooked even by his own shadow,\" he added.\n\nCongress general secretary Priyanka Vadra claimed that the Prime Minister knew that people now understand the reality that he had handed over all wealth to big businessmen and his government waived loans worth \u20b916 lakh crore given to big billionaires in the past 10 years.\n\n\"Today he [Mr. Modi] is saying Rahul does not take the name of Adani, Ambani....He does so every day. He brings their truth in front of you every day. We say every day that they [the BJP] have a nexus with industrialists. You must understand that Prime Minister Modi has waived loans worth \u20b916 lakh crore given to big billionaires. Whose money is this? This is not Modi ji's money. That is the country's money,\" she said at public meetings in Rae Bareli.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adani_Group", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adani Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempo", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tempo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mahatma Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Black market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priyanka_Chopra", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Priyanka Chopra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hum_Do_Hamare_Do", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hum Do Hamare Do"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallikarjun_Kharge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mallikarjun Kharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priyanka_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Priyanka Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jairam_Ramesh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jairam Ramesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/qodvgg/article68155032.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/20240507575L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548578", "eventUri": "eng-9548578", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 32, "textEnd": 37}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-03", "textStart": 3240, "textEnd": 3247}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

It also goes without saying that 'Hamare Do' are key figures in those 21,\" Ramesh alleged.\n\nHe said that since January 28, 2023, the Congress party has repeatedly demanded the formation of a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to investigate the \"Modani scam\".\n\n\"We reiterated this demand even after the elections began - on April 23, 2024, and just five days ago, on May 3, 2024. Since April 3, 2024, Rahul Gandhi has mentioned Adani 103 times and Ambani more than 30 times in his speeches. \"A JPC will be formed as soon as the India bloc comes to power on June 4, 2024, to investigate the Modani Scam - which has an estimated price tag of at least Rs. 2 lakh crores,\" the Congress leader said.\n\nPriyanka Gandhi Vadra also said the Prime Minister knows that people now understand the reality that he has handed over all wealth to big businessmen and he is clarifying after getting nervous.\n\n\"Today he (Modi) is saying Rahul does not take the name of Adani, Ambani....He does so every day. He brings their truth in front of you every day. We say every day that they (BJP) have a nexus with industrialists. You must understand that Prime Minister Modi has waived loans worth Rs 16 lakh crore given to big billionaires. Whose money is this? This is not Modi ji's money. That is the country's money,\" she said at public meetings in Rae Bareli.\n\nAnother party leader Pawan Khera said PM Modi is disturbed after three phases of elections and realises that the ground is shaking. He claimed the Prime Minister has collected Rs 8,200 crore from his \"friends\" and when he was losing the polls, he has turned against them.\n\n\"When you cannot be theirs, how can you be ours or anyone else's in the country,\" he posed, adding that the Congress does not fear anyone or anything.\n\nCongress leader Supriya Shrinate said the Prime Minister is making serious allegations of corruption against the two big industrialists and asked when would a CBI, ED or Income Tax raid happen against them.

Overnight, you have stopped abusing Adani and Ambani. There is definitely something fishy,\" the PM said at an election rally in Telangana.Gandhi has consistently questioned Modi's links with the tycoons and criticised policies he says have favoured wealthy businessmen over the poor, resulting in widening inequality levels in the country.Though Modi accused him of being \"silent\" on the industrialist duo in this election season, Gandhi has actually been repeating the charge this time, too, particularly against Adani. At a campaign rally in Jharkhand\n\non Tuesday, Gandhi spoke about the need for greater representation for tribals and said, \"The BJP says you are vanvasi and they give all the forest land to Adani.\"Modi's allegations, however, came as a surprise as he rarely mentions the names of any industrialist in his campaign speeches. On Wednesday, however, the gloves came off.\n\n\"Have 'tempo loads of notes (money)' reached the Congress that it has stopped targeting Ambani-Adani?\" Modi asked, adding \"let the Congress Shehzada announce, how much has been lifted from Ambani-Adani\".Gandhi was swift to hit back. In a video message, he said the Enforcement Directorate (ED) or the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) should probe if Adani and Ambani sent money in tempo, and wondered whether the PM was talking about his own personal experience. \"I assure the nation once more - the money Narendra Modi has given to them, we will give to the poor...They made 22 arabpatis, we will make crores of lakhpatis,\" he said.\n\nReacting to the statements, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said: \"Times are changing.

He brings their truth in front of you every day. We say every day that they (BJP) have a nexus with industrialists. You must understand that Prime Minister Modi has waived loans worth Rs 16 lakh crore given to big billionaires. Whose money is this? This is not Modi ji's money. That is the country's money,\" she said at public meetings in Rae Bareli.\n\nAnother party leader Pawan Khera said PM Modi is disturbed after three phases of elections and realises that the ground is shaking. He claimed the Prime Minister has collected Rs 8,200 crore from his \"friends\" and when he was losing the polls, he has turned against them.\n\n\"When you cannot be theirs, how can you be ours or anyone else's in the country,\" he posed, adding that the Congress does not fear anyone or anything.\n\nCongress leader Supriya Shrinate said the Prime Minister is making serious allegations of corruption against the two big industrialists and asked when would a CBI, ED or Income Tax raid happen against them.

Following the conclusion of the third phase of polling on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a fresh offensive against the Congress and Rahul Gandhi. This time, he wielded a familiar weapon often used by the Gandhi scion -- Adani & Ambani -- and appeared to reverse the narrative on the Rae Bareli LS candidate.\n\nAlleging that the Congress was stockpiling black money from the Adanis and the Ambanis to shield these top industrialists from any criticism, PM Modi introduced a new angle to the political discourse. This marks the first instance of PM Modi invoking the Ambanis and Adanis to target the Congress. Thus far, the Congress has been directing its attacks towards the PM and the BJP, accusing them of favouring industrialists, alleging loan waivers worth crores for them while burdening farmers with smaller loans.\n\n\"You must have seen Shehzada' of Congress, since his issue of Rafale grounded, he started talking about '5 industrialists' all the time in the last five years...later he started saying 'Ambani-Adani', but after the elections were announced, he stopped abusing 'Ambani-Adani',\" PM Modi said during an election rally in Telangana's Karimnagar on Wednesday.\n\nHe further stated, \"The Shehzaada must declare how much maal [money] he got from Ambani and Adani for the elections. How many bags of black money did he get from them? What deal did you crack with Ambani and Adani that you stopped abusing them overnight after attacking them for over 5 years? Definitely something is wrong (daal main kuch kaala hai). For 5 years, you abused Ambani-Adani and overnight abusive language was stopped.

It is no wonder that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, accused by the opposition of often working for the country's biggest industrialists, suddenly tried to turn the tables by declaring that the Congress had struck a deal with Adani-Ambani and that Rahul Gandhi had therefore stopped taking their name after having abused them for 10 years.\n\nThe Congress, apart from producing audio-visual evidence to expose the lie that Rahul Gandhi stopped nominating Adani-Ambani, unambiguously demolished the charge of any deal with them by stating that a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) would be formed after the regrouping of the opposition. INDIA comes to power in June 2024. Rahul Gandhi released a video message asking: Modi ji, are you shaken? You usually talk about Adani-Ambani behind closed doors. For the first time, you spoke about it publicly. You even know that they send money at the rate. Is this your personal experience? Why don't you send ED-CBI to find out? And I repeat once again, the amount of money you have given to a few selected industrialists, I will give to the poor through our social welfare programs.>\n\nThe Congress leadership saw in this ironic twist the nervousness of Modi, who felt the need to overturn the main accusation he was facing and gave credence by remaining silent all these years. Modi did not respond to any of the more than 100 questions posed by Congress on his ties to Adani, giving specific examples of abuse of power to award contracts and provide protection from investigative agencies.\n\nRahul Gandhi's obsessive focus on Adani for years had deepened public perception of the industrialists' association with the Prime Minister. What justified Rahul Gandhis tirade was the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ecosystem's passionate defense of Adani following the massive political outcry over the Hindenburg report. While in Parliament, the presidents erased references to Adani by Rahul Gandhi and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge, and the government blocked demands for a debate on the issue, apart from a campaign was launched to portray him as a patriotic businessman who contributed to the nation-building process. Anyone who raised legitimate questions about Adanis' operations was labeled anti-national by Modi's support system on social media.>\n\nModi, who chose not to publicly engage with Rahul on this issue all this time, suddenly said at a public rally in Telangana: Friends, you must have seen that the Congress prince started chanting while waking up in the morning for the last five years, ever since his Rafale was grounded, he has not started chanting. The five industrialists, the five industrialists have been chanting the same garland for five years. Then he started saying Ambani-Adani Ambani Adani. For five years but since the announcement of the elections, he has stopped mistreating Ambani-Adani. Today I want to ask the people of Telangana, this prince says, how much money does he collect from Ambani-Adani during elections? How many bags of black rice do you make? What time did the notes go through and did they reach Congress? What agreement took place? Why did you start abusing Ambani-Adani every night? Zaroor dal cooked in the kitchen. The Ambani-Adani have been abused for five years, and there will be abuse every night. This means that no one has found the food stolen in several ways. Responding will make the country proud..\n\nThis translates to, My friends, you may have seen that the Congress scion has stopped repeating for the last five years, ever since the Rafale affair was grounded, if not every morning he has continued to repeat it over the last five years. For five years he made another change, he kept saying the same thing, five industrialists, five industrialists. Then slowly he started saying Ambani-Adani, Ambani-Adani. But since the elections were declared, he has stopped mistreating Ambani-Adani. I want to ask the Congress scion right here from Telangana, how much money did he take from Ambani-Adani? How much black money did he take. Were the tempos filled with money delivered to the Congress party? What is the problem? Overnight you stopped abusing Ambani-Adani. There's something fishy, that's for sure. For five years, you have abused Ambani-Adani and he has stopped governing. This means for sure that from the stolen money, you must have received it loaded in tempos. You will have to answer to the nation.>\n\nModi, as usual, got his facts wrong. Even on Monday and Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi spoke about Adani while explaining how the country's assets were transferred to a select few. The Congress has released videos proving that Rahul Gandhi took the name Adani on May 2 in Karnataka, May 3 in Maharashtra, May 5 in Telangana, May 6 in Madhya Pradesh and May 7 in Jharkhand. The message posted with these videos was: The question we keep asking ourselves is: what is Modi's relationship with Adani? (We'll keep asking questions. What is Adani's relationship with Modi?) >\n\nThe May 2 video showed Rahul Gandhi saying: \"You have to decide whether you want to form a Modi-Adani government or a government of farmers, the poor people. In the May 3 video, he said: He put the wealth of Hindustan in the pockets of 22 people. Adani, Ambani in logon ke jeb mein (He took the wealth of India and lined the pockets of only 22 individuals. Adani, Ambani, the pockets of these people).>\n\nOn May 5, he said, \"We gave MGNREGA, the media said we were making the poor lazy. When we waive agricultural loans, they say farmers are spoiled. Adani gets lakhs and crores, isn't that big data?. In the May 6 video, Rahul Gandhi is heard saying: All the imports, the ports, the infrastructure, the defense industry, everything he gave to one person..\n\nSimilarly, in the May 7 video, he is seen saying: People like Adani have set their sights on your Water, Jungle, Earthand they are Modi's special friends. If Rahul Gandhi spoke about Adani regularly, even on May 6 and 7, what did Modi say on May 8 that he stopped naming them after the deal?>\n\nCongress communications chief Jairam Ramesh responded promptly saying, \"The tide of this election has turned so violently that Hum Do Hamare Do's father is turning against his own children. The man who collected Rs 8,200 crore in electoral bonds for his party, a scam so blatant that even the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional, is now leveling allegations against others.\n\n>\n\n>\n\nRecall that through his Chaar Raaste, the Prime Minister granted contracts and licenses worth Rs 4 lakh crore to his acolytes in return for their donations. If today 21 Indian billionaires own as much wealth as 70 million Indians, it is thanks to the intentions of the Prime Minister and his policies. It also goes without saying that Hamare Do is a key figure among these 21. Since January 28, 2023, Congress has repeatedly called for the formation of a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to investigate the Modani scam. We have reiterated this demand even after the elections began on April 23, 2024, and only five days ago on May 3, 2024. Since April 3, 2024, Rahul Gandhi has mentioned Adani 103 times and Ambani more than 30 times in his speeches. A JPC will be formed as soon as the Indian alliance comes to power on June 4, 2024, to probe the Modani scam estimated to be worth at least Rs 2 lakh crore. Defeat is inevitable. The Prime Minister is now afraid, even of his own shadow.\n\nToday, May 8, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge also took a dig at Modi, posting on X: Time is changing. Dost dost na raha After the completion of the three phases of voting, the Prime Minister started attacking his friends. This shows that the Modis chair is shaking. This is the real pattern of results.>\n\nPriyanka Gandhi also told Raebareli on Wednesday that Modi had written off Rs 16 lakh crore for 22 industrialists. He handed over all national assets to his friends, airports, ports, PSU. Today, he said that Rahul will not take the Adani-Ambani name. Wonderful! Every day, Rahul exposes the connection by taking their name. He tells the truth every day and tells you how Modi is aligned with billionaires.>\n\nModis Adani-Ambani hit out at political observers as well as politicians as, according to them, it almost seemed like an admission that they had earned a lot of unaccounted money under his regime, which can be provided to the parties bit by bit policies. He specifically referenced the dark money that was being sent to Congress in bags as part of the deal. Modi took office in 2014 with a promise to eliminate black money, and as his second term ends in 2024, he claims that industrialists, considered friendly with him, are hiding black money. This itself generated its own set of unflattering optics that added nothing to Modi's decade-long record.>", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors":

Adani and Ambani give away black money in bags. Finally, Rahul Gandhi forced PM Modi to expose the corruption,\" the Congress party wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"Modiji, please tell me when will the ED, CBI, and Income Tax raid these two?\" the Chairperson of Congress party's social media, Supriya Shrinate questioned PM Modi's remarks against two Industrialists.\n\nThe Congress hit back, proclaiming that PM Modi's remarks were an unintentional admission of corruption. They asserted that Rahul Gandhi's consistent focus on the Adani-Ambani issue had finally compelled the Prime Minister to address the elephant in the room.\n\nPriyanka Gandhi Vadra, Congress General Secretary, echoed this sentiment, emphasising that Rahul Gandhi has been vocal about the alleged nexus between PM Modi and big industrialists. She highlighted the stark contrast between the government's willingness to waive off massive debts for corporations while neglecting the plight of farmers.\n\n\"Today Narendra Modi said- Rahul Gandhi is not taking Adani's name.

Narendra Modi should answer this,\" she added.\n\nResponding to PM Modi's Jibe, Pawan Khera in a video message said that since April 3, Rahul Gandhi has mentioned the name of Adani 103 times and Ambani 30 times in his speeches.\n\nWith Rahul Gandhi continuing to target Adani and Ambani, and the Congress party framing it as a fight against corruption, PM Modi made these comments during an election rally in Telangana's Waranga.\n\nThe spark for this latest exchange was started by PM Modi's jibe at Rahul Gandhi during an election rally in Telangana, where he questioned why the Congress leader had suddenly stopped mentioning Ambani and Adani in his speeches. He went on to accuse Gandhi and the Congress party of receiving black money from these industrialists.\n\n\"For years, Congress ke shehzade din raat ek mala japte the...'5 industrialists', 'Ambani', 'Adani'...But since the elections are declared, they have stopped abusing Ambani, Adani...,\" he said.\n\n\"Why?

She challenged Modi to explain why no loans were waived for farmers despite significant favors extended to industrialists.\n\n\"Today Narendra Modi said- Rahul Gandhi is not taking Adani's name.

Modi questioned the source of funding for Congress' election campaigns, alleging a suspicious silence from the party on the matter.\n\n\"Since the election dates were declared, they (Rahul and other Congress leaders) have even stopped abusing Ambani, Adani. Why? I wish to ask the Shehzada of the Congress: how much black money have they received from Adani, Ambani? How much (funding) did the Congress receive from them for the (ongoing) elections? I smell something fishy here. The Congress should come out and clarify to the people,\" PM Modi had said.\n\nIn a separate rally in Telangana, PM Modi launched a scathing attack on both Rahul Gandhi and Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy, accusing them of exploiting the public for personal gain. Modi highlighted the alleged 'double R' tax scheme, alleging corruption within the Telangana government.\n\n\"Telangana mein ek R loot ta hai aur Delhi mein dusre R ko deta hai. (One R loots the public in Telangana and gives the collections to another R in Delhi). This double 'RR' game could potentially destroy Telangana,\" PM Modi added.\n\nALSO READ: 'Won't Tolerate Disrespect': PM Modi Targets Rahul Gandhi After Sam Pitroda's Racial Slur Sparks Row\n\nFurther, PM Modi criticised the Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS), the previous ruling party in Telangana, accusing them of prioritising family interests over national welfare.

But when the Rafale issue faded, he switched to targeting five industrialists, especially Ambani and Adani.However, once the elections were announced, he stopped attacking them. Today, I ask from Telangana: How much money did they take from Ambani and Adani? What changed overnight? Zaroor daal mein kuch kaala hai.

People are smelling a secret deal,\" said PM Modi.\n\nThe Prime Minister's offensive assumes significance as the Congress has accused the PM Modi-Centre of favouring prominent businessmen.\n\nMeanwhile, the Congress leader also fired back at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's criticism regarding the \"silence\" surrounding Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, asking the Centre to send the CBI and ED to investigate the matter at the homes of the two business tycoons.\n\nTaking a jibe at PM Modi, Wayanad MP, Rahul Gandhi asked if it is his \"personal experience\" of receiving money in a 'tempo'.\n\n\"Namaskar, Modi ji! Did you get scared? Usually, you talk about Ambani ji, and Adani ji only behind closed doors. The first time, you said Ambani-Adani in public. And you even know they give money in a tempo. Is it your personal experience? Do one thing, send CBI-ED to their residence and conduct an enquiry. Don't be scared,\" Rahul Gandhi said in a video message on Wednesday.\n\nIn another attack on Rahul Gandhi and his Congress colleague and Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said one 'R' is looting Telangana and passing on the loot to another 'R' in Delhi.\n\nAlso coming down heavily on the Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS), the previous ruling party in the state, PM Modi said while the BJP pursues a 'nation first' policy, the Congress and the BRS work to advance the principle of 'family first'.\n\nPM Modi said that these (dynastic) parties run on the principle of 'by the family, for the family, of the family'.\n\nHe said that the only 'glue' that binds Congress and BRS together is corruption and appeasement politics is in their DNA.\n\n\"It is their only agenda. The Congress and the BRS follow the 'zero governance model'. There is a desperate need to save Telangana from the corrupt clutches of such parties,\" he added.\n\nThe Prime Minister also reacted to Congress leader Sam Pitroda's \"racist remarks\" that stoked a massive row and said that the people of the country will not tolerate insults based on the colour of their skin.\n\nAddressing a rally in Warangal, PM Modi demanded an answer from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, saying 'Shehzade aapko jawaab dena padega'. My country will not tolerate the disrespect of my countrymen based on their skin colour and Modi will never tolerate this.\"\n\nPM Modi said, \"I was thinking a lot that (President) Droupadi Murmu who has a good reputation and is the daughter of an Adivasi family, then why is Congress trying so hard to defeat her but today I got to know the reason. I got to know that there is an uncle in America who is the philosophical guide of 'Shehzada' and just like the third umpire in cricket this 'Shehzada' takes advice from the third umpire.\"\n\nThis comes after former Chairman of Indian Overseas Congress Sam Pitroda ignited a firestorm while speaking on the diversity of India referring to how people in the South \"look like Africans and those in the East look like Arabs and those in the East look like Chinese.\"\n\nCongress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh posted on X to say that the analogies drawn by Pitroda in a podcast to illustrate India's diversity are \"most unfortunate and unacceptable.\"\n\n\"The Indian National Congress completely dissociates itself from these analogies,\" he said.\n\nWhile addressing a public meeting in Andhra Pradesh's Rajampet, Prime Minister Modi launched a blistering attack on the Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy-led Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) on Wednesday.\n\nThe Prime Minister accused the YSRCP government of \"betraying\" the people over development and running a 'Gunda Raaj' in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nHe said that the YSRCP prioritised the development of the mafia over the underprivileged people of the state.\n\n\"YSRCP ke mantri kaise yaha 'Gundgardi' karte hai, yaha 'Rowdy Raaj' chalate hai vo sabke samne hai,\" said the Prime Minister.\n\nPM Modi further said that the YSRCP government in the state is nearing an end and that the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance will treat the mafias in the state permanently.\n\nReiterating his party's slogan of \"double engine ki sarkar (double-engine government)\", PM Modi said that the development works that had been long pending here under the governance of the YSRCP would be fulfilled by the Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Modi held a roadshow in Andhra Pradesh's Vijaywada on Wednesday, along with Telugu Desam Party chief N Chandrababu Naidu and Jana Sena Party chief Pawan Kalyan.\n\nPM Modi was seated on a specially designed vehicle along with the two leaders.\n\nHe was seen waving to the people who had gathered in huge numbers. The flags of BJP along with that of TDP and Jana Sena party were being carried out in the roadshow.\n\nNotably, the Bharatiya Janata Party is in alliance with TDP and the Jana Sena Party in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nElections for the 175-member Assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the state are scheduled for May 13 and the counting of votes will be held on June 4.\n\nAs part of a seat-sharing deal among NDA partners, the TDP was allocated 144 Assembly and 17 Lok Sabha constituencies, while the BJP will contest from six Lok Sabha and 10 Assembly seats. Janasena will contest two Lok Sabha and 21 Assembly seats.

Don't be scared,\" Rahul Gandhi said in a video message on Wednesday.\n\nIn another attack on Rahul Gandhi and his Congress colleague and Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said one 'R' is looting Telangana and passing on the loot to another 'R' in Delhi.\n\nAlso coming down heavily on the Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS), the previous ruling party in the state, PM Modi said while the BJP pursues a 'nation first' policy, the Congress and the BRS work to advance the principle of 'family first'.\n\nPM Modi said that these (dynastic) parties run on the principle of 'by the family, for the family, of the family'.\n\nHe said that the only 'glue' that binds Congress and BRS together is corruption and appeasement politics is in their DNA.\n\n\"It is their only agenda. The Congress and the BRS follow the 'zero governance model'. There is a desperate need to save Telangana from the corrupt clutches of such parties,\" he added.\n\nThe Prime Minister also reacted to Congress leader Sam Pitroda's \"racist remarks\" that stoked a massive row and said that the people of the country will not tolerate insults based on the colour of their skin.\n\nAddressing a rally in Warangal, PM Modi demanded an answer from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, saying 'Shehzade aapko jawaab dena padega'. My country will not tolerate the disrespect of my countrymen based on their skin colour and Modi will never tolerate this.\"\n\nPM Modi said, \"I was thinking a lot that (President) Droupadi Murmu who has a good reputation and is the daughter of an Adivasi family, then why is Congress trying so hard to defeat her but today I got to know the reason. I got to know that there is an uncle in America who is the philosophical guide of 'Shehzada' and just like the third umpire in cricket this 'Shehzada' takes advice from the third umpire.\"\n\nThis comes after former Chairman of Indian Overseas Congress Sam Pitroda ignited a firestorm while speaking on the diversity of India referring to how people in the South \"look like Africans and those in the East look like Arabs and those in the East look like Chinese.\"\n\nCongress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh posted on X to say that the analogies drawn by Pitroda in a podcast to illustrate India's diversity are \"most unfortunate and unacceptable.\"\n\n\"The Indian National Congress completely dissociates itself from these analogies,\" he said.\n\nWhile addressing a public meeting in Andhra Pradesh's Rajampet, Prime Minister Modi launched a blistering attack on the Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy-led Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) on Wednesday.\n\nThe Prime Minister accused the YSRCP government of \"betraying\" the people over development and running a 'Gunda Raaj' in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nHe said that the YSRCP prioritised the development of the mafia over the underprivileged people of the state.\n\n\"YSRCP ke mantri kaise yaha 'Gundgardi' karte hai, yaha 'Rowdy Raaj' chalate hai vo sabke samne hai,\" said the Prime Minister.\n\nPM Modi further said that the YSRCP government in the state is nearing an end and that the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance will treat the mafias in the state permanently.\n\nReiterating his party's slogan of \"double engine ki sarkar (double-engine government)\", PM Modi said that the development works that had been long pending here under the governance of the YSRCP would be fulfilled by the Bharatiya Janata Party.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Modi held a roadshow in Andhra Pradesh's Vijaywada on Wednesday, along with Telugu Desam Party chief N Chandrababu Naidu and Jana Sena Party chief Pawan Kalyan.\n\nPM Modi was seated on a specially designed vehicle along with the two leaders.\n\nHe was seen waving to the people who had gathered in huge numbers. The flags of BJP along with that of TDP and Jana Sena party were being carried out in the roadshow.\n\nNotably, the Bharatiya Janata Party is in alliance with TDP and the Jana Sena Party in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nElections for the 175-member Assembly and 25 Lok Sabha seats in the state are scheduled for May 13 and the counting of votes will be held on June 4.\n\nAs part of a seat-sharing deal among NDA partners, the TDP was allocated 144 Assembly and 17 Lok Sabha constituencies, while the BJP will contest from six Lok Sabha and 10 Assembly seats. Janasena will contest two Lok Sabha and 21 Assembly seats.

The Congress and the BRS follow the 'zero governance model'. There is a desperate need to save Telangana from the corrupt clutches of such parties,\" he added.\n\nThe Prime Minister also reacted to Congress leader Sam Pitroda's \"racist remarks\" that stoked a massive row and said that the people of the country will not tolerate insults based on the colour of their skin.\n\nAddressing a rally in Warangal, PM Modi demanded an answer from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, saying 'Shehzade aapko jawaab dena padega'. My country will not tolerate the disrespect of my countrymen based on their skin colour and Modi will never tolerate this.\"\n\nPM Modi said, \"I was thinking a lot that (President) Droupadi Murmu who has a good reputation and is the daughter of an Adivasi family, then why is Congress trying so hard to defeat her but today I got to know the reason. I got to know that there is an uncle in America who is the philosophical guide of 'Shehzada' and just like the third umpire in cricket this 'Shehzada' takes advice from the third umpire.\"\n\nThis comes after former Chairman of Indian Overseas Congress Sam Pitroda ignited a firestorm while speaking on the diversity of India referring to how people in the South \"look like Africans and those in the East look like Arabs and those in the East look like Chinese.\"\n\nCongress spokesperson Jairam Ramesh posted on X to say that the analogies drawn by Pitroda in a podcast to illustrate India's diversity are \"most unfortunate and unacceptable.\"\n\n\"The Indian National Congress completely dissociates itself from these analogies,\" he said.\n\nWhile addressing a public meeting in Andhra Pradesh's Rajampet, Prime Minister Modi launched a blistering attack on the Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy-led Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) on Wednesday.\n\nThe Prime Minister accused the YSRCP government of \"betraying\" the people over development and running a 'Gunda Raaj' in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nHe said that the YSRCP prioritised the development of the mafia over the underprivileged people of the state.\n\n\"YSRCP ke mantri kaise yaha 'Gundgardi' karte hai, yaha 'Rowdy Raaj' chalate hai vo sabke samne hai,\" said the Prime Minister.\n\nPM Modi further said that the YSRCP government in the state is nearing an end and that the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance will treat the mafias in the state permanently.\n\nReiterating his party's slogan of \"double engine ki sarkar (double-engine government)\", PM Modi said that the development works that had been long pending here under the governance of the YSRCP would be fulfilled by the Bharatiya Janata Party.

If today, 21 Indian billionaires have as much wealth as 70 crore Indians, it is all thanks to the PM's intentions and policies.

I smell something wrong here. The Congress should come out and clarify to the people,\" PM Modi said. Further, in a blistering attack on Rahul Gandhi and his Congress colleague and Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said one 'R' is looting Telangana and passing on the loot to another 'R' in Delhi.\n\n\"From Telangana to Delhi, a lot is being spoken about the 'double R' (RR) tax. A (Telugu) film named 'RRR' was released recently and went on to become a blockbuster hit. However, someone told me that 'RR' has left 'RRR' far behind when it comes to collections. The lifetime (box office) collection of 'RRR' was reported to be over Rs 1000 cr, but the same amount of money was mopped up in just a few days through the 'RR' tax,\" he said. \"Telangana mein ek R loot ta hai aur Delhi mein dusre R ko deta hai. (One R loots the public in Telangana and gives the collections to another R in Delhi). This double 'RR' game could potentially destroy Telangana,\" PM Modi added.\n\nAlso coming down heavily on the Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS), the previous ruling party in the state, PM Modi said while the BJP pursues a 'nation first' policy, the Congress and the BRS work to advance the principle of 'family first'. \"These (dynastic) parties run on the principle of 'by the family, for the family, of the family'. The only 'glue' that binds Congress and BRS together is corruption. Appeasement politics is in their DNA. It is their only agenda. The Congress and the BRS follow the 'zero governance model'. There is a desperate need to save Telangana from the corrupt clutches of such parties,\" he added.\n\nReaffirming his earlier statement on reservation, PM Modi alleged that the Congress was conspiring against the SCs, STs, and OBCs. \"The Constitution, as was envisioned and drafted by Babasaheb Ambedkar, is against the idea of reservation on the basis of religion. They want to steal from your quota, as guaranteed by the Constitution, and give it to their vote bank,\" PM Modi said.\n\nInvoking expelled leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam's big claim against Rahul and the Congress, he said the grand old party wants to 'lock up' the Ram temple in Ayodhya. \"This disclosure was made by none other than a former confidante of the Congress' royal family. He said the Congress conspired to stop the temple construction and overturn the Supreme Court decision (settling the age-old title dispute in favour of the Hindus),\" PM Modi said.

However, as soon as the elections were announced, he has suddenly stopped abusing them, PM Modi said, asking how much money has he received from them.\n\nOn Wednesday (8th May), Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a scathing attack on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, charging him with 'corruption' and cutting a deal with top industrialists. He asserted that the Congress leader, who constantly abused industrialists and chanted 'Ambani-Adani', had gone silent against them after the elections were announced. Accusing the Congress leader of cutting a deal, PM Modi insisted, Shehzada ye ghoshit karein ki Ambani-Adani se kitna maal uthaya hai. (Shehzada of Congress should declare how much black money Congress has received from them.)\n\nPM Modi made these remarks while addressing an election rally in Karimnagar, Telangana. Referring to Rahul Gandhi as 'Shehzada', PM Modi said, \"You must have seen that Shehzada of Congress, for the past five years, had been chanting as soon as he woke up in the morning. Ever since his Rafale issue got grounded, he started a new chant. For five years, he was chanting - five businessmen, five businessmen. Then he started saying Ambani-Adani, Ambani-Adani. But ever since elections have been announced, he has stopped abusing Ambani-Adani.\"\n\nHe added, \"I want to ask from the land of Telangana today, how much has the Shehzada taken from Ambani-Adani this election? How many bags of black money has he got? Has a tempo filled with notes reached for the Congress? What deal has been made that you have stopped abusing Ambani-Adani overnight? For five years, you abused Ambani-Adani. And now you have stopped abusing them suddenly. That means you have got something. You will have to answer to the people of the country on this.\"\n\nPM Modi asserted that corruption and appeasement politics are the only glue that binds Congress and BRS together. Slamming opposition parties, PM Modi said, \"The only 'glue' that binds Congress and BRS together is corruption. Appeasement politics is what's their agenda. Congress and BRS follow the 'zero governance model'. Therefore, we need to save Telangana from the corrupt clutches of these parties.\"\n\nDuring his rally, PM Modi stated that the fuse of the Congress and I.N.D.I. alliance had blown off after the three-phase of voting concluded. Stating that the people are driving BJP's victory chariot, he asserted that this time, Congress will need a microscope to search for its seats.\n\nPM Modi said, \"Yesterday, the third phase of voting (for Lok Sabhal elections) took place in the country. In the third phase, the third fuse of the Congress and the I.N.D.I. alliance has blown up. Four phases of voting are still left, people's blessing is pushing the victory chariot of the BJP and NDA with great pace.\"\n\nHe further stated that two things have become clear after the third phase of elections, first- the public is taking NDA's 'Vijay Rath' forward at a fast pace. Second, Congress is searching their seats with magnifying glasses. After seeing your enthusiasm in Telangana, I can say one more thing: Congress's usual magnifying glass will not be sufficient to find seats in the fourth phase. Congress will have to use a microscope to find its seats, the Prime Minister added.\n\nMeanwhile, after his election rally in Karimnagar, PM Modi will address rallies in Warangal and Rajampet - and attend a roadshow in Vijayawada later in the day.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Black market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault_Rafale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dassault Rafale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_magnate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Business magnate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Rashtra_Samithi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharat Rashtra Samithi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeasement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Appeasement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karimnagar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karimnagar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karimnagar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajampet_Assembly_constituency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajampet Assembly constituency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijay_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vijay (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chariot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vijayawada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vijayawada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vijayawada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warangal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warangal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warangal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Associations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Psychological_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Psychological Abuse", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Conferences", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-2024-05-08T125528.602.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548578", "eventUri": "eng-9548578", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 315, "textEnd": 322}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Friends are no longer friends! After completion of three phases of elections, today the prime minister has started attacking his own friends. It is becoming clear that Modiji's chair is shaking.

The person who collected donations worth Rs 8,200 crore for his party - a scam so huge that even the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional - is today blaming others. Remember that through his \"four ways\", the Prime Minister gave contracts and licenses worth Rs 4 lakh crore to his party for its personal interests and greed for power.

We have repeated this demand even after the election campaign began - on April 23, 2024 and just five days ago, on May 3, 2024. Since April 3, 2024, Rahul Gandhi has mentioned Adani 103 times and Ambani more than 30 times in his speeches. The Modani scam is worth at least Rs 2 lakh crore. A JPC will definitely be formed after the India Alliance comes to power on June 4, 2024. Defeat has been predicted - the Prime Minister is now afraid of his own shadow,\" it said.\n\nCongress' reaction came after the prime minister during an election rally in Telangana said the Congress should explain to people why it has stopped raising the 'Ambani-Adani' issue as its 'Shehzada' used to do for the past five years and asked if it has struck a 'deal'.\n\n\"Ever since elections have been announced, these people (Congress) have stopped abusing Ambani-Adani. I want to ask from Telangana soil, let the Shehzada announce, how much has been lifted from Ambani-Adani. Has tempo loads of notes (currency) reached the Congress? What deal has been arrived at, that abusing Ambani-Adani has stopped overnight,\" he asked.\n\n\"Certainly something is fishy. For five years, (they) abused Adani-Ambani and it stopped overnight.

The Congress leader has also said that while the BJP government has made 22 Indians \"arabpati (billionaires)\", the Congress aims to make crores of people \"lakhpati\" if it comes to power in these elections.\n\nThe location of the Prime Minister's retort is also significant. Telangana, a Congress-ruled state, recently signed several MoUs with the Adani Group totalling an investment of Rs 12,400 crore across various sectors.\n\nThe BJP has flagged Mr Gandhi's repeated verbal attacks on wealth creators and top industrialists.

I smell something wrong here. The Congress should come out and clarify to the people,\" PM Modi said.\n\nFurther, in a blistering attack on Rahul Gandhi and his Congress colleague and Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said one 'R' is looting Telangana and passing on the loot to another 'R' in Delhi.\n\n\"From Telangana to Delhi, a lot is being spoken about the 'double R' (RR) tax. A (Telugu) film named 'RRR' was released recently and went on to become a blockbuster hit. However, someone told me that 'RR' has left 'RRR' far behind when it comes to collections. The lifetime (box office) collection of 'RRR' was reported to be over Rs 1000 cr, but the same amount of money was mopped up in just a few days through the 'RR' tax,\" he said.\n\n\"Telangana mein ek R loot ta hai aur Delhi mein dusre R ko deta hai. (One R loots the public in Telangana and gives the collections to another R in Delhi). This double 'RR' game could potentially destroy Telangana,\" PM Modi added.\n\nAlso coming down heavily on the Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS), the previous ruling party in the state, PM Modi said while the BJP pursues a 'nation first' policy, the Congress and the BRS work to advance the principle of 'family first'.\n\n\"These (dynastic) parties run on the principle of 'by the family, for the family, of the family'. The only 'glue' that binds Congress and BRS together is corruption. Appeasement politics is in their DNA. It is their only agenda. The Congress and the BRS follow the 'zero governance model'. There is a desperate need to save Telangana from the corrupt clutches of such parties,\" he added.\n\nReaffirming his earlier statement on reservation, PM Modi alleged that the Congress was conspiring against the SCs, STs, and OBCs.\n\n\"The Constitution, as was envisioned and drafted by Babasaheb Ambedkar, is against the idea of reservation on the basis of religion. They want to steal from your quota, as guaranteed by the Constitution, and give it to their vote bank,\" PM Modi said.\n\nInvoking expelled leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam's big claim against Rahul and the Congress, he said the grand old party wants to 'lock up' the Ram temple in Ayodhya.\n\n\"This disclosure was made by none other than a former confidante of the Congress' royal family. He said the Congress conspired to stop the temple construction and overturn the Supreme Court decision (settling the age-old title dispute in favour of the Hindus),\" PM Modi said.

In a pointed address on Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi directly challenged Rahul Gandhi to disclose any financial support received from these industrial giants, as well as clarify the nature of any agreements made with them during election seasons.\n\nWhile addressing a public gathering in Warangal, Telangana, Prime Minister Narendra Modi says \"No one can forget the sins of the Congress central government of 10 years ago. Every few days, a scam worth thousands of crores of rupees came to light. There were serial bomb blasts in big cities of the country...This time INDI alliance has come up with a formula of 5 years 5 PM. Just imagine, what will happen to the country if they get power. Every year there is a new PM, second year, second PM, third year, and third PM? What good can they do to the country...\"\n\nFurther training his guns at Rahul, PM Modi said for years, 'Shehzada' (scion) of the Congress used to speak of '5 industrialists' but now, he only brings up \"Ambani and Adani\".\n\n\"However, since the election dates were declared, they (Rahul and other Congress leaders) have even stopped abusing Ambani, Adani. Why? I wish to ask the Shehzadey of the Congress: how much black money have they received from Adani, Ambani? How much (funding) did the Congress receive from them for the (ongoing) elections? I smell something wrong here. The Congress should come out and clarify to the people,\" PM Modi said.\n\nDoubling down on his rhetoric against the opposition's dynastic politics, Prime Minister Modi emphasised that while the BJP prioritises the nation's interests, the Congress and BRS prioritize family interests.\n\nHe described these parties as operating on a \"family first\" principle, contrasting it with the BJP's focus on the nation. Prime Minister Modi criticised the Congress and BRS, alleging that corruption serves as the only common ground between them, with appeasement politics ingrained in their DNA.\n\nHe emphasised their lack of governance, labeling their approach as the \"zero governance model\" and stressing the urgent need to liberate Telangana from the grip of such corrupt parties.\n\nVoting for all 17 seats in Telangana will take place on May 13 in the fourth phase of the Lok Sabha Elections 2024.\n\nThe voting for the first three phases has been completed so far. The next round of voting will be held on May 7.\n\nThe Lok Sabha polls are being held across seven phases till June 1 and votes will be counted on June 4.", "source": {"uri": "ptcnews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "PTC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revanth_Reddy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Revanth Reddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warangal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warangal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warangal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Rashtra_Samithi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bharat Rashtra Samithi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeasement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Appeasement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynasty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dynasty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.ptcnews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/f6907b7cf359142e439e52bf0e2228fa_1280X720.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548578", "eventUri": "eng-9548578", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 2652, "textEnd": 2658}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 2819, "textEnd": 2824}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 2887, "textEnd": 2893}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 2923, "textEnd": 2929}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

The PM, for the first time during the LS polls, accused the Congress of having a nexus with \"Ambani and Adani\", and asked if the party has received \"tempo loads of black money\" from the two businessmen for its leader Rahul Gandhi to stop \"abusing\" them, reports PTI.\n\nChanging the narrative on the issue that was until now used by the Congress to attack Modi and his government at the Centre, the PM also demanded that the Congress should explain to people why it has stopped raising the 'Ambani-Adani' issue. \"Since his Rafale issue got grounded, he started chanting about 'five industrialists'. Then he started saying Ambani-Adani. But ever since elections have been announced, these people (the Congress) have stopped abusing Ambani-Adani,\" the PM said while addressing an election rally at Vemulawada in Telangana, PTI reported.\n\nIt is worth mentioning here that the Congress party has been aggressively targeting the ruling BJP regarding Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani, and on several occasions, its leader Rahul Gandhi himself even accused the Central Government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of directly benefiting this company. There has been an uproar in Parliament over Adani's name several times, and the Congress has been alleging that the government is working only for a few selected industrialists.\n\nPM Modi's statement in Telangana needs to be seen in light of recent investment agreements signed between the Congress-ruled state of Telangana and the Adani Group. When senior Congress leader and former Union Minister P Chidambaram was asked a question regarding this, he became uncomfortable, and instead of answering, he passed the microphone towards party spokesperson Supriya Srinet. Instead of answering this, Shrinet also said that this was not the right occasion. This happened when Congress was announcing its LS poll manifesto.\n\nIt is worth mentioning here that Adani had even invested Rs 25,000 crore in coal mines in Chhattisgarh when Congress was in power there. Adani Group even invested Rs 65,000 crore in Rajasthan during the time of the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government. The then Congress-led Chhattisgarh government has given the contract for the Gidhmuda and Paturia coal mines to Adani. Thus, it would not be an exaggeration to say that Gautam Adani, whom Rahul Gandhi has been accusing of having a deal with PM Modi very often, has been given a red carpet welcome by Congress in Karnataka since the moment the party's government was formed in Karnataka. Adani Group promised to invest Rs 1 lakh crore in Karnataka. Apart from this, the group has invested Rs 35000 crore in Bengal, Rs 60000 crore in Andhra Pradesh, Rs 57000 crore in Odisha, and Rs 4500 crore in Tamil Nadu. Amidst all this, Adani Group also signed four MoUs with the Revanth Reddy-led Telangana government for an investment of over \u20b912,400 crore. Reddy himself signed the deal with Adani. The group is also expected to invest \u20b95000 crore for the data centre, \u20b95000 crore for another project, and \u20b91400 crore for the cement plant.\n\nThus, PM Modi's mention of Adani in Telangana can be seen as a move to show the Congress and especially Rahul Gandhi a mirror. Even Rahul has stopped harping the same old Adani-Ambani tune in the ongoing Lok Sabha polls because he seems to have finally realised that these industrialists are the wealth creators of the country, and accusing them just for petty political gains will not get him or his party the votes. It seems some sense has prevailed upon Rahul after he has seen how he is not getting any benefit from accusing these industrialists of false claims. Many politicians within the INDIA bloc, like Sharad Pawar and West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, among others, have been seen interacting with these industrialists in the past, and thus Rahul's rant about them makes the alliance partners uncomfortable.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kavita_pant@news9live.com", "name": "Kavita Pant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adani_Group", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adani Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautam_Adani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gautam Adani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karimnagar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karimnagar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karimnagar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Council_of_Ministers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union Council of Ministers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._Chidambaram", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "P.

For instance, Adani Enterprises slipped from \u20b92,886.90 to \u20b92,855.50. However, the stock recovered after that to hit a high of \u20b92,880 before closing at \u20b92,860.17, up 0.87 per cent over previous day's close.\n\nModi also used his two Telangana rallies to make a dig at Rahul's mentor Sam Pitroda's remarks that South Indians look like Africans. \"The prince's philosopher looks down on people with dark complexion. How can one judge people's abilities based on their skin colour,\" he said in his speech in Warangal.\n\nHe alleged that the Congress had an issue in making Ramnath Kovind, a Dalit, as the President in 2014 and Draupadi Murmu, an Adivasi woman, in 2019. The Congress tried to defeat Murmu, he said.\n\n\"The BJP believes in nation-first policy. But the BRS and Congress believe in family first. Their motto is - by the family. For the family. Of the family. There is no difference between the two parties. We need to save Telangana from these two parties,\" he said.\n\nThe State government is levying RR tax - the first R is in the State (referring to Revanth Reddy, and the second R (Rahul Gandhi) in the national capital, he said.\n\nThe day of drama which saw many memes flying ended with Sam Pitroda resigning from his role as Chairman of Indian overseas Congress.\n\nSHARE Copy

As the third phase of polling got over on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi opened a new front to attack the Congress and Rahul Gandhi. This time he used an oft-used weapon by Rahul Gandhi -- Adani & Ambani -- and seemed to turn the tables on the Wayanad MP. He accused the Congress of hoarding black money from the Adanis and the Ambanis to stop all attacks against the top industrialists of India.\n\nThis is the first time PM Modi invoked Ambani and Ambani to attack the Congress. So far, the Congress has been attacking the PM and the BJP for favouring the industrialists, accusing it of waiving their loans worth crores but burdening farmers for small loans.\n\nPrime Minister Modi, while speaking at a public meeting in Telangana, said: \"You must have seen the Shehzaada of Congress of has been chanting the name of [Mukesh] Ambani and [Gautam] Adani for 5 years. Suddenly, after the announcement of the elections, he stopped abusing Ambani and Adani. The Shehzaada must declare how much maal [money] he got from Ambani and Adani for the elections.

The truth is this- Rahul Gandhi talks about Adani every day, he puts the truth about Adani in front of you every day and exposes it. Rahul Gandhi tells you every day that Narendra Modi has a nexus with big industrialists. Narendra Modi waived off Rs 16 lakh crore of his friends but did not waive off a single rupee of the farmers. Narendra Modi should answer this,\" Priyanka Gandhi said.\n\nEarlier speaking at a rally in Telangana, PM Modi had said that for years the Congress' 'Shehzada' used to speak of '5 industrialists' and then he started to speak only of \"Ambani and Adani\" and now they are silent on them.\n\n\"Since the election dates were declared, they (Rahul and other Congress leaders) have even stopped abusing Ambani, Adani. Why? I wish to ask the Shehzada of the Congress: how much black money have they received from Adani, Ambani? How much (funding) did the Congress receive from them for the (ongoing) elections? I smell something fishy here. The Congress should come out and clarify to the people,\" PM Modi had said.\n\nMeanwhile, in her election speech, Priyanka Gandhi further said, \"Congress will take steps to stop paper leaks. The Agniveer scheme would be scrapped. The loans of the farmers would be waived. They have waived loans of billionaires but in UP farmers are committing suicide.\"\n\nShe also promised that if Congress came to power the eldest woman in the house would get Rs 8,500 per month which amounts to Rs 1 lakh per year.\n\n\"PM Modi provides 5 kg of rice but people cannot become self-sufficient with it. In Chhattisgarh Congress was giving 35 kg of food grain earlier. All the schemes are made for billionaires. This scheme would have been good if there were additional schemes on education and stopping the paper leak. The eldest woman in the family will get Rs 8,500 per month which amounts to Rs 1 lakh per year,\" she said.\n\nPriyanka Gandhi Vadra alleged that the BJP intended to change the constitution\n\n\"BJP candidates are going everywhere and saying that if you vote for them, they would change the Constitution. They have bought the media with the help of their billionaire friends. They have weakened all institutions that were there to strengthen you. When Modi ji realised that this would harm them in elections, he said that they wouldn't change the Constitution. But what is the truth?\" she said.\n\nRaebareli constituency goes to the polls on May 20. In the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections, Congress leader Sonia Gandhi won the constituency, bagging 534,918 votes. Her closest rival, Dinesh Pratap Singh, put up a formidable challenge, gathering 367,740 votes.

As the third phase of polling concluded on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi opened a new front to attack the Congress and Rahul Gandhi. This time, he used a weapon often used by Rahul Gandhi - Adani and Ambani - and seemed to turn the tables on the Wayanad MP. He accused the Congress of hoarding black money from the Adanis and Ambanis to stop all attacks on India's biggest industrialists.\n\nThis is the first time that PM Modi has invoked Ambani and Ambani to attack the Congress. So far, the Congress has attacked the Prime Minister and the BJP for favoring industrialists, accusing it of waiving their loans worth billions but making farmers pay small loans.\n\nPrime Minister Modi, while addressing a public meeting in Telangana, said, \"You must have seen the Shehzaada of the Congress chanting the name of [Mukesh] Ambani and [Gautam] Adani for 5 years. So, after the elections were announced, he stopped insulting Ambani and Adani. The Shehzaada must declare how much in the country [money] he got from Ambani and Adani for the elections. How many bags of black money did he get? What deal did you make with Ambani and Adani that you stopped mistreating them overnight after attacking them for over 5 years?

These are two businessmen from Gujarat whom the Modi administration has been accused of favoring during its tenure, with opposition leaders alleging that the prime minister had sold the country to the duo.\n\nYou must have seen how Congress Shahzade [referring to Rahul Gandhi] has spent the last five years repeating the same thing. Since their Rafale deal was grounded, they started praying for a new rhythm. For five years, it was the same repetition: five businessmen, five businessmen, five businessmen. Then slowly the melody changed, it became Ambani-Adani, Ambani-Adani, Ambani-Adani. But since the elections were announced, he has stopped abusing Ambani-Adani. So I ask him today in Telangana, how much money did he take from Ambani-Adani? How many bags of black money did he take from him? Modi said.>\n\nFirst of all. The premise of Modi's speech that the Congress in general and Rahul Gandhi in particular stopped talking about Adani and Ambani during the elections is false. On April 24, Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge saidWhat happens in this country is that there are two sellers and two buyers. The sellers are Modi and Shah and the buyers are Ambani and Adani. At an election rally in Coimbatore on April 12, Rahul had saidThe policies of Narendra Modi and Adani have created two Indias. An India of billionaires and an India of poor people. He had also repeatedly raised the issue of the two billionaires and their growing wealth during his Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra.\n\nBut that aside, Modi is right that there are several concerns regarding Adani and Ambani that the people of India might want to take seriously as they vote for the next government of their choice. The India Today Mood of the Nation poll released earlier this year find that 52% of people think that economic policies are made to help big businesses.>\n\nHere's a list, in case he wants to raise this question and provide answers at his upcoming rallies.\n\n1. Ambani-Adani's wealth rises as Indian economy suffers>\n\nThe Adanis and Ambanis have seen their wealth increase significantly over the past 10 years, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the economy was largely at a standstill and millions of Indians struggled to earn an income. Ambani is currently The richest person in Asia, followed closely by Adani. Both find their name among the 15 richest people in the world. Meanwhile, the Indian economy as a whole was prey by record household savings, decline in real wages and serious unemployment.>\n\n>\n\n2. A slow and late investigation into Adanis market manipulation allegations\n\nIt has been 15 months since US short seller Hindenburg Research published its report accusing the Adani group of stock market manipulation and accounting fraud. In India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has been tasked with investigating these allegations, and the Modi regime has not accepted opposition demands for a joint parliamentary committee investigation into the matter. . After Hindenburg, financial journalists uncovered new evidence of wrongdoing. Yet little action has been taken against the group so far, despite SEBI also confirms that there were irregularities.>\n\n3. Expulsion from the parliament of Mahua Moitras>\n\nTrinamool Congress leader Mahua Moitra was summarily expelled from the Lok Sabha following a procedure heavily criticized by opposition parties. It has been suggested that the Modi regime targeted Moitra because of the issues she was raising in Parliament, particularly those regarding the Adani Group (read more about them) here). These are questions that the Modi government is yet to answer.>\n\nRahul Gandhi also alleged that his disqualification of Parliament (he was later reinstated) and the action against him in a defamation case was triggered by his speeches mentioning the Adani group.>\n\n4. Allegations of government favoritism>\n\nWhy were Adani and Ambani brought up in the first place? Because during its years in power, the Modi government made several decisions that observers say were aimed at satisfying corporate interests: the controversial (and now repealed) agricultural laws, airport privatization, modification of mining rules and more.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

ANI\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday questioned the recent Congress silence on Ambani and Adani, asking how many sacks and tempos full of black and stolen money had the \"Congress prince\" received from them.\n\nSpeaking at poll rallies in Telangana, the PM, in a first, raked up Rahul Gandhi's persistent attack on crony capitalism to ask why the former Congress president had suddenly fallen silent.\n\n'How much money received?'\n\nThe prince (Rahul Gandhi) should declare how many bags of black money he has received from Ambani and Adani. ...how many tempos loaded with stolen money have come? Narendra Modi, Prime Minister\n\n'How do you know tempos used?'\n\nModiji, are you anxious? Today, for the first time, you spoke of them in public. And you also know that they send money in tempos? Is it your personal experience? Rahul Gandhi, Cong leader\n\n\"What is the reason behind the Congress prince's overnight silence on Adani and Ambani whom he kept attacking for five years... Surely, the Congress has struck a deal with them,\" the PM said, inviting sharp reactions from the Congress that said the PM's comments signalled the anxiety of impending poll loss.\n\nSpeaking in Telangana's Warangal, Modi said, \"For the past five years, the Congress prince (read Rahul Gandhi) has been parroting one line. After his Rafale issue was grounded, he picked up a new line. For five years, he has been hurling abuses at Indian industrialists. First, he began by targeting five industrialists, and then zeroed down on Ambani and then Adani,\" Modi said.\n\nHe added, \"I want to ask the Congress prince from the land of Telangana. The prince should declare how many bags of black money he has received from Ambani and Adani. How much money has been received by the Congress, how many tempos loaded with stolen money have come? What deal has been struck for the Congress prince to overnight stop abusing Ambani and Adani? He will have to reply to the nation,\" Modi said in his latest attack on the Congress and a rare jibe at industrialists.\n\nReacting to the PM, Rahul Gandhi in a video message asked how PM knew that Adani and Ambani sent money in tempos. \"Is it your personal experience,\" Rahul asked the PM.\n\nIn the video the ex-Congress chief said, \"Modiji, are you anxious? Normally you speak of Adani and Ambani in private. Today, for the first time, you spoke of them in public. And you also know that they send money in tempos? Is it your personal experience?

It means you have received some or the other ill-gotten money loaded in tempos),\" he said.\n\nIt is for the first time that Narendra Modi referred to the country's two most powerful industrialists in his election campaign and to everyone's shock, he also talked about tempo loads of black money still being in circulation in the country post-demonetisation.\n\n\"I am asking shehzada (prince) from this soil of Telangana to explain how much money he took from Adani and Ambani? How much \"kala dhan\" (black money) he looted? Whether Congress received tempo loads of currency notes,\" he said.\n\nThe Prime Minister said Rahul Gandhi started chanting about five industrialists after his efforts to portray the Rafale deal in poor light fell flat. He then started talking about Ambani and Adani.\n\nSeeing a huge crowd at the meeting, Modi said he was happy to see such a massive crowd, which he did not witness in his home state of Gujarat. He exuded confidence that the BJP-led NDA will register a thumping victory and even surveys conducted after the third phase of polls predicted it.\n\nModi is the first Prime Minister to visit the famous Sri Raja Rajeshwara Swamy temple, which is located about 150 km away from Hyderabad. He offered Kode Mokku and special prayers to the presiding deities.\n\nFormer state BJP president and sitting MP Bandi Sanjay Kumar is seeking his re-election from the Karimnagar Lok Sabha constituency.\n\nThe Prime Minister said Sanjay Kumar's win was evident from the large turnout of people from Karimnagar where the Congress struggled to find a candidate till eleventh hour. \"While the BJP always believes in the policy of nation first, both the Congress and the BRS believe in the policy of the family first.

''Remember that through his 'Chaar Raaste', the prime minister has given contracts and licenses worth Rs 4 lakh crore to his cronies in return for their donations. If today, 21 Indian billionaires have as much wealth as 70 crore Indians, it is all thanks to the PM's intentions and his policies. It also goes without saying that 'Hamare Do' are key figures in those 21,'' Ramesh claimed.\n\nHe said that since January 28, 2023, the Congress party has repeatedly demanded the formation of a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to investigate the ''Modani scam''.\n\n''We reiterated this demand even after the elections began - on April 23, 2024, and just five days ago, on May 3, 2024. Since April 3, 2024, Rahul Gandhi has mentioned Adani 103 times and Ambani more than 30 times in his speeches. ''A JPC will be formed as soon as the India alliance comes to power on June 4, 2024, to investigate the Modani Scam - which has an estimated price tag of at least Rs. 2 lakh crores,'' the Congress leader said.\n\nCongress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi said the prime minister knows that people now understand the reality that he has handed over all wealth to big businessmen and he is now clarifying after getting nervous.\n\nAnother party leader Pawan Khera said that PM Modi is disturbed after three phases of elections and realises that the ground is shaking. He claimed the prime minister has collected Rs 8,200 crore from his ''friends'' and when he was losing the polls, he has turned against them.\n\n''When you cannot be theirs, how can you be ours or anyone else's in the country,'' he posed, adding the Congress does not fear anyone or anything.\n\nCongress leader Supriya Shrinate said the prime minister is making serious allegations of corruption against the two big industrialists and asked when would a CBI, ED or Income Tax raid happen against them.\n\nThe Congress has been attacking the Modi government, accusing the prime minister of favouring the top five industrialists in the country, including Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated

Ever since the Rafale case was grounded, he started harping on it. For five years, he has been harping on it. Five industrialists, five industrialists, five industrialists... Then slowly, he started saying Ambani-Adani, Ambani-Adani, Ambani-Adani, for five years. But ever since the elections were declared, he stopped abusing Ambani-Adani. Today, from Telangana, I want to ask him.. the Shehzada should announce how much money (maal) he has taken from Ambani-Adani. How many sacks of black money have gone to him? Have they sent tempos filled with notes to Congress? What deal have they struck? You have stopped abusing Ambani-Adani overnight. There must be something fishy. For five years, he abused Ambani-Adani, and overnight the abuses stopped! That means you have received looted amounts (chori ka maal) filled in trucks. You have to answer the nation.\"\n\nA part of the statement was also highlighted on Prime Minister Modi's official website.\n\nA simple key word search with date filter reveals that Rahul Gandhi has attacked the BJP and Narendra Modi's associations with the two industrialists, Reliance chief Mukesh Ambani and Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani, several times in his campaign speeches in the recent past. Here are a few instances:\n\nMay 7, Konbir, Jharkhand\n\nRahul Gandhi delivered a speech at the NHPC Ground in Jharkhand's Konbir in Lohardaga Lok Sabha area in support of Congress candidates Kalicharan Munda (Khunti) and Sukhdeo Bhagat (Lohardaga), where he alleged that the BJP wanted to hand over forest land of the tribal people to Ambani and Adani.\n\n10-minute onward in the above video, Gandhi states, \"BJP says you are forest dwellers (vanvasi) and they would give the entire forest to Adani. 24 hours a day, they keep handing over forest land to Adani... Whatever they do, they do it for the billionaires. They have 22-25 friends like Adani, Ambani. All the work are done for them. Land for them, forest for them, media for them, infrastructure for them, roads for them, bridges for them, petrol for them, everything for them. Earlier, there used to be public sector where tribals, Dalits, backward classes had their reservation. Everything is now being privatized... the public sector is your asset... roads, railways are your assets, not Adani's. Everything is being handed over to them. You tell me, these mediapersons who are standing here.. do they talk about you? They will never do that. They are not yours. They work for the billionaires. They work for them. They will show the Ambanis' wedding for 24 hours. But even if a tribal dies, if he is killed, if he begs with folded hands, he will not be shown by the media.\"\n\nMay 6, Khargone, Madhya Pradesh\n\nThe Congress leader addressed a public rally at Segaon in Khargone district of Madhya Pradesh in support of party candidate Porlal Kharte.\n\nAt the 13.47-minute mark in the above video, Gandhi states, \"If the Constitution is abolished, all your rights will come to an end... water bodies, forests, land (jal-jangal-zameen), reservation, public sector, everything will vanish. And Hindustan will be ruled by 22-25 people. Who are these people? They are the billionaires of Hindustan. People like Adani, whose eyes are fixed on your land, your forests, your water bodies. They want these to be snatched from you and handed over to them. They are special friends of Narendra Modi ji. Have you heard the name Adani? Have you? The Prime Minister wants to give away your land, forests, water bodies to Adani. Airports, power stations, ports, infrastructure, everything has been given to these 22-25 people by Narendra Modi ji... he has waived off loans amounting to Rs 16 Lakh Crore of these 22-25 people.\"\n\nAgain, 22.03-minute onward, he states, \"Steps like introduction of GST and demonitaztion were taken to help billionaires. Narendra Modi wanted to help people like Adani and hence he brought in faulty GST, demonetization... \"\n\nMay 5, Ratlam, Madhya Pradesh\n\nRahul Gandhi spoke at a public meeting in support of Congress candidate Kantilal Bhuria in Ratlam Lok Sabha constituency of Madhya Pradesh, where he made the same allegations against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the mainstream media. He stated, \"Brothers and sisters, you must have noticed that the media persons never talk about tribals. Isn't that right? They will show Ambanis' wedding, the Bollywood, dancing and singing, but there are atrocities on tribals, your children are raped, your land is snatched away, then nothing is ever said about you in the media.\"\n\nLashing out at PM Modi for his alleged favouritism to billionaires, Gandhi also stated, \"Narendra Modi has waived off loans worth Lakhs of crores of 22 people. He has given money to billionaires. We have made up our mind that if he can give money to them, we can give money to tribals, dalits, backward classes, the poor from the general caste.\"\n\nHe repeated the allegations in another speech on the same day at an election rally at Nagakurnool in Telangana and while addressing the youth on May 4 in Delhi. In both the places, Gandhi mentioned the name of the Adani Group chairman.\n\nMay 3, Pune, Maharashtra\n\nGandhi spoke at a public rally campaigning for the Congress Pune Lok Sabha candidate Ravindra Dhangekar. Pointing out the absence of tribals and backward classes in corporate media houses, he stated, \"Look at the names of big media companies, look at the names of their owners, look at the names of big anchors, look at the names of big journalists, you will not see a single person from the backward classes, not a dalit, not a tribal. That's why they never talk about farmers, about labourers, about unemployement. They show Ambanis' wedding to you. In that, they show you someone wearing a watch worth ten crores, someone is wearing clothes worth two crores, they show that. But the farmers are hungry, there is no water in the fields, price-rise is increasing, they will never show these things, they are not yours. They are not yours, they belong to Adani.\"\n\nThis shows that contrary to the 'sudden silence' statement by Prime Minister Modi on May 8, Rahul Gandhi attacked billionaire businessmen Ambani and Adani in his speeches on each of the five days before Modi made the claim, i.e., on May 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7th.\n\nPrior to that, on April 30, Rahul Gandhi had shared a video on X (Twitter) where he made arguably the most scathing attack against the billionaire duo's alleged links with PM Modi. In the clip captioned \"I am yours, he is theirs. Understand the difference,\" Gandhi says, \"Have you seen Narendra Modiji's photo with Ambani and Adani? But have you heard the word 'Ambani' or 'Adani' on Narendra Modi's lips? Have you seen my photo with them? But I utter the words 'Adani', 'Ambani'. Understand the difference. I am yours, he is theirs.\"\n\nA similar clip, which talks about PM Modi's close association with Gautam Adani, was shared by the official X handle of Congress on May 6 with the same caption. And a couple of days later, PM Modi named Ambani and Adani in his speech and alleged that they were sending black money loaded in tempo to Congress.\n\nIf PM Modi's 'sudden silence' remarks and his allegations against Ambani and Adani of involvement with black money are seen as a response to this video, it marks a significant moment in the campaign discourse where Prime Minister Modi is responding to a narrative set by Congress.\n\nRahul Gandhi responded to Modi's charge through a video statement uploaded on X on the same day Modi spoke in Karimnagar. In the 42-second clip, he dared Prime Minister Modi to conduct a CBI or ED probe into businessmen Adani and Ambani to find out if they had been sending black money to Congress. He also wondered if Modi was speaking from his \"personal experience\" when he said they sent their money \"loaded in a tempo\".\n\nThe official X handle of Congress, too, shared a video compiling short clips of Rahul Ganshi's recent mentions of the billionaire businessmen in recent speeches.\n\nAlt News has written to the Reliance Industries Limited and the Adani Group seeking their response to allegations of Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani's involvement in black money by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. This story will be updated as and when we receive a response from them.", "source": {"uri": "altnews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alt News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

What is the deal that you stopped abusing Ambani and Adani overnight?\"\n\nIn response, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge claimed that Modi's remark was the real indicator of the election results. \"This shows that Modiji's chair is shaking,\" Kharge said on X.\n\nCongress leader Rahul Gandhi said that the prime minister normally talks about the two businessmen \"only behind closed doors\" and Wednesday's rally was the first time he publicly named them.\n\n\"You even know that they give money in tempos - is this your personal experience?\" asked Gandhi. \"Send the CBI [Central Bureau of Investigation] and ED [Enforcement Directorate] to them and get an inquiry done as soon as possible.

They [Bharatiya Janata Party-led government] created 22 billionaires, we will create crores of lakhpatis.\"\n\nCongress General Secretary in-charge of Communications Jairam Ramesh claimed that Modi was making such statements as he was perturbed on seeing his impending electoral defeat.\n\nRamesh asked how the prime minister's \"friends\" had black money if he had implemented demonetisation to get rid of such illicit funds. He further questioned why central agencies such as the Central Bureau of Investigation, Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax Department were not acting against conglomerates owned by Adani and Ambani if the two industrialists had \"sacks full of black money\".\n\nThe Congress MP said: \"If public assets have been sold to Adani and Ambani through privatisation in the past ten years, where has black money come from?\"\n\nCongress leaders, including Gandhi, have accused the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government of favouritism towards conglomerates owned by Ambani and Adani. The party's claims about the Adani Group grew more emphatic in the wake of allegations of accounting fraud, improper use of tax havens and money laundering against the conglomerate made by United States-based short-seller Hindenburg Research in January 2023.\n\nOther Opposition leaders also criticised Modi for his allegations on Wednesday. Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav claimed the prime minister's remarks were proof that demonetisation had failed to curb black money.\n\n\"Big industrialists must have evaded Goods and Services and Tax and income tax, which must have been how so much black money was created in the first place,\" said Yadav. \"The government either allowed this to happen or was unable to stop it. Either way, it is the failure of the government.\"\n\nTrinamool Congress MP Saket Gokhale noted that there was no mention of Adani's companies among those who donated to the BJP through electoral

A (Telugu) film named 'RRR' was released recently and went on to become a blockbuster hit. However, someone told me that 'RR' has left 'RRR' far behind when it comes to collections. The lifetime (box office) collection of 'RRR' was reported to be over Rs 1000 cr, but the same amount of money was mopped up in just a few days through the 'RR' tax,\" he said.\n\n\" Telangana mein ek R loot ta hai aur Delhi mein dusre R ko deta hai. (One R loots the public in Telangana and gives the collections to another R in Delhi). This double 'RR' game could potentially destroy Telangana,\" PM Modi added.\n\nPM Modi On Congress' Bashing Of Ambani & Adani\n\nFurther training his guns at Rahul, PM Modi said for years, 'Shehzada' (scion) of the Congress used to speak of '5 industrialists' but now, he only brings up \"Ambani and Adani\".\n\n\"However, since the election dates were declared, they (Rahul and other Congress leaders) have even stopped abusing Ambani, Adani. Why? I wish to ask the Shehzada of the Congress: how much black money have they received from Adani, Ambani? How much (funding) did the Congress receive from them for the (ongoing) elections? I smell something wrong here. The Congress should come out and clarify to the people,\" PM Modi said.\n\nPM Modi Attacks Bharat Rashtra Samiti\n\nAlso coming down heavily on the Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS), the previous ruling party in the state, PM Modi said while the BJP pursues a 'nation first' policy, the Congress and the BRS work to advance the principle of 'family first'.\n\n\"These (dynastic) parties run on the principle of 'by the family, for the family, of the family'. The only 'glue' that binds Congress and BRS together is corruption. Appeasement politics is in their DNA. It is their only agenda. The Congress and the BRS follow the 'zero governance model'. There is a desperate need to save Telangana from the corrupt clutches of such parties,\" he added.\n\nPM Modi On His Meeting With PV Narasimha Rao, TheFormer Prime Minister Of India\n\nRecalling his meeting with former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao's family on Tuesday, Prime Minister Modi said the Congress, in pursuance of its family-first policy, insulted the Bharat Ratna recipient.\n\n\"Congress insulted PV Narasimha Rao to carry forward its family-first policy. It was our government that honoured Narasimha Rao-ji with the Bharat Ratna, the country's highest civilian honour. It was an incredibly proud moment for me to have met his family members yesterday,\" PM Modi said.\n\nSharpening his attack on the Congress and the BRS, PM Modi said while both accuse each other of corruption, they are backdoor partners of the same 'corruption syndicate'.\n\n\"The BRS used to accuse the Congress of 'cash for votes' but as long as it was in power in the state, it never directed an investigation into it. When the Congress was in the Opposition, it accused BRS of the 'Kaleshwaram scam' but months since coming to power in the state, it hasn't yet instituted a probe into the matter,\" PM Modi said.\n\nReaffirming his earlier statement on reservation, PM Modi alleged that the Congress was conspiring against the SCs, STs, and OBCs.\n\n\"The Constitution, as was envisioned and drafted by Babasaheb Ambedkar, is against the idea of reservation on the basis of religion. They want to steal from your quota, as guaranteed by the Constitution, and give it to their vote bank,\" PM Modi said.\n\nPM Modi Invokes acharya Pramod Krishnam To Criticize The Congress\n\nInvoking expelled leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam's big claim against Rahul and the Congress, he said the grand old party wants to 'lock up' the Ram temple in Ayodhya.\n\n\"This disclosure was made by none other than a former confidante of the Congress' royal family.

Friends are no longer friends...! After the completion of three phases of elections, today the prime minister has started attacking his own friends. It is becoming clear that Modiji's chair is shaking. This is the real trend of the results,\" Kharge said in a post in Hindi on X.\n\nAt a poll rally in Telangana's Vemulavada, Modi said, \"Ever since elections have been announced, these people (Congress) have stopped abusing Ambani-Adani. I want to ask from Telangana soil, let the Shehzada announce, how much has been lifted from Ambani-Adani. Has tempo loads of notes (currency) reached the Congress? What deal has been arrived at, that abusing Ambani-Adani has stopped overnight.\" \"Certainly something is fishy. For five years, (they) abused Adani-Ambani and it stopped overnight. It means you have received some tempo loads of 'chori ka maal' (loot). You have to answer the nation,\" the prime minister further said.\n\nAfter PM's attack, Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh said the tide of this election has turned so \"violently\" that the \"Pappa\" of \"Hum Do Hamare Do\" is turning on his own children.\n\n\"Defeat is a foregone conclusion. The prime minister is now spooked even by his own shadow,\" he said in a post on X and shared a picture of Modi along with his shadow.\n\nThe Congress leader said, \"The man who collected Rs 8,200 crore of Electoral Bonds for his party - a scam so egregious that even the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional - is today levelling allegations on others.\" \"Remember that through his 'Chaar Raaste', the prime minister has given contracts and licenses worth Rs 4 lakh crore to his cronies in return for their donations. If today, 21 Indian billionaires have as much wealth as 70 crore Indians, it is all thanks to the PM's intentions and his policies. It also goes without saying that 'Hamare Do' are key figures in those 21,\" Ramesh claimed.\n\nHe said that since January 28, 2023, the Congress party has repeatedly demanded the formation of a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) to investigate the \"Modani scam\".\n\n\"We reiterated this demand even after the elections began - on April 23, 2024, and just five days ago, on May 3, 2024. Since April 3, 2024, Rahul Gandhi has mentioned Adani 103 times and Ambani more than 30 times in his speeches.\n\n\"A JPC will be formed as soon as the India alliance comes to power on June 4, 2024, to investigate the Modani Scam - which has an estimated price tag of at least Rs. 2 lakh crores,\" the Congress leader said.\n\nCongress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi said the prime minister knows that people now understand the reality that he has handed over all wealth to big businessmen and he is now clarifying after getting nervous.\n\nAnother party leader Pawan Khera said that PM Modi is disturbed after three phases of elections and realises that the ground is shaking. He claimed the prime minister has collected Rs 8,200 crore from his \"friends\" and when he was losing the polls, he has turned against them.\n\n\"When you cannot be theirs, how can you be ours or anyone else's in the country,\" he posed, adding the Congress does not fear anyone or anything.\n\nCongress leader Supriya Shrinate said the prime minister is making serious allegations of corruption against the two big industrialists and asked when would a CBI, ED or Income Tax raid happen against them.\n\nThe Congress has been attacking the Modi government, accusing the prime minister of favouring the top five industrialists in the country, including Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani.

We will support you,\" she told reporters.\n\nSeveral Congress leaders put out video messages on their social media handles asking when will Prime Minister Modi order investigation against Adani and Ambani after his big allegation.\n\nShrinate also said the Congress wants to assure the people that they should not be scared.\n\n\"Narendra Modi created 22 billionaires. We will create crores of 'lakhpatis', and that is our promise,\" she claimed.\n\nThe Congress leader claimed that the revelations made by Prime Minister Modi on corruption have created a stir in the entire BJP and the government.\n\n\"The people are scared because they know that when Modi Ji can sacrifice his close aides after seeing the defeat then where do they stand,\" she alleged.\n\nShe claimed that even those officers who were working on Modi's instructions are scared. All of them have understood that the government is about to change, she said.\n\n\"There is a clear writing on the wall that neither the BJP is going to form the government at the Centre on June 4 nor is Narendra Modi becoming the prime minister again,\" she said, adding that this has already become clear in the first three phases of polling.\n\nIn a change of narrative on the 'Ambani-Adani' issue, which was until now used by the Congress to attack Modi and his government at the Centre, the prime minister also demanded that the party should explain to the people why it has stopped raising the issue as its 'Shehzada' (Rahul Gandhi) used to do for the past five years and asked if it has struck a 'sauda' (deal).\n\nThe Prime Minister also said, \"Certainly something is fishy. For five years, (they) abused Adani-Ambani and it stopped overnight. It means you have received some tempo loads of 'chori ka maal' (loot)... Kaale dhan ki kitni boriya bharkar ke rupaye maare hain (how many sacks of black money you have taken)?

It was an incredibly proud moment for me to have met his family members yesterday,\" PM Modi said.\n\nSharpening his attack on the Congress and the BRS, PM Modi said while both accuse each other of corruption, they are backdoor partners of the same 'corruption syndicate'.\n\n\"The BRS used to accuse the Congress of 'cash for votes' but as long as it was in power in the state, it never directed an investigation into it. When the Congress was in the Opposition, it accused BRS of the 'Kaleshwaram scam' but months since coming to power in the state, it hasn't yet instituted a probe into the matter,\" PM Modi said.\n\nReaffirming his earlier statement on reservation, PM Modi alleged that the Congress was conspiring against the SCs, STs, and OBCs.\n\n\"The Constitution, as was envisioned and drafted by Babasaheb Ambedkar, is against the idea of reservation on the basis of religion. They want to steal from your quota, as guaranteed by the Constitution, and give it to their vote bank,\" PM Modi said.\n\nInvoking expelled leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam's big claim against Rahul and the Congress, he said the grand old party wants to 'lock up' the Ram temple in Ayodhya.\n\n\"This disclosure was made by none other than a former confidante of the Congress' royal family. He said the Congress conspired to stop the temple construction and overturn the Supreme Court decision (settling the age-old title dispute in favour of the Hindus),\" PM Modi said.

The Shehzaada must declare how much money he got from Ambani and Adani for the elections. How many bags of black money did he get from them? What deal did you crack with Ambani and Adani that you stopped abusing them overnight after attacking them for over 5 years? This means you have got trucks full of chori ka maal.\"\n\nPrime Minister Modi in an effort to turn the tables invoked Ambani and Ambani for the first time to attack the Congress after senior leaders from the Congress have been attacking the PM and the BJP for favoring the industrialists, accusing it of waiving their loans worth crores but burdening farmers for small loans.\n\n'By the family, for the family, of the family'\n\nDoubling down on his rhetoric against the opposition's \"dynasty\" politics, Prime Minister Modi said that the Congress & BRS functioned with the mantra of \"family first, \" while the BJP on \"nation first,\" he said.\n\n\"Their political parties are like 'by the family, for the family, of the family'. Congress and BRS are no different and what connects them? Corruption, appeasement politics and the model of zero governance connect these two parties,\" he said.\n\nReiterating his accustion, The PM said that the Congress party wants to grab the reservation rights meant for SCs, STs and Dalits and give the same to the Muslim community.\n\n\"Ensuring welfare is neither their vision nor agenda. All what Congress wants to secure is its vote bank. This corrupt party is fully immersed in appeasement policy,\" he added.\n\nCorruption serves as a unifying element between the Congress and BRS, despite their mutual accusations of corruption, both parties are implicated in the same corrupt practices, Modi said.\n\nPM Modi also alleged that Congress governments focused solely on dismantling every capability of the country for all these years.\n\n\"Whether it is India or Telangana, there was no dearth of capabilities in our country. However, for all these years, Congress governments did only one work - to destroy each and every capability of the country. You tell me the Congress destroyed the country's economy or not? Agriculture and textile sectors were India's strength since ages, but Congress destroyed them too. Congress is the mother of all problems in the country,\" he said.\n\nModi pointed out that while BRS members frequently accused the Congress of engaging in cash-for-votes schemes, they failed to initiate any investigations when they were in power.\n\n\"From Telangana to Delhi, there is a lot of discussion about the 'double R' (RR) tax. A film named 'RRR' was released a few days back in the Telugu language, someone told me that 'RR' has left behind 'RRR' in the collection. It is reported that 'RRR' has a lifetime collection of over Rs 1000 crore, but this much money is just a few days collection of 'RR' tax,\" said PM Modi.\n\n'Congress aur INDIA alliance ka teesra fuse udd gaya hai'\n\nA day after the third phase of polling, Prime Minister Modi also took a dig at the Congress saying that 'the third fuse of the Congress and INDIA alliance was off'\n\n\"Yesterday, the third phase of voting (for Lok Sabhal elections) took place in the country. In the third phase, the third fuse of Congress and INDI alliance has blown up. Four phases of voting are still left, people's blessing is pushing the victory chariot of the BJP and NDA with great pace,\" said PM Modi.\n\n'BJP-NDA govt respected PV Narasimha Rao by awarding Bharat Ratna'\n\nModi also accused the Congress of disrespecting Narasimha Rao even after his death and asserted that the BJP has given the the former PM the due respect he deserved.\n\n\"Due to this policy of 'family first', Congress has disrespected PV Narasimha Rao, even after his death, they denied the entry of his dead body in the Congress' office. BJP-NDA govt respected PV Narasimha Rao by awarding Bharat Ratna to him,\" the PM said in Telangana.\n\n(with input from agencies)\n\nThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

She asked when will the prime minister use his agencies like the CBI, the ED and the Income Tax to probe these charges.\n\n\"The prime minister of this country has never been so weak, helpless and desperate before. Yesterday, Narendra Modi showed courage and made a big revelation on corruption.\n\n\"The PM got this courage by looking at Rahul Gandhi, who is fearlessly exposing corruption, speaking out against the corrupt with great vigour and exposing Adani and Ambani. It was with this courage that Narendra Modi made such a big disclosure about corruption,\" she said.\n\nShrinate charged that looking at his upcoming defeat, Prime Minister Modi made serious allegations of corruption.\n\n\"Now that it has been revealed then what is there to fear from? Get it investigated... Get raids conducted at your friends' places. The irony is that the prime minister is making allegations but the investigating agencies and the media are stunned. Don't be afraid... Get it checked. We will support you,\" she told reporters.\n\nSeveral Congress leaders put out video messages on their social media handles asking when will Prime Minister Modi order investigation against Adani and Ambani after his big allegation.\n\nShrinate also said the Congress wants to assure the people that they should not be scared.\n\n\"Narendra Modi created 22 billionaires. We will create crores of 'lakhpatis', and that is our promise,\" she claimed.\n\nThe Congress leader claimed that the revelations made by Prime Minister Modi on corruption have created a stir in the entire BJP and the government.\n\n\"The people are scared because they know that when Modi Ji can sacrifice his close aides after seeing the defeat then where do they stand,\" she alleged.\n\nShe claimed that even those officers who were working on Modi's instructions are scared. All of them have understood that the government is about to change, she said.\n\n\"There is a clear writing on the wall that neither the BJP is going to form the government at the Centre on June 4 nor is Narendra Modi becoming the prime minister again,\" she said, adding that this has already become clear in the first three phases of polling.\n\nIn a change of narrative on the 'Ambani-Adani' issue, which was until now used by the Congress to attack Modi and his government at the Centre, the prime minister also demanded that the party should explain to the people why it has stopped raising the issue as its 'Shehzada' (Rahul Gandhi) used to do for the past five years and asked if it has struck a 'sauda' (deal).\n\nThe Prime Minister also said, \"Certainly something is fishy. For five years, (they) abused Adani-Ambani and it stopped overnight. It means you have received some tempo loads of 'chori ka maal' (loot)...

I wish to ask the Shehzadey of Congress to declare how much black money have they received from Adani, and Ambani?\" Modi said.\n\nThis charge was countered by several leaders of the Congress party, who have said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is staring at an impending defeat in the general elections and, hence, making such baseless allegations.\n\n\"Let me remind you Prime Minister ji. From 3 April until now (8 May), Rahul Gandhi ji has spoken about Gautam Adani 103 times and 30 times about Mukesh Ambani,\" Congress leader Pawan Khera said in a video uploaded on social media website X.\n\nEmails sent to the Reliance and Adani Group did not elicit any response till the time of going to print.\n\nGandhi and several other opposition leaders have, even in Parliament, made allegations of crony capitalism against the Modi government for helping his 'industrialist friends'. Gandhi had, during the 2019 elections, alleged that the Modi government had helped Anil Ambani through offset deals in the Rafale purchase.\n\nDuring February 2023, Gandhi had raised allegations of a close relationship between PM Modi and Adani by holding a photo of Modi with Adani on the businessman's plane. Gandhi's aim was to emphasize their perceived proximity and potential influence.\n\nHe had stated, \"From Tamil Nadu, Kerala to Himachal Pradesh, we have been listening to only one name everywhere - 'Adani'. Across the country, it's just 'Adani', 'Adani', 'Adani'... People wondered how Adani was successful in every business he entered.\" This statement underlined the widespread discussions surrounding Adani's business ventures and his perceived influence.\n\nGandhi had also alleged that the Adani Group over-invoiced coal imports, leading to a hike in power tariffs. Gandhi stated, \"We are providing subsidies in Karnataka and will also do so in Madhya Pradesh if we come in power. But the youth of the country must understand, that 'as soon as you switch on the fan or light, the money goes into the pocket of Gautam Adani.'\"\n\nGandhi had also alleged that the government is blocking his attempts to raise concerns about Adani in Parliament, claiming that his microphone was turned off when he spoke about the businessman.\n\nMilestone Alert!

Yesterday, Narendra Modi showed courage and made a big revelation on corruption, says party spokesperson Supriya Shrinate\n\nThe Congress on Thursday challenged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to use his investigating agencies like the CBI and the ED to probe the charges he has levelled against businessmen Ambani and Adani that they were distributing sacks full of black money in tempos.\n\nCongress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate claimed that the prime minister was never seen so weak and desperate that he ended up making great revelations about corruption in the country and exposing his own friends.\n\nShe was referring to the charge on Wednesday made by prime minister who, for the first time during Lok Sabha poll campaign, accused the Congress of having a \"deal\" with \"Ambani and Adani\", and asked if the party has received \"tempo loads of black money\" from the two industrialists for its leader Rahul Gandhi to stop \"abusing\" them.\n\nShrinate pointed out that Rahul Gandhi has been saying the same thing for the last 10 years that the big businessmen possessed black money but the prime minister was not taking action against them.\n\nShe said, the prime minister has gathered the courage and admitted about it. She asked when will the prime minister use his agencies like the CBI, the ED and the Income Tax to probe these charges.\n\n\"The prime minister of this country has never been so weak, helpless and desperate before. Yesterday, Narendra Modi showed courage and made a big revelation on corruption.\n\n\"The PM got this courage by looking at Rahul Gandhi, who is fearlessly exposing corruption, speaking out against the corrupt with great vigour and exposing Adani and Ambani. It was with this courage that Narendra Modi made such a big disclosure about corruption,\" she said.\n\nShrinate charged that looking at his upcoming defeat, Prime Minister Modi made serious allegations of corruption.\n\n\"Now that it has been revealed then what is there to fear from? Get it investigated... Get raids conducted at your friends' places. The irony is that the prime minister is making allegations but the investigating agencies and the media are stunned. Don't be afraid... Get it checked. We will support you,\" she told reporters.\n\nSeveral Congress leaders put out video messages on their social media handles asking when will Prime Minister Modi order investigation against Adani and Ambani after his big allegation.\n\nShrinate also said the Congress wants to assure the people that they should not be scared.\n\n\"Narendra Modi created 22 billionaires. We will create crores of 'lakhpatis', and that is our promise,\" she claimed.\n\nThe Congress leader claimed that the revelations made by Prime Minister Modi on corruption have created a stir in the entire BJP and the government.\n\n\"The people are scared because they know that when Modi Ji can sacrifice his close aides after seeing the defeat then where do they stand,\" she alleged.\n\nShe claimed that even those officers who were working on Modi's instructions are scared. All of them have understood that the government is about to change, she said.\n\n\"There is a clear writing on the wall that neither the BJP is going to form the government at the Centre on June 4 nor is Narendra Modi becoming the prime minister again,\" she said, adding that this has already become clear in the first three phases of polling.\n\nIn a change of narrative on the 'Ambani-Adani' issue, which was until now used by the Congress to attack Modi and his government at the Centre, the prime minister also demanded that the party should explain to the people why it has stopped raising the issue as its 'Shehzada' (Rahul Gandhi) used to do for the past five years and asked if it has struck a 'sauda' (deal).\n\nThe Prime Minister also said, \"Certainly something is fishy. For five years, (they) abused Adani-Ambani and it stopped overnight. It means you have received some tempo loads of 'chori ka maal' (loot)...

Neither candidate presented any evidence for their claims.\n\nThe comments from Modi seek to counter Gandhi's long-running criticism about what he says are Modi's ties to the country's two richest men, weeks into the election where differences over growth, poverty and unemployment are key themes.\n\nBut the ramped up rhetoric could also be part of a change of tack from Modi.\n\nA lower turnout so far in the six-week vote has rattled Modi's campaign managers and called into question whether his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies can achieve the landslide predicted by opinion polls a month ago, BJP leaders and political analysts have told Reuters.\n\nThey say the lack of momentum seems to have prompted Modi to change the thrust of his campaign speeches, focusing on economic growth before the first phase of voting to now attacking rivals as pro-Muslims and in other ways in bid to fire up the party's hardline base.\n\n\"For five years you abused Ambani-Adani and now suddenly you have stopped. Meaning, you have accepted truckloads of some illegal funds. You'll have to answer to the country about this,\" Modi said at an election rally.\n\nCONGLOMERATES\n\nGandhi responded hours later by asking Modi whether he was \"slightly scared\" and said he should send financial crime investigators to do a full inquiry immediately.\n\n\"For the first time you have spoken in public about Adani and Ambani. Is it your personal experience that you know they give money in trucks?\" Gandhi said in a video message. \"I want to repeat to the nation that the amount of money Modi has given to them, we are going to give the same amount to India's poor.\"\n\nModi's party did not immediately respond to Gandhi's remarks.\n\nGandhi has for years attacked Modi saying he works for the interests of industrialists such as Ambani and Adani and that inequality between the rich and poor has worsened during his 10-year term, charges the government denies.\n\nModi has previously called allegations of promoting Adani and Ambani monopolies \"unfounded\" and said such accusations do damage to the Congress party.\n\nAmbani, Asia's richest man, is chairman of the oil-to-media conglomerate Reliance Industries while Adani, Asia's second richest, is chairman of the power-to-ports conglomerate Adani Group.\n\nBoth industrialists are from Modi's home state Gujarat, where their businesses have large operations and have branched out to other Indian states including those ruled by opposition parties and also overseas.\n\nResearch group World Inequality Lab said in a recent report that India's richest 1% citizens owned 40.1% of the country's wealth as of 2023, the highest since 1961.\n\nIndia's seven-phase election began on April 19 and ends on June 1.

How many sacks of black money has he received? Has money reached Congress in tempos? What deal has been struck? Overnight, you have stopped abusing Ambani-Adani.

Addressing a rally in Congress-ruled Telangana, PM Modi said that \"Shehzada of Congress (Gandhi) had been saying the same thing for last 5 years. After his Rafale charge grounded, he started taking Ambani-Adani's name.\" However, after the polls were announced, he stopped attacking them, the PM added.\n\nIn 2019, Gandhi alleged that the \"trail of corruption\" in the Rafale fighter jet deal \"begins and ends with\" PM Modi. He also alleged \"destruction of evidence\" and \"obvious cover-up\" after the government told the Supreme Court that crucial files pertaining to the deal were \"stolen.\" However, the apex court later dismissed all review petitions in the Rafale deal case. After the Rafale case, Gandhi accused PM Modi and his government of favoring industrialists' interests over those of marginalized groups.\n\n\"Today, I want to ask from Telangana soil, he must declare how much money they have taken from Ambani, Adani? Was there a deal? Why did you stop abusing Ambani and Adani overnight?\" the prime minister asked. \"Zaroor daal mein kucchh kaala hai (something is wrong). You abused them for five years and then it stopped overnight?\" he added. He also accused the Congress of undermining India's potential and ruining its economy, particularly in the agriculture and textile sectors.\n\nPM Modi further claimed that the Congress and the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) had leased Hyderabad to Asaduddin Owaisi-led AIMIM. He criticized the two parties for prioritizing family interests over national interests, while the BJP upholds a \"nation first\" principle. He claimed that despite the BRS frequently accusing the Congress of cash-for-votes schemes, it did not launch any investigations when it held power. He alleged both parties are linked by corruption, appeasement politics, and ineffective governance.\n\nMeanwhile, on Tuesday, Gandhi brought up the industrialists' charge, alleging that PM Modi wanted to hand over \"Jal, Jungle, Jameen\" (water, forest, land) belonging to tribals to industrialists. \"PM wants to handover tribals' 'Jal, Jungle, Jameen' to 14-15 industrialists...he made 22 people billionaires in his 10-year tenure...We will make crores of lakhpatis if voted to power,\" he said.

Neither candidate presented any evidence for their claims.\n\nThe comments from Modi seek to counter Gandhi's long-running criticism about what he says are Modi's ties to the country's two richest men, weeks into the election where differences over growth, poverty and unemployment are key themes.\n\nBut the ramped up rhetoric could also be part of a change of tack from Modi.\n\nA lower turnout so far in the six-week vote has rattled Modi's campaign managers and called into question whether his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies can achieve the landslide predicted by opinion polls a month ago, BJP leaders and political analysts have told Reuters.\n\nThey say the lack of momentum seems to have prompted Modi to change the thrust of his campaign speeches, focusing on economic growth before the first phase of voting to now attacking rivals as pro-Muslims and in other ways in bid to fire up the party's hardline base.\n\n\"For five years you abused Ambani-Adani and now suddenly you have stopped. Meaning, you have accepted truckloads of some illegal funds. You'll have to answer to the country about this,\" Modi said at an election rally.\n\nCONGLOMERATES\n\nGandhi responded hours later by asking Modi whether he was \"slightly scared\" and said he should send financial crime investigators to do a full inquiry immediately.\n\n\"For the first time you have spoken in public about Adani and Ambani. Is it your personal experience that you know they give money in trucks?\" Gandhi said in a video message. \"I want to repeat to the nation that the amount of money Modi has given to them, we are going to give the same amount to India's poor.\"\n\nModi's party did not immediately respond to Gandhi's remarks.\n\nGandhi has for years attacked Modi saying he works for the interests of industrialists such as Ambani and Adani and that inequality between the rich and poor has worsened during his 10-year term, charges the government denies.\n\nModi has previously called allegations of promoting Adani and Ambani monopolies \"unfounded\" and said such accusations do damage to the Congress party.\n\nAmbani, Asia's richest man, is chairman of the oil-to-media conglomerate Reliance Industries while Adani, Asia's second richest, is chairman of the power-to-ports conglomerate Adani Group.\n\nBoth industrialists are from Modi's home state Gujarat, where their businesses have large operations and have branched out to other Indian states including those ruled by opposition parties and also overseas.\n\nResearch group World Inequality Lab said in a recent report that India's richest 1% citizens owned 40.1% of the country's wealth as of 2023, the highest since 1961.\n\nIndia's seven-phase election began on April 19 and ends on June 1.

Modi claimed that a former chief advisor of the family had told him this.\n\nSuspecting that the Congress would lock the doors of Ayodhya's Ram Mandir if it came to power, Modi asked the people of Telangana whether they were going to \"finish\" the Congress in the state, before it could \"finish\" the state.\n\nAddressing a public meeting held in Vemulawada on Wednesday morning, Modi said that Congress is the \"mother of all problems\" facing the country. He claimed that the grand old party has destroyed all the capabilities of the country, its economy, agriculture and textiles. Modi also wondered as to what was the \"deal\" struck between the Congress, Ambani and Adani, that Congress MP Rahul Gandhi suddenly stopped criticising the business tycoons, after taking bad about them day-in and day-out for the past five years.\n\nModi's claim on the Rahul Gandhi-Adani-Ambani nexus is an interesting, as no one has so far said it. On the contrary, Modi is often accused of helping Adani grow exponentially over the years.\n\n\"After the Rafale issue was grounded, the Yuvraj has been chanting the mantra of Adani and Ambani, persistently been criticising them during the last five years. But as soon as the elections were announced, he became silent. What was the bargain made in the dark of the night that he stopped abusing them? How many bags of black money did the Congress receive? The Congress should answer the people,\" Modi said.\n\nStating that the previous Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) BRS government and Congress now are part of the \"same corruption syndicate\", Modi questioned why the Congress has not conducted an inquiry into the Kaleswaram lift irrigation project in Telangana after claiming it is ridden with corruption. Modi also raked up the infamous 'cash-for-vote' scam involving present Chief minister A Revanth Reddy, alleging that both parties are supporting each other.\n\nWithout naming anyone, Modi said, \"Collections made by 'RR' tax in a few days, collected by 'R' in Telangana that will be sent to 'R' in Delhi, has surpassed the life-time collections made by the 'RRR' movie (Rs 1,000 crore)till now,\". The dig was seemingly at Revanth Reddy. Accusing both the BRS and Congress of playing appeasement politics by helping the All India Majilis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMM), Modi said that it was only the BJP which is challenging MIM in Hyderabad.\n\n\"Just like the BRS which destroyed the dreams of the people of Telangana, Congress has done the same with the people of the country. After the independence there was hope on Congress, but they chose the path of 'family-first' politics,\" Modi said.\n\n\"They said let the country sink, but that'll make no difference to their family. Congress insulted PV Narasimha Rao by not allowing his mortal remains inside the Congress headquarters. But NDA gave Bharat Ratna to Narasimha Rao,\" Modi said, reminiscing his conversation with the three generations of the former prime minister's family members, whom he had met on Wednesday night.\n\nModi also alleged that Congress was against SC categorisation, which would have helped the Dalit Madiga community in Telangana prosper.

Kaale dhan ke kitne bore bhar-bhar ke rupiye maare hain (How much money has been lifted from Ambani-Adani? How many bags full of black money have come?)\"\n\nIf you thought Rahul Gandhi has launched yet another attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Congress leader's pet charge of crony capitalism, think again.\n\nThe man behind the Ambani-Adani jibe is, hold your breath, Narendra Modi.\n\nIn a stunning and intriguing turn of events, Modi on Wednesday questioned why the Congress's \"shehzada\" (prince) had stopped \"abusing\" the two leading industrialists and suggested a huge payoff, but the claim appeared to belie facts.\n\n\"Paanch saal tak Ambani-Adani ko gaali diya aur raato-raat galiyan band ho gayi. Matlab koi na koi chori ka maal, tempo bhar bhar ke aapne paaya hai (For five years you abused Ambani-Adani and suddenly the diatribes stopped overnight. It means you have received tempo-loads of looted money),\" Modi told a rally in Telangana's Karimnagar.\n\nThe Telegraph tried to reach out to the Ambani and Adani concerns for a reaction to Modi's comments. Neither company could be reached.\n\nHours after Modi's attack, Rahul put out a video statement, caustically daring him to send the \"CBI-ED\" to \"Ambani-Adani\" and \"conduct a thorough inquiry at the earliest and not be scared\".\n\n\"Namaskar Modiji.. have you got scared?\" the Congress leader asked.\n\n\"Normally you speak about Ambani-Adani behind closed doors. This is for the first time you have spoken about them in public. You also know that they distribute money in tempos. Is it from personal experience?\" Rahul asked. \"The country knows who is the 'driver' and the 'helper' of the BJP's tempo of corruption,\" Rahul added.\n\nThe Congress's X handle put out a collage of video clips of Rahul's recent election speeches, as latest as Tuesday in Jharkhand, to call out Modi's \"lie\".\n\n\"Aapko nirnay lena hai Modiji Adnaiji ki sarkar banani hai ya phir kisano ki banani hai, garibon ki banani hai (You have to decide, you want a government of Modi and Adani or that of farmers and the poor),\" Rahul is heard saying in the video clip. He had addressed two poll rallies in Jharkhand's Chaibasa and Lohardaga on Tuesday and made the \"Modi-Adani\" reference at both places.\n\nFour days ago in an Instagram reel on the Agniveer scheme, Rahul had said: \"This scheme is harming the youth of the country while billionaires like Adani are benefitting. A 75-year-old man is retiring 22-year-olds to help his friends.\"\n\nCongress media in-charge Jairam Ramesh pointed to Rahul's unrelenting attacks on what he alleges is a \"nexus\" between Adani-Ambani and Modi.\n\n\"Since April 3, 2024, Rahul Gandhi has mentioned Adani 103 times and Ambani more than 30 times in his speeches. A JPC will be formed as soon as the INDIA bloc comes to power on June 4, 2024, to investigate the Modani scam -- which has an estimated price tag of at least \u20b92 lakh crore,\" he said.\n\nRamesh added that the BJP was sensing defeat and the \"Prime Minister is now spooked even by his own shadow\".\n\nThis was the first time Modi had publicly referred to \"Ambani-Adani\" in the political context in the past five years. He had never responded to Rahul's almost obsessive attack on him using the coinage \"Ambani-Adani ki sarkar\".\n\nThe shift in the BJP talisman's campaign after polling in more than half of the 543 Lok Sabha seats had been completed left even sections of BJP leaders puzzled. An old-timer said he was unable to understand the \"strategy behind\" the top leader doing so.\n\nModi, however, dropped the line of attack in his subsequent two rallies in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, focusing instead on exploiting Congress leader Sam Pitroda's contentious remarks.\n\nWhile referring to \"Ambani-Adani\", Modi's body language was aggressive and he appeared unusually agitated. \"Kya sauda hua hai? Aapne raato raat Ambani-Adani inko gaali dena bandh kar diya. Zarur daal mein kuch kaala hai (What deal has been struck? You have stopped abusing Ambani-Adani overnight. There is certainly something fishy),\" he said.\n\nThe Congress claimed the Prime Minister had himself publicly acknowledged what Rahul has been repeatedly saying -- that the two corporate honchos \"have black money\". \"Rahul Gandhi has compelled Prime Minister Narendra Modi to talk about this corruption,\" Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said.", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "j_p_yadav@telegraphindia.com", "name": "J.P.

What deal has been arrived at, that abusing Ambani-Adani has stopped overnight,\" he asked. \"Certainly something is fishy,\" he said.\n\nAddressing the rally after the third phase of general elections, Modi said the fuse of Congress is blown over. \"Congress leaders were searching for seats using magnifying glass. The BJP and NDA were marching toward victory,\" he said.\n\nAttacking the Congress and K Chandrasekhar Rao-led BRS in Telangana, Modi said while the BJP believes in the 'nation first' principle, for the two parties it is 'family first'. The BRS and Congress openly criticise each other on corruption, but it is a common factor between these parties. Hence they need to be defeated.

Are you happy with Ram temple? Did you feel happy or not? But, Congress is unhappy and angry. The Congress party wants to put a lock to the Ram temple,\" he said.\n\n\"This revelation was made by the former adviser of the royal family of Congress,\" he said. He quoted the adviser as having said that the Congress \"shehzada\" was planning to stop the construction of Ram temple by reversing the court's decision.

'5 industrialists', 'Ambani', ' Adani\"... But since the elections were declared, they stopped abusing Ambani, Adani...\"\n\nFor what? I want to ask the Shehzadeys of Congress, how much black money did they receive from Adani, Ambani? How much did the Congress party 'receive' from these industrialists for the elections?', the Prime Minister asked.\n\nRahul Gandhi often accuses Modi and his administration of prioritizing the interests of industrialists over those of marginalized communities.\n\n1) The only thing that binds Congress and BRS is corruption. They both follow the zero governance model. We have to save Telangana from these corrupt parties. \"\n\n2) Since the Congress came to power, the development of Telangana has been at a standstill. Where is people's hard-earned money going? They are looting you under the guise of 'RR tax', half of which goes to 'R' in Hyderabad and half goes to 'R' in Delhi. \"\n\n3) No one knows better than Telangana how the Congress is misleading people. Congress had promised to eliminate farm loans. Now, they are delaying the process until after the Lok Sabha elections so that they can fulfill this pending promise. They swear on our Gods to keep their promises, while on the other hand, they belittle Sanatana Dharma. \"\n\n4) Let me explain this to you in a different way. Imagine 10 farmers gathered in Warangal, they call someone who could find out where there is water in the earth. Now 10 farmers asked that they want to extract water from the ground to water 10 fields, he said it will have to go down 100 meters, and pipes will have to be installed, then the water will come out, and then one farmer asked said to install a 10 meter pipe in my field, another said, install a 10 meter pipe in my field. So they all said if we put 10-10 meter pipes in our 10 fields, that would be 100 meters. Tell me, will any water come out of this?\"\n\n5) No one can forget the sins of the Congress central government 10 years ago. Every few days, a scam worth thousands of crores of rupees was exposed. There have been serial bomb explosions in major cities across the country...\"\n\n6) \"This time the INDI alliance has come up with a formula of 5 years 17 hours. Imagine what will happen to the country if it gets power. Every year there is a new Prime Minister, a second year, a second Prime Minister, a third year, and third Prime Minister?\n\n7) \"Today, before you is the dream of 'Viksit India' and 'Viksit Telangana'... There is instability, unrest and crisis all over the world. In such a situation, can the command of the country be given to the wrong hands? This is why the country says: \"Phir ek baar Modi sarkaar\".\n\n8) Two things became clear after the third phase of the elections: First: The public is fast forwarding the NDA's 'Vijay Rath'. Second, Congress is searching its seats with magnifying glasses. \"\n\n9) After seeing your enthusiasm in Telangana, today I can say one more thing, the usual magnifying glass of the Congress will not be enough to find its seats in the fourth phase. Congress will have to use the microscope to find its seats...\"\n\n10) The Constitution, as conceived and drafted by Babasaheb Ambedkar, is against the idea of reservation on the basis of religion.

For 10 years, Narendra Modi ji gave the country's airports, ports, infrastructure, defence industry and all to Adani,\" the Wayanad MP alleged at an election rally in Medak parliamentary constituency of Telangana.\n\nFull coverage of Lok Sabha Election 2024\n\nGandhi's remarks came a day after Modi at a poll rally in Telangana asked why he had stopped \"abusing\" Adani and Ambani in his attacks and whether his party received \"maal\" (money) from them in return. Hours later, however, the Congress leader hit back and dared Modi to initiate a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to find whether businessmen Adani and Ambani sent black money to his party.\n\nContinuing his tirade against the PM on Thursday, Gandhi alleged that the country's wealth worth lakhs of crores of rupees had gone into the hands of 22 billionaires. \"If the Congress comes to power at the Centre, we shall work out a scheme for eradication of poverty in the country. We shall prepare the list of poor people and \u20b91 lakh would be deposited in the bank accounts of a woman in every poor family. All these days, Modi distributed the country's wealth among the corporates. Now, we shall distribute money among the poor,\" he added.\n\nHe also reiterated his allegation that the Modi government would abolish reservations if it returned to power for the third time. \"The BJP wants to abolish reservations while Congress wants to increase them beyond 50 per cent. The Modi government is privatising public sector undertakings (PSUs) as part of the conspiracy to abolish reservations. The BJP's intention is to privatize everything and abolish reservations,\" he alleged.\n\nStating that the Constitution of India was in deep crisis, Gandhi said the only way to protect the Constitution was to bring the INDIA bloc to power. \"Indian Constitution is not a mere book. It is the heartbeat of the people. It has given powers to the people. We shall go to any extent to protect this Constitution,\" he said.\n\nThe Congress MP also assured the people that the party would implement all the guarantees it had promised in its election manifesto. \"We shall take up caste surveys to identify the genuine figures of population of SCs, STs and OBCs, so that they would get due representation in all fields in proportion to their population,\" he said.\n\nAddressing a separate rally at Saroornagar in Hyderabad, Rahul Gandhi said millions of educated youth had remained unemployed during the Modi regime. \"We are coming out with the slogan of \"first job pucca.\" After coming to power after June 4, we shall fill up 30 lakh government jobs by August 15,\" he said.\n\nHe also promised that the Congress would waive crop loans, ensure minimum support price for the agriculture produce and enhance the wages of labourers to \u20b9400 per day under employment guarantee scheme.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com",

Gandhi has consistently questioned Modi's links with the tycoons and criticized policies he says have favored wealthy businessmen over the poor, resulting in widening inequality levels in the country. At a campaign rally on Tuesday in Jharkhand, Gandhi said the media's attention is focused on Ambani, Adani and Modi, but not the poor.\n\nThe prime minister, who is seeking a third term in elections that run until June 1, rarely mentions the billionaires names in his speeches. On Wednesday, he alleged they had been funding Gandhi and the Congress party since the elections began.\n\n\"How many sacks of black money has he received?\" Modi asked. \"What deal has been struck? Overnight you have stopped cussing out Adani and Ambani. There is definitely something fishy.\"\n\nSanjeev Singh, chief national media coordinator of the Congress party, dismissed Modi's comments, saying by phone that the prime minister \"thinks everyone is as corrupt as him.\" Representatives for Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd. and Adani Group weren't available to comment when contacted by Bloomberg News.\n\nElection funding in India is notoriously opaque. Only a small percentage is declared publicly, according to election watchdogs, with the vast amount unaccounted for and labeled black money. In April, the Election Commission of India said it confiscated 46.5 billion rupees ($557 million) of illicit money and goods in the run up to voting.\n\nModi's comments come a day after India held the third phase of its seven-phase elections. The prime minister and officials from his Bharatiya Janata Party have ramped up attacks on the opposition that have drawn condemnation for being discriminatory. At a rally last month, Modi told supporters that if voted to power, the Congress party would redistribute wealth to Muslims and \"infiltrators.\"\n\nThis week, the BJP in Karnataka province posted an animated video that showed the Congress party favoring Muslims over other minority groups.

I ask from the land of Telangana, let the Shehzada (referring to Rahul Gandhi) declare, how much has been received from Ambani-Adani. Have truckloads of currency notes reached the Congress?

Allies are no longer allies...! After the completion of three phases of elections, today the Prime Minister has started targeting his own allies.

Ever since his Rafale case got grounded, he has started a new chant. For the last five years, he used to chant the names of five industrialists. Then, he slowly started talking about Ambani-Adani. But, since the elections have been declared, he has stopped criticising Ambani and Adani. Today I want to ask the people of Telangana whether this prince can declare how much wealth he has collected from Ambani-Adani for this election? How many sacks of black money have you taken? Has a van full of notes reached for Congress? What's the deal, that you stopped criticizing Adani-Ambani overnight? There is definitely something fishy here.\"\n\nIs this true?: Team WebQoof went through Rahul Gandhi's speeches from 20 April to the present and found multiple mentions of Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani, hence, the Prime Minister's claim is false.\n\nHow did we find out?: We went on Congress's and Rahul Gandhi's YouTube page and started locating speeches from 19 April to the present.\n\n19 April was the first phase of polling for the Lok Sabha elections.\n\nFollowing are instances in the given timeline where we found Rahul Gandhi talking about the two industrialists:\n\nInstance 1: On 20 April, Rahul Gandhi addressed a public meeting in Bhagalpur in Bihar. At 5:47 minutes of the speech, Gandhi mentioned 'Ambani-Adani.' He spoke about how the two industrialists have enormous wealth, whereas the poor, farmers and labourers do not have a sizeable income. He attributed the Ambani-Adani's wealth to PM Modi.\n\nInstance 2: On the same date, Rahul Gandhi also addressed a meeting in Amroha, Uttar Pradesh. At 1:23 minutes into the speech, Rahul Gandhi mentions how Gautam Adani's group has control over airports, ports, mines, electricity, defence industry of the country.\n\nInstance 3: On 24 April, addressing a rally in Solapur, Maharashtra, Gandhi spoke against the two industrialists in his speech. At 6:36 minutes, he talks about how Gautam Adani and the poor people of the country pay the same amount of the Goods and Service Tax (GST), which was introduced by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\nInstance 4: On 26 April, Rahul Gandhi addressed a public meeting in Bijapur, Karnataka. At 12:47 minutes, Rahul Gandhi said that Prime Minister Modi has helped the rich get richer by handing over all the contracts of arenas like airports, ports, solar power to the \"people like Adani.\"\n\nInstance 5: On 28 April, Rahul Gandhi presented a speech in Kendrapara, Odisha where he also spoke about Adani. At 10:45 minutes, he mentions how Adani was given control and money of the people of Odisha. This was done by PM Modi and Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik, he said.\n\nInstance 6: On the same date, Gandhi spoke to the public in Daman and Diu. He mentioned the industrialist in his speech even there. At 14:32 minutes, he mentions that the government only wants to help a handful of rich people of the country. He said, \"They want Adani's name to be put up in the beautiful beaches and locations of Daman and Diu.\"\n\nInstance 7: On 29 April, Rahul Gandhi addressed a gathering in Patan, Gujarat. At 9:18 minutes, he mentions that people like Adani and Ambani own as much wealth as the 70 crore Indians.\n\nInstance 8: On the same date, Gandhi also addressed a rally at Bilaspur in Chhattisgarh. Around 18:25 minutes, he said the BJP's ideology is only to help a handful of people. He went on to say that their ideology is to give people like Ambani-Adani the wealth, land and forests of this country.\n\nInstance 9: On 30 April, Gandhi spoke at a rally in Bhind, Madhya Pradesh (MP). Around 24:48 minutes of the speech, he mentioned how only two to three \"arabpatis\" have access to all the arenas in the country. Gandhi said that Adani owns railways, solar power, roads and electricity. He added that the farm laws were enacted for people like Ambani-Adani.\n\nInstance 10: On 2 May, Rahul Gandhi spoke to the people in Shivamogga, Karnataka. Around 36:44 minutes of his speech, Gandhi said the government took the people's money and filled the pockets of few people like Ambani and Adani.\n\nInstance 11: The Congress leader addressed a public meeting in Pune, Maharashtra on 3 May. Around 11:03 minutes, he mentioned the the media in the country is controlled by Gautam Adani hence, it does not show issues such as farmers suicides, inflation and plight of agriculture in the country. Around 12:39 minutes, Gandhi said that the media is not of the people, it is Adani's and hence, they do whatever the industrialists say.\n\nInstance 12: On 5 May, Rahul Gandhi addressed a crowd at Gadwal in Telangana. Around 31:33 minutes, Gandhi mentioned that in the last ten years of BJP's governance, whatever PM Modi has done is for the \"arabpatis\" of the country. Mentioning Adani, he said that it is for people like him that PM Modi has let go of their loans and given them control over the airports and industries of the country. He drew a comparison and mentioned that the BJP government does not let go of the loans of farmers and labourers.\n\nInstance 13: Addressing a rally in Khargone, Madhya Pradesh on 6 May, Rahul Gandhi did mention Adani and Ambani in his speech. Around 15:13 minutes, he said that if the Constitution was abolished then all the rights the people will disappear and destroyed. He said, \"Your land, your water, your forests, reservation, public sector, everything will disappear and India will be ruled by 22-25 people.\" He mentioned people like Adani have eyes are on your land, forest and water and want them to be handed over to them.\n\nInstance 14: On 7 May, Rahul Gandhi spoke at two rallies in Chaibasa and Gumla in Jharkhand.\n\nAt 25:50 minutes of his speech at Chaibasa, Rahul said, \"The Constitution gives you reservation, jobs, education to your children and treatment to your children. If this disappears, then, the tribals will be left with nowhere.\" He mentioned that Dalits and backward classes will have no place, everything will go into the hands of a few billionaires such as Adani, who had his eyes on the people's forests, land and water.\n\nIn the speech delivered in Gumla, around 24:14 minutes, Rahul Gandhi said, \"BJP says you are a forest dweller and then they give the entire forest to Adani.\"\n\nCongress's response to PM Modi's claim: Hours after PM Modi's statement, Rahul Gandhi posted a video on his social media platforms asking the Prime Minister how he knew about black money being transported in vans and whether he had any personal experience with it. He also told the PM that he should send the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to look into the matter.\n\nOn their YouTube page, Congress also posted a timeline video of Gandhi's speeches from May where he had mentioned Adani and Ambani, as well.\n\nConclusion: PM Modi's claim that Rahul Gandhi had stopped mentioning Ambani-Adani's name in his speeches is false.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adani_Group", "type":

How much did Congress take from them? | News from India - ExBulletin", "body": "You would have seen that the Shahzada of the Congress, for the last five years, has been repeating this. Since his argument over the Rafale was grounded, he started repeating that first, he talked about five industrialists, then Ambani-Adani, Ambani-Adani, Ambani-Adani. But even since the elections were announced, they have stopped abusing both. I want to ask Telangana public, shahzada should declare how much did they take from Ambani-Adani? How much black money was taken? Have tempos full of cash reached Congress? What agreement was reached? Why did you stop abusing Ambani-Adani overnight? There must be something wrong, he said in Telangana.\n\nRahul has consistently attacked the Center and the Prime Minister for policies which he claims are intended to specifically benefit these industrialists. And Adani-Ambani is a recurring theme in his campaign speeches. In fact, he mentioned it yesterday in his campaign speeches. Addressing an election rally in Jharkhand on Tuesday, Rahul spoke about the need for greater tribal representation and added: The BJP says you are vanvasi and they are giving all the forest lands to Adani.\n\nWhatever he does, it's for billionaires. He has 22-25 friends like Adani and Ambani and all the work done is for them only. The land is theirs, the forest is theirs, the media is theirs, the infrastructure is theirs, the flyovers are theirs, the gasoline is theirs, everything is theirs. Dalits, tribals, those from backward communities used to get reservations in public sector, now they are privatizing everything And they are openly saying that railways will also be privatized, this is your asset sector, the railways, the roads, the airlifts, they are yours... And not the Adanis. . He gives her everything.\n\n\"Media people are here, they are talking about tribes, they will never show Ambani's marriage 24 hours a day,\" he said.\n\nResponding to Modi's comments, Praveen Chakravarty of the Congress said, \"It is clear that Prime Minister Modi is pinched and feeling the heat of Rahul Gandhis who is constantly exposing his Adani-Ambani nexus at the expense of the common person and the nation.\n\nAddressing a large gathering of BJP cadres, Modi also attacked the Congress over former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao. \"BJP's policy is Nation First and it is working on this policy, while parties like Congress and BRS have a policy that puts family first. By the family, for the family and from the family, this is their policy. This family oriented policy is also the reason why Congress neglected and disrespected PV Narasimha Rao. They even denied having authorized his body to be deposited in the congressional office. NDA has respect for PV Narasimha Rao and awarded him the Bharat Ratna.\n\nModi said that after the third phase of voting on Monday, the third fuse of the INDI alliance had also burst.\n\nModi is in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh all day today. In the morning, before the public meeting, he visited the Sri Raja Rajeshwara Swamy temple in Karimnagar. After addressing Karimnagar, Modi visited Warangal. Later, he will fly to Rajampet in Andhra Pradesh to address a public meeting.

Gandhi on Wednesday mocked Modi's comments and asked him to order a federal investigation against the firms.\n\nThis is the first time in this general elections campaign that the PM has publicly named Ambani and Adani, two of India's richest industrialists who run vast conglomerates spanning several sectors.\n\nRahul Gandhi to Modi: Are you talking from personal experience?\n\nHours after Modi's barb, Rahul Gandhi hit back and said, \"Normally, you (Modi) take the name of Ambani-Adani behind closed doors. You took their names in public for the first time,\" Gandhi said. \"You also know that Adani-Ambani send money in tempo? Is this your personal experience? Do one thing: send CBI and ED to them. Get a thorough investigation done, don't panic.\"\n\nGandhi also took the opportunity to say, \"The amount of money that PM Modi has given to them, we will give the same to the poor in India. We will make many 'lakhpatis' with the 'Mahalakshmi Yojna' and 'Pehli Naukri Yojana'\"\n\nSam Pitroda sparks another row, quits party post\n\nTrust Sam Pitroda, the Chicago-based inventor, entrepreneur, development thinker, and policy maker, to create a controversy when there is none. This time, he referred to Chinese, Arabs, white people and Africans to describe the looks of people in India's east, west, north and south, respectively.\n\nPitroda's comments in an online interaction - while trying to describe the importance of India's diversity - triggered a political row, with PM Modi attacking Rahul Gandhi for disrespecting the countrymen on the basis of their skin colour. Late in the evening, Pitroda, a friend of late PM Rajiv Gandhi, resigned from his position as the overseas cell chief of the Congress.\n\nThis is not the first time the outspoken Pitroda has shot from the hip. Last month, he spoke about the merits of inheritance tax, sparking a whole new debate and allowing PM Modi and other BJP leaders to campaign that the Congress plans to take away people's wealth. During the last elections, Pitroda, when asked about the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, retorted, \"Hua to hua!\".\n\n\"We have survived 70-75 years, in a very happy environment where people could live together, leaving aside a few fights here and there. We could hold the country together, as diverse as India - where people in the east look like Chinese, people in the west look like Arabs, people in the north look like, maybe white, and people in the south look like Africans. It doesn't matter. We are all brothers and sisters,\" Pitroda told The Statesman in a web interview.\n\nAlmost immediately, the controversy began.\n\nAddressing a rally in Warangal, Modi attacked Rahul Gandhi over Pitroda's comments. \"Shehzade (or prince, a reference to Rahul Gandhi), you will have to answer. My country will not tolerate the disrespect of my countrymen on the basis of their skin colour. Modi will never tolerate this,\" he said.\n\nAkhilesh hits out at BSP over Akash Anand's removal\n\nSamajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Wednesday reacted to Mayawati's decision to remove her nephew Akash Anand as her successor and as national coordinator of the party till he becomes 'politically mature'.\n\nYadav described the BSP chief's announcement as an indication that her party is not winning a single seat as its traditional voters are shifting towards the INDI Alliance \"to save the Consitution and reservation\".\n\n\"Whatever step the BSP has taken to bring about a big change in its organisation is an internal matter of the party,\" Akhilesh Yadav wrote on X. \"Actually, the real reason behind this is that BSP is not seen winning even a single seat because most of the traditional supporters of BSP are also voting for INDIA bloc this time to save the Constitution and reservation.\"\n\nMayawati, however, didn't take Yadav's criticism lightly. Responding to the criticism by SP, Mayawati said that the Akhilesh Yadav-led party should not worry about the happenings in her party and rather concentrate on the Yadav candidates fielded by them, who, she claimed, are in a very bad condition. She also accused the Samajwadi Party of being \"extremely anti-Dalit\".\n\nBengaluru cops summon Nadda and BJP's IT head\n\nThe Bengaluru Police has summoned BJP president JP Nadda and the party's IT cell head Amit Malviya in connection with an animated clip posted by the party's state unit that showed the Congress appeasing Muslims at the cost of other faiths and castes, people aware of the matter said on Wednesday.\n\nThe police summon came against the backdrop of the Congress's Ramesh Babu filing a case against Nadda, Malviya and the BJP's Karnataka chief BY Vijayendra under the Indian Penal Code's (IPC) Section 505(2) (statement conducing public mischief), and the Representation of People Act's Section 125 (promoting enmity between classes).", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Pitroda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sam Pitroda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adani_Group", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adani Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhirubhai_Ambani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dhirubhai Ambani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mahatma Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahujan_Samaj_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bahujan Samaj Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshmi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lakshmi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajiv_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rajiv Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayawati", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayawati"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhilesh_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Akhilesh Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anand,_Gujarat", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anand, Gujarat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anand, Gujarat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Nadda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

In an interview with a national daily, Sharad Pawar said many regional parties would move closer to the Congress and some may merge, and Rahul Gandhi's acceptance (as a PM candidate) was more than that of Morarji Desai in 1977. PM Narendra Modi asked Rahul about his silence on 'Adani and Ambani', and demanded to know about a 'black money' deal to remain silent during the election period after levelling serious allegations against the two major corporate entities. This gave the Congress an opportunity to ask Modi what had gone wrong with his friendship with the particular industrialists. It produced footage of Rahul calling out Adani, Ambani and the PM in the election campaign. The duel went on.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rahul's party associate Sam Pitroda came under severe attack from Modi for 'insulting Indians based on the colour of their skin'. In a podcast, Pitroda talked about India's unity in diversity by describing how Indians looked different (like Chinese, Africans, Whites etc), and yet remained united. Like the previous incidents involving Pitroda, the Congress distanced itself from his statement, calling it unfortunate.\n\nHalfway through the elections, the BJP seemed to have got yet another issue to corner Gandhi, who according to Pawar's assessment, could be the next PM, if the Opposition bloc was voted to power. \"He (Rahul) enjoys substantial support within his own party -- unlike (Morarji) Desai. People feel he sincerely wants to bring together like-minded people,\" Pawar told Indian Express. However, on his party's merger, Pawar said NCP was no different from the Congress, and the decision, if any, would not be taken without consulting colleagues.\n\nSome saw Pawar's statement as a bid to bond further with the Congress, which has been generous in seat sharing with allies, especially the new ones such as Shiv Sena (UBT), this election. Some said the veteran has had the idea of merger on his mind for a long time, and hence was testing the waters before taking a dip. Some said the statement had given a further push to the PM's 'Mission Rahul's Demolition', because the aftereffects were seen in Modi's rally speech later in the day. It cemented the foundation for Rahul versus Modi battle further.\n\nModi's inquiry on Rahul's silence on Adani and Ambani made big news on Wednesday. Because, in his attempt to corner Rahul, the PM also put Adani and Ambani in the dock, seeking answers about the financial deal to buy the Congress leader's silence. The Congress said Rahul had mentioned Adani 103 times and Ambani over 30 times since April 2024.\n\nCongress president Mallikarjun Kharge said the PM's attack on his 'friends' after three rounds of polling was an indication that Modi's throne was shaking. Some Opposition leaders asked the PM to institute an inquiry by Central agencies if he had any evidence to prove the deal. Modi's attack on 'PM-in-waiting' over the Adani-Ambani row has raised more questions than answers.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morarji_Desai", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morarji Desai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharad_Pawar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sharad Pawar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Pitroda", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sam Pitroda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adani_Group", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adani Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhirubhai_Ambani", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dhirubhai Ambani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Indian_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Indian Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mahatma Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiv_Sena_(Uddhav_Balasaheb_Thackeray)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallikarjun_Kharge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mallikarjun Kharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_Congress_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nationalist Congress Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/may/Statement-day_d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548578", "eventUri": "eng-9548578", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Mr Modi arrived in Delhi for his first inauguration as prime minister in 2014 aboard a private jet emblazoned with Mr Adanis' logo, and his face accompanied front-page advertisements announcing the official launch of the company. Mr. Ambanis' telecommunications company, Jio, which has since quickly become a major company. player in a highly lucrative and competitive market.\n\nMr Modi's latest attack on the Congress party's Rahul Gandhi has sparked a debate over the sudden shift in emphasis in the prime minister's campaign speeches, with analysts speculating that his party was doubtful of his performance until now electoral.\n\nAddressing a rally in the southern state of Telangana on Wednesday, Mr Modi accused Mr Gandhi of cutting a deal with billionaires.\n\nFor five years the Congress prince abused Ambani and Adani and now suddenly you have stopped. This means you accepted truckloads of illegal funds. You will have to answer to the country,\" Mr. Modisaid.\n\nHe smelled something fishy as the Congress party's attack on the two billionaires had stopped overnight, the Prime Minister added.\n\nMr Gandhi responded in a video statement saying Mr Modi was nervous about how the election would go.\n\nHe challenged the Prime Minister to send investigative agencies to prove his allegations.\n\nModiji, are you nervous? Normally you talk about Adani and Ambani in closed rooms. This is the first time you are saying their names in public, Mr Gandhi said. You even know that they send money by truck, is this your personal experience?\n\nSend the CBI and ED to them and have a thorough investigation carried out as soon as possible, he said, referring to the federal agencies of the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate, which Mr. Modi's government has both been accused of using it as a weapon against opposition leaders.\n\n\"I want to repeat to the nation that the amount of money Modi gave them, we are going to give the same amount to the poor of India,\" he added, referring to Mr Ambani and Mr Adani .\n\nMr Modi's attack came after Mr Gandhis regularly criticized the prime minister and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party for allegedly having close ties to business tycoons and championing policies favoring the rich over the poor.\n\nMr. Ambani and Mr. Adani come from Mr. Modi's home state of Gujarat, where their multinational companies have significant business operations.\n\nThe Prime Minister, in power for a decade and seeking a third consecutive term, had so far refrained from mentioning their names during the electoral campaign.\n\nNeither industry has publicly said who they might support in the current election, and their companies have not responded to requests for comment.\n\nPolitical analysts said Mr Modi's attack to link Mr Gandhi to billionaires was an attempt to confuse voters. It also showed concern over low voter turnout, they said.\n\nAll three phases of voting so far have seen lower turnout than the previous elections in 2019, calling into question opinion polls that predicted a landslide victory for the ruling party. The election takes place in seven voting phases, the results of which must be announced on June 4.\n\nApoorvanand, professor at Delhi University, said The independent that Mr Modi's baseless allegations against Mr Gandhi were aimed at shaping a narrative.\n\nMr. Modi creates a talking point to confuse Mr. Gandhis constituency so that people forget the facts and get caught up in the narrative. This is aimed at directing the media's incessant attacks on the Congress party for clarification, he said.\n\nThe Indian Prime Minister is definitely anxious and desperate because he has started loving power and giving himself the illusion that he will win. He fears losing power unlike other Democrats, he added.\n\nBut he does not believe Mr Modi made the comment to distance himself from business tycoons when he came to power on the shoulders of these

Instead it has spoken up on economic issues, often attacking the Congress manifesto over populist socialism of redistribution of wealth and a potential inheritance tax, among others.\n\nThis steering away of the election narrative away from the traditional strengths of the BJP, often seen by many as ways to \"communalise\" the elections, is not totally deliberate or a choice of the ruling saffron party as much as a natural twist, and the Congress, perhaps without so much of either a plan or much agency, finds its election ideas at the centre of the poll fight. Among them is the issue of the duo of Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani.\n\nOf course, there is a parallel track on that -- with references replete with dehumanising analogies of a \"set of people\" who have too many children, or illegal immigrants, or attempts to snatch the \"mangalsutras\" of Hindu women, or stoking fears of one alliance keen to impose the Sharia law in India, or being supported by Pakistan, among others -- but somehow, there is a clear lack of traction to such issues.\n\nHence, the organic shift to issues more along the lines of money.\n\nHistorically, Indians have loved the idea of a double-name team to represent a broader vision, from Bollywood scriptwriters and music composer teams to a symbolic phrase to represent infinite wealth -- and interestingly, while it was \"Tata-Birla\" for decades, in the New Age India, especially in the last decade or more, it is Ambani-Adani, who together as an alliterative phrase represent not just extraordinary wealth or rise in success but also proximity to supreme political power.\n\nRahul Gandhi has used the fact that, like Prime Minister Modi and home minister Amit Shah, the two most powerful icons of India, the two wealthiest icons of India, Mukesh Ambani of Reliance and Gautam Adani of the Adani Group, also hail from Gujarat, to constantly create an image of some kind of nexus or cosy comfort. But Mr Modi has refused to even acknowledge the two businessmen so far.\n\nIn his dramatic style, Mr Modi chose to hit back to demonstrate that he has no reason to play this line of attack by Mr Gandhi on the backfoot, and instead, openly asked the people of India why the Congress had gone silent on the Ambani-Adani issue, further insinuating if they had funded the Grand Old Party with black money, stuffing \"tempo vans\" of cash. Mr Gandhi hit back, challenging Mr Modi to initiate a probe by the CBI or the Enforcement Directorate.\n\nThe nation is clearly glued to the discussion, and we can only wait to see its impact on the elections and their final outcome.", "source": {"uri": "deccanchronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Chronicle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dc_comment@deccanchronicle.com", "name": "Dc

It is my observation that some people in his party think that as the phases complete, his position is getting in danger,\" he said.\n\nAsked about his party's possible merger with the Congress, Pawar said he never made any such remark.\n\nPawar, in an interview to a newspaper said recently that in the next couple of years, several regional parties will associate more closely with the Congress or even merge with it.\n\nElaborating on it, he said, \"Take the example of our party - NCP. From foundation till today, NCP and Congress have been working together. The ideology of both the parties is rooted in (the ideals of Mahatma) Gandhi and (Jawaharlal) Nehru. So, it will be no surprise to see an increase in sentiments among parties that share (an ideology similar to that of the Congress), coming together and working more closely with each other.\" When asked about his nephew and Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar's statement about his (senior Pawar's) meetings in Delhi to decide on joining hands with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), he said that some colleagues were in favour of going with the BJP.\n\n\"On several occasions, I told them that if you want to hold dialogues you can do so, but the final decision rests with the party and the party's decision was different from what they are claiming,\" he said.\n\nOn PM Modi's claim that Congress received money from Ambani and Adani, Pawar said it used to be a topic of discussion in the country as to who the Ambanis and Adanis were friends with.\n\n\"But the same people against whom these talks were on are now putting the blame on Congress,\" Pawar said.\n\nAddressing a rally in Hyderabad on Wednesday, PM Modi accused the Congress of having a nexus with \"Ambani and Adani\", and asked if the party has received \"tempo loads of black money\" from the two businessmen for its leader Rahul Gandhi to stop \"abusing\" them.\n\nTo a query about Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray and PM Modi's scheduled joint election rally in Mumbai later this month, he said that Modi going with Thackeray shows how the PM desperately needs help.\n\n\"It shows where his confidence has gone,\" he said.

Kaale dhan ke kitne bore bhar kar ke rupye maare hain? Kya tempo bhar kar ke notein Congress ke liye pahunchi hai kya? Kya sauda hua hai? (I ask from the soil of Telangana, let the shehzada declare how much money he has taken from Ambani-Adani these elections...how many sacks of black money? Have tempos full of currency notes reached Congress? What deal has been struck?)\"\n\nWhile Congress rejected the charge by saying Rahul has consistently attacked Ambani and Adani, there were indications that BJP may not close the front it has opened. Sources in BJP said unlike in the past, the campaign has seen Adani-Ambani ceasing to be Congress's main line of attack. \"In any case, isn't Ambani now missing from their concocted narrative of crony capitalism?\" a source asked.\n\nModi's speech focused on alleged corruption in Telangana under the Revanth Reddy-led Congress govt with the PM suggesting that one part of the bribes earned by one \"R\" in Hyderabad was getting transferred to another \"R\" in New Delhi. Mentioning the Telugu blockbuster 'RRR', Modi said there was a discussion on an \"RR Tax\" in state. \"Even a child knows about the double R tax... You all know about the RRR film but I was told that the RR have left behind the RRR film in collections,\" he said.\n\nAlthough the PM did not take any names, his mention of \"RR\" was seen as a reference to Rahul and Revanth Reddy. He said wherever Congress formed govt, its \"ATM of money collection\" started as he also mentioned unaccounted cash collected from the staff of a Jharkhand minister.\n\nModi said Congress's fuse was blown after the third phase of polling and that the INDIA bloc would need a microscope to find its winning seats after the fourth phase. \"Congress was already, in any case, having to use magnifying glass to spot seats they could win. Now after three rounds of polling, they realise that they have to use a new, more powerful magnifying glass to identify the few they can still win,\" he said. \"Wherever there is Congress, there will be plenty of lies and fraud,\" Modi said. \"It is an anti-SC/ST/OBC party. One of the prominent faces of the Congress alliance has stated that all reservations must be given to Muslims. This despite Ambedkar making it clear that no religious reservations can be given.

During this event, he highlighted significant political developments, including the apparent rift within the Congress and its INDI Alliance parties.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing a rally at Telangana following the completion of the third phase of General general elections, remarked on the political landscape and the dynamics between various parties. He asserted that after the third phase of polls, the \"fuse\" between Congress and its INDI Alliance partners had blown off, indicating a fracture in their political collaboration.\n\nSpeaking at a public meeting in Telangana's Karimnagar, PM Modi emphasized the contrasting ideologies of the BJP and Congress-BRS (BRS refers to the INDI Alliance) regarding governance. He stated that while the BJP prioritizes a \"nation first\" approach, the Congress and its allies operate on a \"family first\" principle, portraying them as parties serving familial interests over national welfare.\n\nPM Modi elaborated on this point by linking corruption, appeasement politics, and a lack of effective governance as common traits connecting Congress and BRS. He also addressed the issue of disrespect towards former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao by the Congress, contrasting it with the BJP-NDA government's recognition of Rao's contributions through the Bharat Ratna award.\n\nThe Prime Minister's speech also touched upon economic matters, referencing the 'double R' (RR) tax, popularized due to a recent Telugu movie titled 'RRR.' He humorously remarked about the tax's significant revenue compared to the film's collections, adding a light-hearted note to his address.\n\nTurning to political opponents, PM Modi criticized Congress's focus on targeting industrialists like Ambani and Adani, questioning their sudden shift in rhetoric after election announcements. He challenged the Congress leadership to disclose any alleged dealings with these industrialists, highlighting a perceived inconsistency in their narrative.\n\nFurthrmore, PM Modi accused both Congress and BRS of conceding Hyderabad's political space to AIMIM (All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen) and asserted that BJP is the first party to challenge AIMIM's dominance in the region.

Sources within the BJP said that unlike in the past, the campaign saw Adani-Ambani cease to be the Congress's main line of attack. Either way, isn't Ambani now absent from their concocted narrative of crony capitalism? \" asked a source.\n\nModi's speech focused on alleged corruption in Telangana under the Revanth Reddy-led Congress government, with the Prime Minister suggesting that some of the bribes earned by one R in Hyderabad were transferred to another R in New Delhi. Mentioning the Telugu blockbuster RRR, Modi said there was a discussion about an RR tax in Telangana. Even a child from Telangana knows about the double R tax... You all know the movie RRR but I was told that the RRs left behind the movie RRR in their collections. As you know, RRR earned more than Rs 1,000 crore, but I was told that this amount was collected by RR in just a few days, such a loot they arranged, he said.\n\nAlthough the Prime Minister did not take any names, his mention of RR was seen as a reference to Rahul and Revanth Reddy. He said wherever the Congress formed a government, its cash collection ATM began, as he also mentioned the unaccounted cash collected from the staff of a minister in Jharkhand.\n\nModi said the Congress fuse had blown after the third phase of polling and the INDIA bloc would need a microscope to find its winning seats after the fourth phase. In any case, Congress already had to use the magnifying glass to identify the seats it could win. Now, after three rounds of voting, they realize they must use a new, more powerful lens to identify the few candidates they can still win, he said.\n\nWherever the Congress is, there will be a lot of lies and fraud, Modi said. It is an anti-SC/ST/OBC party. One of the prominent faces of the Congress alliance said all reservations should be given to Muslims. This is despite Ambedkar making it clear that no religious reservations can be made. They have no respect for the Constitution.

In fact, the frequent mention of the two business groups has drawn criticism, even from within the party, as many have argued that the Congress -- which ushered in liberalisation in the 1990s -- should not send a message that it was anti-business or anti-corporate.\n\nWay back in April 2015, nearly a year after the Congress was decimated in the Lok Sabha elections and returning from his 56-day sabbatical, Gandhi, during an intervention in Lok Sabha, termed the Narendra Modi government a \"suit-boot ki sarkar\". It became a recurring theme of his Parliament speeches since 2018. In the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he picked on the Rafale fighter jet deal to raise allegations of corruption even after the Supreme Court, in December 2018, dismissed pleas asking for a

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nIndian prime minister Narendra Modi has claimed without evidence that his chief rival took \"truckloads\" of illegal money from billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, in one of the most unexpected twists in the heated election battle.\n\nMr Ambani and Mr Adani, two of Asia's richest men, are said to enjoy close ties to the prime minister. Mr Modi arrived in Delhi for his first inauguration as prime minister in 2014 on a private jet emblazoned with Mr Adani's logo, and his face accompanied frontpage advertisements announcing the formal launch of Mr Ambani's telecoms company Jio, which has since rapidly risen to become a major player in a highly lucrative and competitive market.\n\nMr Modi's latest attack on Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party has triggered a debate about the sudden change of thrust in the prime minister's campaign speeches, with analysts speculating that his party was doubtful of its performance in the election so far.\n\nAddressing a rally in southern Telangana state on Wednesday, Mr Modi accused Mr Gandhi of striking a deal with the billionaires.\n\n\"For five years, the Congress prince abused Ambani and Adani and now suddenly you have stopped. Meaning, you have accepted truckloads of illegal funds. You will have to answer to the country about this,\" Mr Modi said.\n\nHe was \"sensing something fishy\" as the Congress party's attack on the two billionaires had stopped overnight, the prime minister added.\n\nMr Gandhi responded in a video statement saying Mr Modi was \"nervous\" about how the election was going.\n\nHe challenged the prime minister to send investigative agencies to prove his allegation.\n\n\"Modiji, are you nervous? Normally you speak of Adani and Ambani in closed rooms. It is for the first time you have taken their names in public,\" Mr Gandhi said. \"You even know they send money in truckloads, is that your personal experience?\"\n\n\"Send CBI, ED to them, get a thorough inquiry done as soon as possible,\" he said, referring to federal agencies Central Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement Directorate, both of which Mr Modi's government has been accused of weaponising against opposition leaders.\n\n\"I want to repeat to the nation that the amount of money Modi has given to them, we are going to give the same amount to India's poor,\" he added, referring to Mr Ambani and Mr Adani.\n\nMr Modi's attack came after Mr Gandhi's consistent swipes at the prime minister and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party for allegedly having close links with business tycoons and championing policies favouring the wealthy over the poor.\n\nMr Ambani and Mr Adani come from Mr Modi's home state of Gujarat where their multinational corporations maintain major business operations.\n\nThe prime minister, who has been in power for a decade and is seeking a third consecutive term, had refrained from mentioning their names on the campaign trail so far.\n\nNeither industrialist has publicly stated who they might support in the ongoing election and their corporations did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPolitical analysts said Mr Modi's attack seeking to link Mr Gandhi to the billionaires was an attempt to confuse voters. It also displayed his anxiousness over low voter turnout, they said.\n\nThe three phases of polling so far have seen lower turnout than the previous election in 2019, putting in doubt opinion polls that predicted a landslide victory for the ruling party. The election is spread over seven phases of voting, with the results due to be declared on 4 June.\n\nApoorvanand, a professor at the University of Delhi, told The Independent that Mr Modi's baseless allegation against Mr Gandhi was intended to shape a narrative.\n\n\"Mr Modi is creating a talking point to create confusion in Mr Gandhi's electorate so that people forget facts and get entangled in the narrative. This is meant to direct the media's relentless attacks on Congress party to clarify,\" he said.\n\n\"The Indian prime minister is definitely anxious and desperate because he has started loving power and led in the illusion that he is going to win. He fears losing power unlike other democrats,\" he added.\n\nBut he did not believe that Mr Modi made the comment to distance himself from the corporate moguls as he \"has come to power riding the shoulders of these billionaires\".", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Once the caste census is done, all facts will come out,\" he said, alleging that Modi government has privatised the public sector undertakings to remove reservations, as capitalists had given \"Prasad\" to BJP.\n\nHe also assured that the Congress government will also ensure one year employment for job-seekers by accommodating in private and public sector industries and institutions, by recruiting them as interns who will be trained and given Rs 1 lakh for one year as the stipend.\n\nReminding the people that it was Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi who have given us the constitution which guarantees reservations, land, schemes and rights to its citizens, Rahul said that the general elections are between an ideology which wants to change and destroy the constitution, and the Congress and its alliance partners who want to protect it.", "source": {"uri": "siasat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Siasat Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vivek_bhoomi@siasat.com", "name": "Vivek

This double 'RR' game could potentially destroy Telangana,\" PM Modi added.\n\nAlso coming down heavily on the Bharat Rashtra Samiti (BRS), the previous ruling party in the state, PM Modi said while the BJP pursues a 'nation first' policy, the Congress and the BRS work to advance the principle of 'family first'.\n\n\"These (dynastic) parties run on the principle of 'by the family, for the family, of the family'.

There is a desperate need to save Telangana from the corrupt clutches of such parties,\" he added.\n\nReaffirming his earlier statement on reservation, PM Modi alleged that the Congress was conspiring against the SCs, STs, and OBCs.\n\n\"The Constitution, as was envisioned and drafted by Babasaheb Ambedkar, is against the idea of reservation on the basis of religion.

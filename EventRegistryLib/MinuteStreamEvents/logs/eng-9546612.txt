They're among the tail end of companies reporting their results for the first three months of the year. Treasury yields eased in the bond market.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks are holding relatively steady Tuesday as trading on Wall Street calms following some sharp recent swings.\n\nThe major stock indexes are essentially flat in afternoon trading after drifting between tiny gains and losses. The S&P 500 was up less than 0.1%. It's coming off a strong three-day winning streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 6 points, or less than 0.1%, as of 2:41 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% lower.\n\nKenvue, the company whose brands include Band-Aids and Tylenol, rose 5.8% after topping analysts' forecasts for both profit and revenue in the latest quarter.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. sank 9.7% despite reporting stronger results for its latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell a bit shy of forecasts, and it expects its entertainment streaming business to soften in the current quarter.\n\nThey're among the tail end of companies reporting their results for the first three months of the year. The majority of companies has so far been beating forecasts for earnings, but they're not getting as big a boost to their stock prices afterward as they usually do, according to FactSet. Not only that, companies that fall short of profit expectations have seen their stock prices sink by more the following day than they have historically.\n\nThat could suggest investors are listening to critics who have been calling the U.S. stock market broadly too expensive following its run to records this year. For stock prices to climb further, either profits will need to grow more dynamically or interest rates will need to fall.\n\nThe latter still looks like a possibility on Wall Street following some events last week that traders found encouraging.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell strongly suggested the central bank is still closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.\n\nAfter charging higher through the start of this year as hopes dimmed for cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve, Treasury yields have been regressing this month to offer some relief for the stock market.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.46% from 4.49% late Monday. The two-year yield, which moves more closely with expectations for the Fed, held steady at 4.83%.\n\nWhile yields have been declining over the last week, strategists at Wells Fargo Investment Institute still expect long-term yields to remain high for a while. That's in part because expectations are broadly for inflation to remain higher than hopes for some time. Luis Alvarado, global fixed income strategist, believes the 10-year yield will likely remain near its recent range.\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, Crocs jumped 5.9% after reporting better profit and revenue than expected. It benefited from strong growth internationally.\n\nInternational Flavors & Fragrances, which makes ingredients used in food and perfume, gained 5.5% after reporting better profit and revenue than expected. It also said it expects its revenue for the full year to come in at the higher end of its forecasted range.\n\nLucid Group tumbled 15.4% after the electric-vehicle maker reported a worse loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected.\n\nBuilders FirstSource fell 17.6% despite topping forecasts for profit and revenue. The supplier of building products said a weakening multi-family market and higher mortgage rates were creating challenges, and its forecast for how much cash it will generate this year came in below some analysts' expectations.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes jumped 2.2% in Seoul and 1.6% in Tokyo but were mixed in the rest of Asia. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 advanced 1.4% after the central bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged.\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott, Elaine Kurtenbach and Alex Veiga contributed.", "source":

Treasury yields rose in the bond market.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Wall Street's lull is stretching into another day, and U.S. stocks are drifting through a quiet Wednesday.\n\nThe S&P 500 was edging down by 0.1% in late trading after a big three-day winning streak gave way to a tiny gain the prior day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up by 132 points, or 0.3%, with a little less than an hour remaining in trading, and the Nasdaq composite was down 0.3%.\n\nUber Technologies slumped 7.7% after reporting worse results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also gave a forecasted range for bookings in the current quarter whose midpoint fell below analysts'.\n\nShopify tumbled 19.5% despite reporting better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which helps businesses sell things online, said its revenue growth would likely slow this quarter and that it would likely make less profit off each $1 in revenue.\n\nMatch Group sank 4.6% despite topping profit expectations. The company behind Tinder, Hinge and other apps gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that fell short of analysts'. It said its efforts to make Tinder better for women and Gen Z customers in particular have hurt some performance measurements in the short term.\n\nIntel fell 2.8% after saying the U.S. Commerce Department revoked licenses for exports to a Chinese customer. That could cause its revenue for the current quarter to fall below the midpoint of the forecasted range it had earlier given.\n\nThey helped to offset Lyft, which revved 4.3% higher after topping expectations for profit and revenue. It said growth was particularly strong for early-morning, commute and weekend-evening trips.\n\nReddit was another winner and rose 6.4% after delivering its first quarterly report as a publicly traded company. It reported a milder loss and better revenue than expected, while also giving a stronger-than-expected forecast for revenue in the current quarter.\n\nArista Networks climbed 5.7% for one of the biggest gains in the S&P 500 after topping expectations for both profit and revenue.\n\nMost companies have been reporting stronger profits for the start of the year than analysts expected. That and newly revived hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve have helped the U.S. stock market to recover from its rough April.\n\nTreasury yields have largely been easing since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that it remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury recovered some of those losses to add more pressure on the stock market. It rose to 4.49% from 4.46% late Tuesday.\n\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury, which moves closer with expectations for action by the Fed, held steady at 4.83%.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Asia. Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 1.6% after Nintendo forecast that its net profit would fall in the upcoming fiscal year and announced that news of a successor product to its popular Switch device will be made by March 2025.\n\nStock indexes rose modestly in Europe.\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Wall Street shifted between small losses and gains before the opening bell as more corporate earnings arrive during what is otherwise expected to be relatively quiet week. (AP Photo/Peter Morgan)NEW YORK (AP) - Stock drifted to a mixed close as Wall Street remains in a lull. The S&P 500 closed little changed Wednesday, after a big three-day winning streak gave way to a tiny gain the prior day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.2%. Uber Technologies slumped after reporting worse results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Shopify tumbled after giving a forecast for slowing revenue growth. Lyft and Arista Networks revved higher after topping expectations for profit and revenue. Treasury yields rose in the bond market. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. NEW YORK (AP) - Wall Street's lull is stretching into another day, and U.S. stocks are drifting through a quiet Wednesday. The S&P 500 was edging down by 0.1% in late trading after a big three-day winning streak gave way to a tiny gain the prior day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up by 132 points, or 0.3%, with a little less than an hour remaining in trading, and the Nasdaq composite was down 0.3%. Uber Technologies slumped 7.7% after reporting worse results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also gave a forecasted range for bookings in the current quarter whose midpoint fell below analysts'. Shopify tumbled 19.5% despite reporting better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which helps businesses sell things online, said its revenue growth would likely slow this quarter and that it would likely make less profit off each $1 in revenue. Match Group sank 4.6% despite topping profit expectations. The company behind Tinder, Hinge and other apps gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that fell short of analysts'. It said its efforts to make Tinder better for women and Gen Z customers in particular have hurt some performance measurements in the short term. Intel fell 2.8% after saying the U.S. Commerce Department revoked licenses for exports to a Chinese customer. That could cause its revenue for the current quarter to fall below the midpoint of the forecasted range it had earlier given. They helped to offset Lyft, which revved 4.3% higher after topping expectations for profit and revenue. It said growth was particularly strong for early-morning, commute and weekend-evening trips. Reddit was another winner and rose 6.4% after delivering its first quarterly report as a publicly traded company. It reported a milder loss and better revenue than expected, while also giving a stronger-than-expected forecast for revenue in the current quarter. Arista Networks climbed 5.7% for one of the biggest gains in the S&P 500 after topping expectations for both profit and revenue. Most companies have been reporting stronger profits for the start of the year than analysts expected. That and newly revived hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve have helped the U.S. stock market to recover from its rough April. Treasury yields have largely been easing since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that it remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high. The yield on the 10-year Treasury recovered some of those losses to add more pressure on the stock market. It rose to 4.49% from 4.46% late Tuesday. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which moves closer with expectations for action by the Fed, held steady at 4.83%. In stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Asia. Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 1.6% after Nintendo forecast that its net profit would fall in the upcoming fiscal year and announced that news of a successor product to its popular Switch device will be made by March 2025. Stock indexes rose modestly in Europe. ___ AP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"},

He said the market's zig-zag pattern since March \"is likely to remain as we search for a catalyst.\"\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Asia. Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 1.6% after Nintendo forecast that its net profit would fall in the upcoming fiscal year and announced that news of a successor product to its popular Switch device will be made by March 2025.\n\nStock indexes rose modestly in Europe.\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

We might do it today. We might do it tomorrow,\" Masato Kanda, the Finance vice minister for international affairs.\n\nThe Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 1.2% to 18,538.57 and the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.9% to 3,156.96.\n\nChina reported that its exports rose 1.5% in April from a year earlier, while imports jumped 8.4%. The renewed growth suggests a stronger recovery in demand than earlier data had suggested.\n\nIn South Korea, the Kospi lost 0.6%, to 2,729.64. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 shed 0.9% to 7,735.20.\n\nOn Wednesday, the S&P 500 finished virtually unchanged after flipping between modest gains and losses through the day. It edged down by 0.03 to 5,187.67, coming off a very slight gain from Tuesday, which followed a big three-day winning streak.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4% to 39,056.39, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2% to 16,302.76.\n\nUber Technologies slumped 5.7% after reporting worse results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also gave a forecasted range for bookings in the current quarter whose midpoint fell below analysts' estimates.\n\nShopify tumbled 18.6% despite reporting better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which helps businesses sell things online, said its revenue growth would likely slow this quarter and that it would likely make less profit off each $1 in revenue.\n\nMatch Group sank 5.4% despite topping profit expectations. The company behind Tinder, Hinge and other apps for connecting people with each other gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that fell short of what analysts were expecting.\n\nIntel fell 2.2% after saying the U.S. Commerce Department revoked licenses for exports to a Chinese customer. That could cause its revenue for the current quarter to fall below the midpoint of the forecasted range it had earlier given.\n\nThey helped to offset Lyft, which revved 7.1% higher after it topped expectations for profit and revenue. It said growth was particularly strong for early-morning, commute and weekend-evening trips.\n\nArista Networks climbed 6.5% for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after topping expectations for both profit and revenue.\n\nMost companies have been reporting stronger profits for the start of the year than analysts expected. That and newly revived hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve have helped the U.S. stock market to recover from its rough April.\n\nTreasury yields have largely been easing since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.\n\nIn other trading, U.S. benchmark crude oil rose 48 cents to $79.47 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude oil, the international standard, was up 35 cents to $83.93 per barrel.\n\nThe euro rose to $1.0751 from $1.0747.\n\nAP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.", "source": {"uri":

It was a quiet day following three straight leaps for the index of at least 0.9%.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average added 31.99, or 0.1%, to 38,884.26, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 16.69, or 0.1%, to 16,332.56.\n\nKenvue, the company whose brands include Band-Aids and Tylenol, rose 6.4% after topping analysts' forecasts for both profit and revenue in the latest quarter.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. sank 9.5% despite reporting stronger results for its latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell a bit shy of forecasts, and it expects its entertainment streaming business to soften in the current quarter.\n\nThey're among the tail end of companies reporting their results for the first three months of the year. The majority of companies has so far been beating forecasts for earnings, but they're not getting as big a boost to their stock prices afterward as they usually do, according to FactSet. Not only that, companies that fall short of profit expectations have seen their stock prices sink by more the following day than they have historically.\n\nThat could suggest investors are listening to critics who have been calling the U.S. stock market broadly too expensive following its run to records this year. For stock prices to climb further, either profits will need to grow more or interest rates will need to fall.\n\nWall Street still considers the latter a possibility this year following some events last week that traders found encouraging.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.\n\nAfter charging higher through the start of this year when hopes dimmed for cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve, Treasury yields have been regressing this month to offer some relief for the stock market.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.45% from 4.49% late Monday. The two-year yield, which moves more closely with expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.82% from 4.83%.\n\nWhile long-term yields have been declining over the last week, strategists at Wells Fargo Investment Institute still expect them to remain relatively high for a while. That's in part because expectations are broadly for inflation to remain higher than hoped. Luis Alvarado, global fixed income strategist, believes the 10-year yield will likely remain near its recent range.\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, Crocs jumped 7.8% after reporting better profit and revenue than expected. It benefited from strong growth internationally.\n\nInternational Flavors & Fragrances, which makes ingredients used in food and perfume, gained 6.4% after reporting better profit and revenue than expected. It also said it expects its revenue for the full year to come in at the higher end of its forecasted range.\n\nLucid Group tumbled 14%.1 after the electric-vehicle maker reported a worse loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected.\n\nBuilders FirstSource fell 19% despite topping forecasts for profit and revenue. The supplier of building products said a weakening multi-family market and higher mortgage rates were creating challenges, and its forecast for how much cash it will generate this year came in below some analysts' expectations.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes jumped across much of Europe and Asia. Stocks rose 2.2% in Seoul, 1.6% in Tokyo and 1.2% in London. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 advanced 1.4% after the central bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged.\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott, Elaine Kurtenbach and Alex Veiga contributed.", "source":

It edged down by 0.03 to 5,187.67. It was coming off a very slight gain from Tuesday, which followed a big three-day winning streak.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 172.13 points, or 0.4%, to 39,056.39, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 29.80, or 0.2%, to 16,302.76.\n\nShares of Uber Technologies slumped 5.7% after reporting worse results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also gave a forecasted range for bookings in the current quarter whose midpoint fell below analysts' estimates.\n\nShopify shares tumbled 18.6% despite reporting better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which helps businesses sell things online, said its revenue growth would likely slow this quarter and that it would likely make less profit off each $1 in revenue.\n\nMatch Group sank 5.4% despite topping profit expectations. The company behind Tinder, Hinge and other apps for connecting people with each other gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that fell short of analyst expectations. It said its efforts to make Tinder better for women and Gen Z customers in particular have hurt some performance measurements in the short term.\n\nIntel shares fell 2.2% after saying the U.S. Commerce Department revoked licenses for exports to a Chinese customer. That could cause its revenue for the current quarter to fall below the midpoint of the forecasted range it had earlier given.\n\nThey helped to offset Lyft shares, which revved 7.1% higher after the company topped expectations for profit and revenue.\n\nIt said growth was particularly strong for early morning, commute and weekend-evening trips.\n\nReddit was another winner and rose 4% after delivering its first quarterly report as a publicly traded company. It reported a milder loss and better revenue than expected, while also giving a stronger-than-expected forecast for revenue in the current quarter.\n\nArista Networks climbed 6.5% for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after topping expectations for both profit and revenue.\n\nMost companies have been reporting stronger profits for the start of the year than analysts expected.\n\nThat and newly revived hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve have helped the U.S. stock market to recover from its rough April.\n\nTreasury yields have largely been easing since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the Fed remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than increasing it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury recovered some of those losses. It rose to 4.49% from 4.46% late Tuesday.\n\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury, which moves closer with expectations for action by the Fed, ticked up to 4.84% from 4.83%.\n\nThe stock market also found some support following April's weakness as companies bought back more shares of their own stock, according to Mark Hackett, Nationwide's chief of investment research. He said the market's zig-zag pattern since March \"is likely to remain as we search for a catalyst.\"\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Asia.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 dropped 1.6% after Nintendo forecast that its net profit would fall in the coming fiscal year and announced that news of a successor product to its popular Switch device will be made by March 2025.\n\nStock indexes rose modestly in Europe.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach of The Associated Press.", "source": {"uri": "arkansasonline.com", "dataType":

The company, which helps businesses sell things online, said its revenue growth would likely slow this quarter and that it would likely make less profit off each $1 in revenue.\n\nMatch Group sank 5.4% despite topping profit expectations. The company behind Tinder, Hinge and other dating apps gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that fell short of what analysts were expecting.\n\nMost companies have been reporting stronger profits for the start of the year than analysts expected.

It was a quiet day after three straight leaps for the index of at least 0.9%.\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average added 31.99, or 0.1%, to 38,884.26, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 16.69, or 0.1%, to 16,332.56.\n\nKenvue, the company whose brands include Band-Aids and Tylenol, rose 6.4% after topping analysts' forecasts for profit and revenue in the latest quarter.\n\nWalt Disney Co. sank 9.5% despite reporting stronger results for its latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell a bit shy of forecasts, and it expects its entertainment streaming business to soften in the current quarter.\n\nThey're among the tail end of companies reporting their results for the first three months of the year. The majority of companies has been beating forecasts for earnings, but they're not getting as big a boost to their stock prices afterward as they usually do, according to FactSet. Not only that, companies that fall short of profit expectations have seen their stock prices sink by more the following day than they have historically.\n\nThat could suggest investors are listening to critics who have been calling the U.S. stock market broadly too expensive after its run to records this year. For stock prices to climb, either profits will need to grow more or interest rates will need to fall.\n\nWall Street still considers the latter a possibility this year after some events last week that traders found encouraging.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell said the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.\n\nAfter charging higher through the start of this year, when hopes dimmed for cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve, Treasury yields have been regressing this month to offer some relief for the stock market.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.45% from 4.49% late Monday. The two-year yield, which moves more closely with expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.82% from 4.83%.\n\nAlthough long-term yields have been declining over the last week, strategists at Wells Fargo Investment Institute still expect them to remain relatively high for a while. That's in part because expectations are broadly for inflation to remain higher than hoped. Luis Alvarado, global fixed income strategist, believes the 10-year yield will probably remain near its recent range.\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, Crocs jumped 7.8% after reporting better profit and revenue than expected. It benefited from strong growth internationally.\n\nInternational Flavors & Fragrances, which makes ingredients used in food and perfume, gained 6.4% after reporting better profit and revenue than expected. It also said it expects its revenue for the full year to come in at the higher end of its forecast range.\n\nLucid Group tumbled 14%.1 after the electric vehicle maker reported a worse loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected.\n\nBuilders FirstSource fell 19% despite topping forecasts for profit and revenue. The supplier of building products said a weakening multifamily market and higher mortgage rates were creating challenges, and its forecast for how much cash it will generate this year came in below some analysts' expectations.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes jumped across much of Europe and Asia. Stocks rose 2.2% in Seoul, 1.6% in Tokyo and 1.2% in London. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 advanced 1.4% after the central bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors":

It reported a milder loss and better revenue than expected, while also giving a stronger-than-expected forecast for revenue in the current quarter.\n\nArista Networks climbed 3.2% for one of the biggest gains in the S&P 500 after topping expectations for both profit and revenue.\n\nMost companies have been reporting stronger profits for the start of the year than analysts expected. That and newly revived hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve have helped the U.S. stock market to recover from its rough April.\n\nTreasury yields have largely been easing since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that it remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury recovered some of those losses to add more pressure on the stock market. It rose to 4.48% from 4.46% late Tuesday.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Asia. Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 1.6% after Nintendo forecast that its net profit would fall in the upcoming fiscal year and announced that news of a successor product to its popular Switch device will be made by March 2025.\n\nStock indexes rose modestly in Europe.\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It was a quiet day following three straight leaps for the index of at least 0.9%.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 31.99, or 0.1%, to 38,884.26, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 16.69, or 0.1%, to 16,332.56.\n\nShares of Kenvue, the company whose brands include Band-Aids and Tylenol, rose 6.4% after topping analysts' forecasts for both profit and revenue in the latest quarter.\n\nWalt Disney Co. shares sank 9.5% despite reporting stronger results for its latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell a bit shy of forecasts, and it expects its entertainment streaming business to soften in the current quarter.\n\nThey're among the tail end of companies reporting results for the first three months of the year. The majority of companies have so far been beating forecasts for earnings, but they're not getting as big a boost to their stock prices afterward as they usually do, according to FactSet. Not only that, companies that fall short of profit expectations have seen their stock prices sink by more the following day than they have historically.\n\nThat could suggest investors are listening to critics who have been calling the U.S. stock market broadly too expensive following its run to records this year.

The two-year yield, which moves more closely with expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.82% from 4.83%.\n\nWhile long-term yields have been declining over the last week, strategists at Wells Fargo Investment Institute still expect them to remain relatively high for a while. That's in part because expectations are broadly for inflation to remain higher than hoped. Luis Alvarado, global fixed income strategist, believes the 10-year yield will likely remain near its recent range.\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, shares of Crocs jumped 7.8% after reporting better profit and revenue than expected. It benefited from strong growth internationally.\n\nShared of International Flavors & Fragrances, which makes ingredients used in food and perfume, gained 6.4% after reporting better profit and revenue than expected.

It was a quiet day following three straight leaps for the index of at least 0.9%.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average added 31.99, or 0.1%, to 38,884.26, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 16.69, or 0.1%, to 16,332.56.\n\nKenvue, the company whose brands include Band-Aids and Tylenol, rose 6.4% after topping analysts' forecasts for both profit and revenue in the latest quarter.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. sank 9.5% despite reporting stronger results for its latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell a bit shy of forecasts, and it expects its entertainment streaming business to soften in the current quarter.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nThey're among the tail end of companies reporting their results for the first three months of the year. The majority of companies has so far been beating forecasts for earnings, but they're not getting as big a boost to their stock prices afterward as they usually do, according to FactSet. Not only that, companies that fall short of profit expectations have seen their stock prices sink by more the following day than they have historically.\n\nThat could suggest investors are listening to critics who have been calling the U.S. stock market broadly too expensive following its run to records this year. For stock prices to climb further, either profits will need to grow more or interest rates will need to fall.\n\nWall Street still considers the latter a possibility this year following some events last week that traders found encouraging.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.\n\nAfter charging higher through the start of this year when hopes dimmed for cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve, Treasury yields have been regressing this month to offer some relief for the stock market.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.45% from 4.49% late Monday. The two-year yield, which moves more closely with expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.82% from 4.83%.\n\nWhile long-term yields have been declining over the last week, strategists at Wells Fargo Investment Institute still expect them to remain relatively high for a while. That's in part because expectations are broadly for inflation to remain higher than hoped. Luis Alvarado, global fixed income strategist, believes the 10-year yield will likely remain near its recent range.\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, Crocs jumped 7.8% after reporting better profit and revenue than expected. It benefited from strong growth internationally.\n\nInternational Flavors & Fragrances, which makes ingredients used in food and perfume, gained 6.4% after reporting better profit and revenue than expected. It also said it expects its revenue for the full year to come in at the higher end of its forecasted range.\n\nLucid Group tumbled 14%.1 after the electric-vehicle maker reported a worse loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected.\n\nBuilders FirstSource fell 19% despite topping forecasts for profit and revenue. The supplier of building products said a weakening multi-family market and higher mortgage rates were creating challenges, and its forecast for how much cash it will generate this year came in below some analysts' expectations.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0 * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "nwitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "nwi.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenvue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenvue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tylenol_(brand)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tylenol (brand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band-Aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Band-Aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FactSet", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FactSet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builders_FirstSource", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Builders FirstSource"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Flavors_&_Fragrances", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Flavors & Fragrances"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixed income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/nwitimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/80/0803ab1c-0cad-11ef-a9ec-bbb0fb67f130/661eaf28776bb.preview.jpg?crop=1758%2C923%2C1%2C73&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546612", "eventUri": "eng-9546612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Germany's DAX rose 0.3% to 18,545.32 and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 0.1% to 8,125.56.\n\nIn Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index was down 0.3% at 38,073.98.\n\nAutomaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp.'s shares dropped 4.9% after the company forecasted a 7% lower net profit in the fiscal year that will end in March 2025.\n\nToyota Motor slipped 0.4% after it reported Wednesday that it doubled its net profit in the fiscal year that ended in March.\n\nThe U.S. dollar rose to 155.86 Japanese yen from 155.52 yen, as reports in Tokyo speculated on the likelihood of further intervention by the Finance Ministry to curb the yen's slide.\n\n\"We're always prepared to do so if necessary. We might do it today. We might do it tomorrow,\" Masato Kanda, the Finance Vice Minister for International Affairs.\n\nThe Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 1.1% to 18,511.26 and the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.8% to 3,154.32.\n\nChina reported that its exports rose 1.5% in April from a year earlier, while imports jumped 8.4%. The renewed growth suggests a stronger recovery in demand than earlier data had suggested.\n\nIn South Korea, the Kospi lost 1.2% to 2,712.14. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 shed 1.1% to 7,721.60.\n\nOn Wednesday, the S&P 500 finished virtually unchanged after flipping between modest gains and losses through the day. It edged down by 0.03 to 5,187.67, coming off a very slight gain on Tuesday, which followed a big three-day winning streak.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4% to 39,056.39, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2% to 16,302.76.\n\nUber Technologies slumped 5.7% after reporting worse results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also gave a forecasted range for bookings in the current quarter whose midpoint fell below analysts' estimates.\n\nShopify tumbled 18.6% despite reporting better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which helps businesses sell things online, said its revenue growth would likely slow this quarter and that it would likely make less profit off each $1 in revenue.\n\nMatch Group sank 5.4% despite topping profit expectations. The company behind Tinder, Hinge and other dating apps gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that fell short of what analysts were expecting.\n\nMost companies have been reporting stronger profits for the start of the year than analysts expected. That and newly revived hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve have helped the U.S. stock market to recover from its rough April.\n\nTreasury yields have largely been easing since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.\n\nIn other trading, U.S. benchmark crude oil rose 66 cents to $79.65 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude oil, the international standard, was up 58 cents to $84.16 per barrel.\n\nThe euro dropped to $1.0734 from $1.0745.\n\n___\n\nAP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.", "source": {"uri":

It reported a milder loss and better revenue than expected, while also giving a stronger-than-expected forecast for revenue in the current quarter.\n\nArista Networks climbed 6.5% for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after topping expectations for both profit and revenue.\n\nMost companies have been reporting stronger profits for the start of the year than analysts expected. That and newly revived hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve have helped the U.S. stock market to recover from its rough April.\n\nTreasury yields have largely been easing since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that it remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury recovered some of those losses. It rose to 4.49% from 4.46% late Tuesday.\n\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury, which moves closer with expectations for action by the Fed, ticked up to 4.84% from 4.83%.\n\nThe stock market also found some support following April's weakness as companies bought back more shares of their own stock, according to Mark Hackett, Nationwide's chief of investment research.

It was a quiet day following three straight leaps for the index of at least 0.9%.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average added 31.99, or 0.1%, to 38,884.26, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 16.69, or 0.1%, to 16,332.56.\n\nKenvue, the company whose brands include Band-Aids and Tylenol, rose 6.4% after topping analysts' forecasts for both profit and revenue in the latest quarter.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. sank 9.5% despite reporting stronger results for its latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell a bit shy of forecasts, and it expects its entertainment streaming business to soften in the current quarter.\n\nThey're among the tail end of companies reporting their results for the first three months of the year. The majority of companies has so far been beating forecasts for earnings, but they're not getting as big a boost to their stock prices afterward as they usually do, according to FactSet. Not only that, companies that fall short of profit expectations have seen their stock prices sink by more the following day than they have historically.\n\nRelated Story: Wall Street Rallies and Adds to Its Hot Start to the Week\n\nThat could suggest investors are listening to critics who have been calling the U.S. stock market broadly too expensive following its run to records this year. For stock prices to climb further, either profits will need to grow more or interest rates will need to fall.\n\nWall Street still considers the latter a possibility this year following some events last week that traders found encouraging.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.\n\nAfter charging higher through the start of this year when hopes dimmed for cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve, Treasury yields have been regressing this month to offer some relief for the stock market.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.45% from 4.49% late Monday. The two-year yield, which moves more closely with expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.82% from 4.83%.\n\nWhile long-term yields have been declining over the last week, strategists at Wells Fargo Investment Institute still expect them to remain relatively high for a while. That's in part because expectations are broadly for inflation to remain higher than hoped. Luis Alvarado, global fixed income strategist, believes the 10-year yield will likely remain near its recent range.\n\nRelated Story: Wall Street Rallies and Adds to Its Hot Start to the Week\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, Crocs jumped 7.8% after reporting better profit and revenue than expected. It benefited from strong growth internationally.\n\nInternational Flavors & Fragrances, which makes ingredients used in food and perfume, gained 6.4% after reporting better profit and revenue than expected. It also said it expects its revenue for the full year to come in at the higher end of its forecasted range.\n\nLucid Group tumbled 14%.1 after the electric-vehicle maker reported a worse loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected.\n\nBuilders FirstSource fell 19% despite topping forecasts for profit and revenue. The supplier of building products said a weakening multi-family market and higher mortgage rates were creating challenges, and its forecast for how much cash it will generate this year came in below some analysts' expectations.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes jumped across much of Europe and Asia. Stocks rose 2.2% in Seoul, 1.6% in Tokyo and 1.2% in London. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 advanced 1.4% after the central bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged.", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It was a quiet day following three straight leaps for the index of at least 0.9%.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1%, to 38,884.26, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.1%, to 16,332.56.\n\nKenvue, the company whose brands include Band-Aids and Tylenol, rose 6.4% after topping analysts' forecasts for both profit and revenue in the latest quarter.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. sank 9.5% despite reporting stronger results for its latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell a bit shy of forecasts, and it expects its entertainment streaming business to soften in the current quarter.\n\nThey're among the tail end of companies reporting their results for the first three months of the year. Most companies have beat their forecasts for earnings, but they're not getting as big a boost to their stock prices afterward as they usually do, according to FactSet. Not only that, companies that fall short of profit expectations have seen their stock prices sink by more the following day than they have historically.\n\nThat could suggest investors are listening to critics who have been calling the U.S. stock market broadly too expensive following its run to records this year. For stock prices to climb further, either profits will need to grow more or interest rates will need to fall.\n\nWall Street still considers the latter a possibility this year following some events last week that traders found encouraging.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.\n\nIn other trading, U.S. benchmark crude oil fell 33 cents to $78.05 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It lost 10 cents on Tuesday to $78.38 per barrel.\n\nBrent crude oil, the international standard, declined 38 cents to $82.78 per barrel.\n\nThe euro dropped to $1.0742 from $1.0755.\n\nAP Business

It edged down 0.03 to 5,187.67. He had just made a very slight gain compared to Tuesday, which followed a big streak of three consecutive victories.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 172.13 points, or 0.4%, to 39,056.39, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 29.80, or 0.2%, to 16,302.76.\n\nUber Technologies fell 5.7% after reporting results for the latest quarter that were worse than analysts expected. It also gave an expected booking range for the current quarter whose midpoint is lower than analysts' estimates.\n\nShopify fell 18.6% despite bring in a better profit and revenues for the last quarter above analysts' expectations. The company, which helps businesses sell products online, said its revenue growth would likely slow this quarter and it would likely make less profit on each dollar of revenue.\n\nMatch Group fell 5.4% despite better-than-expected profits. The company behind Tinder, Hinge and other apps that connect people together gave revenue forecasts for the current quarter that fell short of what analysts expected. It said its efforts to improve Tinder for women and Gen Z customers in particular hurt some short-term performance metrics.\n\nIntel fell 2.2% after it said the U.S. Commerce Department had revoked export licenses to a Chinese customer. This could cause its current quarter revenue to fall below the midpoint of the previously forecast range.\n\nThey helped offset Lyft, which rose 7.1% after beating profit and revenue expectations. Growth was particularly strong for morning commutes, commutes, and weekends and evenings.\n\nReddit was another winner and rose 4% after releasing its first quarterly report as a publicly traded company. It reported a lighter loss and better-than-expected revenue, while also giving higher-than-expected revenue guidance for the current quarter.\n\nArista Networks rose 6.5%, the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after beating earnings and revenue expectations.\n\nMost companies announced profits for the start of the year that were higher than those expected by analysts. That and recently revived hopes of an upcoming interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve have helped the U.S. stock market recover from a tough April.\n\nTreasury yields have largely eased since Jerome Powell, Chairman of the Federal Reserve said last week that the central bank remained closer to cutting its main interest rate than raising it, despite a series of measures stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler than expected jobs report Friday, in the meantime, suggested to American economy could achieve the balancing act of remaining strong enough to avoid a serious recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield has recovered some of these losses. It went from 4.46% on Tuesday evening to 4.49%.\n\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury note, which is close to expectations for Fed action, rose to 4.84% from 4.83%.\n\nThe stock market also found some support after April's weakness as companies bought back more shares of their own stock, according to Mark Hackett, Nationwide's head of investment research. He said the zigzag trend in markets since March is likely to continue as we look for a catalyst.\n\nIn foreign stock markets, indexes fell across much of Asia. Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 1.6% after Nintendo forecast a drop in net profit next fiscal year and announcement that the announcement of a successor product to its popular Switch device will be announced by March 2025.\n\nStock indices rose slightly in Europe.\n\nAP Business writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It also gave a forecasted range for bookings in the current quarter whose midpoint fell below analysts'.\n\nShopify tumbled 19.8% despite reporting better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which helps people and businesses sell things online, said its revenue growth would likely slow this quarter and that it would likely make less profit off each $1 in revenue.\n\nMatch Group sank 6.8% despite topping profit expectations. The company behind Tinder, Hinge and other apps gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that fell short of analysts. It said its efforts to make Tinder better for women and Gen Z customers in particular have hurt some performance measurements in the short term.\n\nIntel fell 2.6% after saying the U.S. Commerce Department revoked licenses for exports to a Chinese customer. That could cause its revenue for the current quarter to fall below the midpoint of the forecasted range it had earlier given.\n\nThey helped to offset Lyft, which revved 8.2% higher after topping expectations for profit and revenue. It said growth was particularly strong for early-morning, commute and weekend-evening trips.\n\nReddit was another winner and rose 4.2% after delivering its first quarterly report as a publicly traded company. It reported a milder loss and better revenue than expected, while also giving a stronger-than-expected forecast for revenue in the current quarter.\n\nArista Networks climbed 7.4% for one of the biggest gains in the S&P 500 after topping expectations for both profit and revenue.\n\nMost companies have been reporting stronger profits for the start of the year than analysts expected.

A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury recovered some of those losses to add more pressure on the stock market. It rose to 4.48% from 4.46% late Tuesday.\n\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury, which moves closer with expectations for action by the Fed, edged down to 4.82% from 4.83%.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Asia.

Wall Street shifted between small losses and gains before the opening bell as more corporate earnings arrive during what is otherwise expected to be relatively quiet week. (AP Photo/Peter Morgan)NEW YORK (AP) - Stocks are opening lower on Wall Street and threatening to end a four-day winning streak for the S&P 500. The benchmark index was down 0.4% early Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite was down 0.6%. Uber Technologies slumped after reporting worse results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Lyft revved higher after topping expectations for profit and revenue. Most companies have been reporting stronger profits for the start of the year than expected. That and newly revived hopes for interest rate cuts have helped the stock market recover from a rough April. THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below. Wall Street leaned toward small losses early Wednesday, coming off a four-day winning streak that's been driven broadly by better-than-expected earnings reports from U.S. companies. Oil prices continued their recent slide and the Japanese yen weakened further against the dollar. Futures for the S&P 500 slid 0.2% before the bell, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked down less than 0.1%. Uber tumbled 7.4% after it surprised investors with a 32 cents-per-share loss in its most recent quarter and fewer gross bookings than Wall Street expected. A day earlier, Uber rival Lyft reported better sales and profit than analysts were projecting, boosting its shares 5.6% after hours. Reddit jumped 11% in premarket after the online message board posted a smaller loss than expected as its revenue grew nearly 50% from the previous quarter on record traffic to its site. Markets have steadied after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high. Elsewhere, in Europe at midday Germany's DAX rose 0.4% and the CAC 40 in Paris jumped 0.9%. Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.3%. In Asian trading, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 lost 1.6% to 38,202.37. Nintendo Co.'s share price sank 5.4% after the company's forecasts disappointed investors and it announced that news of a successor product to its popular Switch device will be made by March 2025.

Market players are watching to see how authorities react to the yen's persisting weakness against the U.S. dollar. The dollar rose to 155.44 Japanese yen from 154.50 yen. Japanese officials have expressed concern after the yen's value slipped to 160.25 per dollar in recent days, prompting the Ministry of Finance to intervene. \"Exchange-rate moves could have a big impact on the economy and prices, so there's a chance we may need to respond with monetary policy,\"\u009d Kazuo Ueda, governor of the Bank of Japan, told lawmakers on Wednesday. A weak yen helps the profits of Japanese companies that earn much of their revenue overseas, but fluctuations in rates can upend planning and the yen's weakness has severely eroded the purchasing power of both households and businesses, pushing up costs of imports of food and energy, among other things. Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index shed 0.8% to 18,331.76 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.6%, falling to 3,128.48.

Brent crude oil, the international standard, declined $1.01 cents to $82.15 per barrel. The euro dropped to $1.0747 from $1.0755.

It was a quiet day after three consecutive jumps for the index of at least 0.9%.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average added 31.99, or 0.1%, to 38,884.26, and the Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 16.69, or 0.1%, to 16,332.56.\n\nKenvue, the company whose brands include Band-Aids and Tylenol, rose 6.4% after beating analysts' earnings and revenue forecasts in the most recent quarter.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company. fell 9.5% despite publishing results for its last quarter that were stronger than those expected by analysts. Its revenue is slightly lower than expected and the company expects its entertainment streaming business to slow down in the current quarter.\n\nThey are among the last companies to publish their results for the first three months of the year. The majority of companies have so far beaten earnings forecasts, but they subsequently don't get as big a boost in their stock prices as they usually do, according to FactSet. Additionally, companies that fail to meet earnings expectations have seen their stock prices fall more the next day than in the past.\n\nThat could suggest investors are listening to critics who have called the U.S. stock market too expensive after hitting record highs this year. For stock prices to continue to rise, either earnings will have to rise further or interest rates will have to fall.\n\nWall Street still views the latter as a possibility this year, following some events last week that traders found encouraging.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank remained closer to cutting its main interest rate than raising it, despite a series of measures. stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler than expected jobs report Friday, in the meantime, suggested to American economy could achieve the balancing act of remaining strong enough to avoid a serious recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.\n\nAfter rising earlier this year as hopes for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve faded, Treasury yields fell this month to offer some relief to the stock market.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.45% from 4.49% Monday evening. The two-year yield, which is closer to expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.82% from 4.83%.\n\nEven though long-term yields have declined over the past week, strategists at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute still expect them to remain relatively high for some time. This is partly because inflation is widely expected to remain higher than expected. Luis Alvarado, global fixed income strategist, believes the 10-year yield will likely stay close to its recent range.\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, Crocs jumped 7.8% after reporting better-than-expected profits and revenue. It benefits from strong international growth.\n\nInternational Flavors & Fragrances, which makes ingredients used in food and perfumes, gained 6.4% after reporting better-than-expected profits and revenue. It also said it expects its full-year revenue to be at the upper end of its expected range.\n\nLucid Group fell 14%1 after the electric vehicle maker reported a loss for the latest quarter that was worse than analysts expected.\n\nBuilders FirstSource fell 19% despite reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenue. The building products supplier said a weakening multifamily housing market and rising mortgage rates were creating challenges, and its forecast for the amount of cash it would generate this year was lower than some analysts' expectations.\n\nIn foreign stock markets, indices surged across much of Europe and Asia.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 54 points, or 0.1%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% higher.\n\nKenvue, the company whose brands include Band-Aids and Tylenol, rose 4.9% after topping analysts' forecasts for both profit and revenue in the latest quarter.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. sank 8.5% despite reporting stronger results for its latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell a bit shy of forecasts, and it expects its entertainment streaming business to soften in the current quarter.\n\nThey're among the tail end of companies reporting their results for the first three months of the year. The majority of companies has so far been beating forecasts for earnings, but they're not getting as big a boost to their stock prices afterward as they usually do, according to FactSet. Not only that, companies that fall short of profit expectations have seen their stock prices sink by more the following day than they have historically.\n\nThat could suggest investors are listening to critics who have been calling the U.S. stock market broadly too expensive following its run to records this year. For stock prices to climb further, either profits will need to grow more dynamically or interest rates will need to fall.\n\nThe latter still looks like a possibility on Wall Street following some events last week that traders found encouraging.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell strongly suggested the central bank is still closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.\n\nAfter charging higher through the start of this year as hopes dimmed for cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve, Treasury yields have been regressing this month to offer some relief for the stock market.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.44% from 4.49% late Monday. The two-year yield, which moves more closely with expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.81% from 4.83%.\n\nWhile yields have been declining over the last week, strategists at Wells Fargo Investment Institute still expect long-term yields to remain high for a while. That's in part because expectations are broadly for inflation to remain higher than hopes for some time. Luis Alvarado, global fixed income strategist, believes the 10-year yield will likely remain near its recent range.\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, Crocs jumped 9% after reporting better profit and revenue than expected. It benefited from strong growth internationally.\n\nInternational Flavors & Fragrances, which makes ingredients used in food and perfume, gained 5.7% after reporting better profit and revenue than expected. It also said it expects its revenue for the full year to come in at the higher end of its forecasted range.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes jumped 2.2% in Seoul and 1.6% in Tokyo but were mixed in the rest of Asia. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 advanced 1.4% after the central bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged.\n\nEuropean stock indexes also rose.\n\nAP Business Writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 93 points, or 0.2%, as of 10:50 a.m. Eastern Time, and the Nasdaq Composite Index was up 0.1%.\n\nKenvue, the company whose brands include Band-Aids and Tylenol, rose 5.9% after beating analysts' forecasts for earnings and revenue in the most recent quarter.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company. fell 9.6% despite publishing results for its last quarter that were stronger than those expected by analysts. Its revenue is slightly lower than expected and the company expects its entertainment streaming business to slow down in the current quarter.\n\nThey are among the last companies to publish their results for the first three months of the year. The majority of companies have so far beaten earnings forecasts, but they subsequently don't get as big a boost in their stock prices as they usually do, according to FactSet. Additionally, companies that fail to meet earnings expectations have seen their stock prices fall more the next day than in the past.\n\nThat could suggest investors are listening to critics who have called the U.S. stock market too expensive after hitting record highs this year. For stock prices to continue to rise, either earnings will need to grow more dynamically or interest rates will need to fall.\n\nThe latter option still appears to be a possibility on Wall Street after some events last week that traders found encouraging.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell strongly suggested that the central bank was still closer to cutting its main interest rate than raising it, despite a series of measures. stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler than expected jobs report Friday, in the meantime, suggested to American economy could achieve the balancing act of remaining strong enough to avoid a serious recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.\n\nAfter rising earlier this year as hopes for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve faded, Treasury yields fell this month to offer some relief to the stock market.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.43% from 4.49% Monday evening. The two-year yield, which is closer to expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.81% from 4.83%.\n\nEven though yields have fallen over the past week, strategists at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute still expect long-term yields to remain elevated for some time. This is partly because inflation is generally expected to remain higher than expected for some time. Luis Alvarado, global fixed income strategist, believes the 10-year yield will likely stay close to its recent range.\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, Crocs jumped 9% after reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenue. It benefits from strong international growth.\n\nInternational Flavors & Fragrances, which makes ingredients used in food and perfumes, gained 3.9% after reporting better-than-expected profits and revenue. It also said it expects its full-year revenue to be at the upper end of its expected range.\n\nLucid Group fell 11.1% after the electric vehicle maker reported a loss for the latest quarter that was worse than analysts expected.\n\nBuilders FirstSource fell 15.4% despite reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenue. The building products supplier said a weakening multifamily housing market and rising mortgage rates were creating challenges, and its forecast for the amount of cash it would generate this year was lower than some analysts' expectations.\n\nOn foreign stock markets, indices jumped 2.2% in Seoul and 1.6% in Tokyo but were mixed in the rest of Asia. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 rose 1.4% after the central bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged.\n\nEuropean stock indices also rose.\n\nAP Business writers Matt Ott and Elaine Kurtenbach

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 331.37, or 0.8%, to 39,387.76, and the Nasdaq composite added 43.51, or 0.3%, to 16,346.26.\n\nA report showing a pickup in layoffs helped to support the market. The number of workers applying for unemployment benefits rose by more last week than economists expected, though it remains relatively low compared with history.\n\nThat could be a sign the economy can pull off a hoped-for balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession, but not so strong that it puts upward pressure on inflation. Treasury yields erased earlier gains immediately after the report's release, an indication of expectations for the Federal Reserve to deliver long-sought cuts to interest rates later this year.\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, some stocks swung sharply following their latest earnings reports.\n\nEquinix jumped 11.5% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which runs data centers around the world, also said an independent investigation led by its board found no accounting inconsistencies or errors that would require financial restatements. Earlier, an investment firm had accused it of \"major accounting manipulation.\"\n\nYeti Holdings rose 12.8% after reporting better profit for the latest quarter than expected thanks to stronger sales for its drinkware and coolers and equipment. It also raised its forecast for full-year earnings per share. Like other companies, it's plowing cash into buying back its own stock, which boosts per-share profit for existing investors.\n\nCheesecake Factory gained 6.2% after topping expectations for profit. The results were encouraging following some recent warnings by big food and drink companies about how much pressure their customers, particularly lower-income ones, are feeling.\n\nAirbnb sank 6.9% despite topping expectations for profit and revenue. It gave a forecasted range for revenue in the current quarter whose midpoint fell short of analysts'. It said an earlier Easter pulled more of its business this year into the first quarter from the second quarter.\n\nBeyond Meat, the maker of plant-based meat substitutes, fell 14.4% after it posted a much worse loss than analysts expected as demand continued to crater.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.45% from 4.50% late Wednesday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.81% from 4.84% late Wednesday.\n\nA smooth auction of 30-year Treasury bonds helped to keep yields stable.\n\nTreasury yields have largely been easing since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could manage to avoid being either too hot or too cold.\n\nIt could take a while for inflation in the United States to cool all the way back to the Federal Reserve's target, even with the Fed's main interest rate at its highest level in more than two decades. Economists at S&P Global Market Intelligence slightly downgraded their forecasts for U.S. economic growth in 2025 and 2026, which they said could allow inflation to settle at the Fed's target on a sustained basis by 2027.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose in London and other markets in Europe after the Bank of England hinted it may soon cut its key interest rate from a 16-year high.\n\nIn Asia, indexes were mixed. They climbed 1.2% in Hong Kong and 0.8% in Shanghai after China reported its exports rose 1.5% in April from a year earlier, while imports jumped 8.4%. The renewed growth suggests a stronger recovery in demand than earlier data had suggested.\n\nAP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType":

It edged down by 0.03 to 5,187.67. It was coming off a very slight gain from Tuesday, which followed a big three-day winning streak.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 172.13 points, or 0.4 percent, to 39,056.39, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 29.80, or 0.2 percent, to 16,302.76.\n\nUber Technologies slumped 5.7 percent after reporting worse results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also gave a forecasted range for bookings in the current quarter whose midpoint fell below analysts' estimates.\n\nShopify tumbled 18.6 percent despite reporting better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which helps businesses sell things online, said its revenue growth would likely slow this quarter and that it would likely make less profit off each $1 in revenue.\n\nMatch Group sank 5.4 percent despite topping profit expectations. The company behind Tinder, Hinge, and other apps for connecting people gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that fell short of what analysts were expecting. It said its efforts to make Tinder better for women and Gen Z customers, in particular, have hurt some performance measurements in the short term.\n\nREAD: Tinder, other Match dating apps encourage compulsive use, lawsuit claims\n\nIntel fell 2.2 percent after saying the U.S. Commerce Department revoked licenses for exports to a Chinese customer. That could cause its revenue for the current quarter to fall below the midpoint of the forecasted range it had earlier given.\n\nTop gainers\n\nThey helped to offset Lyft, which revved 7.1 percent higher after it topped expectations for profit and revenue. It said growth was particularly strong for early-morning, commute, and weekend-evening trips.\n\nReddit was another winner and rose 4 percent after delivering its first quarterly report as a publicly traded company. It reported a milder loss and better revenue than expected, while also giving a stronger-than-expected forecast for revenue in the current quarter.\n\nArista Networks climbed 6.5 percent for the biggest gain in the S&P 500 after topping expectations for both profit and revenue.\n\nMost companies have been reporting stronger profits for the start of the year than analysts expected. That and newly revived hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve have helped the U.S. stock market to recover from its rough April.\n\nTreasury yields have largely been easing since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year.\n\nA cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.\n\nREAD: US employers scaled back hiring in April\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury recovered some of those losses. It rose to 4.49 percent from 4.46 percent late Tuesday.\n\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury, which moves closer to expectations for action by the Fed, ticked up to 4.84 percent from 4.83 percent.\n\nThe stock market also found some support following April's weakness as companies bought back more shares of their own stock, according to Mark Hackett, Nationwide's chief of investment research. He said the market's zig-zag pattern since March \"is likely to remain as we search for a catalyst.\"\n\nREAD: Asian shares mixed after calm day on Wall Street\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes fell across much of Asia. Japan's Nikkei 225 dropped 1.6 percent after Nintendo forecast that its net profit would fall in the upcoming fiscal year and announced that news of a successor product to its popular Switch device

Helping to keep the market steady was a report showing a rise in the number of U.S. workers applying for unemployment benefits, though it remains low compared with history. Treasury yields erased earlier gains after the report raised hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates this year. Across the Atlantic, the Bank of England hinted a cut to its key rate may come soon.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks are rising Thursday to pull the S&P 500 back within 1% of its record following a rough April.\n\nThe S&P 500 was 0.5% higher in late trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 321 points, or 0.8%, with less than an hour remaining in trading, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.3% higher.\n\nA report showing a pickup in layoffs helped to prop up the market. The number of workers applying for unemployment benefits rose by more last week than economists expected, though it remains relatively low compared with history.\n\nThat could be a sign the economy can pull off a hoped-for balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession, but not so strong that it puts upward pressure on inflation. Treasury yields erased earlier gains immediately after the report's release, indicating expectations for the Federal Reserve to deliver long-sought cuts to interest rates later this year.\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, some stocks swung sharply following their latest earnings reports.\n\nEquinix jumped 11.9% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which runs data centers around the world, also said that an independent investigation led by its board found no accounting inconsistencies or errors that would require financial restatements. An investment firm earlier had accused it of \"major accounting manipulation.\"\n\nYeti Holdings rose 13.6% after reporting better profit for the latest quarter than expected thanks to stronger sales for its drinkware and coolers and equipment. It also raised its forecast for full-year earnings per share. Like several other companies, it's plowing cash into buying back its own stock, which boosts per-share profit for existing investors.\n\nCheesecake Factory gained 5.4% after topping expectations for profit. The results were encouraging following some recent warnings by big food and drink companies about how much pressure their lower-income customers are feeling.\n\nAirbnb sank 6.5% despite also topping expectations for profit and revenue. It gave a forecasted range for revenue in the current quarter whose midpoint fell short of analysts'. It said an earlier Easter pulled more of its business this year into the first quarter from the second quarter.\n\nBeyond Meat, the maker of plant-based meat substitutes, fell 13.9% after it posted a much worse loss than analysts expected as demand continued to crater.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.45% from 4.50% late Wednesday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.81% from 4.84% late Wednesday.\n\nA smooth auction of 30-year Treasury bonds also helped to keep yields stable.\n\nTreasury yields have largely been easing since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the delicate balancing act and avoids getting too cold or too hot.\n\nIt could take a while for inflation in the United States to get all the way back to the Federal Reserve's 2% target, even with the Fed's main interest rate at its highest level in more than two decades. Economists at S&P Global Market Intelligence downgraded slightly their forecasts for U.S. economic growth in 2025 and 2026, and they say it may not be until 2027 that the Fed's main measure of inflation hits its target on a sustained basis.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose in London and other markets in Europe after the Bank of England hinted it may soon cut its key interest rate from a 16-year high.\n\nIn Asia, indexes were mixed. They climbed 1.2% in Hong Kong and 0.8% in Shanghai after China reported its exports rose 1.5% in April from a year earlier, while imports jumped 8.4%. The renewed growth suggests a stronger recovery in demand than earlier data had suggested.\n\nAP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed.\n\nMore from this section\n\nDataNumen Unveils DataNumen Data Recovery 3.0: Multilingual Magic and More!

The number of workers applying for unemployment benefits rose by more last week than economists expected, though it remains relatively low compared with history.\n\nThat could be a sign the economy can pull off a hoped-for balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession, but not so strong that it puts upward pressure on inflation.

The company, which runs data centers around the world, also said an independent investigation led by its board found no accounting inconsistencies or errors that would require financial restatements. Earlier, an investment firm had accused it of \"major accounting manipulation.\"\n\nYeti Holdings rose 12.8% after reporting better profit for the latest quarter than expected thanks to stronger sales for its drinkware and coolers and equipment. It also raised its forecast for full-year earnings per share. Like other companies, it's plowing cash into buying back its own stock, which boosts per-share profit for existing investors.\n\nCheesecake Factory gained 6.2% after topping expectations for profit. The results were encouraging following some recent warnings by big food and drink companies about how much pressure their customers, particularly lower-income ones, are feeling.\n\nAirbnb sank 6.9% despite topping expectations for profit and revenue.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 321 points, or 0.8%, with less than an hour remaining in trading, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.3% higher.\n\nA report showing a pickup in layoffs helped to prop up the market. The number of workers applying for unemployment benefits rose by more last week than economists expected, though it remains relatively low compared with history.\n\nThat could be a sign the economy can pull off a hoped-for balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession, but not so strong that it puts upward pressure on inflation. Treasury yields erased earlier gains immediately after the report's release, indicating expectations for the Federal Reserve to deliver long-sought cuts to interest rates later this year.\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, some stocks swung sharply following their latest earnings reports.\n\nEquinix jumped 11.9% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which runs data centers around the world, also said that an independent investigation led by its board found no accounting inconsistencies or errors that would require financial restatements. An investment firm earlier had accused it of \"major accounting manipulation.\"\n\nYeti Holdings rose 13.6% after reporting better profit for the latest quarter than expected thanks to stronger sales for its drinkware and coolers and equipment. It also raised its forecast for full-year earnings per share. Like several other companies, it's plowing cash into buying back its own stock, which boosts per-share profit for existing investors.\n\nCheesecake Factory gained 5.4% after topping expectations for profit. The results were encouraging following some recent warnings by big food and drink companies about how much pressure their lower-income customers are feeling.\n\nAirbnb sank 6.5% despite also topping expectations for profit and revenue. It gave a forecasted range for revenue in the current quarter whose midpoint fell short of analysts'.

Economists at S&P Global Market Intelligence downgraded slightly their forecasts for U.S. economic growth in 2025 and 2026, and they say it may not be until 2027 that the Fed's main measure of inflation hits its target on a sustained basis.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose in London and other markets in Europe after the Bank of England hinted it may soon cut its key interest rate from a 16-year high.\n\nIn Asia, indexes were mixed. They climbed 1.2% in Hong Kong and 0.8% in Shanghai after China reported its exports rose 1.5% in April from a year earlier, while imports jumped 8.4%.

Nintendo Co.'s stock price fell 5.2% after the company's forecast disappointed investors and it said news of a successor product to its popular Switch device would be announced soon. by March 2025.\n\nMarket participants are waiting to see how authorities will respond to the continued weakness of the yen against the US dollar.\n\nThe dollar fell from 154.50 Japanese yen to 155.14 yen. Japanese officials have expressed concern after the value of the yen fell to 160.25 to the dollar in recent days, prompting the Finance Ministry to intervene.\n\nChanges in exchange rates could have a big impact on the economy and prices, so we may need to respond with monetary policy, Kazuo Ueda, governor of the Bank of Japan, told lawmakers on Wednesday.\n\nA weak yen contributes to the profits of Japanese companies that earn much of their revenue overseas, but rate fluctuations can disrupt planning and the weakness of the yen has seriously eroded the purchasing power of households and businesses, driving up the costs of food and energy imports. among others.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.4% to 18,410.20 and the Shanghai Composite Index also lost 0.4% to 3,134.75.\n\nAustralia's S&P/ASX 200 index was little changed at 7,795.70, while South Korea's Kospi edged up 0.1 percent to 2,736.20.\n\nTaiwan's Taiex rose 0.1%.\n\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500 edged up 0.1% to 5,187.70.

Its revenue is slightly lower than expected and the company expects its entertainment streaming business to slow down in the current quarter.\n\nThey are among the last companies to publish their results for the first three months of the year. Most companies beat their earnings forecasts, but they subsequently don't get as big a boost in their stock prices as they usually do, according to FactSet. Additionally, companies that fail to meet earnings expectations have seen their stock prices fall more the next day than in the past.\n\nThat could suggest investors are listening to critics who have called the U.S. stock market too expensive after hitting record highs this year. For stock prices to continue to rise, either earnings will have to rise further or interest rates will have to fall.\n\nWall Street still views the latter as a possibility this year, following some events last week that traders found encouraging.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank remained closer to cutting its main interest rate than raising it, despite a series of stubbornly high inflation indicators this year. At the same time, a colder-than-expected jobs report released Friday suggests the U.S. economy could succeed in the balancing act of remaining strong enough to avoid a serious recession without being so strong that it keeps l inflation at too high a level.\n\nIn other trading, benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 33 cents to $78.05 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 321 points, or 0.8%, with less than an hour remaining in trading, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.3% higher.\n\nA report showing a pickup in layoffs helped to prop up the market. The number of workers applying for unemployment benefits rose by more last week than economists expected, though it remains relatively low compared with history.\n\nThat could be a sign the economy can pull off a hoped-for balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession, but not so strong that it puts upward pressure on inflation. Treasury yields erased earlier gains immediately after the report's release, indicating expectations for the Federal Reserve to deliver long-sought cuts to interest rates later this year.\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, some stocks swung sharply following their latest earnings reports.\n\nEquinix jumped 11.9% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which runs data centers around the world, also said that an independent investigation led by its board found no accounting inconsistencies or errors that would require financial restatements. An investment firm earlier had accused it of \"major accounting manipulation.\"\n\nYeti Holdings rose 13.6% after reporting better profit for the latest quarter than expected thanks to stronger sales for its drinkware and coolers and equipment. It also raised its forecast for full-year earnings per share. Like several other companies, it's plowing cash into buying back its own stock, which boosts per-share profit for existing investors.\n\nCheesecake Factory gained 5.4% after topping expectations for profit. The results were encouraging following some recent warnings by big food and drink companies about how much pressure their lower-income customers are feeling.\n\nAirbnb sank 6.5% despite also topping expectations for profit and revenue. It gave a forecasted range for revenue in the current quarter whose midpoint fell short of analysts'. It said an earlier Easter pulled more of its business this year into the first quarter from the second quarter.\n\nBeyond Meat, the maker of plant-based meat substitutes, fell 13.9% after it posted a much worse loss than analysts expected as demand continued to crater.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.45% from 4.50% late Wednesday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.81% from 4.84% late Wednesday.\n\nA smooth auction of 30-year Treasury bonds also helped to keep yields stable.\n\nTreasury yields have largely been easing since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the delicate balancing act and avoids getting too cold or too hot.\n\nIt could take a while for inflation in the United States to get all the way back to the Federal Reserve's 2% target, even with the Fed's main interest rate at its highest level in more than two decades. Economists at S&P Global Market Intelligence downgraded slightly their forecasts for U.S. economic growth in 2025 and 2026, and they say it may not be until 2027 that the Fed's main measure of inflation hits its target on a sustained basis.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose in London and other markets in Europe after the Bank of England hinted it may soon cut its key interest rate from a 16-year high.\n\nIn Asia, indexes were mixed. They climbed 1.2% in Hong Kong and 0.8% in Shanghai after China reported its exports rose 1.5% in April from a year earlier, while imports jumped 8.4%. The renewed growth suggests a stronger recovery in demand than earlier data had suggested.\n\nAP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType":

World shares are mostly higher after U.S. stocks held relatively steady on Wall Street.\n\nWall Street leaned toward small losses early Wednesday, coming off a four-day winning streak that's been driven broadly by better-than-expected earnings reports from U.S. companies.\n\nOil prices continued their recent slide and the Japanese yen weakened further against the dollar.\n\nFutures for the S&P 500 slid 0.2% before the bell, while futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked down less than 0.1%.\n\nUber tumbled 7.4% after it surprised investors with a 32 cents-per-share loss in its most recent quarter and fewer gross bookings than Wall Street expected. A day earlier, Uber rival Lyft reported better sales and profit than analysts were projecting, boosting its shares 5.6% after hours.\n\nReddit jumped 11% in premarket after the online message board posted a smaller loss than expected as its revenue grew nearly 50% from the previous quarter on record traffic to its site.\n\nMarkets have steadied after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.\n\nElsewhere, in Europe at midday Germany's DAX rose 0.4% and the CAC 40 in Paris jumped 0.9%. Britain's FTSE 100 gained 0.3%.\n\nIn Asian trading, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 lost 1.6% to 38,202.37.\n\nNintendo Co.'s share price sank 5.4% after the company's forecasts disappointed investors and it announced that news of a successor product to its popular Switch device will be made by March 2025.\n\nSony Corp. shed 5% amid speculation over a potential buyout of Paramount Global by Sony Pictures and the private equity firm Apollo Global Management.\n\nMarket players are watching to see how authorities react to the yen's persisting weakness against the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe dollar rose to 155.44 Japanese yen from 154.50 yen. Japanese officials have expressed concern after the yen's value slipped to 160.25 per dollar in recent days, prompting the Ministry of Finance to intervene.\n\n\"Exchange-rate moves could have a big impact on the economy and prices, so there's a chance we may need to respond with monetary policy,\" Kazuo Ueda, governor of the Bank of Japan, told lawmakers on Wednesday.\n\nA weak yen helps the profits of Japanese companies that earn much of their revenue overseas, but fluctuations in rates can upend planning and the yen's weakness has severely eroded the purchasing power of both households and businesses, pushing up costs of imports of food and energy, among other things.\n\nElsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index shed 0.8% to 18,331.76 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.6%, falling to 3,128.48.\n\nAustralia's S&P/ASX 200 edged 0.1% higher to 7,804.50, while the Kospi in South Korea rose 0.4% to 2,745.05.\n\nTaiwan's Taiex gained 0.2%.\n\nIn other trading, U.S. benchmark crude oil fell $1 to $77.38 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It lost 10 cents on Tuesday to $78.38 per barrel.\n\nU.S. crude prices have fallen 10% in the past month but remain about $8 per barrel higher than they were when the year began.\n\nBrent crude oil, the international standard, declined $1.01 cents to $82.15 per barrel.\n\nThe euro dropped to $1.0747 from $1.0755.\n\nOn Tuesday, the S&P 500 edged 0.1% higher in a quiet day following three straight

Its revenue is slightly lower than expected and the company expects its entertainment streaming business to slow down in the current quarter.\n\nThey are among the last companies to publish their results for the first three months of the year. The majority of companies have so far beaten earnings forecasts, but they subsequently don't get as big a boost in their stock prices as they usually do, according to FactSet. Additionally, companies that fail to meet earnings expectations have seen their stock prices fall more the next day than in the past.\n\nThat could suggest investors are listening to critics who have called the U.S. stock market too expensive after hitting record highs this year. For stock prices to continue to rise, either earnings will need to grow more dynamically or interest rates will need to fall.\n\nThe latter option still appears to be a possibility on Wall Street after some events last week that traders found encouraging.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell strongly suggested that the central bank was still closer to cutting its main interest rate than raising it, despite a series of measures. stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler than expected jobs report Friday, in the meantime, suggested to American economy could achieve the balancing act of remaining strong enough to avoid a serious recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.\n\nAfter rising earlier this year as hopes for interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve faded, Treasury yields fell this month to offer some relief to the stock market.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.43% from 4.49% Monday evening. The two-year yield, which is closer to expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.81% from 4.83%.\n\nEven though yields have fallen over the past week, strategists at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute still expect long-term yields to remain elevated for some time. This is partly because inflation is widely expected to remain higher than expected for some time. Luis Alvarado, global fixed income strategist, believes the 10-year yield will likely stay close to its recent range.\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, Crocs jumped 9% after reporting better-than-expected earnings and revenue. It benefits from strong international growth.\n\nInternational Flavors & Fragrances, which makes ingredients used in food and perfumes, gained 3.9% after reporting better-than-expected profits and revenue.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 38 points, or 0.1%, as of 9:50 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.3% lower.\n\nA report showing a pickup in layoffs helped keep the market steady. The number of workers applying for unemployment benefits rose by more last week than economists expected, though it remains relatively low compared with history.\n\nThat could be a sign the economy can pull off a hoped-for balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession, but not so strong that it puts upward pressure on inflation. Treasury yields erased earlier gains immediately after the report's release, indicating expectations for it to encourage the Federal Reserve to deliver long-sought cuts to interest rates.\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, some stocks swung sharply following their latest earnings reports.\n\nEquinix jumped 11.2% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which runs data centers around the world, also said that an independent investigation led by its board found no accounting inconsistencies or errors that would require financial restatements. An investment firm earlier had accused it of \"major accounting manipulation.\"\n\nRobinhood Markets rose 1.2% after breezing past analysts' expectations for profit and revenue. It showed broad-based growth, particularly from customers trading cryptocurrencies.\n\nAirbnb sank 6.9% despite also topping expectations for profit and revenue. It gave a forecasted range for revenue in the current quarter whose midpoint fell short of analysts'. It said an earlier Easter pulled more of its business this year into the first quarter from the second quarter.\n\nU.S.-traded shares of Arm Holdings dropped 6.6% even though it also reported better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than expected. The U.K.-based chip company gave a forecast for revenue this upcoming fiscal year whose midpoint was a bit shy of analysts' estimates.\n\nBeyond Meat, the maker of plant-based meat substitutes, fell 11.8% after it posted a much worse loss than analysts expected as demand continued to crater.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.49% from 4.50% late Wednesday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.82% from 4.84% late Wednesday.\n\nTreasury yields have largely been easing since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the delicate balancing act and avoids getting too cold or too hot.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose modestly in London and other markets in Europe after the Bank of England hinted it may soon cut its key interest rate from a 16-year high.\n\nIn Asia, indexes were mixed. They climbed 1.2% in Hong Kong and 0.8% in Shanghai after China reported its exports rose 1.5% in April from a year earlier, while imports jumped 8.4%. The renewed growth suggests a stronger recovery in demand than earlier data had suggested.\n\nAP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType":

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 321 points, or 0.8%, with less than an hour of trading remaining, and the Nasdaq Composite Index was up 0.3%.\n\nA report showing a resumption of layoffs helped support the market. The number of workers seeking unemployment benefits rose last week more than economists expected, although it remains relatively low by historical standards.\n\nThis could be a sign that the economy can achieve the hoped-for balancing act of remaining strong enough to avoid a serious recession, but not so strong as to put upward pressure on inflation. Treasury yields erased earlier gains immediately after the report was released, indicating the Federal Reserve is expected to make long-awaited interest rate cuts later this year.\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, some stocks fluctuated sharply after releasing their latest results.\n\nEquinix jumped 11.9% after announcing a profit for the last quarter that was higher than expected by analysts. The company, which operates data centers around the world, also said an independent investigation by its board of directors found no accounting inconsistencies or errors that would require financial restatements. An investment company had earlier accused him of major accounting manipulations.\n\nYeti Holdings rose 13.6% after reporting better-than-expected earnings for the latest quarter on stronger sales for its beverages, coolers and equipment. It also raised its earnings per share forecast for the full year. Like many other companies, it invests cash in buying back its own shares, which increases earnings per share for existing investors.\n\nCheesecake Factory gained 5.4% after beating profit expectations. The results were encouraging following some recent warnings from major food and drink companies about the pressure felt by their low-income customers.\n\nAirbnb fell 6.5% although it also beat expectations on profit and revenue. It gives a range of revenue forecasts for the current quarter whose midpoint is lower than analysts. He said earlier Easter had resulted in a larger share of his business this year in the first quarter compared to the second quarter.\n\nBeyond Meat, the maker of plant-based meat alternatives, fell 13.9% after posting a much worse loss than analysts expected as demand continued to collapse.\n\nOn the bond market, the yield on 10-year Treasury bills fell to 4.45% from 4.50% Wednesday evening. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.81% from 4.84% late Wednesday.\n\nA smooth auction of 30-year Treasury bonds also helped keep yields stable.\n\nTreasury yields have largely eased since Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank remained closer to cutting its main interest rate than raising it, despite a series of stubbornly high inflation indicators this year. Meanwhile, a colder-than-expected jobs report released Friday suggests the U.S. economy could strike a delicate balance and avoid becoming too cold or too hot.\n\nIn the United States, it may be some time before inflation returns to the Federal Reserve's 2% target, even though the Fed's main interest rate is at its highest level in over of two decades. Economists at S&P Global Market Intelligence have slightly lowered their forecasts for U.S. economic growth in 2025 and 2026, and estimate that it may not be until 2027 that the Fed's main measure of inflation will reach its objective in a sustainable manner.\n\nIn overseas stock markets, indexes rose in London and other markets in Europe after the Bank of England hinted it may soon cut its key interest rate from its highest level in 16 years.\n\nIn Asia, the indices were mixed. They climbed 1.2% in Hong Kong and 0.8% in Shanghai after China said its exports rose 1.5% in April from a year earlier, while imports rose 1.5% in April from a year earlier. jumped 8.4%.

Germany\u00b4s DAX rose 0.3% to 18,545.32 and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 0.1% to 8,125.56.\n\nIn Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index was down 0.3% at 38,073.98.\n\nAutomaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp.'s shares dropped 4.9% after the company forecasted a 7% lower net profit in the fiscal year that will end in March 2025.\n\nToyota Motor slipped 0.4% after it reported Wednesday that it doubled its net profit in the fiscal year that ended in March.\n\nA person looks at an electronic stock board showing Japan's Nikkei 225 index at a securities firm Thursday, May 9, 2024, in Tokyo. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko)\n\nThe U.S. dollar rose to 155.86 Japanese yen from 155.52 yen, as reports in Tokyo speculated on the likelihood of further intervention by the Finance Ministry to curb the yen's slide.\n\n\"We're always prepared to do so if necessary. We might do it today. We might do it tomorrow,\" Masato Kanda, the Finance Vice Minister for International Affairs.\n\nThe Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 1.1% to 18,511.26 and the Shanghai Composite index gained 0.8% to 3,154.32.\n\nChina reported that its exports rose 1.5% in April from a year earlier, while imports jumped 8.4%. The renewed growth suggests a stronger recovery in demand than earlier data had suggested.\n\nIn South Korea, the Kospi lost 1.2% to 2,712.14. Australia\u00b4s S&P/ASX 200 shed 1.1% to 7,721.60.\n\nOn Wednesday, the S&P 500 finished virtually unchanged after flipping between modest gains and losses through the day. It edged down by 0.03 to 5,187.67, coming off a very slight gain on Tuesday, which followed a big three-day winning streak.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.4% to 39,056.39, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2% to 16,302.76.\n\nUber Technologies slumped 5.7% after reporting worse results for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It also gave a forecasted range for bookings in the current quarter whose midpoint fell below analysts\u00b4 estimates.\n\nShopify tumbled 18.6% despite reporting better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which helps businesses sell things online, said its revenue growth would likely slow this quarter and that it would likely make less profit off each $1 in revenue.\n\nMatch Group sank 5.4% despite topping profit expectations. The company behind Tinder, Hinge and other dating apps gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that fell short of what analysts were expecting.\n\nMost companies have been reporting stronger profits for the start of the year than analysts expected. That and newly revived hopes for coming cuts to interest rates by the Federal Reserve have helped the U.S. stock market to recover from its rough April.\n\nTreasury yields have largely been easing since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession without being so strong that it keeps inflation too high.\n\nIn other trading, U.S. benchmark crude oil rose 66 cents to $79.65 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude oil, the international standard, was up 58 cents to $84.16 per barrel.\n\nThe euro dropped to $1.0734 from $1.0745.\n\nAP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed.\n\nA person stands near an electronic stock board showing Japan's Nikkei 225 index at a securities firm Thursday, May 9, 2024, in Tokyo.

It's pulled back within 1% of its record following a rough April.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 189 points, or 0.5%, as of 11 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% higher.\n\nA report showing a pickup in layoffs helped keep the market steady. The number of workers applying for unemployment benefits rose by more last week than economists expected, though it remains relatively low compared with history.\n\nThat could be a sign the economy can pull off a hoped-for balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession, but not so strong that it puts upward pressure on inflation. Treasury yields erased earlier gains immediately after the report's release, indicating expectations for it to encourage the Federal Reserve to deliver long-sought cuts to interest rates.\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, some stocks swung sharply following their latest earnings reports.\n\nEquinix jumped 11.2% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which runs data centers around the world, also said that an independent investigation led by its board found no accounting inconsistencies or errors that would require financial restatements. An investment firm earlier had accused it of \"major accounting manipulation.\"\n\nYeti Holdings rose 9.6% after reporting better profit for the latest quarter than expected thanks to stronger sales for its drinkware and coolers and equipment. It also raised its forecast for full-year earnings per share. Like several other companies, it's plowing cash into buying back its own stock, which boosts per-share profit for existing investors.\n\nCheesecake Factory gained 8% after topping expectations for profit. The results were encouraging following some recent warnings by big food and drink companies about how much pressure their lower-income customers are feeling.\n\nAirbnb sank 6.7% despite also topping expectations for profit and revenue. It gave a forecasted range for revenue in the current quarter whose midpoint fell short of analysts'. It said an earlier Easter pulled more of its business this year into the first quarter from the second quarter.\n\nBeyond Meat, the maker of plant-based meat substitutes, fell 12.5% after it posted a much worse loss than analysts expected as demand continued to crater.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.48% from 4.50% late Wednesday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.82% from 4.84% late Wednesday.\n\nTreasury yields have largely been easing since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the delicate balancing act and avoids getting too cold or too hot.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose in London and other markets in Europe after the Bank of England hinted it may soon cut its key interest rate from a 16-year high.\n\nIn Asia, indexes were mixed. They climbed 1.2% in Hong Kong and 0.8% in Shanghai after China reported its exports rose 1.5% in April from a year earlier, while imports jumped 8.4%. The renewed growth suggests a stronger recovery in demand than earlier data had suggested.\n\nAP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType":

It's pulled back within 1% of its record following a rough April.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 189 points, or 0.5%, as of 11 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% higher.\n\nA report showing a pickup in layoffs helped keep the market steady. The number of workers applying for unemployment benefits rose by more last week than economists expected, though it remains relatively low compared with history.\n\nThat could be a sign the economy can pull off a hoped-for balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession, but not so strong that it puts upward pressure on inflation. Treasury yields erased earlier gains immediately after the report's release, indicating expectations for it to encourage the Federal Reserve to deliver long-sought cuts to interest rates.\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, some stocks swung sharply following their latest earnings reports.\n\nEquinix jumped 11.2% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which runs data centers around the world, also said that an independent investigation led by its board found no accounting inconsistencies or errors that would require financial restatements. An investment firm earlier had accused it of \"major accounting manipulation.\"\n\nYeti Holdings rose 9.6% after reporting better profit for the latest quarter than expected thanks to stronger sales for its drinkware and coolers and equipment. It also raised its forecast for full-year earnings per share. Like several other companies, it's plowing cash into buying back its own stock, which boosts per-share profit for existing investors.\n\nCheesecake Factory gained 8% after topping expectations for profit. The results were encouraging following some recent warnings by big food and drink companies about how much pressure their lower-income customers are feeling.\n\nAirbnb sank 6.7% despite also topping expectations for profit and revenue. It gave a forecasted range for revenue in the current quarter whose midpoint fell short of analysts'. It said an earlier Easter pulled more of its business this year into the first quarter from the second quarter.\n\nBeyond Meat, the maker of plant-based meat substitutes, fell 12.5% after it posted a much worse loss than analysts expected as demand continued to crater.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.48% from 4.50% late Wednesday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.82% from 4.84% late Wednesday.\n\nTreasury yields have largely been easing since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the delicate balancing act and avoids getting too cold or too hot.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose in London and other markets in Europe after the Bank of England hinted it may soon cut its key interest rate from a 16-year high.\n\nIn Asia, indexes were mixed. They climbed 1.2% in Hong Kong and 0.8% in Shanghai after China reported its exports rose 1.5% in April from a year earlier, while imports jumped 8.4%. The renewed growth suggests a stronger recovery in demand than earlier data had suggested.\n\nAP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed.\n\nMore from this section\n\nTrump fined $1,000 for gag

The Dow Jones Industrial Average also rose by 54 points, or 0.1%, as of 9:35am Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite increased by 0.2%. Shares in Kenvue, the company behind brands such as Band-Aids and Tylenol, surged by 4.9% after it exceeded analysts' predictions for both profit and revenue in the latest quarter.\n\nDespite posting stronger results for its latest quarter than anticipated, The Walt Disney Co. saw its shares drop by 8.5%. Its revenue fell slightly short of forecasts, and it expects its entertainment streaming business to soften in the current quarter.\n\nThese companies are among the last to report their results for the first three months of the year. While the majority of companies have so far surpassed earnings forecasts, they're not seeing as significant a boost to their stock prices afterward as they typically do, according to FactSet.\n\nMoreover, companies that fail to meet profit expectations have seen their stock prices plummet more the following day than they have historically. Investors seem to be heeding the warnings of critics who have labelled the US stock market as overpriced following its record-breaking run this year.\n\nFor stocks to continue their upward trajectory, either profits need to see a significant increase or interest rates need to drop. The latter still appears to be a viable option on Wall Street, especially after last week's events which traders found promising.\n\nJerome Powell, Chair of the Federal Reserve, strongly hinted that the central bank is more likely to cut its main interest rate than raise it, despite persistent high inflation readings this year. Additionally, a jobs report released on Friday, which was cooler than expected, suggested that the US economy might manage to maintain stability and avoid a severe recession without fuelling excessive inflation.\n\nTreasury yields, which had been climbing at the start of the year due to diminishing hopes for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, have been retreating this month, providing some respite for the stock market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury dropped to 4.44% from 4.49% late Monday.\n\nThe two-year yield, which is more closely tied to Fed expectations, slipped to 4.81% from 4.83%. Despite yields falling over the past week, strategists at Wells Fargo Investment Institute anticipate that long-term yields will stay high for some time. This is partly due to widespread expectations that inflation will outpace hopes for a while.\n\nLuis Alvarado, a global fixed income strategist, predicts that the 10-year yield will likely hover around its recent range. In other Wall Street news, Crocs saw a 9% surge after posting better-than-expected profit and revenue, thanks to robust international growth.\n\nInternational Flavors & Fragrances, a company that produces ingredients for food and perfume, enjoyed a 5.7% boost after reporting higher than anticipated profit and revenue. The firm also projected its full-year revenue to hit the upper end of its forecasted range.\n\nOverseas, stock markets in Seoul and Tokyo jumped 2.2% and 1.6% respectively, while other Asian markets showed mixed results. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed 1.4% following the central bank's decision to maintain interest rates.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 38 points, or 0.1%, as of 9:50 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.3% lower.\n\nA report showing a pickup in layoffs helped keep the market steady. The number of workers applying for unemployment benefits rose by more last week than economists expected, though it remains relatively low compared with history.\n\nThat could be a sign the economy can pull off a hoped-for balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession, but not so strong that it puts upward pressure on inflation. Treasury yields erased earlier gains immediately after the report's release, indicating expectations for it to encourage the Federal Reserve to deliver long-sought cuts to interest rates.\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, some stocks swung sharply following their latest earnings reports.\n\nEquinix jumped 11.2% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which runs data centers around the world, also said that an independent investigation led by its board found no accounting inconsistencies or errors that would require financial restatements. An investment firm earlier had accused it of \"major accounting manipulation.\"\n\nRobinhood Markets rose 1.2% after breezing past analysts' expectations for profit and revenue. It showed broad-based growth, particularly from customers trading cryptocurrencies.\n\nAirbnb sank 6.9% despite also topping expectations for profit and revenue. It gave a forecasted range for revenue in the current quarter whose midpoint fell short of analysts'. It said an earlier Easter pulled more of its business this year into the first quarter from the second quarter.\n\nU.S.-traded shares of Arm Holdings dropped 6.6% even though it also reported better profit and revenue for the latest quarter than expected. The U.K.-based chip company gave a forecast for revenue this upcoming fiscal year whose midpoint was a bit shy of analysts' estimates.\n\nBeyond Meat, the maker of plant-based meat substitutes, fell 11.8% after it posted a much worse loss than analysts expected as demand continued to crater.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.49% from 4.50% late Wednesday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.82% from 4.84% late Wednesday.\n\nTreasury yields have largely been easing since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could pull off the delicate balancing act and avoids getting too cold or too hot.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes rose modestly in London and other markets in Europe after the Bank of England hinted it may soon cut its key interest rate from a 16-year high.\n\nIn Asia, indexes were mixed. They climbed 1.2% in Hong Kong and 0.8% in Shanghai after China reported its exports rose 1.5% in April from a year earlier, while imports jumped 8.4%. The renewed growth suggests a stronger recovery in demand than earlier data had suggested.\n\nAP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed.\n\nMore from this section\n\nTrump fined $1,000 for gag

Tokyo's Nikkei 225 saw a drop of 1.6% to 38,202.37. Shares in Nintendo Co. plunged by 5.4% after the company's forecasts failed to impress investors and it revealed that news of a successor product to its popular Switch device will be announced by March 2025.\n\nSony Corp. also experienced a 5% drop amid rumours of a potential takeover of Paramount Global by Sony Pictures and private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Market watchers are keeping a close eye on how authorities respond to the yen's ongoing weakness against the US dollar.\n\nThe dollar climbed to 155.20 Japanese yen from 154.50 yen. Japanese officials have voiced their concerns after the yen's value slipped to 160.25 per dollar in recent days, leading to intervention from the Ministry of Finance. \"Exchange-rate moves could have a big impact on the economy and prices, so there's a chance we may need to respond with monetary policy,\" Kazuo Ueda, governor of the Bank of Japan, informed lawmakers on Wednesday.\n\nA weak yen boosts the profits of Japanese firms that generate a significant portion of their revenue abroad, but rate fluctuations can disrupt planning and the yen's weakness has significantly diminished the purchasing power of both households and businesses, increasing the costs of food and energy imports, among other things.\n\nIn other parts of Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 0.7% to 18,354.11, while the Shanghai Composite index fell by 0.6%, landing at 3,129.65. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 nudged 0.1% higher to 7,804.50, while South Korea's Kospi increased by 0.4% to 2,745.05.\n\nTaiwan's Taiex saw a rise of 0.2%. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 inched 0.1% higher, reaching 5,187.70. It was a calm day following three consecutive jumps for the index of at least 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also gained 0.1%, hitting 38,884.26, while the Nasdaq composite dipped 0.1%, settling at 16,332.56.\n\nKenvue, the company behind brands such as Band-Aids and Tylenol, saw a 6.4% increase after exceeding analysts' predictions for both profit and revenue in the most recent quarter. Despite reporting stronger results for its latest quarter than analysts anticipated, The Walt Disney Co. plunged 9.5%.\n\nIts revenue fell slightly short of forecasts, and it expects its entertainment streaming business to soften in the current quarter. They are among the last batch of companies to report their results for the first quarter of the year.\n\nMost firms have surpassed their earnings forecasts, but they're not seeing as significant a boost to their share prices as they typically do, according to FactSet. Moreover, companies that fail to meet profit expectations have seen their share prices plummet more the following day than they have historically.\n\nThis could indicate that investors are heeding warnings from critics who argue that the US stock market is broadly overpriced following its record-breaking run this year. For share prices to continue rising, either profits will need to increase further or interest rates will need to decrease.\n\nWall Street still views the latter as a possibility this year, following some events last week that traders found promising. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that the central bank is closer to cutting its main interest rate than raising it, despite persistent high inflation readings this year. A jobs report on Friday that was cooler than expected suggested that the US economy might manage to remain robust enough to avoid a severe recession without being so strong that it drives inflation too high.\n\nMeanwhile, US benchmark crude oil dropped 48 cents to $77.90 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It fell by 10 cents on Tuesday to $78.38 per barrel. Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, saw a decrease of 52 cents to $82.64 per barrel. The euro experienced a slight dip, falling from $1.0755 to $1.0747.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lawrence_matheson@mirror.co.uk",

The company, which operates data centers around the world, also said an independent investigation by its board of directors found no accounting inconsistencies or errors that would require financial restatements.

The UK-based chip company gave a revenue forecast for the next financial year whose midpoint was a bit short of analyst estimates.\n\nBeyond Meat, the maker of plant-based meat alternatives, fell 11.8% after posting a much worse loss than analysts expected as demand continued to collapse.\n\nOn the bond market, the yield on 10-year Treasury bills fell slightly to 4.49% compared to 4.50% on Wednesday evening.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 331.37, or 0.8%, to 39,387.76, and the Nasdaq composite added 43.51, or 0.3%, to 16,346.26.\n\nA report showing a pickup in layoffs helped to support the market. The number of workers applying for unemployment benefits rose by more last week than economists expected, though it remains relatively low compared with history.\n\nThat could be a sign the economy can pull off a hoped-for balancing act of staying solid enough to avoid a bad recession, but not so strong that it puts upward pressure on inflation. Treasury yields erased earlier gains immediately after the report's release, an indication of expectations for the Federal Reserve to deliver long-sought cuts to interest rates later this year.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nElsewhere on Wall Street, some stocks swung sharply following their latest earnings reports.\n\nEquinix jumped 11.5% after reporting stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company, which runs data centers around the world, also said an independent investigation led by its board found no accounting inconsistencies or errors that would require financial restatements. Earlier, an investment firm had accused it of \"major accounting manipulation.\"\n\nYeti Holdings rose 12.8% after reporting better profit for the latest quarter than expected thanks to stronger sales for its drinkware and coolers and equipment. It also raised its forecast for full-year earnings per share. Like other companies, it's plowing cash into buying back its own stock, which boosts per-share profit for existing investors.\n\nCheesecake Factory gained 6.2% after topping expectations for profit. The results were encouraging following some recent warnings by big food and drink companies about how much pressure their customers, particularly lower-income ones, are feeling.\n\nAirbnb sank 6.9% despite topping expectations for profit and revenue. It gave a forecasted range for revenue in the current quarter whose midpoint fell short of analysts'. It said an earlier Easter pulled more of its business this year into the first quarter from the second quarter.\n\nBeyond Meat, the maker of plant-based meat substitutes, fell 14.4% after it posted a much worse loss than analysts expected as demand continued to crater.\n\nIn the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury eased to 4.45% from 4.50% late Wednesday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, slipped to 4.81% from 4.84% late Wednesday.\n\nA smooth auction of 30-year Treasury bonds helped to keep yields stable.\n\nTreasury yields have largely been easing since Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank remains closer to cutting its main interest rate than hiking it, despite a string of stubbornly high readings on inflation this year. A cooler-than-expected jobs report on Friday, meanwhile, suggested the U.S. economy could manage to avoid being either too hot or too cold.\n\nIt could take a while for inflation in the United States to cool all the way back to the Federal Reserve's target, even with the Fed's main interest rate at its highest level in more than two decades. Economists at S&P Global Market Intelligence slightly downgraded their forecasts for U.S. economic growth in 2025 and 2026, which they said could allow inflation to settle at the Fed's target on a sustained basis by 2027.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0 * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "nwitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "nwi.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_benefits", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment benefits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeti_Holdings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yeti Holdings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinix", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equinix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airbnb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Meat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beyond Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_Global", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P Global"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Easter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/nwitimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/fa/0fa6e740-0e37-11ef-8c06-9b494006c47d/661eaf28776bb.preview.jpg?crop=1758%2C923%2C1%2C73&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546612", "eventUri": "eng-9546612", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 452986615, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 97, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 97}}}

For real. Y'all are going to see it though. Y'all are going to see it with your own eyes. Me talking about it is just another thing, but when y'all see it in person y'all are going to feel it.\"\n\nUpgrading the options for quarterback Jared Goff has been a priority since losing all seven starts in his disastrous rookie season, and trading former starting cornerback E.J. Gaines and a second-round pick in the 2018 draft is the boldest commitment yet to that aim.\n\nIf Watkins can live up to Robey-Coleman's assessment, it becomes a worthwhile transaction, even if it also means using the franchise tag to keep him or signing him to a lucrative long-term deal as his contract expires at the end of this season.\n\nWatkins showed hints of that potential in Buffalo. He finished just 18 yards receiving shy of the 1,000-yard mark as a rookie, then followed it up with 1,047 yards and nine touchdowns in his second season despite missing three games due to injury.\n\nEven as he missed eight games last season because of a foot injury that ultimately required surgery, Watkins still averaged 15.4 yards per reception, a threshold no Rams receiver reached in 2016.\n\nSimply having Watkins on the field should make the game easier for Goff and the other receivers. Woods has first-hand experience in benefiting from the one-on-one coverage Watkins can create, and coach Sean McVay showed in Washington with DeSean Jackson that he can take advantage of a deep threat.\n\n\"I think his vertical presence and even just his threat and his name will allow defenses to play us different because you always have to have someone over the top of him,\" Woods said.\n\n\"You see in McVay's offense how he is always spreading the ball around, multiple receivers with 1,000 yards, and I think that's the same thing that helps us. We all lose targets, but I think the main goal is to win games and be productive, and I think that will help us as an offense.\"\n\nBringing in Watkins also gives Goff another experienced receiver to go with Woods and Tavon Austin, who has been limited in training camp with a hamstring injury.\n\nAdd in rookies Cooper Kupp and Gerald Everett, an athletic tight end drafted in the second round, and that should be enough of an improved supporting cast to judge what kind of strides Goff has made.\n\nWatkins is expected to arrive in Los Angeles on Saturday after catching four passes for 39 yards in the Bills' preseason opener Thursday. The Rams host the Dallas Cowboys on Saturday to begin their exhibition schedule.\n\n\"I don't even know if you can play in two games in one week, but he did a nice job last night,\" McVay said.\n\n\"We'll get him going right away, start getting him acclimated to our verbiage and our system, and looking forward to being able to get to know him a little bit better and see how he is able to absorb the material. He is certainly going to be a good addition for our offense and I think the guys are excited about it.\"\n\nWoods was shocked by the trade, with McVay informing the Rams receivers shortly before it was announced.\n\n\"Still didn't believe him,\" Woods said, \"but it's like a crazy, crazy deal.\"\n\nMore AP NFL: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356965", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T03:23:00Z", "sim": 0.8235294222831726, "source": {"uri": "dailyjournal.net", "title": "Daily Journal", "id": "141"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:23:00", "url": "http://www.dailyjournal.net/2017/08/11/fbn-rams-watkins/", "storyUri": "eng-3356965", "id": "8737628", "image": "http://d1bdhkmqqz901h.cloudfront.net/1200x630/smart/http://s3.amazonaws.com/new-smedia/4c686fa37ef04692becf7fafddfd4ed8/eb92b3acc12b40c48c37c97ff9cb099f.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "03:23:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Timing was on their side. The Rams held the No. 2 overall pick, and Sammy Watkins, Mike Evans and Odell Beckham Jr. were all among the best players available. But they chose Greg Robinson, a freakishly athletic left tackle who never quite figured it out. After three years, Robinson was gone, sent to the Detroit Lions for a sixth-round pick, and the Rams' desire for a legitimate No. 1 receiver persisted, leaving them to wonder what could have been.\n\n\"In '14, I often said, 'Wow, this might be one of the best wide-receiver drafts I've ever seen,\" Rams general manager Les Snead recalled Friday, the day he finally acquired the bona fide outside threat he long coveted. \"A handful of players were going to make major impacts in this league.\"\n\nThe Rams finally have one of those players. On the morning before their first preseason game -- at home against the Dallas Cowboys, with kickoff set for 6 p.m. PT Saturday -- they sent cornerback E.J. Gaines and a 2018 second-round pick to the Buffalo Bills and received Watkins in return.\n\nIt was the kind of trade the Rams desperately needed to make, the type that gives their offense a real chance to finally emerge as a legitimate unit.\n\nWatkins, who went fourth overall in that 2014 draft, boasts the talent of a true No. 1, boasting the NFL's fourth-most yards per reception since he came into the league. He gives rookie head coach Sean McVay a deep threat similar to what DeSean Jackson was for him in Washington. It'll create a lot of single coverage for Robert Woods, Cooper Kupp and Tavon Austin, three guys who make most of their impact in the intermediate passing game. It'll open up more running lanes for Todd Gurley, who saw his rushing yards per carry drop from 4.8 in 2015 to 3.2 last season. And it'll give second-year quarterback Jared Goff the tools he needs to succeed after a tumultuous rookie season.\n\n\"When you attack a team with your pass game, you'd like to use the width of the field and the length of the field, and that's what speed can do,\" said Snead, who also received a sixth-round pick in next year's draft from the Bills. \"It's really just trying to open the field up.\"\n\nLosing Gaines hurts the Rams. He was very good as a rookie in 2014 and was performing well throughout training camp. But newcomer Kayvon Webster, who is very familiar with Wade Phillips' system from his time in Denver, already had locked down the starting job opposite Trumaine Johnson. And younger players such as Nickell Robey-Coleman, Lamarcus Joyner, Troy Hill and Mike Jordan gave the Rams some adequate depth at the position.\n\nWhat really hurt was giving up a second-round pick, but the chances of hitting on someone like Watkins in the second round seem far less favorable than the chances of Watkins staying healthy enough to be productive.\n\nThe key is making sure this isn't only a one-year stint.\n\nWatkins is eligible for free agency after this season. The Rams and Bills had been talking about a trade like this since the early part of May, when the Bills decided not to pick up the fifth-year option on Watkins' rookie contract (the Rams did the same with Robinson). The Bills paid Watkins most of his 2017 money with a training-camp bonus. He'll cost the Rams less than $700,000 against the salary cap this season, which is roughly $1 million less than what Gaines was on the hook for. But the Rams need to figure out a way to sign Watkins beyond this season.\n\nDoing so would give the Rams enough skill-position players to build around, with Goff, Gurley, Woods and Kupp all 25 or younger and controllable for at least the next three seasons.\n\nIt's something Snead is \"definitely\" interested in.\n\n\"He's 24,\" Snead said of Watkins. \"So, you don't just do it for the now, although we do think he'll help the now. Because of the age, you'd want it to be for the future as well.\"\n\nThe Rams' offense has finished last in the NFL in yards each of the past two seasons and outside the top 20 in Defense-adjusted Value Over Average for the past decade. They know you can't be both bad and boring in Los Angeles, as they were amid a miserable 4-12 season in 2016. So they went about changing that this calendar year. They hired McVay, one of the game's brightest offensive minds, then splurged on a new left tackle in Andrew Whitworth, signed Woods, used three of their first four draft picks on pass-catchers and traded for Watkins.\n\nWatkins, a teammate of Woods in Buffalo, caught 125 passes for 2,029 yards and 15 touchdowns in 29 starts in 2014-15, seasons when the Bills' passing attack wasn't necessarily setting the world on fire. Calf and ankle injuries held Watkins back early in 2015, but he had 900 receiving yards over the final nine games that season. Foot surgery kept him out of eight games in 2016, a season he finished with only 28 catches for 430 yards. But he's healthy now, and players like him normally don't become available so young.\n\nThe Rams wanted Austin to emerge as a deep threat, but injuries -- wrist surgery in the spring, a tender hamstring in the summer -- kept him from working on a role that never seemed to fit him.

(AP) -- If the Los Angeles Rams needed someone to vouch for wide receiver Sammy Watkins before acquiring him in a trade from the Buffalo Bills on Friday, they didn't have to go very far.\n\nWide receiver Robert Woods and cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman, who both played in Buffalo for the past four seasons before signing with Los Angeles as free agents, expect the former No. 4 overall draft pick to provide a major jolt of energy to the Rams' passing offense.\n\nWoods said Watkins is \"a big, big, big-time receiver,\" while the gregarious Robey-Coleman sees him as the kind of difference-maker the Rams have lacked since the heyday of \"The Greatest Show on Turf\" when they were located in St. Louis.\n\n\"To me, in my eyes, he's a true No. 1,\" Robey-Coleman said. \"He's, like, just Sammy Watkins. For real. Y'all are going to see it though. Y'all are going to see it with your own eyes. Me talking about it is just another thing, but when y'all see it in person y'all are going to feel it.\"\n\nSponsored Content: Sign up for a free webinar as the U.S. Trade and Development Agency and Small Business Administration explore the hybrid IT environment in government.\n\nUpgrading the options for quarterback Jared Goff has been a priority since losing all seven starts in his disastrous rookie season, and trading former starting cornerback E.J. Gaines and a second-round pick in the 2018 draft is the boldest commitment yet to that aim.\n\nIf Watkins can live up to Robey-Coleman's assessment, it becomes a worthwhile transaction, even if it also means using the franchise tag to keep him or signing him to a lucrative long-term deal as his contract expires at the end of this season.\n\nWatkins showed hints of that potential in Buffalo. He finished just 18 yards receiving shy of the 1,000-yard mark as a rookie, then followed it up with 1,047 yards and nine touchdowns in his second season despite missing three games due to injury.\n\nEven as he missed eight games last season because of a foot injury that ultimately required surgery, Watkins still averaged 15.4 yards per reception, a threshold no Rams receiver reached in 2016.\n\nSimply having Watkins on the field should make the game easier for Goff and the other receivers. Woods has first-hand experience in benefiting from the one-on-one coverage Watkins can create, and coach Sean McVay showed in Washington with DeSean Jackson that he can take advantage of a deep threat.\n\n\"I think his vertical presence and even just his threat and his name will allow defenses to play us different because you always have to have someone over the top of him,\" Woods said.\n\nSEC warns TSP participants of new scam\n\n\"You see in McVay's offense how he is always spreading the ball around, multiple receivers with 1,000 yards, and I think that's the same thing that helps us. We all lose targets, but I think the main goal is to win games and be productive, and I think that will help us as an offense.\"\n\nBringing in Watkins also gives Goff another experienced receiver to go with Woods and Tavon Austin, who has been limited in training camp with a hamstring injury.\n\nAdd in rookies Cooper Kupp and Gerald Everett, an athletic tight end drafted in the second round, and that should be enough of an improved supporting cast to judge what kind of strides Goff has made.\n\nWatkins is expected to arrive in Los Angeles on Saturday after catching four passes for 39 yards in the Bills' preseason opener Thursday. The Rams host the Dallas Cowboys on Saturday to begin their exhibition schedule.\n\n\"I don't even know if you can play in two games in one week, but he did a nice job last night,\" McVay said.\n\n\"We'll get him going right away, start getting him acclimated to our verbiage and our system, and looking forward to being able to get to know him a little bit better and see how he is able to absorb the material. He is certainly going to be a good addition for our offense and I think the guys are excited about it.\"\n\nWoods was shocked by the trade, with McVay informing the Rams receivers shortly before it was announced.\n\n\"Still didn't believe him,\" Woods said, \"but it's like a crazy, crazy deal.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356965", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T03:22:00Z", "sim": 0.8156862854957581, "source": {"uri": "federalnewsradio.com", "title": "Federal News Radio", "id": "9518"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:22:00", "url": "https://federalnewsradio.com/sports-news/2017/08/rams-see-watkins-as-difference-maker-at-receiver/", "storyUri": "eng-3356965", "id": "8737538", "image": "https://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Bills_Eagles_Rams_Trades_Football_79858.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "03:22:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

In Buffalo's preseason opener Thursday, Watkins caught passes on the first three plays of the game.\n\n\"I just thought I was catching it hot,\" Watkins said. \"They were targeting me pretty quick. After the game, I was like, 'Oh, I was probably out there auditioning.\"'\n\nMaybe, maybe not, but shortly after the game, Watkins learned that he had been traded to the Rams, along with Buffalo's 2018 sixth-round pick, for cornerback E.J. Gaines and the Rams' second-round pick.\n\nWatkins arrived in Southern California on Saturday afternoon and was not in uniform for the Rams' preseason opener against Dallas at the Coliseum, but going forward, he figures to be a huge part of the Rams' offense. As soon as he learns it, that is.\n\n\"I can't wait to get on the field and figure those guys out,\" Watkins said Saturday. \"They'll learn my speed and I'll learn the way they throw, and really just learn the offense. That's the biggest thing.\"\n\nWatkins should give the Rams the speedy, downfield threat that they currently lack, particularly with Tavon Austiin sidelined with a hamstring injury. Watkins was a 1,000-yard receiver two seasons ago, but he also has been slowed by injuries, and he missed half of the 2016 season with a foot injury that required surgery.\n\nWatkins said he didn't know much about Rams coach Sean McVay, but had positive memories of McVay's offense when he worked as coordinator in Washington.\n\n\"I know they open it up pretty good, with a lot of wide receivers, so I can't wait to get in this offense,\" Watkins said.\n\nBut for how long? A few months before the trade, Buffalo declined its fifth-year contract option on Watkins, which means he would be a free agent at the end of this season. Rams general manager Les Snead said the Rams would explore signing Watkins to a new contract, but Watkins sounded somewhat less certain.\n\n\"I've got to handle my business and control what I can control on the field,\" Watkins said. \"If I go out there and have the year that I'm expecting to have, then we can talk contract. I've still got to go out there and do my job, and let those guys handle paperwork and contracts and numbers.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356965", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T18:53:00Z", "sim": 0.7921568751335144, "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "title": "The Orange County Register", "id": "1025"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "01:57:00", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/2017/08/12/new-rams-receiver-sammy-watkins-cant-wait-to-get-in-new-offense-after-trade/", "storyUri": "eng-3356965", "id": "8862084", "image": "http://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cowboys_rams_football_24319271.jpg?w=640", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "18:53:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

He was targeted with the first three plays from scrimmage in the Buffalo Bills' first preseason game on Thursday, then returned to the locker room later that night and was told he had been traded to the Los Angeles Rams.\n\n\"They were targeting me pretty quick,\" Watkins said. \"And then after the game I was like, 'Oh, I probably was out there auditioning.'\"\n\nWatkins was acquired in exchange for cornerback E.J. Gaines and a second-round pick in next year's draft. He called the deal \"a total shock,\" but also \"a blessing.\"\n\nWatkins flew west on Saturday and arrived at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum three hours before his new team would face the Dallas Cowboys in its preseason opener. The 24-year-old wide receiver still hadn't sat down with his new coach, Sean McVay, or his new quarterback, Jared Goff, and he has no idea how he will fit in this offense.\n\nBut he does know one thing.\n\n\"I'm a hundred percent healthy,\" Watkins said. \"The foot thing is out the door. I probably need to get in a little bit better shape. Other than that, I'm fine.\"\n\nWatkins is coming off two foot surgeries, in the spring of 2016 and in January of 2017. He also had hip surgery after his rookie season in 2014 and dealt with a few smaller ailments throughout 2015, but has mostly been unrestricted in training camp.\n\nThe Bills initially gave up two first-round picks and a fourth rounder to draft Watkins fourth overall three years ago, but a new regime declined the fifth-year option on his rookie contract, setting him up for free agency at the end of this season.\n\nRams general manager Les Snead said Friday that he \"definitely\" wants to figure something out long term with Watkins.\n\n\"I gotta handle my business and control what I can control,\" Watkins said. \"If I go out there and have a year that I'm expecting to have, then we can talk contract. But I still gotta go out there and do my job and let those guys handle the paperwork, contract, numbers.\"\n\nAt full health, Watkins gives the Rams the outside vertical threat they so desperately need. His ability to take the top off a coverage should open things up in the middle of the field for the likes of Cooper Kupp, Tavon Austin and Robert Woods, his former teammate with the Bills.\n\nAmong receivers with at least 100 catches over the last three years, Watkins ranks fourth in yards per catch.\n\n\"I just feel like that's been my game,\" Watkins said. \"I can be that home-run guy.\"\n\nWatkins caught 65 passes for 982 yards and six touchdowns as a rookie in 2014, then caught for 900 yards over the last nine games in 2015, finishing the season with over 1,000 yards. But serious foot issues kept Watkins out of half the games in 2016, a season that finished with only 28 catches for 430 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nSpeaking in front of the Rams' locker room on Saturday, Watkins expressed excitement about joining a McVay offense that he previously saw \"open it up a lot with a lot of wide receivers\" in Washington.\n\nWatkins was asked if he can benefit from a fresh start, and he smiled.\n\n\"Just being in L.A. can help me out,\" Watkins said. \"Nice city, nice weather.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356965", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T03:01:00Z", "sim": 0.7882353067398071, "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "title": "ESPN.com", "id": "4"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:01:00", "url": "http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/20326806", "storyUri": "eng-3356965", "id": "8865134", "image": "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0812%2Fr243413_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "03:01:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

I'm just trying to fill in the void and help this team win.\"\n\nThe former first-round pick was traded from the Buffalo Bills on Friday just one day after the team's first preseason game. Watkins joins former Bills teammate Robert Woods in Los Angeles, where, he said Saturday, he feels comfortable being the vertical threat the Rams have lacked in recent years.\n\n\"Most definitely. I just feel like that's in my game,\" Watkins said, per the Los Angeles Times' Lindsey Thiry. \"I can be that home-run guy and I'm just here to help. Honestly, I think they've got what they need as far as Robert Woods and Tavon [Austin] and the guys they drafted. I'm just here to add to that and just come here to have fun and win some games.\"\n\nWatkins' impact in the short-term should be immediate. The addition of a much-needed big-play wideout opens up first-year coach Sean McVay's offense that much more, helping replicate what he had in Washington last season. McVay intimated as much Friday.\n\nBut when it comes to Watkins' future with his new organization -- his rookie deal expires at the end of the season -- there are fewer expectations.\n\nOn his contract situation, Watkins said, per NFL Network's Andrew Siciliano, \"If I play like I should, I'll get what I deserve.\"\n\nWe'll see next week how McVay and the Rams utilize Watkins in practice, alongside Woods, Austin and rookie Cooper Kupp. Until then, Los Angeles' newest acquisition should be nose deep in his playbook.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356965", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T23:02:00Z", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "source": {"uri": "nfl.com", "title": "NFL.com", "id": "5624"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:32:00", "url": "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000829039/article/sammy-watkins-wants-to-be-that-homerun-guy", "storyUri": "eng-3356965", "id": "8867538", "image": "http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/08/12/0ap3000000829034_thumbnail_200_150.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "23:02:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Sammy Watkins' ankle had been bothering him, but it was late November in 2015, and his Buffalo Bills were very much in the playoff hunt. Watkins torched the Chiefs that Sunday, catching six passes for 158 yards and two touchdowns, all of it in the first half. He beat Sean Smith over the top for a 48-yard catch, tip-toed the sidelines for a third-down conversion, caught a 28-yard touchdown over his back shoulder, outmuscled Ron Parker to haul in another deep ball in double coverage and leapt over Smith for a 21-yard touchdown that stunned the opposing crowd.\n\n\"That's when I really seen him at his best,\" said Robey-Coleman, Watkins' teammate on the Bills these past three years before he signed with Los Angeles in April. \"He was like in 'go' mode.\"\n\nRobey-Coleman and Watkins will now be reunited with the Los Angeles Rams, by virtue of the Friday trade that sent cornerback E.J. Gaines and a 2018 second-round pick to Buffalo. Watkins gives the Rams a much-needed vertical threat to pair with a slot receiver in Cooper Kupp, a gadget receiver in Tavon Austin and a possession receiver in Robert Woods, who was also Watkins' teammate in Buffalo from 2014 to 2016. The Rams intend to eventually sign Watkins beyond this coming season and are hoping he can stay healthy.\n\nWhen he is, Robey-Coleman said, \"He's up there with Odell Beckham.\n\n\"He's a true No. 1 in my eyes. He can do quick routes; he can do intermediate routes and he can stretch the field. Even when he's not open, he's still kind of open because he finds a way to catch the ball. He's not dropping it. His hands are huge. And he's fast.\"\n\nWatkins and Beckham were part of the star-studded receiver class of 2014, which also included Mike Evans, Brandin Cooks and Kelvin Benjamin. The Bills traded up to select Watkins fourth overall, then watched him catch 65 passes for 982 yards and six touchdowns as a rookie.\n\nThen the injuries came.\n\nWatkins dealt with nagging calf and ankle ailments in 2015, though he caught for 900 yards over the last nine games to register his first 1,000-yard season. In 2016, Watkins was never himself. He had foot surgery in the spring, missed half the year, caught for 28 passes for 430 yards in eight games, then had foot surgery again in January.\n\nBut Watkins returned to Bills drills in the middle of June and looked good while making four catches for 39 yards in limited time during Thursday's preseason opener.\n\nThe Rams seem to believe he's healthy again.\n\n\"I think that's the biggest thing, to have a healthy Sammy out here,\" Woods said. \"And I think we'll have that this year.\"\n\nWoods, now the No. 2 receiver, praised Watkins' strong hands and blazing speed. He believes Watkins' presence will force defenses to leave somebody over the top, allowing a lot of one-on-one matchups for himself, Kupp and Austin, whose role no longer seems solidified.\n\n\"It's going to be hard to double guys,\" Robey-Coleman said. \"That's going to be key. It's matchups. He's going to be able to skew the matchup, because if you've got him on the backside, you've got Robert, Cooper and Tavon or somebody in there. You can't double Robert.

Sammy Watkins' ankle had been bothering him, but it was late November in 2015 and his Buffalo Bills were very much in the playoff hunt. Watkins torched the Chiefs that Sunday, catching six passes for 158 yards and two touchdowns, all of it in the first half. He beat Sean Smith over the top for a 48-yard catch, tip-toed the sidelines for a third-down conversion, caught a 28-yard touchdown over his back shoulder, out-muscled Ron Parker to haul in another deep ball in double coverage and leaped over Smith for a 21-yard touchdown that stunned the opposing crowd.\n\n\"That's when I really seen him at his best,\" said Robey-Coleman, Watkins' teammate on the Bills these last three years. \"He was like in 'go' mode.\"\n\nRobey-Coleman and Watkins have since been reunited on the Los Angeles Rams, by virtue of the Friday trade that sent cornerback E.J. Gaines and a 2018 second-round pick to Buffalo. Watkins gives the Rams a much-needed vertical threat to pair with a slot receiver in Cooper Kupp, a gadget receiver in Tavon Austin and a possession receiver in Robert Woods, who was also Watkins' teammate in Buffalo from 2014 to 2016. The Rams hope to eventually sign Watkins beyond this coming season and are hoping that he can stay healthy.\n\nWhen he is, Robey-Coleman said, \"He's up there with Odell Beckham.\n\n\"He's a true No. 1 in my eyes. He can do quick routes, he can do intermediate routes and he can stretch the field. Even when he's not open, he's still kind of open because he finds a way to catch the ball. He's not dropping it. His hands are huge. And he's fast.\"\n\nWatkins and Beckham were part of the star-studded receiver class of 2014, which also included Mike Evans, Brandin Cooks and Kelvin Benjamin. The Bills traded up to select Watkins fourth overall, then watched him catch 65 passes for 982 yards and six touchdowns as a rookie.\n\nThen the injuries came.\n\nWatkins dealt with nagging calf and ankle ailments in 2015, though he caught for 900 yards over the last nine games to register his first 1,000-yard season. In 2016, Watkins was never himself. He had foot surgery in the spring, missed half the year, caught for 28 passes for 430 yards in eight games, then had foot surgery again in January.\n\nBut Watkins returned to team Bills drills in the middle of June and looked good while making four catches for 39 yards in limited time during Thursday's preseason opener.\n\nThe Rams believe he's healthy again.\n\n\"I think that's the biggest thing, to have a healthy Sammy out here,\" Woods said. \"And I think we'll have that this year.\"\n\nWoods, now the No. 2 receiver, praised Watkins' strong hands and blazing speed. He believes Watkins' presence will force defenses to leave somebody over the top, allowing a lot of one-on-one matchups for himself, Kupp and Austin, whose role no longer seems solidified.\n\n\"It's going to be hard to double guys,\" Robey-Coleman said. \"That's going to be key. It's matchups. He's going to be able to skew the matchup, because if you've got him on the backside, you've got Robert, Cooper and Tavon or somebody in there. You can't double Robert. You might shift your focus onto Sammy, and it's going to leave open stuff for Tavon, it's going to leave open opportunities for Cooper and those guys. So if we can win those one-on-ones and beat those one-on-ones, it's going to be something to see on offense.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356965", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T12:13:00Z", "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "title": "ESPN.com", "id": "4"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "12:13:00", "url": "http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/244151", "storyUri": "eng-3356965", "id": "8788870", "image": "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2014%2F0821%2Ffan_g_watkins_b1_1296x729.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "12:13:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

a total shock,\" Watkins said about the trade that brought him to Los Angeles from the Buffalo Bills. \"But I am definitely excited and honored to be here.\"\n\nLess than 48 hours earlier, Watkins caught four passes, three in the first three plays, in a Bills preseason game. Shortly after, he was informed that he was traded.\n\n\"I just thought I was catching hot,\" Watkins said. \"I mean they was targeting me pretty quick and then after the game I was like 'Oh, I probably was out there auditioning.'\"\n\nRams coach Sean McVay expects Watkins, 6 feet 1 and 211 pounds, to provide a much-needed vertical threat for second-year quarterback Jared Goff. General manager Les Snead said acquiring a receiver with size and speed was on the agenda since last spring.\n\nTwo hours before the Rams and Dallas Cowboys kicked off in a preseason game, Watkins had yet to meet with McVay and was unsure how he would fit in the offense, but said he was familiar with the Washington Redskins' offense, where McVay spent the last three seasons as the offensive coordinator, and that he was certain he could be a deep target.\n\n\"I just feel like that's in my game,\" Watkins said. \"I can be that home run guy.\"\n\nWatkins, 24, has 153 career receptions for 2,459 yards and 17 touchdowns. He averages 16.1 yards per catch.\n\nBut he also has an injury-riddled history that caused the Bills to decline the fifth-year option on his rookie contract. Snead said the Rams \"felt comfortable\" with the risk.\n\nLast season, because of a foot injury, Watkins was limited to eight games. He caught 28 passes, two for touchdowns.\n\nWatkins said Saturday that injuries were not a concern. \"The foot thing is out the door,\" he said. \"Probably got to get in a little bit better shape, but other than that I am fine.\"\n\nWatkins will reunite with former Bills teammate Robert Woods in a position group that includes Tavon Austin, who has been sidelined because of hamstring injury, Pharoh Cooper, Mike Thomas and rookies Cooper Kupp and Josh Reynolds.\n\n\"They got what they need as far as Robert Woods and Tavon and the guys they drafted,\" Watkins said. \"I'm just here to add to that and just come here and have fun and win some games.\"\n\nHome-field advantage\n\nAt times, Saturday's game looked like a return to college for running back Justin Davis as he broke off a 32-yard run across the Coliseum grass.\n\nDavis, a standout at USC, rushed for 70 yards in nine carries.\n\nBut he also fumbled twice in a series and the Cowboys recovered the second fumble.\n\nDavis joined the Rams as an undrafted free agent, a somewhat curious choice given the depth at the position with starter Todd Gurley, the acquisition of free agent Lance Dunbar and backups Malcolm Brown and Aaron Green.\n\nBut Davis' choice has seemed to pay off.\n\nDunbar, who played five seasons with the Cowboys, was sidelined for most offseason workouts and has not participated in training camp drills because of a knee injury.\n\nDavis was inserted in the game after short appearances from Gurley and Brown.\n\nGurley rushed for two yards in four carries and Brown rushed for 25 yards in five carries.\n\nDefensive line\n\nRams defensive lineman Aaron Donald, a three-time Pro Bowl selection, continues his holdout for a renegotiated contract.\n\nFifth-year pro Michael Brockers, third-year pro Ethan Westbrooks, and Louis Trinca-Pasat, who was on the practice squad in 2015 and spent last season on the injured reserve, started against the Cowboys in new defensive coordinator Wade Phillips' 3-4 defense.\n\nThe trio helped hold the Cowboys' to a three-and-out in the first two series.\n\nEtc.\n\nKupp caught two passes for 35 yards, including a 19-yard reception and tight end Gerald Everett caught two passes for 12 yards.\n\nlindsey.thiry@latimes.com\n\nFollow Lindsey Thiry on Facebook and Twitter @LindseyThiry", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356965", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T04:01:00Z", "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "title": "Los Angeles Times", "id": "971"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "04:01:00", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-rams-report-20170812-story.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356965", "id": "8869778", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-598fce44/turbine/la-sp-rams-report-20170812", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "04:01:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

For the Rams, his arrival was an adrenaline shot for a Rams passing game still in desperate need of one.\n\nThe payoff would have to wait. Watkins knew little about the Rams offense and nothing about his expected role. He hadn't met Jared Goff, the quarterback whose career he's billed to save, or Sean McVay, the coach who plans to turn him into the No. 1 Rams have lacked since Torry Holt. He'd be forgiven, too, if he didn't know the mustachioed man in the expensive suit, shaking his hand on the sideline, was the team's owner, Stan Kroenke.\n\n\"I just can't wait to get on the field and figure those guys out,\" Watkins reiterated more than once.\n\nBut while the Rams' new No. 1 wideout watched from midfield, it was another new receiver who started his preseason on an especially impressive note.\n\nSince the Rams drafted him in the third round this past April, Cooper Kupp had already surpassed expectations. By the first day of training camp, he'd forced his way to the top of the depth chart at slot receiver, and since camp started, it was Kupp who seemed to be open, day in and day out.\n\nAs all eyes focused on Watkins on Saturday, it was Kupp again who separated himself from the pack in a 13-10 preseason victory over the Cowboys.\n\nSometimes, the separation was literal. After the Rams recovered a muffed punt early in the first quarter, Goff rolled out on a playaction boot and found Kupp wide open in the middle of the field for a 19-yard gain. Two plays later, as Robert Woods fumbled near the goal line, it was Kupp who slipped between two Cowboys and dove for the loose ball, scoring his first-ever NFL touchdown.\n\n\"When you dream of your first NFL touchdown, that's not exactly how you dream it up,\" Kupp said, after. \"But I'll take it.\"\n\nThe Rams will gladly take it, as well. Kupp's football IQ has already been a hit with McVay, who has consistently raved about his rookie wideout's development. Kupp's understanding of coverages and route concepts, McVay has said, is far more advanced than most rookies.\n\n\"He's one of those players that always seems to be in the right spot,\" McVay on Saturday. \"That's a credit to his football IQ. He's going to continue to improve. He's a very smart, conscientious player. We feel fortunate to have Cooper on our team.\"\n\nBefore Watkins was added to the picture, the Rams made a concerted effort to revamp their receiving corps during the offseason. They let starters Kenny Britt and Brian Quick walk in free agency. They signed Robert Woods, a sure-handed intermediate receiver, from the Bills. And they put their hope, again, in a breakout season from Tavon Austin, who was expected -- or, at least, paid -- to be the Rams' most dynamic wideout.\n\nAustin has so far been the only obstacle in that plan, as he's spent most of training camp nursing a hamstring injury. Woods, meanwhile, has proven reliable, but has also never been the No. 1 wideout type.\n\nWith Watkins set to join practice this week, Kupp may not have the makings of a No. 1, either. If the team has its way, their newly acquired wideout will hold onto that spot for many years to come.\n\nWatkins was the one who fans greeted with a standing ovation during Saturday's fourth quarter. He'll be the one fans anoint as their first No. 1 wideout since the days of Holt, Bruce, and the Greatest Show on Turf.\n\nThe attention will remain on Watkins going forward, and for good reason. Receivers like him are rarely available. Even Kupp said he \"couldn't wait to get on the field with him.\n\nBut as defenses hone in on the Rams' new home-run threat, it's the rookie from Eastern Washington who's determined to slip by unnoticed.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356965", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T22:32:00Z", "sim": 0.7215686440467834, "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "title": "The Orange County Register", "id": "1025"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "05:35:00", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/2017/08/12/as-watkins-watches-rams-rookie-kupp-impresses-at-wideout/", "storyUri": "eng-3356965", "id": "8876103", "image": "http://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cowboys_rams_football_24320345.jpg?w=640", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "22:32:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Gaines and a 2018 second-round pick to Buffalo. Goff found out about it when he finished a meeting on Friday.\n\n\"I look at my phone, and I have like 50 text messages,\" Goff said. \"'Sammy Watkins,' 'Sammy Watkins,' 'Sammy Watkins.' I'm like, 'What? What happened?'\"\n\nHere's what happened: The Rams gave Goff that final piece, and now it's up to him to make it work.\n\nThis calendar year has represented a seismic shift for the Rams' offense, a unit that finished last in the NFL in yards each of the last two years and outside of the top 20 in Defense-adjusted Value Over Average for the last decade. It began with the hiring of 31-year-old head coach Sean McVay, one of the brightest young minds in the game. He brought in an up-and-coming quarterbacks coach to be his offensive coordinator (Matt LaFleur) and an accomplished offensive coordinator to be his quarterbacks coach (Greg Olson).\n\nThen the Rams signed Andrew Whitworth, one of the game's best left tackles, and Robert Woods, a reliable possession receiver. They drafted an athletic tight end in Gerald Everett and a polished slot receiver in Cooper Kupp. And then, on the day before their first preseason game, they added Watkins, giving their offense the vertical threat that should open up space for everybody else.\n\n\"He obviously is a weapon,\" Goff said after Saturday's game. \"His track record speaks for itself and what we're trying to do. He's a guy that can stretch the field. That's something you take from him, obviously, right away. I also think he's not only a really good guy, but works hard, just from what I've gathered so far. I'm excited to get him here, excited to get to work, and just briefly talking with him over the phone and on the sideline really quickly, just getting a feel for him, he seems like a really friendly guy who's excited for a fresh start.\"\n\nNobody really knows what to expect from Goff in his second season. He struggled so much as a rookie -- 54.6 percent completion percentage, 5.3 yards per attempt, 22.2 Total QBR -- but he also had so little to work with. The offensive line was bad, the receiving corps was underwhelming, the running game was non-existent, and the coaching staff was devoid of experience grooming NFL quarterbacks.\n\nBy the end of this year, though, we should finally have a much better feel for who Goff is -- because he finally has a chance to succeed.\n\n\"You never know if you have what you need until the season, but right now, I think it's definitely something to be excited about,\" veteran offensive lineman Rodger Saffold said of what the Rams have added to their weakest department. \"I've got a lot of confidence in our team, and it's exciting to know the potential that we have with all these new pieces.\"\n\nGoff made some nice throws when the Rams got the ball back in enemy territory. He ran play action, rolled to his right, then connected with Kupp on a crossing route for a 19-yard gain, putting the Rams in the red zone. He then hit Woods on a quick slant, which resulted in the fumble that Kupp fell on for a touchdown. Goff's only incompletion came on the first play from scrimmage, a wobbly throw to Woods that fell short. He lamented that to McVay as soon as he returned to the sidelines, which impressed the rookie head coach.\n\n\"Those are the kind of expectations that we have for him,\" McVay said. \"We expect him to have them for himself, and he does.\"\n\nGoff and Watkins can't really begin to work together until Monday, at which point they will have less than four weeks to prepare for a season. But Goff isn't worried. He believes their chemistry will forge quickly.\n\nThe question is whether he can eventually make it all work.\n\n\"You start stacking guys up, you start building a pretty good roster,\" Goff said of his weapons, a list that also includes running back Todd Gurley and gadget receiver Tavon Austin. \"I'm excited to see what [Watkins] can do, like the other guys.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356965", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T13:52:00Z", "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "title": "ESPN.com", "id": "4"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "13:52:00", "url": "http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/244253", "storyUri": "eng-3356965", "id": "8922802", "image": "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0813%2Fr243584_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "13:52:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Just winning any game at the Coliseum was a step for the Rams, who lost the final six home contests of their relocation season last fall.\n\n\"It's a good one to learn from, and I was happy with the win for us,\" Goff said.\n\nThe Rams punted after Goff's first three plays, but Josh Forrest recovered the Cowboys' muffed return. Robert Woods then caught Goff's pass and fumbled near the goal line moments later, but rookie Cooper Kupp recovered for a score.\n\nLos Angeles' offense put up 271 yards with Sean McVay calling the plays on his first day on the sideline as the youngest head coach in modern NFL history. While Sean Mannion played most of the game and passed for 144 yards, Goff used the night as a learning opportunity.\n\n\"I was trying to do my best to help Sean, and then just try to talk to guys, keep those guys encouraged,\" Goff said.\n\nDak Prescott, Dez Bryant and Ezekiel Elliott were among several starters sitting out for the Cowboys, who didn't manage a first down until the second quarter and got just nine first downs all game. Elliott was given a six-game suspension by the NFL on Friday for injuring his girlfriend in July 2016.\n\n\"We talked to the team about the situation and the importance of focusing on what we can control,\" Dallas coach Jason Garrett said of Elliott's troubles. \"We can't control what the NFL does, and it's not my place to comment on whether I think it's justified. ... We suspected something like this might happen. We prepared our team accordingly by building it the right way.\"\n\nElliott and Prescott worked out on the Coliseum field before the game and then watched from the sideline in uniform. The Cowboys threw 41 passes in Elliott's absence, and Darren McFadden was their top ball-carrier with only six rushes.\n\nBIG TIME RUSH: Rookie Cooper Rush threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Rico Gathers in the third quarter while completing his first eight passes for the Cowboys.\n\nKellen Moore went 8 for 17 in the first half for the Cowboys, but the offense perked up for Rush, the four-year starter at Central Michigan. Rush also caught the eye of Garrett during the Hall of Fame Game last week, and his exceptional touch on the TD throw to Gathers was undeniably impressive.\n\nRush went 9 of 11 for 104 yards. Gathers scored in his second straight game.\n\nBUTTERFINGERS: The Rams hung in despite alarming ball security. Los Angeles fumbled six times, but recovered its own fumble four times before losing the last two. Rookie running back Justin Davis looked good while running for 70 yards in his college stadium, but he also fumbled twice.\n\nBIG HIT: Dallas rookie Taco Charlton got his first sack, downing Mannion in the first quarter. The Michigan product took a bit of light criticism after a quiet debut in the Hall of Fame Game. \"It looked like he was making some strides,\" Garrett said.\n\nNEW GUY: Rams receiver Sammy Watkins watched from the sideline in sweats after arriving in LA earlier in the day. The Rams traded a second-round pick and cornerback E.J. Gaines to Buffalo for the playmaking wideout. Watkins got a big ovation when he appeared on the scoreboard. \"He's obviously a weapon,\" Goff said. \"His track record speaks for itself, what he's able to do.\"\n\nCOOOOOP: Kupp was busy in his first professional game, making two early catches for 35 yards and scoring LA's only touchdown while lining up all over McVay's formations. The Rams chose the prolific Eastern Washington product in the third round, hoping to add playmakers to the NFL's worst offense.\n\nINJURY: Dallas tight end Connor Hamlett was taken off the field on a cart, and he left the locker room on crutches with his right foot in a walking boot.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-07-", "textEnd": 1737, "textStart": 1728}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356965", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T13:54:00Z", "sim": 0.7098039388656616, "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "title": "Associated Press", "id": "963"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "14:06:00", "url": "http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/F/FBN_COWBOYS_RAMS_CAOL-?SITE=COCOL&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT", "storyUri": "eng-3356965", "id": "8924585", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "13:54:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Before that, he has to get comfortable. And that may take a little while.\n\nWhen he spoke to reporters, Watkins still hadn't met coach Sean McVay or quarterback Jared Goff.

He could fill a gap for now, or he might be a long-term answer at wide receiver. They, along with Tyler Higbee, Tavon Austin and Pharoh Cooper, would provide much-needed weaponry for Goff.\n\nDRAFT - One of the best parts of playing fantasy is the draft. The counter would be that Matthews is a slot receiver - not an exceptionally explosive one relative to some others out there - and paying big money for a player who might end up being the team's third receiving option doesn't make sense, especially if they want to extend Alshon Jeffery beyond this year. We got Anquan, who we added.\n\nA difference maker, if you will. Even when he's not open, he's still kind of open because he finds a way to catch the ball.\n\nSo the Rams reluctantly tabled the item until next offseason.\n\nBuffalo was busy on the trade front, also shipping Sammy Watkins and a sixth-round draft pick to the Los Angeles Rams in exchange for cornerback E.J. Gaines and a second-round pick in the 2018 NFL Draft.\n\nWatkins has dealt with a rash of injuries throughout his career, but he's seemingly put them behind him. The addition of Watkins will likely shift the two back into the roles they played with the Bills, with Woods being more of a possession receiver; Woods had 51 receptions for 613 yards and one touchdown a year ago.\n\nSimply having Watkins on the field should make the game easier for Goff and the other receivers.\n\nWatkins is expected to arrive in Los Angeles on Saturday after catching four passes for 39 yards in the Bills' preseason opener Thursday. Yes they drafted Nathan Peterman but it's impossible to think he's the future of this team.\n\nTo me, the big victor here is Gurley. QB Tyrod Taylor will have to rely more than ever on McCoy in the offense in the early going as he starts to build a new rapport with the incoming Jordan Matthews.\n\nWoods was shocked by the trade, with McVay informing the Rams receivers shortly before it was announced.\n\nThe Rams' to-do list was daunting on New Year's Day. The Buffalo Bills haven't made a postseason appearance since the team was stunned by the Tennessee Titans via the \"Music City Miracle\" in the 1999 AFC Wild Card Playoffs.\n\nBut as the regular season approaches, there is genuine reason to believe things have changed for the better.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356965", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T21:02:00Z", "sim": 0.6980392336845398, "source": {"uri": "aliveforfootball.com", "title": "aliveforfootball.com", "id": "18447"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:32:00", "url": "http://aliveforfootball.com/2017/08/sammy-watkins-jordan-matthews-trades-shake-up-wr-rankings/", "storyUri": "eng-3356965", "id": "8867627", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "21:02:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Rush also caught the eye of Garrett during the Hall of Fame Game last week, and his exceptional touch on the TD throw to Gathers was undeniably impressive.\n\nRush went 9 of 11 for 104 yards. Gathers scored in his second straight game.\n\nBUTTERFINGERS: The Rams hung in despite alarming ball security. Los Angeles fumbled six times, but recovered its own fumble four times before losing the last two. Rookie running back Justin Davis looked good while running for 70 yards in his college stadium, but he also fumbled twice.\n\nBIG HIT: Dallas rookie Taco Charlton got his first sack, downing Mannion in the first quarter. The Michigan product took a bit of light criticism after a quiet debut in the Hall of Fame Game. \"It looked like he was making some strides,\" Garrett said.\n\nNEW GUY: Rams receiver Sammy Watkins watched from the sideline in sweats after arriving in LA earlier in the day. The Rams traded a second-round pick and cornerback E.J. Gaines to Buffalo for the playmaking wideout. Watkins got a big ovation when he appeared on the scoreboard. \"He's obviously a weapon,\" Goff said. \"His track record speaks for itself, what he's able to do.\"\n\nCOOOOOP: Kupp was busy in his first professional game, making two early catches for 35 yards and scoring LA's only touchdown while lining up all over McVay's formations. The Rams chose the prolific Eastern Washington product in the third round, hoping to add playmakers to the NFL's worst offense.\n\nINJURY: Dallas tight end Connor Hamlett was taken off the field on a cart, and he left the locker room on crutches with his right foot in a walking boot.\n\nMore AP NFL: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-07-", "textEnd": 1732, "textStart": 1723}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356965", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T06:07:00Z", "sim": 0.6901960968971252, "source": {"uri": "therepublic.com", "title": "The Republic", "id": "159"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:07:00", "url": "http://www.therepublic.com/2017/08/13/fbn-cowboys-rams/", "storyUri": "eng-3356965", "id": "8877855", "image": "http://d1bdhkmqqz901h.cloudfront.net/1200x630/smart/http://s3.amazonaws.com/new-smedia/3d71832bf6774de4bfd3e91c6ccffafe/7ccdc14332a8493f88a163fef2a4c5fb.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "06:07:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

The Cowboys threw 41 passes in Elliott's absence, and Darren McFadden was their top ball-carrier with only six rushes.\n\nBIG TIME RUSH: Rookie Cooper Rush threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Rico Gathers in the third quarter while completing his first eight passes for the Cowboys.\n\nKellen Moore went 8 for 17 in the first half for the Cowboys, but the offense perked up for Rush, the four-year starter at Central Michigan. Rush also caught the eye of Garrett during the Hall of Fame Game last week, and his exceptional touch on the TD throw to Gathers was undeniably impressive.\n\nRush went 9 of 11 for 104 yards. Gathers scored in his second straight game.\n\nBUTTERFINGERS: The Rams hung in despite alarming ball security. Los Angeles fumbled six times, but recovered its own fumble four times before losing the last two. Rookie running back Justin Davis looked good while running for 70 yards in his college stadium, but he also fumbled twice.\n\nBIG HIT: Dallas rookie Taco Charlton got his first sack, downing Mannion in the first quarter. The Michigan product took a bit of light criticism after a quiet debut in the Hall of Fame Game. \"It looked like he was making some strides,\" Garrett said.\n\nNEW GUY: Rams receiver Sammy Watkins watched from the sideline in sweats after arriving in LA earlier in the day. The Rams traded a second-round pick and cornerback E.J. Gaines to Buffalo for the playmaking wideout. Watkins got a big ovation when he appeared on the scoreboard. \"He's obviously a weapon,\" Goff said. \"His track record speaks for itself, what he's able to do.\"\n\nCOOOOOP: Kupp was busy in his first professional game, making two early catches for 35 yards and scoring LA's only touchdown while lining up all over McVay's formations. The Rams chose the prolific Eastern Washington product in the third round, hoping to add playmakers to the NFL's worst offense.\n\nINJURY: Dallas tight end Connor Hamlett was taken off the field on a cart, and he left the locker room on crutches with his right foot in a walking boot.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-07-", "textEnd": 2083, "textStart": 2074}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356965", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T09:25:00Z", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "source": {"uri": "shreveporttimes.com", "title": "shreveporttimes.com", "id": "11809"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "14:00:00", "url": "http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/sports/nfl/cowboys/2017/08/13/cowboys-stars-sit-loss-rams/562880001/", "storyUri": "eng-3356965", "id": "8923790", "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/shreveporttimes.png", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "09:25:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Watkins and former Bills teammate Robert Woods will be the Rams' primary receivers. Their slot receiver is Cooper Kupp, a rookie out of Eastern Washington who already looks to have solidified a role.\n\nBut the Rams stress that they'll find a place for Austin.\n\n\"Tavon is a fast kid,\" Snead said at a charity luncheon in downtown Los Angeles. \"Jimmy Johnson probably said it best, long before I was in football: Speed is important. So having fast people on your team, you never have too many of those.\"\n\nAustin signed a four-year, $42 million extension weeks before the start of the 2016 season. But he gained only 668 yards from scrimmage that year, which actually represented his second-highest total in four seasons. The Rams then brought in a new head coach (Sean McVay), signed one primary receiver (Woods) and traded for another (Watkins). They also have selected seven wide receivers and tight ends in the past two drafts.\n\nAustin, meanwhile, hasn't been able to get on the field.\n\nWrist surgery in the spring made him a spectator while the Rams went about their offseason program. The 26-year-old was a full participant at the start of training camp, but a hamstring injury has kept him out of practice for the last 11 days. And it's hard to envision his role once he returns.\n\nAustin always has made an impact on punt returns, but he has hardly ever been an ideal fit on offense. His blazing speed screams vertical threat, but his height (5-foot-8) does not. Former Rams coach Jeff Fisher used Austin mostly as a gadget receiver the past four seasons. He made 75 of his 181 catches behind the line of scrimmage and carried the ball 125 times out of the backfield. His best season was 2015, when he gained 907 yards from scrimmage. But unless Austin supplants Kupp as the slot receiver -- seemingly unlikely -- it's hard to see him getting the snaps to produce like that again.\n\nHe still can return punts, be on the field on four-receiver sets and perhaps even emerge as an option out of the backfield, but his role won't match his pay.\n\nAustin will cost the Rams close to $15 million toward the salary cap this season, after which the Rams can cut ties with him and absorb only $5 million toward the cap. That's why this was going to be an important season for Austin, and why it now seems his days with the Rams are numbered. But Snead said he still sees Austin as an effective player when he gets the ball in space -- and having more weapons theoretically will allow him to get the ball in space more often.\n\n\"It's we, not me,\" Snead said, echoing McVay's rallying cry for this team. \"It's not just one player; it's not just one star. It's a group. I would love to have a Gonzaga basketball team, where everybody complements each other. Some days it's one person, some days it's another. The sum of the parts is better than the individual.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356965", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T02:25:00Z", "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "title": "ESPN.com", "id": "4"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "02:25:00", "url": "http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/244090", "storyUri": "eng-3356965", "id": "8733275", "image": "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2016%2F1222%2Fr165169_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "02:25:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

The first time you heard that Sammy Watkins had been traded you feared for the worst. You heard the phrase \"has been traded\" and you likely filled in the rest yourself, \"to the IR.\" The curveball here wasn't just the fact that Watkins is fine, but that he's been traded to the Los Angeles Rams. Now that the dust has settled, most of us are wondering about the fantasy implications of the trade.\n\nIt's not often that you hear that moving to LA is a downgrade, but that's the case here. Watkins went from facing the secondaries of the NFC South and teams like the Jets (twice) to the tough NFC West. Don't get me wrong. Watkins had his fair share of tough match ups when he was with the Bills (most notably facing the improved Patriots' secondary twice), but his updated schedule includes a brutal week 5 through 15 stretch. During these weeks Watkins faces the following secondary ranks (according to Pro Football Focus): #1 (NYG), #3 twice (SEA), #6 (JAC), #8 (MIN), #11 twice (ARI), and #13 (HOU). In short, as Warren Sharp put it, Watkins could be a sell-high candidate this year.\n\nJared Goff will need to improve in order for Watkins to be a sell-high candidate, or hopefully more. When you look at the numbers, there is no doubt that going from Tyrod Taylor to Goff is a downgrade. Using Warren Sharp's directional passer rating tool, there is a remarkable difference between the two passers. In fact, Goff had a higher passer rating in only one zone: deep left (twelve attempts). Even more discouraging is how often Goff threw short of the sticks. Last season Goff threw short of the line to gain 80% of the time with an average first down rate of 15%. That's not good. In fact, that's a RoboCop 3 kind of terrible. Goff's predilection to throw short is bad news for a wide receiver who, according to NFL's Matt Harmon, ran the nine (the go route) more than any other in the route tree.\n\nHowever, there is a glimmer of hope for the Goff-Watkins pairing. Since Goff took over as the starter, he targeted Kenny Britt, his top WR, nearly eight times a game. In contrast, last season Watkins averaged six and a half targets per game. If Goff keeps up that rate, and if Watkins plays a full sixteen games, Watkins will be on track for around 125 targets for the season. If he had those targets last season, he would have ranked 21st (four behind Julio Jones) in that category.\n\nJared Goff, on the other hand, definitely benefits from this trade. It's not everyday that a former top draft pick joins your offense. As far as what Watkins will bring to the offense, Matt Harmon notes that the new Ram wide receiver is quite good at seven routes: screen, slant, flat, comeback, dig, post, and the nine. Watkins does need to improve on his contested catch conversion rate, which has remained below league average. Outside of contested catches, Harmon also notes that Watkins has above average success rates versus both man and zone coverages. Essentially, this confirms what we pretty much already knew: when Watkins is on the field, he is #goodatfootball.\n\nThe person getting bad news here isn't Goff, it's Robert Woods. Woods, who was slated to be the top WR, has to make room for Watkins. Given Goff's struggles last year, there are doubts that the Rams' offense can support two fantasy wide receivers that are worth starting. Now, if Goff can take a decent step forward, things would change for the Rams. It might not be enough to thrust Woods into fantasy lore, but it certainly would help Watkins and Todd Gurley.\n\nGurley logically stands to benefit from Watkins's arrival. \"Logically\" is the operative word here. There is essentially no proof of how Gurley performs with a top level wide receiver in the NFL. Well technically that's not true, but that would include watching the Pro Bowl, which is about as fun as putting down a beloved dog. Seriously. The Pro Bowl is the equivalent of watching Dads re-runs on a loop. I'm sure there's a demographic out there that enjoys it, but they ought to be too ashamed to admit it.\n\nThe Watkins arrival likely means that defenses will have to respect the pass more. In theory, this should mean good things for the running game; however, according to Playerprofiler.com, only 4.7% of Gurley's carries came against a stacked front. His struggles were less about facing stacked fronts, and more about the offensive line and quarterback play. In reality, Gurley will also need Goff to take a step forward in order to reclaim his prior success.\n\nThe deal that sent Watkins to Los Angeles hurt his fantasy value for the upcoming season. Goff now throws the ball to Watkins, which isn't great for a number of reasons. Watkins also faces a truly rough stretch of secondaries. While injuries may change the look of his schedule, it's never a good idea to bank on such changes. If you haven't drafted yet, you need to drop Watkins down in your fantasy rankings.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356965", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T23:02:00Z", "sim": 0.658823549747467, "source": {"uri": "lastwordonprofootball.com", "title": "Last Word on Pro Football", "id": "19195"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:32:00", "url": "http://lastwordonprofootball.com/2017/08/12/the-fantasy-impact-of-the-sammy-watkins-trade/", "storyUri": "eng-3356965", "id": "8867549", "image": "http://lwosonnfl.ms.lastwordonsports.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2017/08/Sammy-Watkins.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "23:02:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Maybe by his sophomore year ....\n\n\"We had a guy named (Marquan) Jones who was going to start,\" said Tajh Boyd, the quarterback. \"We'd all heard about how good Sammy was but nobody had seen it yet.\n\n\"Our first 7-on-7, I went back and threw it as far as I could, and Sammy got it and scored a touchdown. We all got excited and then we looked at Jones and said, 'Sorry about that, bro.' Because from then on, Sammy was playing.\"\n\nSammy kept playing. He was a first-team All-American as a freshman. Only three other guys had done that: Herschel Walker, Marshall Faulk and Adrian Peterson.\n\nAs a junior he caught 102 passes and scalded Ohio State with 16 catches and 227 yards, an Orange Bowl record.\n\nClemson was already on the map. Watkins and Boyd turned it into a globe and made it spin. Boyd, in fact, was the scout team quarterback last December, imitating Jalen Hurts, when Clemson prepared for and beat Alabama for the College Football Playoff championship.\n\nWatkins was the fourth overall draft pick in 2014. Buffalo traded two first-round picks and a fourth to get him.\n\nHe was a Sure Thing in a league that doesn't believe in them, that subjects its receiving geniuses to the whims of injury and quarterbacking. Watkins had too many of the former, not enough of the latter. He wasn't playing anymore, at least not enough, and on Friday he was traded to the Rams. Even in a league that disposes of its players like blue razor blades, this was news that made you blink.\n\n\"This is the best thing that ever happened to (Rams quarterback) Jared Goff,\" Boyd said. \"You got Todd Gurley in the backfield. You got Robert Woods and Pharoh Cooper out wide, plus those tight ends. You've improved your offensive line. Now you got Sammy. You got to get him on your fantasy team right now. They've taken their offense and turned it into a Ferrari. There aren't many players or people like Sammy..\"\n\nAnd then Sammy couldn't play any more, or not often enough. He missed 11 games in his first two years.\n\n\"Guys with that type of speed, they're going to have foot problems,\" Boyd said. \"The fast-twitch guys all go through it.\"\n\nLast season Watkins made it through a 16-game schedule and caught 65 balls for six touchdowns. Fourteen of those plays went for 20 or more yards. Four went for 40-plus, and only 10 NFL receivers had more of those.\n\nStill, Buffalo had a chance to sign him for a fifth year and enter a whole new world of financial obligation. It declined. It took cornerback C.J. Gaines and a second-round 2018 pick instead.\n\nThe Bills' other maneuverings on Friday let them with two picks in each of the first three rounds next year. Meanwhile, the Rams had to live without a first-round pick in 2017 and now don't have their 2nd-rounder next year, which could be a player in the mid-30s on the draft board.\n\nOne can hardly criticize General Manager Les Snead for going high for such a runaway player. Last year Kenny Britt nudged his way to 1,002 receiving yards. That made him the first Ram wideout to get to 1,000 since Torrey Holt in 2007.\n\nWatkins broke 1,000 two years ago. He is 24 years old. He suffered through quarterbacking and coaching instability in Buffalo. And, yes, he gives Gurley a chance to run against normally populated defensive boxes, behind a better line in a more 21st-century system. At least that's the theory..\n\nBut what do Bills GM Brandon Beane and Coach Sean McDermott know that the Rams don't? Did they lose confidence in Watkins' long-term health?\n\nTheir quarterback, Tyrod Taylor, is far more established than Goff is, and Buffalo's playoff drought is longer than the Rams'. By resume and physical gifts, Watkins should be an untouchable player. Apparently not.\n\nWith Goff and Watkins the Rams gave up prime draft position. There is football soundness in those moves, but there is also marketing.\n\nLast year the Rams had to deepen their L.A. footprint. This year they have to fight the Chargers (and Dodgers, USC and Lakers) for public awareness. Season tickets are available, as the ubiquitous billboards tell you, and the Rams need an identity other than The Last Team To Lose To Colin Kaepernick.\n\nIt may come down to whether the Ferrari can survive the warranty.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356965", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T17:35:00Z", "sim": 0.6509804129600525, "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "title": "The Orange County Register", "id": "1025"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "00:37:00", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/2017/08/12/sammy-watkins-once-a-ferrari-joins-l-a-traffic/", "storyUri": "eng-3356965", "id": "8858171", "image": "http://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cowboys_rams_football_24318817.jpg?w=640", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "17:35:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Just winning any game at the Coliseum was a step for the Rams, who lost the final six home contests of their relocation season last fall.\n\n\"It's a good one to learn from, and I was happy with the win for us,\" Goff said.\n\nThe Rams punted after Goff's first three plays, but Josh Forrest recovered the Cowboys' muffed return. Robert Woods then caught Goff's pass and fumbled near the goal line moments later, but rookie Cooper Kupp recovered for a score.\n\nLos Angeles' offense put up 271 yards with Sean McVay calling the plays on his first day on the sideline as the youngest head coach in modern NFL history. While Sean Mannion played most of the game and passed for 144 yards, Goff used the night as a learning opportunity.\n\n38\n\nView Gallery Gallery: Dallas Cowboys fall in preseason play 13-10 to the Los Angeles Rams\n\nRichard Mackson-USA TODAY Sports | Richard Mackson\n\n\"I was trying to do my best to help Sean, and then just try to talk to guys, keep those guys encouraged,\" Goff said.\n\nDak Prescott, Dez Bryant and Ezekiel Elliott were among several starters sitting out for the Cowboys, who didn't manage a first down until the second quarter and got just nine first downs all game. Elliott was given a six-game suspension by the NFL on Friday for injuring his girlfriend in July 2016.\n\n\"We talked to the team about the situation and the importance of focusing on what we can control,\" Dallas coach Jason Garrett said of Elliott's troubles. \"We can't control what the NFL does, and it's not my place to comment on whether I think it's justified. ... We suspected something like this might happen. We prepared our team accordingly by building it the right way.\"\n\nElliott and Prescott worked out on the Coliseum field before the game and then watched from the sideline in uniform. The Cowboys threw 41 passes in Elliott's absence, and Darren McFadden was their top ball-carrier with only six rushes.\n\nBIG TIME RUSH: Rookie Cooper Rush threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Rico Gathers in the third quarter while completing his first eight passes for the Cowboys.\n\nKellen Moore went 8 for 17 in the first half for the Cowboys, but the offense perked up for Rush, the four-year starter at Central Michigan. Rush also caught the eye of Garrett during the Hall of Fame Game last week, and his exceptional touch on the TD throw to Gathers was undeniably impressive.\n\nRush went 9 of 11 for 104 yards. Gathers scored in his second straight game.\n\nBUTTERFINGERS: The Rams hung in despite alarming ball security. Los Angeles fumbled six times, but recovered its own fumble four times before losing the last two. Rookie running back Justin Davis looked good while running for 70 yards in his college stadium, but he also fumbled twice.\n\nBIG HIT: Dallas rookie Taco Charlton got his first sack, downing Mannion in the first quarter. The Michigan product took a bit of light criticism after a quiet debut in the Hall of Fame Game. \"It looked like he was making some strides,\" Garrett said.\n\nNEW GUY: Rams receiver Sammy Watkins watched from the sideline in sweats after arriving in LA earlier in the day. The Rams traded a second-round pick and cornerback E.J. Gaines to Buffalo for the playmaking wideout.

Just winning any game at the Coliseum was a step for the Rams, who lost the final six home contests of their relocation season last fall.\n\n\"It's a good one to learn from, and I was happy with the win for us,\" Goff said.\n\nThe Rams punted after Goff's first three plays, but Josh Forrest recovered the Cowboys' muffed return. Robert Woods then caught Goff's pass and fumbled near the goal line moments later, but rookie Cooper Kupp recovered for a score.\n\nLos Angeles' offense put up 271 yards with Sean McVay calling the plays on his first day on the sideline as the youngest head coach in modern NFL history. While Sean Mannion played most of the game and passed for 144 yards, Goff used the night as a learning opportunity.\n\n\"I was trying to do my best to help Sean, and then just try to talk to guys, keep those guys encouraged,\" Goff said.\n\nDak Prescott, Dez Bryant and Ezekiel Elliott were among several starters sitting out for the Cowboys, who didn't manage a first down until the second quarter and got just nine first downs all game. Elliott was given a six-game suspension by the NFL on Friday for injuring his girlfriend in July 2016.\n\n\"We talked to the team about the situation and the importance of focusing on what we can control,\" Dallas coach Jason Garrett said of Elliott's troubles. \"We can't control what the NFL does, and it's not my place to comment on whether I think it's justified. ... We suspected something like this might happen. We prepared our team accordingly by building it the right way.\"\n\nElliott and Prescott worked out on the Coliseum field before the game and then watched from the sideline in uniform. The Cowboys threw 41 passes in Elliott's absence, and Darren McFadden was their top ball-carrier with only six rushes.\n\nBIG TIME RUSH: Rookie Cooper Rush threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Rico Gathers in the third quarter while completing his first eight passes for the Cowboys.\n\nKellen Moore went 8 for 17 in the first half for the Cowboys, but the offense perked up for Rush, the four-year starter at Central Michigan. Rush also caught the eye of Garrett during the Hall of Fame Game last week, and his exceptional touch on the TD throw to Gathers was undeniably impressive.\n\nRush went 9 of 11 for 104 yards. Gathers scored in his second straight game.\n\nBUTTERFINGERS: The Rams hung in despite alarming ball security. Los Angeles fumbled six times, but recovered its own fumble four times before losing the last two. Rookie running back Justin Davis looked good while running for 70 yards in his college stadium, but he also fumbled twice.\n\nBIG HIT: Dallas rookie Taco Charlton got his first sack, downing Mannion in the first quarter. The Michigan product took a bit of light criticism after a quiet debut in the Hall of Fame Game. \"It looked like he was making some strides,\" Garrett said.\n\nNEW GUY: Rams receiver Sammy Watkins watched from the sideline in sweats after arriving in LA earlier in the day. The Rams traded a second-round pick and cornerback E.J. Gaines to Buffalo for the playmaking wideout. Watkins got a big ovation when he appeared on the scoreboard. \"He's obviously a weapon,\" Goff said. \"His track record speaks for itself, what he's able to do.\"\n\nCOOOOOP: Kupp was busy in his first professional game, making two early catches for 35 yards and scoring LA's only touchdown while lining up all over McVay's formations.

Rookie quarterback Jared Goff didn't start until Week 11 because he struggled with getting acclimated to the NFL, and running back Todd Gurely and the rest of the Rams' offense couldn't gain traction.\n\nThe team finished with a 4-12 record and had the worst offense in the league. Jeff Fisher was fired after nearly five seasons with the franchise, and the Rams hired Sean McVay, a 31-year-old who was Washington's offensive coordinator, to groom Goff into a franchise quarterback.\n\nLos Angeles gave Goff some weapons to work with in the offseason. The Rams signed left tackle Andrew Whitworth and receiver Robert Woods in free agency. They followed that up by drafting tight end Gerald Everett and receivers Cooper Kupp and Josh Reynolds.\n\nOn Friday, the Rams made another big move by trading cornerback E.J. Gaines and a 2018 second-round pick to the Buffalo Bills for receiver Sammy Watkins and a 2018 sixth-round pick. Watkins will join his new team, but won't play against Dallas.\n\nKupp and Reynolds are competing with receivers like Woods and Tavon Austin. Kupp is a solid route runner with great hands and size, and he should get plenty of playing time Saturday. Reynolds and Austin have been dealing with injuries and are both likely out.\n\nUnder new defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, the Rams are moving away from the 4-3 scheme to the 3-4. This game will give fans a sneak peek at how well the Rams are transitioning to Philips' scheme.\n\nDallas already has one preseason game under its belt. The Cowboys knocked off the Arizona Cardinals, 20-18, in this year's Hall of Fame game. Quarterback Dak Prescott, the reigning NFL Rookie Offensive Player of the Year, didn't play against Arizona but will play against the Rams, according to Pro Football Talk's Charean Williams.\n\nDarren McFadden, Alfred Morris, and Rod Smith got most of the carries in the first preseason game. That will likely be the case again after running back Ezekiel Elliott was handed a six-game suspension by the NFL on Friday. Elliott is appealing the suspension but can still participate in all preseason activities.\n\nDefensively, rookies Taco Charlton and Chidobe Awuzie both got their feet wet but didn't make much of an impact in their debut. They should get another shot to earn playing time Saturday night. Second-year linebacker Jaylon Smith, who missed his entire rookie season due to severe knee injures, will most likely sit out against the Rams.

The Rams traded a second-round pick and cornerback E.J. Gaines to Buffalo for the playmaking wideout. Watkins got a big ovation when he appeared on the scoreboard.\n\nCOOOOOP: Kupp was busy in his first professional game, making two early catches for 35 yards and scoring LA's only touchdown while lining up all over McVay's formations. The Rams chose the prolific Eastern Washington product in the third round, hoping to add playmakers to the NFL's worst offense.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-07-", "textEnd": 2108, "textStart": 2099}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356965", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T05:12:00Z", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "source": {"uri": "dailyherald.com", "title": "Daily Herald", "id": "180"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "05:12:00", "url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20170812/sports/308129866", "storyUri": "eng-3356965", "id": "8874460", "image": "http://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20170812/sports/308129866/EP/1/5/EP-308129866.jpg&updated=201708122218&imageversion=Facebook&exactH=630&exactW=1200&exactfit=crop&noborder", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "05:12:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Players receive food & drink specials plus a free draft kit. Sign up HERE today!\n\nTodd Gurley and Jared Goff were not good in 2016, but it was difficult to know how much of the blame to lay at their feet. After all, they didn't have a lot of offensive talent around them. That changed on Friday when the team traded for Sammy Watkins. We're going to find out exactly how good Goff is now and defenses shouldn't be quite as eager to stack the box against Gurley.\n\nWhile the move is a clear upgrade for Goff, it may not matter much for Fantasy. He was well off the radar in a standard league. Gurley is a different story. We've seen him look spectacular and mediocre over his first two years in the league. Watkins is the most explosive receiver he's ever played with. Opposing defenses will have respect Watkins' big-play ability assuming Goff can get him the ball.\n\nOf course, no one's value maybe affected more than that of Watkins himself. The Rams' new receiver has had trouble staying on the field, but when he's been healthy he's been a bona fide No. 1 receiver. We were excited to see a healthy Watkins over a full season with Tyrod Taylor, and this is most likely a significant downgrade at quarterback. Still, there are plenty of elite receivers (DeAndre Hopkins, Allen Robinson, Damaryius Thomas) with bad quarterbacks, so deciding how much to ding Watkins is a bit of a riddle.\n\nHere's what I've come up with for Watkins' expectations and how it affects the rest of his new team.\n\n*Rankings expressed below are in terms of expected Fantasy points. This is a part of our actual Fantasy Football rankings but not a direct correlation to my rankings. Things like injury risk, upside, etc. factor into rankings but they're not being talked about here. This is simply an expectation as the team is currently constructed.\n\nLos Angeles RamsPlayer NameExpected FPPosition RankExpected PPR FPPosition Rank Todd Gurley LAR RB 197.4#8229.4#8 Sammy Watkins BUF WR 141#18207#27 Robert Woods LAR WR 81.3#73136.3#71 Tavon Austin LAR WR 76.4#75130.4#72 Cooper Kupp LAR WR 63.6#86106.6#84\n\nBreaking down the touches\n\nSean McVay has called the plays for the Washington Redskins the past three seasons, so it's more telling to look at their splits than the offense of the Rams. In his three seasons in Washington, McVay's team averaged 569 pass attempts to just 403 rush attempts. At the same time, he never had a running back as good as Gurley in Washington and he doesn't have Kirk Cousins in Los Angeles.\n\nI anticipate a slight drop in the number of pass attempts (540) and a corresponding increase in rush attempts (430). Gurley should be the primary focus of the offense, but you should also expect both young tight ends to be heavily involved. McVay's offenses have thrown the ball to their tight end roughly 25 percent of the time the past three seasons.\n\nIf either Gerald Everett or Tyler Higbee were flying solo in this offense, I'd be more interested in them as a sleeper. As it is, they're likely going to be waiver wire fodder unless one becomes the true No. 1.\n\nRams touches Player RuSHARE RuATT ReSHARE TGT REC TD Todd Gurley 66% 2907% 40 32 9 Sammy Watkins0% 0 20% 110 667Robert Woods0% 0 16% 90 55 3 Tavon Austin7% 30 16% 90 543 Cooper Kupp 0% 0 13% 70 432Tyler Higbee 0% 0 11% 60 68 2 Gerald Everett 0% 0 10% 55 30 2\n\nOf note:\n\nI have Watkins' target share going down with the move to Los Angeles as well as his yards per catch. Tyrod Taylor was a good deep ball passer and I'd expect many of Goff's passes will be closer to the line of scrimmage.Tavon Austin gets a significant boost in leagues that give points for return yards. He has top-20 potential in those formats.Cooper Kupp has had a great camp, but it's fair to wonder how much that matters now. The team has brought in Woods and Watkins, and they're paying a ton of money to Austin. Kupp will have to continue to force his way into the discussion.The Leftovers\n\nThe biggest loser in this whole situation may be Josh Reynolds, one of my favorite sleeper rookie receivers.

Robert Woods then caught Goff's pass and fumbled near the goal line moments later, but rookie Cooper Kupp recovered for a score.\n\nDak Prescott, Dez Bryant and Ezekiel Elliott were among several starters sitting out for the Cowboys, who didn't manage a first down until the second quarter.\n\nRookie Cooper Rush threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Rico Gathers in the third quarter while completing his first eight passes for the Cowboys. Gathers scored in his second straight game.\n\nSean Mannion went 18 of 25 for 144 yards while playing most of the game. The Rams' offense put up 271 yards in Sean McVay's first day on the sideline as the youngest head coach in modern NFL history.\n\nKellen Moore went 8 for 17 in the first half for the Cowboys, but the offense perked up for Rush, the four-year starter at Central Michigan. Rush also caught the eye of Dallas coach Jason Garrett during the Hall of Fame Game last week, and his exceptional touch on the TD throw to Gathers was undeniably impressive.\n\nRush went 9 of 11 for 104 yards.\n\nBUTTERFINGERS: The Rams hung in despite alarming ball security. Los Angeles fumbled six times, but recovered its own fumble four times before losing the last two. Rookie running back Justin Davis looked good while running for 70 yards in his college stadium, but he also fumbled twice.\n\nSPECTATORS: Elliott and Prescott worked out on the Coliseum field before the game and then watched from the sideline in uniform. Elliott was given a six-game suspension by the NFL on Friday for injuring his girlfriend in July 2016.\n\nBIG HIT: Dallas rookie Taco Charlton got his first sack, downing Mannion in the first quarter. The Michigan product took a bit of light criticism after a quiet debut in the Hall of Fame Game. \"It looked like he was making some strides,\" Garrett said.\n\nNEW GUY: Rams receiver Sammy Watkins watched from the sideline in sweats after arriving in LA earlier in the day. The Rams traded a second-round pick and cornerback E.J. Gaines to Buffalo for the playmaking wideout. Watkins got a big ovation when he appeared on the scoreboard.\n\nCOOOOOP: Kupp was busy in his first professional game, making two early catches for 35 yards and scoring LA's only touchdown while lining up all over McVay's formations.

On third down, a check-down to Todd Gurley finished well short of the sticks, and the Rams were forced to punt it away. But Dallas return man Lance Lenoir muffed the kick, and the Rams jumped on the loose ball, giving Goff and Co. new life.\n\nTaking over at the Dallas 33, Goff followed a one-yard Gurley run with a nice completion to Cooper Kupp off of play action for a first down. Two plays later, on third-and-six, Goff found Woods on a slant. As Woods pushed for first-down yardage, Dallas linebacker Anthony Hitchens popped the ball loose.

After the Rams shipped a second-round pick and corner E.J. Gaines to Buffalo for star receiver Sammy Watkins, McVay ruminated on the possibilities for his offense.\n\n\"With Sammy, I think clearly you're getting a special receiver,\" McVay said, via the team's official website. \"Obviously, his career when he's been available, he's been outstanding in terms of being able to stretch the field vertically, but when the balls in his hands, good things happen. We feel like he's going to be a good addition to our offense.\"\n\nWatkins' ability to stretch the field will benefit quarterback Jared Goff most. With defenses now forced to send help toward Watkins, the rest of the field should open up for the second-year passer.\n\n\"I think it certainly helps him because anytime that you have good playmakers where it makes it more difficult for defensive guys to be able to key in on one player, it certainly loosens up and regulates some of the coverages and I think it'll be very helpful for our team and especially for our quarterback,\" McVay said of how Thursday's addition will help Goff.\n\nThe trade finally gives the Rams a bona fide playmaker at receiver after years of playing with third and fourth fiddles. McVay seems to believe adding Watkins will slot the rest of his receiver corps perfectly into position.\n\n\"I think the thing that you really think about is that when you look at some offenses that I've been fortunate to be a part of,\" McVay said, \"you've got a handful of good playmakers and that's where you can truly say, 'Quarterback, be a good decision maker, distribute the ball and there's plenty of touches to go around.' You look at some of the success that Washington's offense was able to have with some of the playmakers they have and we're trying to do something similar here.\"\n\nThe coach continued: \"I feel like adding Sammy to the mix with guys like Robert Woods and Tavon Austin -- you're looking at the emergence of Cooper Kupp. Pharoh Cooper's done a nice job, done some nice things, done a nice job filling in. And then the tight ends continue to do a nice job as far as developing in their roles. And obviously we know what a special back Todd Gurley is.\"\n\nSnead added that Austin \"definitely has a place\" on the team, even after all the additions in 2017 would suggest he's close to sliding off the depth chart.\n\nAfter trading a stockpile of draft picks for Goff, Snead doubled down with the Watkins addition. Giving up a second-round pick isn't the move of a rebuilding team. It's a move of a man who can feel the leash tightening. Snead rolled the dice hoping Watkins will be the missing piece that opens a restricted offense. McVay is the beneficiary of that dice roll.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356965", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T13:56:00Z", "sim": 0.545098066329956, "source": {"uri": "nfl.com", "title": "NFL.com", "id": "5624"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:08:00", "url": "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000828986/article/mcvay-rams-got-special-receiver-in-sammy-watkins", "storyUri": "eng-3356965", "id": "8877947", "image": "http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/photo/2017/08/12/0ap3000000828987_thumbnail_200_150.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "13:56:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

ANGELES -- A year can change so much. It was 366 days ago that the Los Angeles Rams hosted the Dallas Cowboys for their preseason opener from Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. Jeff Fisher patrolled the sidelines, Case Keenum started at quarterback and 89,140 people were in the stands, representing the largest crowd ever to watch an NFL preseason game on American soil.\n\nThe Rams hosted the Cowboys to begin the preseason once again Saturday, but it was Sean McVay as head coach, Jared Goff acting as the starting quarterback and 62,888 at the game, a reflection of the 4-12 season that sapped some of the excitement in this city. The new-look Rams ultimately came away with a 13-10 victory, thanks to a late Sean Mannion drive that set up a 36-yard field goal by backup kicker Travis Coons.\n\nBelow are some key takeaways.\n\nQB depth chart: Goff got two series in very quickly. He went three-and-out, then the Cowboys muffed a punt, allowing him to take over on the Cowboys' 33-yard line. Goff then completed a 19-yard pass to Cooper Kupp on play-action, putting the Rams in the red zone. He later threw a pass to Robert Woods off a quick slant, which Woods fumbled before it was recovered by Kupp in the end zone. That was it. Goff went 3-for-4 for 34 yards. His backup, Mannion, saw extended action and played very well against Cowboys backups, going 18-of-25 for 144 yards.\n\nWhen it was starters vs. starters, the Rams looked ...: not too different from last season, but it was a small sample size. Their defense -- without Robert Quinn, Mark Barron and Aaron Donald, a camp holdout -- played well and aggressively against a Dallas offense that didn't have Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott, Dez Bryant and Jason Witten. On offense, Todd Gurley gained only 2 yards on four carries. And Goff kept most of his throws pretty short.\n\nOne reason to be concerned: The Rams' offensive line might not have room for injury. Their second unit struggled. Particularly backup center Austin Blythe, who made a high snap to Mannion that prompted the Rams to lose 28 yards. And reserve tackle Pace Murphy had a really tough day, allowing at least three defensive ends to blow by him for vicious hits on Mannion. One of the Rams' key backups, Andrew Donnal, has been nursing a knee injury throughout training camp. If something happens to the 35-year-old Andrew Whitworth at left tackle, they could be in serious trouble.\n\nThat guy could start: Matt Longacre won't start, but he looks like he could be a key backup for Quinn and Connor Barwin at outside linebacker. Longacre, a backup defensive end last season, got extended playing time with Quinn and rookie Samson Ebukam out and did a nice job of getting around the edge to create disruption. Quinn and Barwin have combined for 14 NFL seasons and will be asked to do a lot in new coordinator Wade Phillips' system. The Rams need guys to step up behind them so they can stay fresh.\n\nRookie watch: Kupp and tight end Gerald Everett played well. Kupp, a third-round pick out of Eastern Washington who already looks to have solidified a role as a slot receiver, caught a couple of passes for 35 yards. Everett, drafted 44th overall out of South Alabama, had two catches for 12 yards and showed some nice moves in space. But the most impressive rookie was actually an undrafted running back, Justin Davis, who played on this very field while at USC. Davis hit holes quickly and decisively, and he moved well in space, gaining 70 yards on nine carries. But he fumbled twice.\n\nFumbling around: The Rams fumbled the ball five times officially, and two more could've easily been added. Davis fumbled twice, Woods fumbled near the end zone, Blythe fumbled on an errant snap and Malcolm Brown fumbled on a run across the middle. Brown, currently Gurley's backup, also fumbled, then quickly recovered, after catching a short pass. Second-year tight end Temarrick Hemingway was called for a fumble after reeling in a long pass from Mannion, but it was overturned and ruled an incomplete pass.\n\nWelcome to L.A.: Wide receiver Sammy Watkins, acquired from the Bills in exchange for cornerback E.J. Gaines and a second-round pick Friday, made it to the Coliseum about three hours before kickoff and watched his new team play from the sideline. Watkins was introduced to a rousing applause on the video board in the fourth quarter. While speaking to the media earlier, Watkins called the trade \"a total shock, but I'm definitely excited, honored to be here. I really can't wait to get started, just learning the plays and getting with the guys.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356965", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T04:21:00Z", "sim": 0.5372549295425415, "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "title": "ESPN.com", "id": "4"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "04:21:00", "url": "http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/244216", "storyUri": "eng-3356965", "id": "8871313", "image": "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0812%2Fr243419_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "04:21:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Robert Woods then caught Goff's pass and fumbled near the goal line moments later, but rookie Cooper Kupp recovered for a score.\n\nDak Prescott, Dez Bryant and Ezekiel Elliott were among several starters sitting out for the Cowboys, who didn't manage a first down until the second quarter.\n\nRookie Cooper Rush threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Rico Gathers in the third quarter while completing his first eight passes for the Cowboys. Gathers scored in his second straight game.\n\nSean Mannion went 18 of 25 for 144 yards while playing most of the game. The Rams' offense put up 271 yards in Sean McVay's first day on the sideline as the youngest head coach in modern NFL history.\n\nKellen Moore went 8 for 17 in the first half for the Cowboys, but the offense perked up for Rush, the four-year starter at Central Michigan. Rush also caught the eye of Dallas coach Jason Garrett during the Hall of Fame Game last week, and his exceptional touch on the TD throw to Gathers was undeniably impressive.\n\nRush went 9 of 11 for 104 yards.\n\nBUTTERFINGERS: The Rams hung in despite alarming ball security. Los Angeles fumbled six times, but recovered its own fumble four times before losing the last two. Rookie running back Justin Davis looked good while running for 70 yards in his college stadium, but he also fumbled twice.\n\nSPECTATORS: Elliott and Prescott worked out on the Coliseum field before the game and then watched from the sideline in uniform. Elliott was given a six-game suspension by the NFL on Friday for injuring his girlfriend in July 2016.\n\nBIG HIT: Dallas rookie Taco Charlton got his first sack, downing Mannion in the first quarter. The Michigan product took a bit of light criticism after a quiet debut in the Hall of Fame Game. \"It looked like he was making some strides,\" Garrett said.\n\nNEW GUY: Rams receiver Sammy Watkins watched from the sideline in sweats after arriving in LA earlier in the day. The Rams traded a second-round pick and cornerback E.J. Gaines to Buffalo for the playmaking wideout. Watkins got a big ovation when he appeared on the scoreboard.\n\nCOOOOOP: Kupp was busy in his first professional game, making two early catches for 35 yards and scoring LA's only touchdown while lining up all over McVay's formations. The Rams chose the prolific Eastern Washington product in the third round, hoping to add playmakers to the NFL's worst offense.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Keeping it off the grass seems to be a more complicated matter.\n\nPreseason football is sloppy by nature, but the Rams put the ball on the ground in Saturday's first half more often than the Golden State Warriors do in a full NBA game. The Rams fumbled six times on their first six drives, but strong defense helped them to a 13-10 victory over Dallas at the Coliseum.\n\nBackup kicker Travis Coons made a 36-yard field goal with 6:11 remaining in the fourth quarter to break the tie. Dallas had a chance to win the game late, with the ball at the Rams' 30, but defensive lineman Tanzel Smart recovered a fumble to clinch the victory.\n\nIt's folly to put too much value on mid-August football, with one month to go before the start of the regular season, but naturally all eyes Saturday were on the offense of McVay, the Rams' 31-year-old rookie coach, who called his own plays, and on quarterback Jared Goff.\n\nThe good? As planned, Goff was on the field for only eight plays but completed 3 of 4 passes for 34 yards. One completion, to receiver Robert Woods, was fumbled into the endzone, where rookie receiver Cooper Kupp fell on it for a touchdown and a 7-0 first-quarter lead. That was Goff's final play.\n\nThe Rams' pass game looked effective with most of its starters in, as Sean Mannion relieved Goff and completed 9 of his first 11 passes (for 76 yards) with the first-team offensive line in the game.\n\nThe bad? Running back Todd Gurley got four carries, and they essentially went nowhere, as the Rams' line struggled in run blocking. Jamon Brown, moved from right tackle to right guard during training camp, had a couple tough plays, and Gurley's runs went for four yards, one yard, zero yards and minus-3 yards.\n\nGurley didn't fumble, which is more than a few Rams could say. His primary backups, Malcolm Brown and Justin Davis, each fumbled twice. Woods had the fumble-and-catch play, and in the first quarter, backup center Austin Blythe air-mailed a snap that ended up in a 28-yard loss. The Rams recovered all but one.\n\nDavis, in particular, rebounded nicely and displayed good cuts and open-field vision. One of the highlights of the game was Davis' 32-yard run, which set up Greg Zuerlein's 42-yard field goal for a 10-3 Rams lead.\n\nDallas tied the game 10-10 late in the third quarter, when quarterback Cooper Rush connected with tight end Rico Gathers for a 25-yard touchdown pass.\n\nThe Cowboys already had played in the preseason, in the Hall of Fame Game against Arizona, so not surprisingly, they showed a bit more physicality than the Rams, who hadn't even tackled in practice.\n\nThe Rams' defense looked good, even though it faced a Dallas offense that held out its three skill-position stars: quarterback Dak Prescott, running back Ezekiel Elliot and receiver Dez Bryant.\n\nThen again, the Rams didn't have star defensive lineman Aaron Donald, whose contract holdout has entered its third week, but the 3-4 scheme of new defensive coordinator Wade Phillips came as advertised: fast and aggressive.\n\nLinebackers Robert Quinn and Mark Barron and cornerback Kayvon Webster missed the game for precautionary reasons, but the Rams still made life difficult for Cowboys quarterback Kellen Moore, who passed for only 69 yards in the first half.\n\nMatt Longacre, a former undrafted free agent, looked particularly effective in place of Quinn at outside linebacker, and the Cowboys didn't pick up their initial first down until the third play of the second quarter.\n\nDallas' only points of the first half came five minutes into the second quarter, when Dan Bailey's 32-yard field goal pulled the Cowboys within 10-3.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356965", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T21:11:00Z", "sim": 0.5098039507865906, "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "title": "The Orange County Register", "id": "1025"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "04:15:00", "url": "http://www.ocregister.com/2017/08/12/rams-fumble-6-times-but-13-points-are-enough-to-beat-dallas-in-preseason-opener/", "storyUri": "eng-3356965", "id": "8870933", "image": "http://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/0812_spo_ldn-l-rams-cowboys-kb28_24320113-1.jpg?w=640", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "21:11:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

So, as the Rams prepare for their first preseason game against the Cowboys on Saturday night, they're doing so without their star defensive lineman, who has yet to report to training camp.\n\nOn Friday, Rams general manager Les Snead was asked for an update on negotiations with Donald. His update? There is no update. \"Not any movement,\" he said, per ESPN.\n\nStill, Snead hasn't given up hope. \"There is hope,\" he said. \"There's hope that he'll be a Ram a long time.\"\n\nIn Snead's defense, he's a been a bit busy engineering a trade with the Bills to bring Sammy Watkins to Los Angeles. But in Donald's defense, he's massively underpaid and deserves a significant pay raise. The Rams should prioritize his contract over everything else, because as previously mentioned, he's one of the game's best players. In the first three years of his career, he has 28 sacks -- remember, he's a defensive tackle, not an edge rusher. Our Pete Prisco ranked him as the third best player in all of football, only behind Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady. He was Pro Football Focus' highest-graded interior defender last season.\n\nYet Donald's base salary in 2017 ($1.8 million) ranks 31st among all defensive tackles, according to Spotrac. His base salary in 2018 ($6.9 million) ranks 13th.\n\nUnderstandably, the Rams probably enjoy having the best defensive tackle in football on a super cheap contract. Understandably, Donald does not enjoy that nearly as much, which is why he's not with the team for training camp. Earlier this week, our Joel Corry -- a former agent -- explained how he expects the holdout to proceed. As Corry noted in his story, the Rams have a history of rewarding first-round picks with contract extensions. Both receiver Tavon Austin and defensive end Robert Quinn got new deals before/during their fourth season. But the Rams still hold all the leverage.\n\nI'll let Corry explain:\n\nThe Rams possess leverage over Donald because he is under contract this season for approximately $1.8 million and for $6.892 million in 2018 since the Rams picked up their fifth-year option with him. Donald could also be designated a franchise player in 2019 and 2020.\n\nTeams giving highly-accomplished first-round picks extremely early extensions haven't exploited their leverage. Cowboys center Travis Frederick, Panthers inside linebacker Luke Kuechly, Cardinals cornerback Patrick Peterson and Texans defensive end J.J. Watt became the highest-paid player (by average year salary) at their respective positions. Each player received All-Pro honors in two of their first three years, just like Donald.\n\nBased on their treatment, the Rams should at least be willing to make Donald the NFL's highest-paid interior defensive lineman over Ndamukong Suh. Suh signed a six-year, $114.375 million contract with the Dolphins in 2015, which averages $19,062,500 and contains nearly $60 million fully guaranteed. Donald insisting upon being the NFL's first $20 million per-year non-quarterback with more than the $70 million in guarantees Von Miller received from the Broncos in 2016 would be justified. Miller became the league's highest paid non-quarterback at $19,083,333 per year with his extension. The Cowboys making Zack Martin, who has earned All-Pro honors in his each of three NFL seasons, the NFL's highest-paid offensive guard before Donald gets a new deal would likely added to his resolve.\n\nThe Rams might want to extend him sooner rather than later so Donald can get fully comfortable in the new defensive system that Wade Phillips is bringing from Denver to L.A.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356965", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T21:27:00Z", "sim": 0.4313725531101227, "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "title": "CBS Sports", "id": "765"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "21:27:00", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/rams-gm-les-snead-on-negotiations-with-aaron-donald-no-movement/", "storyUri": "eng-3356965", "id": "8845577", "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2016/07/19/e9ed2641-d973-435d-b89b-8d3e4ed305ec/thumbnail/770x433/3fcb46b7897b59f69ccb35bc3eed9fe2/aaron-donald-rams.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "21:27:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

{"id": 231294686, "title": "Ederson transfer latest and Man City goalkeeper state of play after Stefan Ortega decision", "text": "Manchester City\u2019s decision to hand Stefan Ortega a new contract casts fresh doubt on Ederson\u2019s Etihad future as the Blues head into what could be an intriguing summer transfer window. Ortega has penned a one-year extension to his deal which keeps him at City until 2026. The 31-year-old had widely been expected to depart this summer having failed to usurp Ederson as Pep Guardiola\u2019s first choice or break into the Germany squad. He made 20 appearances last season and has emerged as an outstanding back-up and has stated his ambition to be a first-choice goalkeeper. Ortega values life in Manchester as much as life at City and despite toying with a return to Germany - his wife is due to give birth to his second child in August - he is happy to remain in the north west of England.

He had an up and down campaign last season and was forced off through injury in four separate Premier League matches. Guardiola made it clear the Brazil international was his first choice, restoring him to the starting line up for the title run in, and City want to keep the 30-year-old and are even hoping he extends his contract which runs out in 2026. But there is strong interest from the Saudi Pro League in the keeper and a clutch of clubs could test City\u2019s resolve with an offer this summer. The Ortega decision adds further fuel to the speculation that Ederson will depart given the German\u2019s desire to play regular football. City have Scott Carson as third choice with the veteran having signed a new one year deal in the summer.", "summary": "Manchester City's decision to hand Stefan Ortgea a new contract has prompted questions about Ederson's future at the Etihad", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ederson-transfer-latest-man-city-29317546", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/article29318000.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1620523808.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:07:35", "author": "Alex James,Simon Bajkowski", "authors": ["Alex James", "Simon Bajkowski"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.002}

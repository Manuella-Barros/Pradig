Nigel Farage is the latest to bear the brunt of pelting as politics", "text": "I am an anthropologist who studies popular democracy and has written on how pelting as a show of collective grievance has lost neither its significance nor its frequency. Throwing things and pelting as a form of popular politics is an ancient and enduring way for the masses to express their dissatisfaction with authority and the status quo. Egg on their face The Roman emperor Vespasian is one of history\u2019s early known targets of protest pelting. According to accounts, in 63 CE, ordinary Romans, frustrated by food shortages, attacked Vespasian with turnips. Similarly, Emperor Nero reportedly faced the ire of dissatisfied citizens, who pelted him with onions in the Colosseum. Much later, Bram Stoker \u2013 the Irish author of the 1897 novel Dracula and a long-time theater manager \u2013 quipped that as criticism goes, being pelted with eggs amounted to a positive review compared to having bricks thrown at you. But throwing eggs can be injurious, too \u2013 just ask the U.K. protester who in 2001 dared to throw one at then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott. Prescott, a former boxer in the merchant navy, responded with a neat left jab to the jaw and a scuffle ensued. Milkshakes have taken over from eggs in more recent years as the protestor\u2019s projectile of choice \u2013 and for Farage, this wasn\u2019t his first dousing. In 2019, an anti-Brexit protester emptied a milkshake on the right-wing politician. In a video of the incident, you can hear one of Farage\u2019s entourage muttering, \u201cAh, not again!\u201d And in the U.K., it isn\u2019t just politicians \u2013 British royals, too, are acquainted with the tradition. After King Charles inherited the British throne in 2022, raw eggs were thrown his way twice in one month, including at a public appearance where he unveiled a statue of his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II. The assailant on that occasion was hauled away shouting, \u201cThis country was built on the blood of slaves\u201d and \u201cNot my king.\u201d Queen Elizabeth II, who died on Sept. 8, 2022, was a victim of egg-throwing herself more than once, and with more accurate results. During a 1986 trip to New Zealand, one egg hit the queen\u2019s coat, and egg yolk trickled down her pink dress. Another egg splattered on the car\u2019s windshield, according to media reports. A show of collective grievance Pelting may be seen as the act of a hero or a villain \u2013 one example might be Muntadhar Al-Zaidi, the Iraqi journalist who threw his shoes at President George W. Bush \u2013 but the act remains a performance of popular defiance. Pelting connects the person pelting with their enemy through a physical object. Russian philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin described something similar when discussing the medieval carnival and the \u201ccarnivalesque.\u201d While those throwing the objects often see retribution, be it through arrest or punishment, to see the projectiles as weapons of the weak misses the point. The ritualized aspect of pelting doesn\u2019t diminish its enjoyment, and the carnal element reminds us that even in today\u2019s popular democracies, \u201cthe people\u201d still may resort to physical protests to signal grievances to those who wield power. To targets such as Farage, it can be an annoyance, an embarrassment and an additional trip to the dry cleaners. But to those who wield the milkshake, it can be a moment to shake up the establishment, so to speak. Nusrat S.

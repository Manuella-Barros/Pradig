Suri looked relaxed and happy as she left her long, dark hair loose and appeared makeup free. She wore a white crocheted vest top with patterned red trousers and black ballet pumps as she sat across the saddle and cycled through the greenery in the city park. Her blue tote bag sat in the basket on the handlebars as she was seen weaving through people in Central Park. The 18-year-old is set to attend college in September as she will head to Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Suri is reported to be leaning towards studying fashion, with Carnegie Mellon considered one of the oldest and most highly ranked programs with many famous fashion alumni.

She has a very close group of loyal friends, and she knows exactly where she comes from.\" Suri has also recently made the decision to drop her famous dad's last name earlier this month and changing her legal name to Suri Noelle. According to reports from Hello! Magazine, Suri's name was simply \"Suri Noelle\" in the playbill of her school's production of The Go-Go's jukebox musical, Head Over Heels. \"Noelle\" is the middle name of her mother Katie, whom she's been living with since Katie and Tom's divorce back in 2012. Suri adopts a quiet life away from any connection to her Hollywood father, and prefers a lowkey life with her mother. Tom and Suri have reportedly had a strained relationship for years with the Mission Impossible star recently missing her 18th birthday party earlier this year whilst filming in London. Suri's decision to drop her 'Cruise' surname is thought to be a moment of rebellion, according to a US psychiatrist. In an exclusive interview with The Mirror, expert Carole Lieberman, M.D. explained: \"Children \u2018drop\u2019 their last name to rebel against their parents. They\u2019re angry and resentful over some hurt from childhood.\" She continued: \"When they get older, they get back at their parents by \u2018dropping\u2019 them as a way to punish their parents for all the painful memories they\u2019ve held onto and obsessed over for years,\" and added: \"These memories could be something as seemingly minor as their parent not coming to all their games in high school, or something major like their father divorcing their mother and going on to have another family.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "summary": "Suri Cruise, who is preparing for college in September, is estranged from her father Tom Cruise and was last pictured with him in 2012 and has recently opted to drop his surname", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/us-celebrity-news/tom-cruises-daughter-suri-takes-32992744", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32992948.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_suritom.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:23:33", "author": "Niamh Spence,Niamh-Spence", "authors": ["Niamh Spence", "Niamh-Spence"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.342}

The Red Sox took two of three last weekend when the longtime rivals played at Yankee Stadium.\n\n\"These are really important games for us because the clock is ticking,\" manager Joe Girardi said .\n\nSanchez hit a three-run homer off struggling starter Steven Matz in the first inning and a two-run single in the fourth. Brett Gardner broke his 3-for-29 slump with a two-run double , and the Yankees won twice at Citi Field just as they did back home in the Bronx earlier this week.\n\nCurtis Granderson hit his seventh career grand slam off Bryan Mitchell in the ninth, pulling the Mets to 7-5. Dellin Betances was summoned immediately and got three quick outs for his eighth save.\n\n\"It's not what you really want to do, but we had to win the game so I had to go to him,\" Girardi said. \"I probably won't have him tomorrow.\"\n\nBetances has pitched four of the past five days.\n\nSince interleague play began in 1997, it was the third time one team swept the season series between these New York counterparts. The Yankees won all six meetings in 2003, and the Mets went 4-0 in 2013.\n\nSeverino (10-5) was working on a two-hit shutout with one out in the seventh when Aaron Judge dropped a fly ball in the right-field corner for a two-base error. The All-Star righty never got another out, throwing a wild pitch and giving up two straight singles before he was removed without allowing an earned run. He struck out nine .\n\nIn his previous outing Saturday, the 23-year-old Severino had the worst start of his career. He allowed 10 runs, eight earned, and eight hits over 4 1/3 innings during a 10-5 loss to Boston.\n\nBefore that, Severino was 4-0 with a 1.36 ERA in a span of six games.\n\n\"I would say the difference tonight was his slider and his changeup,\" Sanchez, the Yankees' catcher, said through a translator.\n\nMatz (2-7) was unable to turn things around, dropping to 0-6 with a 10.19 ERA in his last eight starts. The left-hander hasn't won since June 28 at Miami.\n\n\"It's nothing I can put my finger on. I've got to figure out what's causing it,\" he said.\n\nMatz was his own worst enemy Thursday, throwing away Gardner's easy grounder for a two-base error to begin the game. Aaron Hicks walked and, after Judge struck out for the 34th consecutive game, Sanchez hit his third home run against the Mets (53-66) this week.\n\n\"I've seen it in the past, a here-we-go-again kind of attitude,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said. \"Certainly tonight, when we threw the ball away right at the start of the game, all of a sudden, boy, the air came out of the dugout, too.\"\n\nSeverino's bunt single in the fourth, his first major league hit , loaded the bases. Gardner doubled to left field off Matz, and Sanchez hit a two-run single on the first pitch from reliever Chasen Bradford.\n\nMatz gave up seven hits in 3 1/3 innings and allowed seven runs for the second time in a month. Six were earned.\n\n\"We've absolutely wringed the rag dry with ideas that we've all seen in the past, that we've all used in the past,\" Collins said. \"Back to square one.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nYankees: All-Star 2B Starlin Castro (strained right hamstring) begins a rehab assignment Friday at Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, the same day DH Matt Holliday (back) reports to Class-A Tampa to start playing rehab games. ... Before the game, Girardi said closer Aroldis Chapman (hamstring) probably would be unavailable for the second consecutive night. Afterward, the manager said he hopes Chapman can pitch Friday. ... 1B Garrett Cooper went on the 10-day disabled list with tendinitis in his left hamstring. Tyler Austin was promoted from Triple-A and singled his first two times up. ... 1B-3B Chase Headley was rested.\n\nMets: The next rehab outing for closer Jeurys Familia will probably be Saturday with Class-A St. Lucie, Collins said. Familia pitched a scoreless inning Wednesday for St. Lucie in his first appearance since surgery for a blood clot in his shoulder. ... SS Jose Reyes was placed on the 10-day DL, retroactive to Wednesday, with a sore left ribcage. Fellow infielder Wilmer Flores sat out again with a similar injury.\n\nCITY SLICKERS\n\nThe Yankees are 12-4 against the Mets since May 14, 2014.\n\nREINFORCEMENTS ARRIVE\n\nThe Mets recalled infielders Matt Reynolds and Gavin Cecchini from Triple-A Las Vegas. Reynolds started at third base and had two hits, including an RBI single off Severino in the seventh. RHP Kevin McGowan was optioned to Las Vegas.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees: Rookie LHP Jordan Montgomery (7-6, 3.94 ERA) pitches Friday against Boston LHP Drew Pomeranz (12-4, 3.39). Montgomery has permitted only one run in three of his past four starts, including a solid effort over 5 1/3 innings Sunday night against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium.\n\nMets: Giancarlo Stanton brings his home run show to the Big Apple when Miami visits Friday night. Stanton leads the majors with 44 homers. \"He's hurt us enough in the past to know that he can be so dangerous,\" Collins said. \"We're going to try to be very, very careful with him.\"\n\n-- --

The All-Star righty never got another out, throwing a wild pitch and giving up two straight singles before he was removed without allowing an earned run. He struck out nine .\n\nIn his previous outing Saturday, the 23-year-old Severino had the worst start of his career. He allowed 10 runs, eight earned, and eight hits over 4 1/3 innings during a 10-5 loss to Boston.\n\nBefore that, Severino was 4-0 with a 1.36 ERA in a span of six games.\n\n\"I would say the difference tonight was his slider and his changeup,\" Sanchez, the Yankees' catcher, said through a translator.\n\nMatz (2-7) was unable to turn things around, dropping to 0-6 with a 10.19 ERA in his last eight starts. The left-hander hasn't won since June 28 at Miami.\n\n\"It's nothing I can put my finger on. I've got to figure out what's causing it,\" he said.\n\nMatz was his own worst enemy Thursday, throwing away Gardner's easy grounder for a two-base error to begin the game. Aaron Hicks walked and, after Judge struck out for the 34th consecutive game, Sanchez hit his third home run against the Mets (53-66) this week.\n\n\"I've seen it in the past, a here-we-go-again kind of attitude,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said. \"Certainly tonight, when we threw the ball away right at the start of the game, all of a sudden, boy, the air came out of the dugout, too.\"\n\nSeverino's bunt single in the fourth, his first major league hit , loaded the bases. Gardner doubled to left field off Matz, and Sanchez hit a two-run single on the first pitch from reliever Chasen Bradford.\n\nMatz gave up seven hits in 3 1/3 innings and allowed seven runs for the second time in a month. Six were earned.\n\n\"We've absolutely wringed the rag dry with ideas that we've all seen in the past, that we've all used in the past,\" Collins said. \"Back to square one.\"\n\nTrainer's room\n\nYankees: All-Star 2B Starlin Castro (strained right hamstring) begins a rehab assignment Friday at Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, the same day DH Matt Holliday (back) reports to Class-A Tampa to start playing rehab games. ... Before the game, Girardi said closer Aroldis Chapman (hamstring) probably would be unavailable for the second consecutive night. Afterward, the manager said he hopes Chapman can pitch Friday. ... 1B Garrett Cooper went on the 10-day disabled list with tendinitis in his left hamstring. Tyler Austin was promoted from Triple-A and singled his first two times up. ... 1B-3B Chase Headley was rested.\n\nMets: The next rehab outing for closer Jeurys Familia will probably be Saturday with Class-A St. Lucie, Collins said. Familia pitched a scoreless inning Wednesday for St. Lucie in his first appearance since surgery for a blood clot in his shoulder. ... SS Jose Reyes was placed on the 10-day DL, retroactive to Wednesday, with a sore left ribcage. Fellow infielder Wilmer Flores sat out again with a similar injury.\n\nThe Mets recalled infielders Matt Reynolds and Gavin Cecchini from Triple-A Las Vegas. Reynolds started at third base and had two hits, including an RBI single off Severino in the seventh. RHP Kevin McGowan was optioned to Las Vegas.\n\nUp next\n\nYankees: Rookie LHP Jordan Montgomery (7-6, 3.94 ERA) pitches Friday against Boston LHP Drew Pomeranz (12-4, 3.39). Montgomery has permitted only one run in three of his past four starts, including a solid effort over 5 1/3 innings Sunday night against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium.\n\nMets: Giancarlo Stanton brings his home run show to the Big Apple when Miami visits Friday night. Stanton leads the majors with 44 homers. \"He's hurt us enough in the past to know that he can be so dangerous,\" Collins said. \"We're going to try to be very, very careful with him.\"", "id":

Brett Gardner broke his 3-for-29 slump with a two-run double, and the Yankees won twice at Citi Field just as they did back home in the Bronx earlier this week.\n\nFour games behind first-place Boston in the AL East, the Yankees begin a three-game series Friday night at Fenway Park. The Red Sox took two of three last weekend when the longtime rivals played at Yankee Stadium.\n\nCurtis Granderson hit his seventh career grand slam off Bryan Mitchell in the ninth, pulling the Mets to 7-5. Dellin Betances was immediately summoned and got three quick outs for his eighth save.\n\nSince interleague play began in 1997, it was only the third time one team swept the season series between these New York counterparts.

The Red Sox took two of three last weekend when the longtime rivals played at Yankee Stadium.\n\n\"These are really important games for us because the clock is ticking,\" manager Joe Girardi said .\n\nSanchez hit a three-run homer off struggling starter Steven Matz in the first inning and a two-run single in the fourth. Brett Gardner broke his 3-for-29 slump with a two-run double , and the Yankees won twice at Citi Field just as they did back home in the Bronx earlier this week.\n\nCurtis Granderson hit his seventh career grand slam off Bryan Mitchell in the ninth, pulling the Mets to 7-5. Dellin Betances was summoned immediately and got three quick outs for his eighth save.\n\n\"It's not what you really want to do, but we had to win the game so I had to go to him,\" Girardi said. \"I probably won't have him tomorrow.\"\n\nBetances has pitched four of the past five days.\n\nSince interleague play began in 1997, it was the third time one team swept the season series between these New York counterparts. The Yankees won all six meetings in 2003, and the Mets went 4-0 in 2013.\n\nSeverino (10-5) was working on a two-hit shutout with one out in the seventh when Aaron Judge dropped a fly ball in the right-field corner for a two-base error. The All-Star righty never got another out, throwing a wild pitch and giving up two straight singles before he was removed without allowing an earned run. He struck out nine .\n\nIn his previous outing Saturday, the 23-year-old Severino had the worst start of his career. He allowed 10 runs, eight earned, and eight hits over 4 1/3 innings during a 10-5 loss to Boston.\n\nBefore that, Severino was 4-0 with a 1.36 ERA in a span of six games.\n\n\"I would say the difference tonight was his slider and his changeup,\" Sanchez, the Yankees' catcher, said through a translator.\n\nMatz (2-7) was unable to turn things around, dropping to 0-6 with a 10.19 ERA in his last eight starts. The left-hander hasn't won since June 28 at Miami.\n\n\"It's nothing I can put my finger on. I've got to figure out what's causing it,\" he said.\n\nMatz was his own worst enemy Thursday, throwing away Gardner's easy grounder for a two-base error to begin the game. Aaron Hicks walked and, after Judge struck out for the 34th consecutive game, Sanchez hit his third home run against the Mets (53-66) this week.\n\n\"I've seen it in the past, a here-we-go-again kind of attitude,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said. \"Certainly tonight, when we threw the ball away right at the start of the game, all of a sudden, boy, the air came out of the dugout, too.\"\n\nSeverino's bunt single in the fourth, his first major league hit , loaded the bases. Gardner doubled to left field off Matz, and Sanchez hit a two-run single on the first pitch from reliever Chasen Bradford.\n\nMatz gave up seven hits in 3 1/3 innings and allowed seven runs for the second time in a month. Six were earned.\n\n\"We've absolutely wringed the rag dry with ideas that we've all seen in the past, that we've all used in the past,\" Collins said. \"Back to square one.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nYankees: All-Star 2B Starlin Castro (strained right hamstring) begins a rehab assignment Friday at Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, the same day DH Matt Holliday (back) reports to Class-A Tampa to start playing rehab games. ... Before the game, Girardi said closer Aroldis Chapman (hamstring) probably would be unavailable for the second consecutive night. Afterward, the manager said he hopes Chapman can pitch Friday. ... 1B Garrett Cooper went on the 10-day disabled list with tendinitis in his left hamstring. Tyler Austin was promoted from Triple-A and singled his first two times up. ... 1B-3B Chase Headley was rested.\n\nMets: The next rehab outing for closer Jeurys Familia will probably be Saturday with Class-A St. Lucie, Collins said. Familia pitched a scoreless inning Wednesday for St. Lucie in his first appearance since surgery for a blood clot in his shoulder. ... SS Jose Reyes was placed on the 10-day DL, retroactive to Wednesday, with a sore left ribcage. Fellow infielder Wilmer Flores sat out again with a similar injury.\n\nThe Mets recalled infielders Matt Reynolds and Gavin Cecchini from Triple-A Las Vegas. Reynolds started at third base and had two hits, including an RBI single off Severino in the seventh. RHP Kevin McGowan was optioned to Las Vegas.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees: Rookie LHP Jordan Montgomery (7-6, 3.94 ERA) pitches Friday against Boston LHP Drew Pomeranz (12-4, 3.39). Montgomery has permitted only one run in three of his past four starts, including a solid effort over 5 1/3 innings Sunday night against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium.\n\nMets: Giancarlo Stanton brings his home run show to the Big Apple when Miami visits Friday night. Stanton leads the majors with 44 homers. \"He's hurt us enough in the past to know that he can be so dangerous,\" Collins said. \"We're going to try to be very, very careful with him.\"\n\n___\n\nMore

The Red Sox took two of three last weekend when the longtime rivals played at Yankee Stadium.\n\n\"These are really important games for us because the clock is ticking,\" manager Joe Girardi said .\n\nSanchez hit a three-run homer off struggling starter Steven Matz in the first inning and a two-run single in the fourth. Brett Gardner broke his 3-for-29 slump with a two-run double , and the Yankees won twice at Citi Field just as they did back home in the Bronx earlier this week.\n\nCurtis Granderson hit his seventh career grand slam off Bryan Mitchell in the ninth, pulling the Mets to 7-5. Dellin Betances was summoned immediately and got three quick outs for his eighth save.\n\n\"It's not what you really want to do, but we had to win the game so I had to go to him,\" Girardi said. \"I probably won't have him tomorrow.\"\n\nBetances has pitched four of the past five days.\n\nSince interleague play began in 1997, it was the third time one team swept the season series between these New York counterparts. The Yankees won all six meetings in 2003, and the Mets went 4-0 in 2013.\n\nSeverino (10-5) was working on a two-hit shutout with one out in the seventh when Aaron Judge dropped a fly ball in the right-field corner for a two-base error. The All-Star righty never got another out, throwing a wild pitch and giving up two straight singles before he was removed without allowing an earned run. He struck out nine .\n\nIn his previous outing Saturday, the 23-year-old Severino had the worst start of his career. He allowed 10 runs, eight earned, and eight hits over 4 1/3 innings during a 10-5 loss to Boston.\n\nBefore that, Severino was 4-0 with a 1.36 ERA in a span of six games.\n\n\"I would say the difference tonight was his slider and his changeup,\" Sanchez, the Yankees' catcher, said through a translator.\n\nMatz (2-7) was unable to turn things around, dropping to 0-6 with a 10.19 ERA in his last eight starts. The left-hander hasn't won since June 28 at Miami.\n\n\"It's nothing I can put my finger on. I've got to figure out what's causing it,\" he said.\n\nMatz was his own worst enemy Thursday, throwing away Gardner's easy grounder for a two-base error to begin the game. Aaron Hicks walked and, after Judge struck out for the 34th consecutive game, Sanchez hit his third home run against the Mets (53-66) this week.\n\n\"I've seen it in the past, a here-we-go-again kind of attitude,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said. \"Certainly tonight, when we threw the ball away right at the start of the game, all of a sudden, boy, the air came out of the dugout, too.\"\n\nSeverino's bunt single in the fourth, his first major league hit , loaded the bases. Gardner doubled to left field off Matz, and Sanchez hit a two-run single on the first pitch from reliever Chasen Bradford.\n\nMatz gave up seven hits in 3 1/3 innings and allowed seven runs for the second time in a month. Six were earned.\n\n\"We've absolutely wringed the rag dry with ideas that we've all seen in the past, that we've all used in the past,\" Collins said. \"Back to square one.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nYankees: All-Star 2B Starlin Castro (strained right hamstring) begins a rehab assignment Friday at Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, the same day DH Matt Holliday (back) reports to Class-A Tampa to start playing rehab games. ... Before the game, Girardi said closer Aroldis Chapman (hamstring) probably would be unavailable for the second consecutive night. Afterward, the manager said he hopes Chapman can pitch Friday. ... 1B Garrett Cooper went on the 10-day disabled list with tendinitis in his left hamstring. Tyler Austin was promoted from Triple-A and singled his first two times up. ... 1B-3B Chase Headley was rested.\n\nMets: The next rehab outing for closer Jeurys Familia will probably be Saturday with Class-A St. Lucie, Collins said. Familia pitched a scoreless inning Wednesday for St. Lucie in his first appearance since surgery for a blood clot in his shoulder. ... SS Jose Reyes was placed on the 10-day DL, retroactive to Wednesday, with a sore left ribcage. Fellow infielder Wilmer Flores sat out again with a similar injury.\n\nThe Mets recalled infielders Matt Reynolds and Gavin Cecchini from Triple-A Las Vegas. Reynolds started at third base and had two hits, including an RBI single off Severino in the seventh. RHP Kevin McGowan was optioned to Las Vegas.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees: Rookie LHP Jordan Montgomery (7-6, 3.94 ERA) pitches Friday against Boston LHP Drew Pomeranz (12-4, 3.39). Montgomery has permitted only one run in three of his past four starts, including a solid effort over 5 1/3 innings Sunday night against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium.\n\nMets: Giancarlo Stanton brings his home run show to the Big Apple when Miami visits Friday night. Stanton leads the majors with 44 homers. \"He's hurt us enough in the past to know that he can be so dangerous,\" Collins said. \"We're going to try to be very, very careful with him.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Brett Gardner broke his 3-for-29 slump with a two-run double, and the Yankees won twice at Citi Field just as they did back home in the Bronx earlier this week.\n\nFour games behind first-place Boston in the AL East, the Yankees begin a three-game series Friday night at Fenway Park. The Red Sox took two of three last weekend when the longtime rivals played at Yankee Stadium.\n\nCurtis Granderson hit his seventh career grand slam off Bryan Mitchell in the ninth, pulling the Mets to 7-5. Dellin Betances was immediately summoned and got three quick outs for his eighth save.\n\nSince interleague play began in 1997, it was only the third time one team swept the season series between these New York counterparts. The Yankees won all six meetings in 2003, and the Mets went 4-0 in 2013.\n\nSeverino (10-5) was working on a two-hit shutout with one out in the seventh when Aaron Judge dropped a fly ball in the right-field corner for a two-base error. The All-Star righty never got another out, throwing a wild pitch and giving up two straight singles before he was removed.\n\nIn his previous outing Saturday, the 23-year-old Severino had the worst start of his career. He allowed 10 runs, eight earned, and eight hits over 4 1/3 innings during a 10-5 loss to Boston.\n\nBefore that, Severino was 4-0 with a 1.36 ERA in a span of six games.\n\nMatz (2-7) was unable to turn things around, dropping to 0-6 in his last nine starts. The left-hander hasn't won since June 28 at Miami.\n\nHe was his own worst enemy Thursday, throwing away Gardner's comebacker for a two-base error to begin the game. Aaron Hicks walked and, after Judge struck out for the 34th consecutive game, Sanchez hit his third home run against the Mets this week.\n\nSeverino's bunt single in the fourth, his first major league hit, loaded the bases. Gardner doubled to left field off Matz, and Sanchez hit a two-run single on the first pitch from reliever Chasen Bradford later in the inning.\n\nMatz gave up seven hits in 3 1/3 innings and allowed seven runs for the second time in a month. Six were earned.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nYankees: All-Star 2B Starlin Castro (strained right hamstring) is scheduled to begin a rehab assignment Friday at Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, the same day DH Matt Holliday (back) reports to Class-A Tampa to start playing rehab games. ... Yankees manager Joe Girardi said closer Aroldis Chapman probably would be unavailable for the second consecutive night. Chapman's hamstring tightened up as he saved Tuesday's win. ... 1B Garrett Cooper went on the 10-day DL with tendinitis in his left hamstring. ... 1B-3B Chase Headley was rested. ... RHP Masahiro Tanaka (shoulder inflammation) did not throw a pregame bullpen as originally planned, but Girardi said everything was fine. The Yankees hope Tanaka can come off the DL during next week's series in Detroit.\n\nMets: The next rehab outing for closer Jeurys Familia will probably be Saturday with Class-A St. Lucie, manager Terry Collins said. Familia pitched a scoreless inning for St. Lucie on Wednesday in his first appearance since surgery for a blood clot in his shoulder. ... SS Jose Reyes was placed on the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to Wednesday, with a sore left ribcage. Fellow infielder Wilmer Flores remained out of the lineup with a similar injury. Flores planned to work out before the game, and the team decided not to put him on the DL. But he wasn't expected to be available off the bench, Collins said. Both players sat out Wednesday as well.\n\nREINFORCEMENTS ARRIVE\n\nThe Mets recalled infielders Matt Reynolds and Gavin Cecchini from Triple-A Las Vegas. Reynolds started at third base and had two hits, including an RBI single off Severino in the seventh. RHP Kevin McGowan was optioned to Las Vegas.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees: Rookie LHP Jordan Montgomery (7-6, 3.94 ERA) pitches the series opener Friday night at Fenway Park against Boston LHP Drew Pomeranz (12-4, 3.39). Montgomery has permitted only one run in three of his past four starts, including a solid effort over 5 1/3 innings Sunday night against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium.\n\nMets: Giancarlo Stanton brings his home run show to the Big Apple when Miami visits Friday night. Stanton leads the majors with 44 homers. \"He's hurt us enough in the past to know that he can be so dangerous,\" Collins said. \"We're going to try to be very, very careful with him.\" Stanton said he would enjoy facing new Mets closer AJ Ramos, traded by the Marlins late last month. The big slugger said his former teammate told him he's going to cool off his bat. \"It'll be funny facing him. We've been talking trash to each other,\" Stanton said.\n\n--\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball", "id": "9816354", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Sanchez powers

The All-Star righty never got another out, throwing a wild pitch and giving up two straight singles before he was removed.\n\nIn his previous outing Saturday, the 23-year-old Severino had the worst start of his career. He allowed 10 runs, eight earned, and eight hits over 4 1/3 innings during a 10-5 loss to Boston.\n\nBefore that, Severino was 4-0 with a 1.36 ERA in a span of six games.\n\nMatz (2-7) was unable to turn things around, dropping to 0-6 in his last nine starts.

Aaron Hicks walked and, after Judge struck out for the 34th consecutive game, Sanchez hit his third home run against the Mets this week.\n\nSeverino's bunt single in the fourth, his first major league hit, loaded the bases. Gardner doubled to left field off Matz, and Sanchez hit a two-run single on the first pitch from reliever Chasen Bradford later in the inning.\n\nMatz gave up seven hits in 3 1/3 innings and allowed seven runs for the second time in a month.

The Yankees hope Tanaka can come off the DL during next week's series in Detroit.\n\nMets: The next rehab outing for closer Jeurys Familia will probably be Saturday with Class-A St. Lucie, manager Terry Collins said. Familia pitched a scoreless inning for St. Lucie on Wednesday in his first appearance since surgery for a blood clot in his shoulder. ... SS Jose Reyes was placed on the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to Wednesday, with a sore left ribcage. Fellow infielder Wilmer Flores remained out of the lineup with a similar injury. Flores planned to work out before the game, and the team decided not to put him on the DL. But he wasn't expected to be available off the bench, Collins said. Both players sat out Wednesday as well.\n\nREINFORCEMENTS ARRIVE\n\nThe Mets recalled infielders Matt Reynolds and Gavin Cecchini from Triple-A Las Vegas.

Share your opinions in a Federal News Radio survey.\n\nSince interleague play began in 1997, it was only the third time one team swept the season series between these New York counterparts. The Yankees won all six meetings in 2003, and the Mets went 4-0 in 2013.\n\nSeverino (10-5) was working on a two-hit shutout with one out in the seventh when Aaron Judge dropped a fly ball in the right-field corner for a two-base error. The All-Star righty never got another out, throwing a wild pitch and giving up two straight singles before he was removed.\n\nIn his previous outing Saturday, the 23-year-old Severino had the worst start of his career. He allowed 10 runs, eight earned, and eight hits over 4 1/3 innings during a 10-5 loss to Boston.\n\nBefore that, Severino was 4-0 with a 1.36 ERA in a span of six games.\n\nMatz (2-7) was unable to turn things around, dropping to 0-6 in his last nine starts. The left-hander hasn't won since June 28 at Miami.\n\nHe was his own worst enemy Thursday, throwing away Gardner's comebacker for a two-base error to begin the game. Aaron Hicks walked and, after Judge struck out for the 34th consecutive game, Sanchez hit his third home run against the Mets this week.\n\nGSA gives per diem travel rates another bump for 2018\n\nSeverino's bunt single in the fourth, his first major league hit, loaded the bases. Gardner doubled to left field off Matz, and Sanchez hit a two-run single on the first pitch from reliever Chasen Bradford later in the inning.\n\nMatz gave up seven hits in 3 1/3 innings and allowed seven runs for the second time in a month. Six were earned.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nYankees: All-Star 2B Starlin Castro (strained right hamstring) is scheduled to begin a rehab assignment Friday at Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, the same day DH Matt Holliday (back) reports to Class-A Tampa to start playing rehab games. ... Yankees manager Joe Girardi said closer Aroldis Chapman probably would be unavailable for the second consecutive night. Chapman's hamstring tightened up as he saved Tuesday's win. ... 1B Garrett Cooper went on the 10-day DL with tendinitis in his left hamstring. ... 1B-3B Chase Headley was rested. ... RHP Masahiro Tanaka (shoulder inflammation) did not throw a pregame bullpen as originally planned, but Girardi said everything was fine. The Yankees hope Tanaka can come off the DL during next week's series in Detroit.\n\nMets: The next rehab outing for closer Jeurys Familia will probably be Saturday with Class-A St. Lucie, manager Terry Collins said. Familia pitched a scoreless inning for St. Lucie on Wednesday in his first appearance since surgery for a blood clot in his shoulder. ... SS Jose Reyes was placed on the 10-day disabled list, retroactive to Wednesday, with a sore left ribcage. Fellow infielder Wilmer Flores remained out of the lineup with a similar injury. Flores planned to work out before the game, and the team decided not to put him on the DL. But he wasn't expected to be available off the bench, Collins said. Both players sat out Wednesday as well.\n\nREINFORCEMENTS ARRIVE\n\nThe Mets recalled infielders Matt Reynolds and Gavin Cecchini from Triple-A Las Vegas. Reynolds started at third base and had two hits, including an RBI single off Severino in the seventh. RHP Kevin McGowan was optioned to Las Vegas.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nYankees: Rookie LHP Jordan Montgomery (7-6, 3.94 ERA) pitches the series opener Friday night at Fenway Park against Boston LHP Drew Pomeranz (12-4, 3.39). Montgomery has permitted only one run in three of his past four starts, including a solid effort over 5 1/3 innings Sunday night against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium.\n\nMets: Giancarlo Stanton brings his home run show to the Big Apple when Miami visits Friday night. Stanton leads the majors with 44 homers. \"He's hurt us enough in the past to know that he can be so dangerous,\" Collins said. \"We're going to try to be very, very careful with him.\" Stanton said he would enjoy facing new Mets closer AJ Ramos, traded by the Marlins late last month. The big slugger said his former teammate told him he's going to cool off his bat. \"It'll be funny facing him. We've been talking trash to each other,\" Stanton said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball", "id": "9813680", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Sanchez powers

Brett Gardner broke his 3-for-29 slump with a two-run double, and the Yankees won twice at Citi Field just as they did back home in the Bronx earlier this week.\n\nFour games behind first-place Boston in the AL East, the Yankees begin a three-game series Friday night at Fenway Park. The Red Sox took two of three last weekend when the longtime rivals played at Yankee Stadium.\n\nCurtis Granderson hit his seventh career grand slam off Bryan Mitchell in the ninth, pulling the Mets to 7-5. Dellin Betances was immediately summoned and got three quick outs for his eighth save.\n\nSince interleague play began in 1997, it was only the third time one team swept the season series between these New York counterparts. The Yankees won all six meetings in 2003, and the Mets went 4-0 in 2013.\n\nSeverino (10-5) was working on a two-hit shutout with one out in the seventh when Aaron Judge dropped a fly ball in the right-field corner for a two-base error. The All-Star righty never got another out, throwing a wild pitch and giving up two straight singles before he was removed.\n\nIn his previous outing Saturday, the 23-year-old Severino had the worst start of his career. He allowed 10 runs, eight earned, and eight hits over 41/3 innings during a 10-5 loss to Boston.\n\nBefore that, Severino was 4-0 with a 1.36 ERA in a span of six games.\n\nMatz (2-7) was unable to turn things around, dropping to 0-6 in his past nine starts. The left-hander hasn't won since June 28 at Miami.\n\nHe was his own worst enemy Thursday, throwing away Gardner's comebacker for a two-base error to begin the game. Aaron Hicks walked and, after Judge struck out for the 34th consecutive game, Sanchez hit his third home run against the Mets this week.\n\nSeverino's bunt single in the fourth, his first major league hit, loaded the bases. Gardner doubled to left field off Matz, and Sanchez hit a two-run single on the first pitch from reliever Chasen Bradford later in the inning.\n\nMatz gave up seven hits in 31/3 innings and allowed seven runs, six earned.\n\nTrainer's room\n\nMets: The next rehab outing for closer Jeurys Familia will probably be Saturday with Class-A St. Lucie, manager Terry Collins said. Familia pitched a scoreless inning for St. Lucie on Wednesday in his first appearance since surgery for a blood clot in his shoulder. ...

The dreadful 2003 Mets of the Art Howe era were the only other team in this Subway rivalry to get swept in the season series; the Yankees went 6-0 against the Mets that year.\n\nAnd now the party moves to Boston, where the Yankees will face the Red Sox for three games with aspirations of turning the AL East into a dogfight. The Yankees will begin play four games behind the Red Sox.\n\nLuis Severino (10-5) gave the Yankees their best pitching performance of the 2017 Subway Series, limiting the Mets to one unearned run on four hits over 6 \u00b9/\u2083 innings. It was a rebound performance for the right-hander, who had an abysmal outing against the Red Sox last weekend, when he surrendered 10 runs -- eight of which were earned -- in 4 \u00b9/\u2083 innings.\n\nCurtis Granderson hit a grand slam -- the seventh of his career -- against Bryan Mitchell in the ninth to make it briefly interesting before Dellin Betances got the final three outs for the save.\n\nSanchez hit a three-run homer in the first inning to start the runaway and delivered two additional runs with a single in the fourth against Chasen Bradford.\n\nMatz (2-7) was putrid, allowing seven runs, six of which were earned, on seven hits and two walks with four strikeouts over 3 \u00b9/\u2083 innings. The lefty fell to 0-6 with a 10.19 ERA over his last eight starts.\n\nThe Yankees set the tone for the night when the game's leadoff hitter, Brett Gardner, his a bouncer that Matz fielded and threw away for a two-base error. After Aaron Hicks walked, Sanchez cleared the left-field fence for his 22nd homer of the season.\n\nIn the fourth, Severino was credited with his first major league hit after Dominic Smith couldn't handle his popped-up bunt, loading the bases. Gardner delivered two runs with a double before Aaron Judge was hit by a pitch and Sanchez greeted Bradford with a two-run single.\n\nThe Mets scored an unearned run in the seventh on Matt Reynolds'

The Yankees will be going for a sweep of the four-game season series after earning a 5-3 victory Wednesday night.\n\nMatz and Severino lost their previous starts, albeit in wholly different fashions. Matz had one of his best starts during a nearly two-month winless stretch Saturday, when he gave up two runs over 5 2/3 innings as the Mets fell to the Phillies 3-1 in Philadelphia.\n\nIt was only the second time in his past eight starts -- a stretch in which he is 0-5 with a 7.68 ERA -- that Matz allowed two runs or fewer. Mets manager Terry Collins said Wednesday he believed the solid start provided proof to the 26-year-old that he can pitch when he is at less than 100 percent.\n\nMatz underwent Tommy John surgery in 2010, had bone spurs removed from his left elbow last October and didn't debut this season until June 10 because of left elbow inflammation.\n\n\"You're talking about a guy (who has) had (multiple) elbow operations -- you're never going to be 100 percent,\" Collins said. \"Out of 30-something starts, you're not going to feel good a majority of the time. You've got to learn how to get through it. And I think his last start really did that.\"\n\nSeverino, who made his first All-Star team this season, endured the worst start of his career Saturday. He allowed 10 runs (eight earned) on eight hits over 4 1/3 innings as the Yankees fell to the Boston Red Sox 10-5 at Yankee Stadium. The 23-year-old entered Saturday having allowed just eight runs (six earned) in his previous six starts, a stretch in which he went 4-0 with a 1.36 ERA.\n\n\"He made some mistakes,\" Yankees manager Joe Girardi said following the loss. \"He's been so good and executing so well, and we haven't seen that for a while. But it just shows that he's human.\"\n\nMatz is 1-1 with a 5.25 ERA in two career starts against the Yankees. Severino earned the win in his lone previous appearance against the Mets on Aug. 3, 2016, when he allowed an unearned run and one hit over 4 1/3 innings of relief in the Yankees' 9-5 victory.\n\nThe Yankees, who won the first two contests of the four-game, two-stadium series Monday and Tuesday in the Bronx, are looking for the third Subway Series season sweep in the 21-year history of the interleague rivalry. The Mets won all four games in 2013, and the Yankees won all six in 2003.\n\nAaron Judge had an up-and-down game for the Yankees on Wednesday at Citi Field. He hit his American League-leading 37th homer but also struck out in a 33rd consecutive game, setting a single-season record for position players.", "id": "9629462", "details": {}, "date":

And for the Mets, it was one big Amtrak snafu at Penn Station.\n\nA 7-5 triumph Thursday at Citi Field, featuring a big home run and five RBIs for resurgent slugger Gary Sanchez and a gem by ace Luis Severino, completed a sweep for the Yankees. It was both a respite and encouraging tuneup between big series against the Red Sox for a club that is aiming for October. By the same token, it all just worsened the Mets' summer of hell.\n\nLatest Yankees stories A healthy Austin finally makes it back Steven Matz chased early as Mets fall to Yanks Reyes lands on disabled list, Flores avoids it Steinbrenner, Torre like Jeter in front office with Marlins D'Arnaud plays 3B, 2B with Reyes, Flores scratched\n\nThe Mets finally created excitement in the bottom of the ninth as Curtis Granderson hit a grand slam against Bryan Mitchell. But it was too late, after another washout for Steven Matz, who gave up a three-run shot to Sanchez in the first inning and did not make it out of the fourth.\n\nOverall, the four games seemed symbolic for one team that is chasing a pennant and another, having traded several veterans, has waved a white flag.\n\nEveryone on both sides always recognizes the special nature of these games. As Brett Gardner said in the Yankees clubhouse Thursday afternoon, \"I think it's always fun for us as players to experience the Subway Series. We have young guys on the team, obviously, who are experiencing it for the first time so it's exciting.\"\n\nBaseballMets vs. Yankees: See photos of Subway Series 2017\n\nBut Matz knows it on a much deeper level. He spoke Wednesday night about the excitement of having been a kid on Long Island during the 2000 Mets-Yankees World Series. He knows the dynamic of seeing jerseys saying \"deGrom\" and \"Munson\" side-by-side in the stands. Most of all, he knows the embarrassment that fans feel when their team gets waxed by the neighbor.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\nHe set a somber tone for Mets followers on the very first play of the game, as he fielded Gardner's dribbler, got set and fired way over the head of first baseman Dominic Smith for a two-base error (the exact opposite of the resourcefulness Orlando Hernandez of the Yankees showed when he threw his glove with the ball in it to retire the Mets' Rey Ordonez in 1999).\n\nThree batters later, Sanchez put the Yankees ahead 3-0 as he drove a changeup into the left-centerfield seats. It burnished his early credentials as a Mets killer, giving him three homers this week.\n\nDespite the moral victories of striking out Aaron Judge twice, extending the latter's major-league non-pitcher record streak of 34 games with a strikeout, Matz had an awful night. To start the fourth, he allowed four hits in a row, including Gardner's two-run double to left. Terry Collins removed the starter after he hit Judge with a pitch. Reliever Chasen Bradford entered just in time to allow a two-run single to Sanchez and it was 7-0.\n\nThat provided a cushion for Severino, who allowed no earned runs and four hits in 6 1/3 innings, bouncing back from a poor start Saturday (the Mets' only run against him resulted from Judge muffing a fly ball in the seventh). The big margin also gave the Yankees a head of steam heading into Boston Friday night.\n\n\"It doesn't matter if you're playing the Red Sox or the Mets or anybody in between,\" Gardner said. \"All the games are important right now.\"\n\nThe Mets appear done with important games this season. This week did not feature the upheaval of the 1999 Subway Series, when the Mets fired three coaches (hours after the El Duque play), but it will be recalled for the chaos of having catcher Travis d'Arnaud start at third base and switch back and forth with second baseman Asdrubal Cabrera Wednesday.\n\n\"I think they had fun with it early but we were lucky it didn't hurt us,\" Collins said.\n\nIn general, the sweep did hurt badly for the Mets, whose season went off the track long ago.", "id": "9811322", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Sanchez's HR, 5 RBIs help

This trimmed the Mets' deficit to two runs, and Yankees Manager Joe Girardi brought Dellin Betances into the game.\n\nBetances, filling in for closer Aroldis Chapman, who is nursing a sore hamstring, notched a save with ease.\n\nThe Yankees' four-game winning streak has come at an opportune time. They sit firmly atop the American League wild-card standings as they head to Boston for a critical three-game series that begins Friday.\n\nThe Yankees lost two of three last weekend to the Red Sox, the A.L. East leaders. If the Yankees want to make up their four-game deficit in the division race, the coming series offers a convenient opportunity. Scheduled to start for the Yankees are Jordan Montgomery, C. C. Sabathia and Sonny Gray.\n\nThe Mets, on the other hand, will stay at home to face the Miami Marlins in a matchup of teams going nowhere.\n\nThe Mets were built around a talented pitching staff, but Thursday was another example of its perplexing performance this season. Injuries have decimated the staff, yet even when healthy the starters have not delivered as expected.\n\nStarter Steven Matz, despite an injury-filled career, has a stout track record when healthy. But since missing the first two months of the season with an elbow problem, he has pitched poorly. Matz and the Mets have said multiple times that he is healthy.\n\nAgainst the Yankees, Matz was off from the start. He committed a two-base throwing error after the leadoff hitter Brett Gardner hit a ground ball to the mound. Then Matz walked Aaron Hicks and struck out Aaron Judge, only to give up a three-run home run to Sanchez on a changeup that caught too much of the plate.\n\nMatz yelled at himself on the mound, and straightened himself out for the next two innings. But in the fourth, he gave up four straight hits, including a double that drove in two runs, before inducing a groundout and hitting Judge with a pitch. Mets Manager Terry Collins hooked Matz, ending his night at 76 pitches.\n\nSanchez then drove in two more runs with a single off Matz's replacement, Chasen Bradford. In all, Matz was charged with a career-high seven runs (six earned). His earned run average ballooned to 6.08.\n\nMuch of it was courtesy of Sanchez, who has been among the Yankees' best hitters of late after sputtering in July. Since his batting average dropped to .263 on Aug. 8, Sanchez has five multihit games and smashed five home runs.\n\nUntil the ninth inning, the Mets' only run came on a single by Matt Reynolds, which drew applause from the Citi Field crowd, perhaps somewhat mockingly.\n\nThe Mets played short-handed on Thursday, but not as badly as the day before, when injuries to Jose Reyes and Wilmer Flores forced them to comically use catcher Travis d'Arnaud at third base (and second base).\n\nBefore Thursday's game, the Mets placed Reyes on the 10-day disabled list with a left oblique strain, which he said was milder than the one that forced him to miss 17 games last summer. In his place, the Mets called up Reynolds from Class AAA Las Vegas and plugged him in at third base.\n\nFlores, on the other hand, tested out his sore left rib cage injury before the game and satisfied the Mets enough not to be placed on the disabled list. Collins, however, said before the game that Flores was likely to be unavailable to play anyway.\n\nBut just in case, the Mets also activated infielder Gavin Cecchini, sending down reliever Kevin McGowan.\n\nAs the musical chairs of the Mets' roster and season continued, the crosstown rival Yankees simply charged ahead.\n\nINSIDE PITCH\n\nDesignated hitter Matt Holliday (lumbar strain) and second baseman Starlin Castro (hamstring strain) are both expected to begin minor league rehabilitation assignments on Friday. Holliday will report to Class A Advanced Tampa and Castro to Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. ...

The Yankees could be heating up after a 5-3 victory over the Mets gave the team three straight wins. Both the arms and bats contributed with Yanks starter Jaime Garcia allowing all three runs on five hits and three free passes over 5.1 frames before three relievers put up zeros the rest of the way. The Yankees offense did their damage on eight hits and five BB with Aaron Judge going deep and scoring twice while Didi Gregorius knocked in two followed by Chase Headley with an RBI and run. The New York Yankees have tabbed right hander Luis Severino as the starter versus the rival New York Mets on Thursday. Severino suffered a rare poor performance in a 10-5 loss to the Boston Red Sox with all ten runs soring (eight earned) over 4.1 frames.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports\n\nThe New York Mets know the season is over from a competitive standpoint but they can be spoilers. The Mets opportunity at playing a spoiler didn't materialize on Wednesday as neither the pitching or hitting was able to come through. NYM starter Robert Gsellman gave up three runs (two earned) on four hits and three bases on balls over 5.1 innings to absorb the loss while Paul Sewald allowed a pair of runs in 1.2 innings. The Mets mustered six hits and three bases on balls with Rene Rivera clubbing his 8th long ball while Yoenis Cespedes knocked in a run and scored. The New York Mets give Thursday's starting assignment to Steven Matz who last faced the New York Yankees in 2016.Matz comes off of a 3-1 defeat at the Philadelphia Phillies with two runs (one earned) scoring on four hits and two BB in 5.2 frames.\n\nThe under is 12-5-1 in NY Yankees last 18 road games while the over is 9-3 in NY Yankees last 12 interleague road games.

But it was. The Yankees swept four games from the Mets culminating with a 7-5 triumph Thursday night.\n\nSo they left the Subway Series for Boston, to a huge three-game set, to six-plus weeks of contention.\n\nThe Mets? They are as far off the rails as at any point this year, unsure about the physical and or mental state of all of the prized starters not named Jacob deGrom who were supposed to make this a Met city in 2017.\n\n\"No question about it,\" Terry Collins said when I asked if he remembered that narrative from March.\n\nWhen asked how it makes him feel -- a baseball lifer almost certainly in his final days in uniform -- that these Mets could not honor that expectation, the manager stared at the ground, searched for the right words and then said, \"It breaks your heart.\"\n\nThe Mets have won one of their last seven series -- against the worst-in-the-majors Phillies. During this time they were swept by the Dodgers and Yankees, a gulf between where they are and where they were supposed to be overt. They are 10-28 against teams in a playoff spot.\n\nYes, this further August downturn coincides with their trading of three of their better players. But still from this core the Mets want to insist they are going to revive into a contender again next year. But, as always, much of that will be based on the names in the rotation. Notice the use of \"names.\"\n\nBecause when it comes to deeds there is deGrom and a bunch of head and body cases. Take your choice on Steven Matz, who has not recorded an out in the sixth inning since July 3 and Tuesday night recorded one out in the fourth before being lifted, ultimately responsible for a 7-0 deficit.\n\nWill there be enough physical and behavioral improvements in Matz, Robert Gsellman, Matt Harvey, Seth Lugo, Noah Syndergaard and Zack Wheeler for the Mets to truly believe 2017 an aberration? Maybe that is what the rest of this dispiriting season is about, getting them all back pitching well. Though would anything done by this group make even an optimist comfortable about 2018?\n\nPerhaps the Mets can look to Luis Severino, who went from among the majors' worst starters last year to one of the best this season. In a microcosm of that, he rebounded from his poorest effort in 2017 (10 runs in 4 \u00b9/\u2083 innings against the Red Sox) to hold the Mets to one unearned runs over 6 \u00b9/\u2083 innings with nine strikeouts.\n\nHis pitching and a 7-0 lead created through four innings, mainly via five RBIs from Gary Sanchez, should have helped the cause in Boston this weekend by resting the best parts of a bullpen that had overwhelmed the Mets in the first three games of this series.\n\nBut Bryan Mitchell yielded a ninth-inning grand slam to Curtis Granderson -- really, no contender can use this guy? -- and Dellin Betances had to get three outs, taking him out of service for the opener in Fenway. This was as close to victory as the Mets got in this series -- hurting the Yankees for a big upcoming series.\n\n\"Not ideal,\" manager Joe Girardi said about having to deploy Betances.\n\nStill, the sweep of the Mets gave the Yankees greater comfort in the wild-card race. They are now up 3 \u00b9/\u2082 games on the second wild-card Angels and four on a playoff spot in general. But that, four games, is what they trail the Red Sox by as this weekend showdown begins.\n\nSo if the Yankees are going to try to do more than host a wild-card game these three games in Boston grow in substance. The Red Sox have won 12-of-14, including two of three last week in The Bronx. Should they take another two of three or sweep, then the Red Sox essentially go on magic number watch.\n\n\"The clock is ticking,\" Girardi acknowledged about a dwindling schedule.\n\nBut for the Yankees at least there is Boston and opportunity and six weeks of contention. For the Mets, the Subway Series stood as a last best chance to salvage at least some pride this season. Now, that too is gone.", "id": "9817979", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Yankees own New York once again", "image":

It is the third season sweep in Subway Series history; the Yanks went 6-0 against the Mets in 2003, and the Mets went 4-0 in 2013 during the first Subway Series to feature the four-game format.\n\nWith the Red Sox idle, the Yankees (65-55) now sit four games behind them for the AL East lead and head up to Boston for a three-game set.\n\nThe Mets trailed 7-1 heading into the ninth, but Bryan Mitchell loaded the bases and gave up a grand slam to Curtis Granderson with no outs to make it interesting. With the struggling Aroldis Chapman (hamstring) still unavailable, Dellin Betances then came in and got the next three batters out for his eighth save of the season.\n\nSteven Matz was reeling from the get-go, and Sanchez made him pay with a three-run homer in the first inning. Sanchez added a two-run single in the fourth immediately after Matz was pulled, putting the Yanks up 7-0. His five RBI tied a career-high, marking the third time he's driven in that many runs, and he's up to 22 home runs and 64 RBI this season.\n\nMatz gave up seven runs (six earned) in 3 1/3 innings, allowing seven hits and two walks with four strikeouts. Meanwhile, Luis Severino bounced back from his rough outing by giving up just one unearned run in 6 1/3 innings, striking out nine while allowing four hits and three walks.\n\nPLAY OF THE GAME\n\nIn the fourth inning, Severino picked up his first career hit on what was an attempt at a sacrifice bunt. Severino's bunt popped the ball up but Dominic Smith missed it on a dive, and Matz's shovel attempt couldn't beat Severino to first base. That loaded the bases and set Brett Garner up for a two-run double.\n\nTURNING POINT\n\nSanchez's two-run single in the fourth inning put the Yankees up 7-0 at the time, important runs as the Mets ended up putting up a fight in the ninth inning.\n\nSTAR OF THE GAME\n\nSanchez. In 15 games this month, Sanchez is 17-for-51 (.333) with six homers, 13 RBI, three doubles, 11 runs and six walks.\n\nSTAT OF THE GAME\n\n34. Already the record-holder for position players, Aaron Judge tied pitcher Vida Blue at 34 consecutive games with at least one strikeout, and Judge is now one shy of tying pitcher Bill Stoneman's 1971 record of 35. Judge struck out thrice Thursday and has struck out multiple times in 19 of the 34 games during the streak.\n\nMIA\n\nYoenis Cespedes went 0-for-3 with a strikeout before he was switched out of the game at the end of the sixth inning.\n\nUNSUNG HERO\n\nGardner's two-run double in the fourth put the Yanks up 5-0. The left fielder reached on a throwing error by Matz to begin the game and scored on Sanchez's home run.\n\nNEXT GAMES\n\nYankees vs. Red Sox\n\nFriday, Aug. 18, 7:10 p.m. TV: YES/MLBN\n\nLHP Jordan

The over-under is set at 7.\n\nMLB Quick Links: Scores & Matchups | Injuries | Odds Comparison | Betting Trends | ATS Stats\n\nLuis Severino (9-5, 3.32 ERA) will start for the Yankees, while the Mets turn to Steven Matz (2-6, 5.54 ERA). Severino had been on a roll, giving up no more than one earned run in five straight starts before being shelled for 10 runs (eight earned) in 4 1/3 innings during a 10-5 home loss to Boston on August 12. He carries a 1.11 WHIP into this game. Matz has struggled with consistency since returning from injury and the Mets are 3-9 in his 12 starts. He is coming off an encouraging performance at Philadelphia, where he gave up two earned runs on four hits over 5 1/3 innings in a 3-1 loss.\n\nThe Yankees won two games in the Bronx to begin the home-and-home four-game series, then proceeded to defeat the Mets 5-3 at Citi Field Wednesday night. The Yankees are 64-55 overall and 29-33 on the road, while the Mets are 53-65 and 26-33 at home.\n\nWednesday's game saw a Didi Gregorius two-run double in the top of the seventh inning snap a 3-3 tie. Aaron Judge also hit a 450-foot home run. Chase Headley was 2-for-2 with a double, a walk, a run scored and an RBI. Ronald Torreyes was 2-for-4 with a double and a run. The Mets were led offensively by Juan Lagares, who was 2-for-4 with a double and a run. Rene Rivera added a solo home run. Paul Sewald took the loss in relief for the Mets, giving up the double to Gregorius. Three Yankees relievers combined for 3 2/3 innings of one-hit baseball, with Tommy Kahnle earning the win and David Robertson picking up his 14th save.\n\nBet on Yankees vs. Mets\n\nSeverino was great until his last start and you have to assume he will bounce back strong against a lineup that isn't all that difficult to navigate through. Matz has been poor and even his last start can be taken with a grain of salt since it was against the Phillies. Don't overthink this game, aside from perhaps considering the Yankees' -1.5 runline at -110.\n\nMLB DAILY PREDICTION: NEW YORK YANKEES -191\n\nRecent MLB Discussions Hey Mike on Thu, Aug 2017 by Timmy19611ST MLB FOR THURS.

It was 2016, and he labored and lost. He struggled terribly as a starter, his spot with the Yankees was called into question, and with Severino at the ripe old age of 22, some wondered if he was destined to be a disappointment.\n\nBut that was the past. Severino rebounded in 2017. Last month, CC Sabathia even called him the Yankees' ace.\n\nLatest Yankees stories Steven Matz chased early as Mets fall to Yanks Rieber: Gary returns to 2016 San-chise mode Sanchez's HR, 5 RBIs help Yankees sweep Mets A healthy Austin finally makes it back Reyes lands on disabled list, Flores avoids it\n\nIf Severino learned anything from the most difficult year of his career, it was on full display Thursday night at Citi Field. In his first start since being charged with a career-high 10 runs in 4 1/3 innings against the Red Sox (eight earned), he proved he has mastered something that many players his age struggle with.\n\nIt appears Severino has learned how to fail -- or, perhaps more correctly, how to not let past failure dictate future results.\n\nSeverino zipped through the Mets' lineup with the confidence of someone with a very short memory Thursday night, and his team cruised until Bryan Mitchell made it a ballgame by allowing Curtis Granderson's grand slam in the ninth inning of the Yankees' 7-5 victory.\n\nBaseballMets vs. Yankees: See photos of Subway Series 2017\n\nSeverino (10-5, 3.18 ERA) allowed one run, which was unearned, and four hits in 6 1/3 innings. His nine strikeouts put him at 175 in 150 innings this year, fourth in the American League.\n\nadvertisement | advertise on newsday\n\n\"A lot of times in life, you grow more through your struggles than through your success,\" Joe Girardi said. \"The year before he came up -- 2015 -- and really burst on the scene, he didn't really struggle a whole lot. Last year, he went through his struggles and figured out what he needed to do to be really successful at this level over and over . . . Sometimes you have to make adjustments, and that's what he learned how to do last year, and I think it helps him make an adjustment after a poor start.\"\n\nSeverino walked three Mets, but with a ground-ball percentage that ranks third in the AL, it didn't cause too much of a problem. His slider and changeup appeared sharper, his fastball placement more exact.\n\n\"I wasn't ahead of the count almost all of the time [in the previous start], so I tried to do that,\" Severino said. \"I think the last time, the third inning, I tried too [hard] to pitch around the batters, so this time, I just went after everyone.\"\n\nHe also recorded his first major-league hit, a semi-popped-up sacrifice bunt that got past the diving Dominic Smith in the fourth inning to load the bases with none out, much to the delirious delight of his teammates. He scored the Yankees' sixth run on Gary Sanchez's two-run single.\n\nYankeesSanchez's HR, 5 RBIs help Yankees sweep Mets\n\nSeverino was 0-8 with an 8.50 ERA as a starter last season but then starred as a reliever, going 3-0 with an 0.39 ERA. And on Thursday night, he returned to his 2017 form, giving the Yankees confidence that a bad start doesn't necessarily mean a regression to the Severino of old. Before that start against the Red Sox, he was 4-0 with a 0.83 ERA since the All-Star break.\n\nThe only run he gave up Thursday night came courtesy of Aaron Judge, who dropped a one-out fly ball to land Travis d'Arnaud at second in the seventh. Matt Reynolds drove him in with a single. Brandon Nimmo also singled, and Severino exited to applause from the Yankees fans situated behind the visiting dugout.\n\nIt was a poised, successful start, and really not all that surprising. One year after that terrible season, Severino is the youngest Yankees All-Star since Mel Stottlemyre in 1965. He's withstood failure and disappointment and months of being booed to come out the other side, and on Thursday night, he simply showed how far he's come and how much he's learned along the way.", "id": "9816197", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Severino rebounds from bad start vs. Red Sox", "image": "https://cdn.newsday.com/polopoly_fs/1.14071434.1503025499!/httpImage/image.jpeg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1280/image.jpeg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}, "id": "302624", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}, "id": "303573", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball"}, {"label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}, "id": "303713", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in"}, {"label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}, "id": "303714", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher"}, {"label": {"eng": "Disabled list"}, "id": "304989", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disabled_list"}, {"label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}, "id": "304992", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average"}, {"label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}, "id": "305016", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}, "id": "305018", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls"}, {"label": {"eng": "Innings"}, "id": "305020", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings"}, {"label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "id": "305021", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "id": "305791", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}, "id": "310475", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox"}, {"label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}, "id": "310537", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Changeup"}, "id": "310539", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup"}, {"label": {"eng": "Earned run"}, "id": "310542", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fastball"}, "id": "310548", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glossary of baseball (P)"}, "id": "310554", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_(P)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Slider"}, "id": "310593", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider"}, {"label": {"eng": "American League"}, "id": "310669", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}, "id": "310901", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball"}, {"label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}, "id": "312236", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game"}, {"label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}, "id": "312732", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees"}, {"label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}, "id": "312740", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets"}, {"label": {"eng": "Curtis Granderson"}, "id": "334413", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Granderson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis d'Arnaud"}, "id": "361268", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_d'Arnaud"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joe Girardi"}, "id": "366221", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Girardi"}, {"label": {"eng": "CC Sabathia"}, "id": "403816", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CC_Sabathia"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 381, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 385, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 724, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Distance Learning", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Distance_Learning"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 725, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Methods and Theories", "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Methods_and_Theories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1012, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Childcare", "uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Childcare"}], "time": "03:34:00"}

He tallied 11 homers and 21 RBIs in 24 games last August.\n\nLuis, Luis: Severino has emerged as the Yankees' ace, but none of his achievements on the mound have seemed to generate as much genuine enthusiasm as his first big league hit, a bunt popup in the fourth inning that eluded first baseman Dominic Smith. Severino raised his hands in the air after his soft knock, which loaded the bases with none out to set up Gardner's two-run double and Sanchez's two-run single.", "id": "9821353", "details": {"gpCnt": 4}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Yankees sweep Mets in Subway Series", "image": "http://m.mlb.com/assets/images/0/1/6/249121016/cuts/1280x720/cut.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "209299", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}, "id": "302624", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Handedness"}, "id": "303569", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness"}, {"label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}, "id": "303573", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball"}, {"label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}, "id": "303713", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in"}, {"label": {"eng": "Innings"}, "id": "305020", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings"}, {"label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "id": "305021", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}, "id": "305023", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher"}, {"label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "id": "305791", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run"}, {"label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}, "id": "307683", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}, "id": "310475", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox"}, {"label": {"eng": "First baseman"}, "id": "310511", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman"}, {"label": {"eng": "Changeup"}, "id": "310539", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup"}, {"label": {"eng": "Earned run"}, "id": "310542", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fastball"}, "id": "310548", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dellin Betances"}, "id": "310587", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dellin_Betances"}, {"label": {"eng": "Save (baseball)"}, "id": "310590", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_(baseball)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}, "id": "310591", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}, "id": "311922", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder"}, {"label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}, "id": "312732", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees"}, {"label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}, "id": "312740", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets"}, {"label": {"eng": "Subway Series"}, "id": "314181", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Series"}, {"label": {"eng": "American League East"}, "id": "314218", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East"}, {"label": {"eng": "Curveball"}, "id": "327953", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball"}, {"label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}, "id": "328427", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Curtis Granderson"}, "id": "334413", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Granderson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brett Gardner"}, "id": "423229", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Gardner"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 52, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 205, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 220, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1009, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Multiplayer", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Multiplayer"}], "time": "04:24:00"}

Suffice it to say, it wasn't the type of performance Yankees have grown accustomed to seeing out of their All-Star ace.\n\n\"I think he's pretty good at doing that,\" Girardi said. \"Our hope is he'll get back to being Sevy today.\"\n\nThat wish was granted. Big time.\n\nIn 6 \u00b9/\u2083 innings Thursday, Severino gave up just four hits and one run, which was unearned. A two-base error by Aaron Judge on a deep fly ball from Travis d'Arnaud led to the Mets' only run with Severino dealing.\n\nThe 23-year-old also fanned nine batters, bringing his strikeout total to 175, which ranks fourth in the American League behind Chris Sale, Chris Archer and Corey Kluber. Not bad company.\n\n\"I would say the difference tonight was his slider and his changeup,\" catcher Gary Sanchez said.\n\nSeverino said his ability to get ahead in the count, which he struggled to do in his previous start, was key.\n\n\"I think the last time I tried to pitch around the batters, this time I went after them,\" he said.\n\nSeverino, who improved to 10-5 with a 3.18 ERA, didn't just deliver on the mound. In the fourth inning, he recorded his first career hit, a pop-up bunt that Mets first baseman Dominic Smith could not corral. It wasn't conventional, but it worked, and Severino came around to score on Sanchez's single to left field.\n\n\"A hit is a hit,\" Severino said. \"I'll take it.\"\n\nSanchez had a monster night of his own, tying a career-high with five RBIs.\n\nHis three-run homer in the first provided a nice cushion for Severino. Those runs proved crucial later, however, as Curtis Granderson's ninth-inning grand slam off Bryan Mitchell made things interesting.\n\nDellin Betances got the final three outs to seal Severino's 10th win of what has been a breakout season.", "id": "9832526", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Why Luis Severino was able to rebound after Red Sox debacle", "image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/severino.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}, "id": "302624", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Handedness"}, "id": "303569", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness"}, {"label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}, "id": "303713", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in"}, {"label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}, "id": "304992", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average"}, {"label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}, "id": "305016", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Innings"}, "id": "305020", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings"}, {"label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "id": "305021", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Home run"}, "id": "305791", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run"}, {"label": {"eng": "Catcher"}, "id": "305794", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}, "id": "310475", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox"}, {"label": {"eng": "First baseman"}, "id": "310511", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glossary of baseball (A)"}, "id": "310535", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_(A)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}, "id": "310537", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Changeup"}, "id": "310539", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup"}, {"label": {"eng": "Earned run"}, "id": "310542", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run"}, {"label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}, "id": "310552", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glossary of baseball (P)"}, "id": "310554", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_(P)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Slider"}, "id": "310593", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider"}, {"label": {"eng": "American League"}, "id": "310669", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}, "id": "310901", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball"}, {"label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}, "id": "311922", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chris Sale"}, "id": "312729", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sale"}, {"label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}, "id": "312732", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees"}, {"label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}, "id": "312740", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets"}, {"label": {"eng": "Curtis Granderson"}, "id": "334413", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Granderson"}, {"label": {"eng": "Travis d'Arnaud"}, "id": "361268", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_d'Arnaud"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joe Girardi"}, "id": "366221", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Girardi"}, {"label": {"eng": "Corey Kluber"}, "id": "385393", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Kluber"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chris Archer"}, "id": "425314", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Archer"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 69, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 385, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 386, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 947, "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers"}], "time": "06:09:00"}

Most of the early scoring came off of sac flies and solo home runs, including one exceptional home run by none other than Aaron Judge, who launched a ball 457 feet into the left field upper deck in the sixth.\n\nAfter exchanging one-run innings for most of the game, the Yankees finally jumped ahead for good in the top of the seventh after Didi Gregorius plated two runs with a bases-loaded double. The Yankee bullpen then proceeded to shut down the Mets' lineup, with Adam Warren and Dave Robertson combining for three innings while allowing only one hit and striking out five.\n\nSeverino has been the Yankees' unlikely ace in 2017 after last season's struggles, and besides a rough start against Boston last week, he shows no signs of wearing down. In the month of July he posted a 2.58 ERA, his best month to date. He's also been a top five AL pitcher in K/9 (10.40), K/BB (4.37) and WHIP (1.11). It is worth noting that this is Severino's first full season in the Majors, and although the team has stated he is not on an innings limit, he has already more than doubled his total innings pitched from last season. Some wear and tear could be imminent.\n\nMatz has had a tough and injury-shortened season so far for the Mets, posting a 5.54 ERA and a 1.47 WHIP. He comes into tonight's game off a four game losing streak in which he's allowed 16 earned runs in 19 innings. He's still looking to regain some of the success he had last year, but his decreased strike out rates and increased walk/home run rates indicate that something's not working.\n\nGary Sanchez really seems to have things figured out as we enter mid-August, batting .319 in his last 14 games, with eight extra-base hits including five home runs. He has also reached base safely in his past 10 consecutive games. Judge has shown signs of breaking his extended post-All Star slump, putting up an OPS of .983 in his last seven games, in spite of setting the MLB record for consecutive games for a non-pitcher with a strikeout last night.\n\nFrazier's struggles as a Yankee continue as his low power numbers fail to make up for his less than impressive batting average of .209 on the season.\n\nThe Mets' outfield has really been picking things up lately, with Curtis Granderson, Yoenis Cespedes, and Michael Conforto all sporting slugging percentages over .500 and combining for 15 home runs and 30 RBIs in their last 15 games. Highly touted rookie Amed Rosario looks to finally be figuring things out as well, posting an OPS of 1.011 in the past week.\n\nOn the other side, Travis d'Arnaud has been struggling in a major way, gathering only six hits in his last 40 at-bats, for a batting average of .150 over that span.\n\nThe Yankees have had some issues driving in runners in scoring position as of late, but I have to figure that will end soon, and with a struggling pitcher like Matz on the mound for the Mets it looks like tonight could be their night. Still, the home team's lineup figures to make some noise against Severino, who has entered uncharted territory in terms of work load. The Yankees are rolling right now, having won the first three games of the series so far, and I think this gives them the definitive edge.", "id": "9806516", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "New York Yankees vs New York Mets Lineups: Preview and prediction (August 17, 2017) -

It's not that way for most baseball fans, however. The numbers show that only a minority actually like one team but not the other, while far more people hold the same opinion of both teams (good or bad) or just don't care about one or both. In other words, most fans will probably be fine no matter the outcome tonight.\n\nThat's according to data from a combination of two FiveThirtyEight-commissioned SurveyMonkey Audience polls conducted in June and July. SurveyMonkey asked baseball fans across the country how they felt -- whether they had a favorable view, an unfavorable view or didn't know enough to say -- about each MLB team. Here, we're examining a subset of that data, totaling 321 baseball fans who were asked specifically about the Mets and Yankees.\n\nOf those, many fans (29 percent) held a favorable view of both the Mets and the Yankees. It's not just that a fairly high percentage liked both teams. It's that if you like one team, it actually increases your chance of liking the other team. While just 49 percent of the overall subsample held a favorable view of the Mets, 66 percent of fans who viewed the Yankees favorably felt the same way about the Mets. And a similar story holds in reverse. Only 44 percent of the fans in our subsample held a favorable view of the Yankees, but that percentage jumped to 59 percent among fans who held a favorable view of the Mets.\n\nWhile the idea that someone could simultaneously like the Mets and the Yankees is unthinkable to this Yankee hater, it actually makes a lot of sense. Fans often root for the hometown team, whether it be in their city or even their state. So it's not unreasonable to say you like both the Mets and the Yankees because they are both from New York. Indeed, among our subsample who live in New York state, the Mets and Yankees sport a 71 percent and a 67 percent favorable rating, respectively.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, 21 percent of baseball fans dislike both franchises. So that means 50 percent of baseball fans either like both the Yankees and Mets, or dislike both -- not quite what you'd expect from a heated rivalry where battle lines are drawn and allegiances sworn. In fact, disliking the Mets or the Yankees actually makes one less apt to like the other team as well. The Mets sport just a 41 percent favorable rating among those who dislike the Yankees, 8 points below their overall favorable rating. And the Yankees do even worse among fans who dislike the Mets, with a 33 percent favorable rating -- far below their 44 percent favorable mark overall.\n\nAgain, part of this may just have to do with disliking a city or a state. As an illustration of this, the Mets and Yankees sport favorable ratings of just 40 percent and 30 percent among our subsample that hailed from New England. New England, of course, is a natural geographic rival of New York.\n\nStill, there are some people who do like the Mets and dislike the Yankees, and vice versa. One-fifth (20 percent) of fans hold a favorable view of the Mets and an unfavorable view of the Yankees. Meanwhile, 11 percent of fans hold a favorable view of the Yankees but an unfavorable view of the Mets. These fans, however, total only about a third of our subsample. That's not much more than the 20 percent of fans who hold no opinion of at least one (if not both) teams.\n\nDon't tell that to the New Yorkers in the stands, jawing at each other about the two ballclubs. But the bottom line is that most baseball fans around the country won't have much of anything on the line in tonight's Subway Series finale.", "id": "9764183", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Mets vs. Yankees?

And by the sound of it, the Mets don't plan on pitching around the Marlins' hulking power hitter.\n\n\"For sure we'll go after him,\" catcher Rene Rivera said Thursday before the Mets were swept in the Subway Series after losing 7-5 to the Yankees. \"You have a way to pitch him. Same thing with Judge here, he's got 37 bombs, and you have to go right after him. You got to get outs. You cannot make a mistake. That's when you get hit.\n\n\"We got to go out there and pitch to him, don't be afraid of the long ball.\"\n\nFollowing an off day Thursday, Stanton comes to Flushing with a major league-best 44 home runs, and is fourth in MLB with 94 RBIs. He's on pace to set a career high in slugging percentage, with his .645 clip, and his .287 batting average is close to his career high of .290 set in 2012.\n\nRookie Chris Flexen, Friday's starting pitcher, has never faced Stanton, but is looking forward to the challenge.\n\n\"Why not?\" said Flexen, who has won his past two starts. \"I'm excited to face a team like that with a guy like that. ... After scouting him and watching video and stuff, it's about executing the game plan and executing the pitches. Keep him off balance, work him up and down. Everybody's got a hole, and you just got to exploit it.\"\n\nSince the All-Star break, the 27-year-old slugger has been on another planet, belting 18 homers in 31 games. A streak of going deep in six straight games, two shy of the major league record shared by Ken Griffey Jr., Dale Long and Marlins manager Don Mattingly, was broken in Wednesday's win over the Giants. In August, Stanton has put up absurd numbers: 11 homers in 15 games, a slash line of .386/.462/1.018, and a 1.479 OPS.\n\nStanton has homered five times in 13 games against the Mets this season, and is batting .280 (14-for-37) versus them overall. But the Mets haven't seen this version of Stanton. The Mets and Marlins last met June 27-29 in Miami.\n\n\"There's a lot of things different,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said. \"We've noticed a change in his stance. We've noticed a change in his approach at the plate. We've got to make certainly some adjustments how we're going to pitch to him.\n\n\"We're seeing him hit balls he didn't hit in April.\"\n\nCollins did say the Mets will try to be \"very, very careful with him,\" but also pointed out the Marlins' lineup is too deep to just put Stanton on base. Mets pitchers can't be afraid of him.\n\n\"No matter what he does, or any of those other guys do, as long as we come out on top, that's all that matters at the end,\" Flexen said.", "id": "9815772",

He faced four or fewer batters in each of his first five innings. The Yankee ace has now won five of his last six games pitched.\n\nGirardi believes Severino's struggles last season, when he finished the year 3-8 with a 5.83 ERA, have helped the righthander mature and be able to better overcome poor outings like the one against Boston.\n\n\"I think he grew a lot last year,\" Girardi said after the game. \"And I think a lot of times in life you grow more through your struggles than you do your success.\"\n\nSeverino, who gave up eight hits and 10 runs (eight earned) in 4.1 innings against the Red Sox, said the biggest difference Thursday night was the fact he was able to get into more pitcher-friendly counts early-on in at-bats, allowing him to attack hitters more so than he did in his last outing.\n\n\"I was in a hitter count almost all the time (against the Red Sox),\" Severino said after the game. \"Last time I tried to pitch around the batters. This time I just went after everyone.\"\n\nGary Sanchez further backed Severino's claim, telling reporters the righthander had much better command of his pitches Thursday compared to his last outing against Boston.\n\n\"I would say the difference tonight was his slider and his changeup,\" Sanchez said through a translator after the game. \"His changeup was much better tonight and his slider as well. He was also commanding his fastball tonight very well.\"\n\nThe righthander leads the Yankees in wins (10), ERA (3.18) and strikeouts (175).\n\nIncluding Thursday's impressive performance, Severino is now fourth in the American League in ERA and sixth with 3.7 wins above replacement.\n\nIn addition to his latest win, Severino also recorded his first career major-league hit, a sacrifice bunt attempt that dropped right in front of a diving Dominic Smith. While a hit wasn't his intended goal, Severino said he was happy with the outcome.\n\n\"A hit is a hit,\" Severino said, laughing. \"I'll take it.\"\n\nTags: luis severino new york yankees mlb Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "id": "9824998", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Luis Severino returns to ace form in win over Mets", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3421816.1503029882!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/yankees-mets-baseball.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "209299", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hit (baseball)"}, "id": "302624", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_(baseball)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Handedness"}, "id": "303569", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "id": "303571", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher"}, {"label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}, "id": "303573", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball"}, {"label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}, "id": "304992", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average"}, {"label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}, "id": "305016", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}, "id": "305021", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}, "id": "305217", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game"}, {"label": {"eng": "Batting average"}, "id": "305786", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average"}, {"label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}, "id": "310475", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox"}, {"label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}, "id": "310537", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout"}, {"label": {"eng": "Changeup"}, "id": "310539", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fastball"}, "id": "310548", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball"}, {"label": {"eng": "Glossary of baseball (P)"}, "id": "310554", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_baseball_(P)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Slider"}, "id": "310593", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider"}, {"label": {"eng": "American League"}, "id": "310669", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League"}, {"label": {"eng": "At bat"}, "id": "311917", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat"}, {"label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}, "id": "312236", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game"}, {"label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}, "id": "312732", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees"}, {"label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}, "id": "312740", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets"}, {"label": {"eng": "Subway Series"}, "id": "314181", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_Series"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wins Above Replacement"}, "id": "314219", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sacrifice bunt"}, "id": "358790", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_bunt"}, {"label": {"eng": "Joe Girardi"}, "id": "366221", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Girardi"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 49, "label": "dmoz/Games", "uri": "dmoz/Games"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 51, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 52, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 134, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 135, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 205, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 641, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action"}], "time": "05:00:00"}

The bad news is Friday marks the first of six times they will have to deal with Giancarlo Stanton over the final six weeks of the 2017 campaign.\n\nThe Mets will look to quiet the hottest hitter in the game Friday night when Stanton and the Miami Marlins arrive in New York for a three-game series at Citi Field.\n\nNew York right-hander Chris Flexen (2-1, 7.02 ERA) is scheduled to oppose Miami left-hander Justin Nicolino (1-1, 4.56 ERA).\n\nThe Mets enter Friday fresh off four consecutive losses to the New York Yankees, who swept the Subway Series for the first time since 2003 by earning a 7-5 win at Citi Field on Thursday night. The Mets (53-66) are at least 13 games below .500 for the first time since ending the 2013 season at 74-88.\n\nMiami was off Thursday following an 8-1 win over the visiting San Francisco Giants on Wednesday. The Marlins (58-61) will try Friday to move within two games of .500 for the first time since they were 12-14 on May 3.\n\nStanton's historic run hit the mildest of hiccups Wednesday, when he went 2-for-4 but saw his streak of games with a home run end at six, just two shy of the all-time record shared by Marlins manager Don Mattingly, Hall of Famer Ken Griffey Jr. and Dale Long.\n\nStanton has a remarkable 23 homers in his past 36 games dating back to July 5 and leads the majors with a franchise-record 44 homers.\n\n\"What Giancarlo has been doing is just incredible,\" Mattingly said after Stanton homered in a 9-4 loss to the Giants on Tuesday. \"He's right on a lot of balls. He's very dangerous right now.\"\n\nNobody knows that better than Mets manager Terry Collins, whose pitching staff just \"limited\" Judge, the American League's home run leader, to two round-trippers in four games.\n\nStanton has 32 homers in 102 career games against New York.\n\n\"Giancarlo, he's hurt us enough in the past to know that he can be so dangerous,\" Collins said Thursday. \"We're going to try to be very, very careful with him.\"\n\nFlexen, a rookie making his fifth career start, will be the first line of defense against Stanton. The 23-year-old won his second consecutive start Sunday when he allowed two runs over five innings as the Mets beat the Phillies 6-2 in Philadelphia.\n\nNicolino earned his first win as a starter in more than 15 months on Saturday, when he allowed two runs (one earned) over 5 1/3 innings as the Marlins beat the Colorado Rockies 4-3.\n\nThe victory was Nicolino's first since Sept. 13, 2016, when he tossed two scoreless innings of relief in the Marlins' win over the Atlanta Braves, and his first as a starter since May 3, 2016, when he allowed four runs over six innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nFlexen has never faced the Marlins. Nicolino is 0-1 with a 5.29 ERA in five career appearances (three starts) against the Mets.", "id": "9845276", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Mets gear up to face Stanton, Marlins (Aug

The collapse occurred shortly after 2 pm, approximately 400 kilometres east of Cape Town along South Africa's south coast.\n\nAuthorities are currently engaged in a frantic rescue operation to reach more than 40 workers believed to be trapped under the debris. Chantel Edwards-Klose, a spokesperson for the George Municipality, provided an early estimate that 70 individuals were on-site when the tragedy struck. The efforts to rescue the trapped workers are being supported by an impressive assembly of 80 rescue personnel already at the scene, with an additional 53 en route from neighboring cities.\n\nThe site of the collapse is notably adjacent to the municipal offices of George, highlighting the proximity of this disaster to the heart of the city's administrative operations. The Western Cape government has been actively monitoring the situation, with Premier Alan Winde affirming that all necessary support is being extended to emergency teams on the ground. \"At the moment, officials are focused on saving lives. This is our top priority at this stage,\" stated Winde, emphasizing the urgency and gravity of the rescue operations.\n\nThe national government has also been briefed on this critical incident as efforts continue to save those still trapped.

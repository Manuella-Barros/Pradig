fight back Sunday against criticisms that it is divided and unprepared for Brexit, saying it will set out detailed plans for the U.K.'s exit from the European Union and issuing a joint statement by two Cabinet rivals over Europe.\n\nTrade Secretary Liam Fox, a strong supporter of leaving the European Union, and the more pro-EU Treasury chief Philip Hammond, wrote in the Sunday Telegraph that they agreed there should be a \"time-limited\" transition period after Britain formally leaves the bloc in 2019, to avoid a \"cliff-edge\" for people and businesses.\n\nFox and Hammond said the transition period \"cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.\" They didn't say how long the transition would last or what rules would apply during that period.\n\nThe government also said Sunday it wants to increase pressure on the 27 other EU nations to start negotiating a \"deep and special\" future relationship that would include a free trade deal between Britain and the EU.\n\nThe EU says those negotiations can't start until sufficient progress has been made on three initial issues: how much money the U.K. will have to pay to settle its outstanding commitments to the bloc; whether security checks and customs duties will be instituted on the Irish border; and the status of 3 million EU nationals living in Britain.\n\nThe government's Brexit department said Britain wants to show that progress on the preliminary issues has been made and \"we are ready to broaden out the negotiations\" by the time of an EU summit in October.\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis said that \"with time of the essence, we need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong U.K. and a strong EU.\"\n\nThe push comes after EU officials expressed impatience with the pace of Britain's preparations.\n\nThe bloc's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said last month there was \"a clock ticking\" on the talks. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said last week that Brexit advocates \"already had 14 months\" to issue detailed proposals, but had not.\n\nBarnier is due to meet Davis for a new round of negotiations at the end of August.\n\nBritain voted to leave the EU in June 2016, but did not trigger the formal two-year exit process until March.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May then called a snap election in an attempt to increase her Conservative Party's majority in Parliament and strengthen her negotiating hand. But voters did not rally to her call, leaving May atop a weakened minority government.\n\nIn recent weeks, with May on her summer vacation, members of her Cabinet have openly disagreed about what direction Brexit should take.\n\nOpponents of Brexit have become increasingly vocal, arguing that the public or Parliament must get the chance to vote on any final deal between Britain and the EU.\n\nDavid Miliband, who was foreign minister in Britain's previous Labour government, said leaving the EU was \"an unparalleled act of economic self-harm.\"\n\nWriting in The Observer newspaper, Miliband said there must be \"a straight vote between EU membership and the negotiated alternative.\"\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

senior ministers presented a united approach to negotiations.\n\nBritain is keen to start talking about its post-Brexit relationship with Europe, wary of the need to reassure anxious businesses, citizens and investors. But Brussels has insisted that progress must be made on divorce arrangements first.\n\n\"We need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong UK and EU,\" Brexit minister David Davis said in a statement.\n\nBritain's call to move forward with Brexit talks came as finance minister Philip Hammond and trade minister Liam Fox presented a united front that there should be a time-limited transition period - signalling a truce between rival factions in Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet.\n\nDavis's Brexit department said it was preparing to publish several papers, including plans for a new customs arrangement and a proposal on how to resolve the difficulties of a non-physical border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\n\"We've been crystal clear that issues around our withdrawal and our future partnership are inextricably linked,\" a source in Britain's Brexit department said.\n\n\"These papers show we are ready to broaden out the negotiations.\"\n\nTalks so far have focused on how much Britain should pay to leave the EU, what rights British and EU citizens will have, and how to manage a land border to the bloc in Ireland. The two sides will be looking for a solution to those issues at the next round of talks due at the end of this month.\n\nThe decision to announce the publication of papers on its plans indicates Britain's desire to counter criticism from Brussels about its approach to the talks.\n\nIn July, EU officials said progress was difficult not because Britain had unacceptable demands, but because it had no position at all on many issues. EU negotiators have warned that an already-tight timetable could be delayed ahead of a scheduled March 2019 exit.\n\nA British paper focused on \"issues unique to Northern Ireland and Ireland\" is expected ahead of the talks, but no further details of the proposal were provided on Sunday.\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph reported that Britain was seeking a \"Schengen area\" between Britain and Ireland, which would allow free movement of people and a \"light-touch customs regime\" across the border of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The Brexit department declined to comment on the story.\n\nThe report, which cited an unnamed source in the Brexit department, said that Irish citizens would be able to work freely in the UK, and British citizens would work freely in Ireland. Citizens of other EU countries could access the UK over the Irish border but would not be able to work in Britain without a work permit.\n\nSeparate papers would also address \"Continuity in the availability of goods for the EU and the UK\" and \"Confidentiality and access to official documents\", the Brexit department said.\n\nEager to push talks past the opening divorce issues and on to the future trading and legal ties to the bloc, Britain also promised a series of \"Future Partnership\" papers in the run-up to October's European Council.

it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.\" They didn't say how long the transition would last or what rules would apply during that period.\n\nThe government also said Sunday it wants to increase pressure on the 27 other EU nations to start negotiating a \"deep and special\" future relationship that would include a free trade deal between Britain and the EU.\n\nThe EU says those negotiations can't start until sufficient progress has been made on three initial issues: how much money the U.K. will have to pay to settle its outstanding commitments to the bloc; whether security checks and customs duties will be instituted on the Irish border; and the status of 3 million EU nationals living in Britain.\n\nThe government's Brexit department said Britain wants to show that progress on the preliminary issues has been made and \"we are ready to broaden out the negotiations\" by the time of an EU summit in October.\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis said that \"with time of the essence, we need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong U.K. and a strong EU.\"\n\nThe push comes after EU officials expressed impatience with the pace of Britain's preparations.\n\nThe bloc's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said last month there was \"a clock ticking\" on the talks.

Smout\n\nLONDON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Britain said on Sunday that it want talks with the EU to move on to the next phase, as it set out details of the future relationship it wants with the bloc and senior ministers presented a united approach to negotiations.\n\nBritain is keen to start talking about its post-Brexit relationship with Europe, wary of the need to reassure anxious businesses, citizens and investors. But Brussels has insisted that progress must be made on divorce arrangements first.\n\n\"We need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong UK and EU,\" Brexit minister David Davis said in a statement.\n\nBritain's call to move forward with Brexit talks came as finance minister Philip Hammond and trade minister Liam Fox presented a united front that there should be a time-limited transition period - signalling a truce between rival factions in Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet.\n\nDavis's Brexit department said it was preparing to publish several papers, including plans for a new customs arrangement and a proposal on how to resolve the difficulties of a non-physical border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.\n\n\"We've been crystal clear that issues around our withdrawal and our future partnership are inextricably linked,\" a source in Britain's Brexit department said.\n\n\"These papers show we are ready to broaden out the negotiations.\"\n\nTalks so far have focused on how much Britain should pay to leave the EU, what rights British and EU citizens will have, and how to manage a land border to the bloc in Ireland. The two sides will be looking for a solution to those issues at the next round of talks due at the end of this month.\n\nThe decision to announce the publication of papers on its plans indicates Britain's desire to counter criticism from Brussels about its approach to the talks.\n\nIn July, EU officials said progress was difficult not because Britain had unacceptable demands, but because it had no position at all on many issues. EU negotiators have warned that an already-tight timetable could be delayed ahead of a scheduled March 2019 exit.\n\nIRISH SCHENGEN AREA?\n\nA British paper focused on \"issues unique to Northern Ireland and Ireland\" is expected ahead of the talks, but no further details of the proposal were provided on Sunday.\n\nThe Sunday Telegraph reported that Britain was seeking a \"Schengen area\" between Britain and Ireland, which would allow free movement of people and a \"light-touch customs regime\" across the border of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The Brexit department declined to comment on the story.\n\nThe report, which cited an unnamed source in the Brexit department, said that Irish citizens would be able to work freely in the UK, and British citizens would work freely in Ireland.

and Liam Fox have agreed there should not be a 'cliff-edge' break when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019\n\nChancellor Philip Hammond and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox have come together to declare that a post-Brexit transition would not be a \"back door\" to Britain remaining in the EU.\n\nAfter a summer of cabinet feuding, Mr Hammond, who favours a \"softer\" pro-business Brexit, and Dr Fox, a hardline Brexiteer, said that they agreed there should not be a \"cliff-edge\" break when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019.\n\nBut in a joint article for The Sunday Telegraph, they agreed that any transition would be \"time limited\" and that Brexit would mean the UK pulling out of both the EU single market and the customs union.\n\n\"We want our economy to remain strong and vibrant through this period of change. That means businesses need to have confidence that there will not be a cliff-edge when we leave the EU in just over 20 months' time,\" they wrote.\n\n\"That is why we believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty - but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.\n\n\"We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the customs union and will be a 'third country', not a party to EU treaties.\"\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May will hope the intervention of the two ministers will cool temperatures in the Tory ranks amid divisions over Brexit and speculation of a possible leadership challenge when MPs return to Westminster in September.\n\nFrom this week, the Government is to start publishing a new series of detailed papers setting out its negotiating position on a range of key issues, amid criticism from Brussels of a lack of clarity about what it wants from the talks.\n\nThey will start with one covering the thorny issues of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic to be followed in the autumn by a second series looking at the future relationship with the EU, including post-Brexit customs arrangements.\n\nMinisters hope it will be enough to persuade the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier that sufficient progress has been made on the opening issues of the Irish border, the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and Britain's \"divorce bill\" to move on to the second phase of talks including a new trade deal.\n\nMeanwhile the leading Conservative Remainer Anna Soubry warned the Prime Minister that she needed to face down the \"hard Brexiteers\" in the Conservative ranks if she wanted to hold on to her position in No 10.\n\nIn an article for The Mail on Sunday, the former business minister indicated she could be prepared to join with politicians from other parties to stop the country \"staggering recklessly\" towards a hard break with Brussels.\n\n\"Could I ever see myself joining with like-minded people who want to save our country from such an appalling fate? And has that moment arrived yet?\" she wrote.\n\n\"The answer to the first question is 'it is not impossible'; the answer to the second is 'no'. But I would be betraying my principles if I did not make it clear that country must always come before party.\"\n\nHer comments came as Labour former foreign secretary David Miliband issued a call for politicians on all sides to fight back against the \"worst consequences\" of last year's vote for Britain to leave the EU.\n\nMr Miliband, who narrowly lost out to his brother Ed in the 2010 Labour leadership contest and who now heads the International Rescue Committee relief agency in New York, described the outcome of the 2016 referendum as an \"unparalleled act of economic self-harm\".\n\nWriting in The Observer, he said the country should have the chance to vote on any Brexit deal in a second referendum with a straight choice between remaining in the EU and the negotiated alternative.\n\n\"In Britain, the implementation of the EU referendum decision has been rash and chaotic. The timing and content has been governed by factions in the Tory party. Our negotiating position is a mystery - even on immigration,\" he wrote.\n\n\"So the fightback against the worst consequences of the referendum has the opportunity and responsibility to get its bearings fast.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-03-", "textEnd": 121, "textStart": 111, "freq": 2}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T09:39:00Z", "sim": 0.7764706015586853, "source": {"uri": "newsandstar.co.uk", "title": "newsandstar.co.uk", "id": "1964"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "09:39:00", "url": "http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/news/national/article/Britain-will-not-stay-in-EU-by-back-door-say-Hammond-and-Fox-145b4de0-8a5b-4cc3-908f-20dc2eba9d95-ds", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8896975", "image": "http://www.newsandstar.co.uk/image/layout_set_logo?img_id=34305&t=1502617063160", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "09:39:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Hammond and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox have come together to declare that a post-Brexit transition would not be a \"back door\" to Britain remaining in the EU.\n\nAfter a summer of cabinet feuding, Mr Hammond, who favours a \"softer\" pro-business Brexit, and Dr Fox, a hardline Brexiteer, said that they agreed there should not be a \"cliff-edge\" break when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019.\n\nBut in a joint article for The Sunday Telegraph, they agreed that any transition would be \"time limited\" and that Brexit would mean the UK pulling out of both the EU single market and the customs union.\n\n\"We want our economy to remain strong and vibrant through this period of change. That means businesses need to have confidence that there will not be a cliff-edge when we leave the EU in just over 20 months' time,\" they wrote.\n\n\"That is why we believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty - but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.\n\n\"We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the customs union and will be a 'third country', not a party to EU treaties.\"\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May will hope the intervention of the two ministers will cool temperatures in the Tory ranks amid divisions over Brexit and speculation of a possible leadership challenge when MPs return to Westminster in September.\n\nFrom this week, the Government is to start publishing a new series of detailed papers setting out its negotiating position on a range of key issues, amid criticism from Brussels of a lack of clarity about what it wants from the talks.\n\nThey will start with one covering the thorny issues of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic to be followed in the autumn by a second series looking at the future relationship with the EU, including post-Brexit customs arrangements.\n\nMinisters hope it will be enough to persuade the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier that sufficient progress has been made on the opening issues of the Irish border, the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and Britain's \"divorce bill\" to move on to the second phase of talks including a new trade deal.\n\nMeanwhile the leading Conservative Remainer Anna Soubry warned the Prime Minister that she needed to face down the \"hard Brexiteers\" in the Conservative ranks if she wanted to hold on to her position in No 10.\n\nIn an article for The Mail on Sunday, the former business minister indicated she could be prepared to join with politicians from other parties to stop the country \"staggering recklessly\" towards a hard break with Brussels.\n\n\"Could I ever see myself joining with like-minded people who want to save our country from such an appalling fate? And has that moment arrived yet?\" she wrote.\n\n\"The answer to the first question is 'it is not impossible'; the answer to the second is 'no'. But I would be betraying my principles if I did not make it clear that country must always come before party.\"\n\nHer comments came as Labour former foreign secretary David Miliband issued a call for politicians on all sides to fight back against the \"worst consequences\" of last year's vote for Britain to leave the EU.\n\nMr Miliband, who narrowly lost out to his brother Ed in the 2010 Labour leadership contest and who now heads the International Rescue Committee relief agency in New York, described the outcome of the 2016 referendum as an \"unparalleled act of economic self-harm\".\n\nWriting in The Observer, he said the country should have the chance to vote on any Brexit deal in a second referendum with a straight choice between remaining in the EU and the negotiated alternative.\n\n\"In Britain, the implementation of the EU referendum decision has been rash and chaotic. The timing and content has been governed by factions in the Tory party. Our negotiating position is a mystery - even on immigration,\" he wrote.\n\n\"So the fightback against the worst consequences of the referendum has the opportunity and responsibility to get its bearings fast.\"\n\nCopyright (c) Press Association Ltd. 2017, All Rights Reserved.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-03-", "textEnd": 417, "textStart": 407}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T08:51:00Z", "sim": 0.7647058963775635, "source": {"uri": "derryjournal.com", "title": "derryjournal.com", "id": "1564"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "08:51:00", "url": "http://www.derryjournal.com/news/ni/britain-will-not-stay-in-eu-by-back-door-say-hammond-and-fox-1-8100640", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8892528", "image": "http://editorial.jpress.co.uk/mastheads/INJF-masthead-share-img.png", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "08:51:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

unprepared for Brexit, announcing it will publish a set of detailed proposals on customs arrangements, the status of the Ireland-Northern Ireland border and other issues.\n\nThe Department for Exiting the European Union said Sunday that it would release the first set of position papers this week, more than a year after Britons voted in a referendum to leave the European Union.\n\nThe government says it hopes to persuade the 27 other EU nations to start negotiating a \"deep and special\" future relationship that would include a free trade deal between Britain and the EU.\n\nThe EU says those negotiations can't start until sufficient progress has been made on three initial issues: how much money the U.K. will have to pay to leave the bloc; whether security checks and customs duties will be instituted on the Irish border; and the status of EU nationals living in Britain.\n\nThe exit bill, estimated at tens of billions of euros, is to cover pension liabilities for EU staff and programs Britain committed to funding over the next few years.\n\nThe government's Brexit department said Britain wants to show that progress on the preliminary issues has been made and \"we are ready to broaden out the negotiations\" by the time of an EU summit in October.\n\n\"Businesses and citizens in the U.K. and EU want to see the talks progress and move towards discussing a deal that works for both sides,\" the department said in a statement.\n\nEU officials have expressed impatience with the pace of Britain's preparations.\n\nThe bloc's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said last month there was \"a clock ticking\" on the talks. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said last week that Brexit advocates \"already had 14 months\" to issue detailed proposals, but had not.\n\nBarnier is due to meet Britain's Brexit minister, David Davis, for a new round of negotiations at the end of August.\n\nBritain voted to leave the EU in June 2016, but did not trigger the formal two-year exit process until March.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May then called a snap election in an attempt to increase her Conservative Party's majority in Parliament and strengthen her negotiating hand. But voters did not rally to her call, leaving May atop a weakened minority government.\n\nIn recent weeks, with May on her summer vacation, members of her Cabinet have openly disagreed about what direction Brexit should take.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-06-", "textEnd": 2003, "textStart": 1994}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T23:15:00Z", "sim": 0.7647058963775635, "source": {"uri": "hosted2.ap.org", "title": "Associated Press", "id": "566"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:41:00", "url": "http://hosted2.ap.org/CARIE/0260ea4c3e85456b80715585ba3c7b5b/Article_2017-08-12-APFN-EU--Britain-Brexit/id-fd5ca9a6acd748598c66b11f3109c767", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8854956", "image": "http://hosted2.ap.org/CBImages/?media=photo&contentId=35783e1987e04d708052e9e278eb6db6&fmt=jpg&Role=Preview&reldt=2017-08-12T23:00:52GMT&authToken=eNoFwjESwCAIBMAXMXMIclj4GSOFXcoUPj6ze%2bubYWHZwh0EoOq8z5nWmVY6JFkQ34QkepMa1Zi1Yq%2b4553aLajk0B%2fmkBNX", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "23:15:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

And has that moment arrived yet?\" she wrote.\n\n\"The answer to the first question is 'it is not impossible'; the answer to the second is 'no'. But I would be betraying my principles if I did not make it clear that country must always come before party.\"\n\nHer comments came as Labour former foreign secretary David Miliband issued a call for politicians on all sides to fight back against the \"worst consequences\" of last year's vote for Britain to leave the EU.\n\nMr Miliband, who narrowly lost out to his brother Ed in the 2010 Labour leadership contest and who now heads the International Rescue Committee relief agency in New York, described the outcome of the 2016 referendum as an \"unparalleled act of economic self-harm\".\n\nWriting in The Observer, he said the country should have the chance to vote on any Brexit deal in a second referendum with a straight choice between remaining in the EU and the negotiated alternative.\n\n\"In Britain, the implementation of the EU referendum decision has been rash and chaotic. The timing and content has been governed by factions in the Tory party. Our negotiating position is a mystery - even on immigration,\" he wrote.\n\n\"So the fightback against the worst consequences of the referendum has the opportunity and responsibility to get its bearings fast.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-03-", "textEnd": 572, "textStart": 562}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T12:45:00Z", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "title": "Belfast Telegraph", "id": "226"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "12:45:00", "url": "http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/britain-will-not-stay-in-eu-by-back-door-say-hammond-and-fox-36026721.html", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8915802", "image": "http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/article36026720.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/PANews%20BT_P-369bd278-44ef-442f-af79-1667f9a4fb04_I1.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "12:45:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

unprepared for Brexit, announcing it will publish a set of detailed proposals on customs arrangements, the status of the Ireland-Northern Ireland border and other issues.\n\nThe Department for Exiting the European Union said Sunday that it would release the first set of position papers this week, more than a year after Britons voted in a referendum to leave the European Union.\n\nThe government says it hopes to persuade the 27 other EU nations to start negotiating a \"deep and special\" future relationship that would include a free trade deal between Britain and the EU.\n\nThe EU says those negotiations can't start until sufficient progress has been made on three initial issues: how much money the U.K. will have to pay to leave the bloc; whether security checks and customs duties will be instituted on the Irish border; and the status of EU nationals living in Britain.\n\nThe exit bill, estimated at tens of billions of euros, is to cover pension liabilities for EU staff and programs Britain committed to funding over the next few years.\n\nThe government's Brexit department said Britain wants to show that progress on the preliminary issues has been made and \"we are ready to broaden out the negotiations\" by the time of an EU summit in October.\n\n\"Businesses and citizens in the U.K. and EU want to see the talks progress and move towards discussing a deal that works for both sides,\" the department said in a statement.\n\nEU officials have expressed impatience with the pace of Britain's preparations.\n\nThe bloc's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said last month there was \"a clock ticking\" on the talks. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said last week that Brexit advocates \"already had 14 months\" to issue detailed proposals, but had not.\n\nBarnier is due to meet Britain's Brexit minister, David Davis, for a new round of negotiations at the end of August.\n\nBritain voted to leave the EU in June 2016, but did not trigger the formal two-year exit process until March.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May then called a snap election in an attempt to increase her Conservative Party's majority in Parliament and strengthen her negotiating hand. But voters did not rally to her call, leaving May atop a weakened minority government.\n\nIn recent weeks, with May on her summer vacation, members of her Cabinet have openly disagreed about what direction Brexit should take.\n\nGet news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

leave the European Union.\n\nThe government says it hopes to persuade the 27 other EU nations to start negotiating a \"deep and special\" future relationship that would include a free trade deal between Britain and the EU.\n\nThe EU says those negotiations can't start until sufficient progress has been made on three initial issues: how much money the U.K. will have to pay to leave the bloc; whether security checks and customs duties will be instituted on the Irish border; and the status of EU nationals living in Britain.\n\nThe exit bill, estimated at tens of billions of euros, is to cover pension liabilities for EU staff and programs Britain committed to funding over the next few years.\n\nThe government's Brexit department said Britain wants to show that progress on the preliminary issues has been made and \"we are ready to broaden out the negotiations\" by the time of an EU summit in October.\n\n\"Businesses and citizens in the U.K. and EU want to see the talks

will leave the European Union by the \"back door\" leaving the single market and customs union in March 2019, Philip Hammond and Liam Fox have jointly declared.\n\nIn an attempt to provide a unified front after a summer of open conflict, the Chancellor and International Trade Secretary have said there will be a transitional \"time-limited\" period designed to avoid a so-called \"cliff-edge\".\n\nHowever, their joint article for the Sunday Telegraph does not declare how long this period will last.\n\nMr Hammond and Mr Fox write: \"We will leave the customs union and be free to negotiate the best trade deals around the world as an independent, open, trading nation.\n\n\"We will leave the single market, because there was a vote for change on June 23 and that is what we will deliver.\n\n\"We want our economy to remain strong and vibrant through this period of change.\n\n\"That means businesses need to have confidence that there will not be a cliff-edge when we leave the EU in just over 20 months' time.\n\n\"That is why we believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty - but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.\n\n\"We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the single market and outside the customs union and will be a 'third-country' not party to EU treaties.\n\n\"But we are also clear that during this period our borders must continue to operate smoothly; goods bought on the internet must still cross borders; businesses must still be able to supply their customers across the EU and our innovative, world-leading companies must be able to hire the talent they need, including from within the EU.\"\n\nThe joint statement from those who represent Remain and Leave within the Cabinet comes as Theresa May returns from her walking holiday in Switzerland this week.\n\nMeanwhile, ministers are to publish a new series of detailed papers setting out their aims for the Brexit talks amid criticism about a lack of clarity over the Government's negotiating position.\n\nThese include papers on the issue of the Irish border as well as a paper on the \"future partnership\" arrangements, including the UK's proposals for a new customs agreement with the EU.\n\nThe new detailed proposals come as Mr Davis prepares to embark on a third round of talks with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier in the Belgian capital at the end of the month.\n\nMr Barnier has expressed his disappointment that the first two rounds of talks have failed to produce sufficient clarity on the opening issues of the Irish border, the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and Britain's \"divorce bill\".\n\nSources at the Department for Exiting the EU said the \"future partnership\" papers would show that the Government is ready to move on to the next stage of the negotiations.\n\nMr Davis said: \"Over the last year, the Government has been working with British businesses and the British people to establish exactly how our new relationship with the EU should look and feel.\n\n\"I've launched this process because with time of the essence, we need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong UK and a strong EU.\n\n\"It's what businesses across Europe have called on both sides to do and will demonstrate that the UK is ready for the job.\n\n\"As well the issue of the Irish border, the first set of new position papers will also cover continued availability of goods for the EU and the UK, and confidentiality and access to official documents following the UK's withdrawal.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true,

will leave the European Union by the \"back door\" leaving the single market and customs union in March 2019, Philip Hammond and Liam Fox have jointly declared.\n\nIn an attempt to provide a unified front after a summer of open conflict, the Chancellor and International Trade Secretary have said there will be a transitional \"time-limited\" period designed to avoid a so-called \"cliff-edge\".\n\nHowever, their joint article for the Sunday Telegraph does not declare how long this period will last.\n\nMr Hammond and Mr Fox write: \"We will leave the customs union and be free to negotiate the best trade deals around the world as an independent, open, trading nation.\n\n\"We will leave the single market, because there was a vote for change on June 23 and that is what we will deliver.\n\n\"We want our economy to remain strong and vibrant through this period of change.\n\n\"That means businesses need to have confidence that there will not be a cliff-edge when we leave the EU in just over 20 months' time.\n\n\"That is why we believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty - but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.\n\n\"We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the single market and outside the customs union and will be a 'third-country' not party to EU treaties.\n\n\"But we are also clear that during this period our borders must continue to operate smoothly; goods bought on the internet must still cross borders; businesses must still be able to supply their customers across the EU and our innovative, world-leading companies must be able to hire the talent they need, including from within the EU.\"\n\nThe joint statement from those who represent Remain and Leave within the Cabinet comes as Theresa May returns from her walking holiday in Switzerland this week.\n\nMeanwhile, ministers are to publish a new series of detailed papers setting out their aims for the Brexit talks amid criticism about a lack of clarity over the Government's negotiating position.\n\nThese include papers on the issue of the Irish border as well as a paper on the \"future partnership\" arrangements, including the UK's proposals for a new customs agreement with the EU.\n\nThe new detailed proposals come as Mr Davis prepares to embark on a third round of talks with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier in the Belgian capital at the end of the month.\n\nMr Barnier has expressed his disappointment that the first two rounds of talks have failed to produce sufficient clarity on the opening issues of the Irish border, the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and Britain's \"divorce bill\".\n\nSources at the Department for Exiting the EU said the \"future partnership\" papers would show that the Government is ready to move on to the next stage of the negotiations.\n\nMr Davis said: \"Over the last year, the Government has been working with British businesses and the British people to establish exactly how our new relationship with the EU should look and feel.\n\n\"I've launched this process because with time of the essence, we need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong UK and a strong EU.\n\n\"It's what businesses across Europe have called on both sides to do and will demonstrate that the UK is ready for the job.\n\n\"As well the issue of the Irish border, the first set of new position papers will also cover continued availability of goods for the EU and the UK, and confidentiality and access to official documents following the UK's withdrawal.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true,

'back door' option to remain, two opposing Cabinet members have pledged.\n\nAfter a summer of cabinet feuding, Chancellor Philip Hammond, who favours a 'softer' pro-business Brexit, and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, a hardline Brexiteer, appear to have put the differences aside and agree there should not be a 'cliff-edge' break when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019.\n\nBut in a joint article for The Sunday Telegraph, they agreed that any transition would be 'time limited' and that Brexit would mean the UK pulling out of both the EU single market and the customs union.\n\nNo back

And has that moment arrived yet?' she wrote.\n\n'The answer to the first question is 'it is not impossible'; the answer to the second is 'no'. But I would be betraying my principles if I did not make it clear that country must always come before party.'\n\nHer comments came as Labour former foreign secretary David Miliband issued a call for politicians on all sides to fight back against the 'worst consequences' of last year's vote for Britain to leave the EU.\n\nMr Miliband, who narrowly lost out to his brother Ed in the 2010 Labour leadership contest and who now heads the International Rescue Committee relief agency in New York, described the outcome of the 2016 referendum as an 'unparalleled act of economic self-harm'.\n\nWarning: Conservative Remainer Anna Soubry has warned the Prime Minister she needs to face down the 'hard Brexiteers' in the Conservative ranks if she wants to hold on to power\n\nWriting in The Observer, he said the country should have the chance to vote on any Brexit deal in a second referendum with a straight choice between remaining in the EU and the negotiated alternative.\n\n'In Britain, the implementation of the EU referendum decision has been rash and chaotic.

papers setting out their aims for the Brexit talks amid criticism about a lack of clarity over the British Government's negotiating position.\n\nThe papers, to be published from this week, will include one covering the thorny issue of the border between Ireland and the North after the UK has left the EU.\n\nA second batch of papers, to be released in the run-up to the October meeting of the European Council in Brussels, will look at \"future partnership\" arrangements, including the UK's proposals for a new customs agreement with the EU.\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis said the publication of the papers would mark \"an important next step\" towards delivering last year's referendum vote to leave the EU.\n\nThe disclosure comes as Mr Davis prepares to embark on a third round of talks with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier in the Belgian capital at the end of August.\n\nMr Barnier is reported to have warned EU ambassadors the first two rounds had failed to produce sufficient clarity on the opening issues of the Irish border, the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and Britain's \"divorce bill\".\n\nHis gloomy assessment cast doubt on whether the talks will have made enough progress to begin discussions in the autumn on a new free trade deal between Britain and the EU.\n\nLeo Varadkar meanwhile has expressed his frustration at the failure so far of the UK Government to come up with firm proposals to ensure that there is no return to the \"hard\" border between the North and the Republic.\n\nOn his first official visit to Northern Ireland earlier this month, the Taoiseach even put forward his own suggestions for a \"soft Brexit\" - including the possibility of creating a new EU-UK customs union.\n\nSources at the Department for Exiting the EU said the \"future partnership\" papers would show that the Government is ready to move on to the next stage of the negotiations.\n\nThey insisted the issues of Britain's withdrawal - which include the divorce bill the UK will have to pay in respect of its outstanding liabilities - remained \"inextricably linked\" with the talks on its future relations with the bloc.\n\nMr Davis said: \"Over the last year, the Government has been working with British businesses and the British people to establish exactly how our new relationship with the EU should look and feel.\n\n\"I've launched this process because with time of the essence, we need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong UK and a strong EU.\n\n\"It's what businesses across Europe have called on both sides to do and will demonstrate that the UK is ready for the job.\n\nAs well the issue of the Irish border, the first set of new position papers will also cover continued availability of goods for the EU and the UK, and confidentiality and access to official documents following the UK's withdrawal.", "extractedDates": null,

papers setting out their aims for the Brexit talks amid criticism about a lack of clarity over the Government's negotiating position.\n\nThe papers, to be published from this week, will include one covering the thorny issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic after the UK has left the EU.\n\nA second batch of papers, to be released in the run-up to the October meeting of the European Council in Brussels, will look at \"future partnership\" arrangements, including the UK's proposals for a new customs agreement with the EU.\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis said the publication of the papers would mark \"an important next step\" towards delivering last year's referendum vote to leave the EU.\n\nThe disclosure comes as Mr Davis prepares to embark on a third round of talks with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier in the Belgian capital at the end of August.\n\nMr Barnier is reported to have warned EU ambassadors the first two rounds had failed to produce sufficient clarity on the opening issues of the Irish border, the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and Britain's \"divorce bill\".\n\nHis gloomy assessment cast doubt on whether the talks will have made enough progress to begin discussions in the autumn on a new free trade deal between Britain and the EU.\n\nIreland's premier Leo Varadkar meanwhile has expressed his frustration at the failure so far of the UK Government to come up with firm proposals to ensure that there is no return to the \"hard\" border between the North and the Republic.\n\nOn his first official visit to Northern Ireland earlier this month, the Taoiseach even put forward his own suggestions for a \"soft Brexit\" - including the possibility of creating a new EU-UK customs union.\n\nSources at the Department for Exiting the EU said the \"future partnership\" papers would show that the Government is ready to move on to the next stage of the negotiations.\n\nThey insisted the issues of Britain's withdrawal - which include the divorce bill the UK will have to pay in respect of its outstanding liabilities - remained \"inextricably linked\" with the talks on its future relations with the bloc.\n\nMr Davis said: \"Over the last year, the Government has been working with British businesses and the British people to establish exactly how our new relationship with the EU should look and feel.\n\n\"I've launched this process because with time of the essence, we need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong UK and a strong EU.\n\n\"It's what businesses across Europe have called on both sides to do and will demonstrate that the UK is ready for the job.\n\nAs well the issue of the Irish border, the first set of new position papers will also cover continued availability of goods for the EU and the UK, and confidentiality and access to official documents following the UK's withdrawal.", "extractedDates": null,

Both men now appear to be committed to a \"transition period\", but also a \"hard Brexit\", outside of the EU institutions.\n\nThe article's publication comes as the prime minister returns from holiday and ministers prepare to publish papers on Britain's Brexit plans covering the Irish border, the customs union, fisheries, and agriculture over the next 10 days.\n\nIn their article, Mr. Hammond and Dr. Fox write: \"We respect the will of the British people - in March 2019 the United Kingdom will leave the European Union.\n\n\"We will leave the customs union and be free to negotiate the best trade deals around the world as an independent, open, trading nation.\"\n\nThey pledged the UK will \"leave the single market, because there was a vote for change on June 23rd and that is what we will deliver\".\n\nBrexiteers have been suspicious of a so-called \"transition period\", fearing it would be used to delay leaving the EU and see Brexit drag on until 2022.\n\nIn what seems as an effort to lessen those fears, the ministers write: \"We believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty - but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.\"\n\n\"We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the single market and outside the customs union and will be a 'third-country' not party to EU treaties, \" they added.\n\n\"But we are also clear that during this period our borders must continue to operate smoothly; goods bought on the internet must still cross borders; businesses must still be able to supply their customers across the EU and our innovative, world-leading companies must be able to hire the talent they need, including from within the EU.\n\n\"Once the interim period is over, we want a permanent, treaty-based arrangement between the UK and the EU which supports the closest possible relationship with the European Union, retaining close ties of security, trade and commerce.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-06-23", "textEnd": 1467, "textStart": 1458}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-03-", "textEnd": 1177, "textStart": 1167}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T10:11:00Z", "sim": 0.729411780834198, "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "title": "Breitbart", "id": "6627"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "14:00:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/london/2017/08/13/fox-and-hammond-promise-clean-brexit-customs-union-single-market/", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8923705", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/Foreigh-Secretary-Phillip-Hammond-Getty.png", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "10:11:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

papers setting out their aims for the Brexit talks amid criticism about a lack of clarity over the Government's negotiating position.\n\nThe papers, to be published from this week, will include one covering the thorny issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic after the UK has left the EU.\n\nA second batch of papers, to be released in the run-up to the October meeting of the European Council in Brussels, will look at \"future partnership\" arrangements, including the UK's proposals for a new customs agreement with the EU.\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis said the publication of the papers would mark \"an important next step\" towards delivering last year's referendum vote to leave the EU.\n\nThe disclosure comes as Mr Davis prepares to embark on a third round of talks with the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier in the Belgian capital at the end of August.\n\nMr Barnier is reported to have warned EU ambassadors the first two rounds had failed to produce sufficient clarity on the opening issues of the Irish border, the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and Britain's \"divorce bill\".\n\nHis gloomy assessment cast doubt on whether the talks will have made enough progress to begin discussions in the autumn on a new free trade deal between Britain and the EU.\n\nIreland's premier Leo Varadkar meanwhile has expressed his frustration at the failure so far of the UK Government to come up with firm proposals to ensure that there is no return to the \"hard\" border between the North and the Republic.\n\nOn his first official visit to Northern Ireland earlier this month, the Taoiseach even put forward his own suggestions for a \"soft Brexit\" - including the possibility of creating a new EU-UK customs union.\n\nSources at the Department for Exiting the EU said the \"future partnership\" papers would show that the Government is ready to move on to the next stage of the negotiations.\n\nThey insisted the issues of Britain's withdrawal - which include the divorce bill the UK will have to pay in respect of its outstanding liabilities - remained \"inextricably linked\" with the talks on its future relations with the bloc.\n\nMr Davis said: \"Over the last year, the Government has been working with British businesses and the British people to establish exactly how our new relationship with the EU should look and feel.\n\n\"I've launched this process because with time of the essence, we need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong UK and a strong EU.\n\n\"It's what businesses across Europe have called on both sides to do and will demonstrate that the UK is ready for the job.\n\nAs well the issue of the Irish border, the first set of new position papers will also cover continued availability of goods for the EU and the UK, and confidentiality and access to official documents following the UK's withdrawal.\n\nCopyright (c) Press

cabinet feuding, Mr Hammond, who favours a \"softer\" pro-business Brexit, and Dr Fox, a hardline Brexiteer, said that they agreed there should not be a \"cliff-edge\" break when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019.\n\nIn a joint article for The Sunday Telegraph, they agreed that any transition would be \"time limited\" and that Brexit would mean the UK pulling out of both the EU single market and the customs union.\n\n\"We want our economy to remain strong and vibrant through this period of change. That means businesses need to have confidence that there will not be a cliff-edge when we leave the EU in just over 20 months' time,\" they wrote.\n\n\"That is why we believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty -- but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.\n\n\"We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the customs union and will be a 'third country', not a party to EU treaties.\"\n\nUK Prime Minister Theresa May will hope the intervention of the two ministers will cool temperatures in the Tory ranks amid divisions over Brexit and speculation of a possible leadership challenge when MPs return to Westminster in September.\n\nFrom this week, the UK Government is to start publishing a new series of detailed papers setting out its negotiating position on a range of key issues, amid criticism from Brussels of a lack of clarity about what it wants from the talks.\n\nThey will start with one covering the thorny issues of the Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic to be followed in the autumn by a second series looking at the future relationship with the EU, including post-Brexit customs arrangements.\n\nMinisters hope it will be enough to persuade the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier that sufficient progress has been made on the opening issues of the Irish border, the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and Britain's \"divorce bill\" to move on to the second phase of talks including a new trade deal.\n\nMeanwhile the leading Conservative Remainer Anna Soubry warned the prime minister that she needed to face down the \"hard Brexiteers\" in the Conservative ranks if she wanted to hold on to her position in No 10.\n\nIn an article for The Mail on Sunday, the former business minister indicated she could be prepared to join with politicians from other parties to stop the country \"staggering recklessly\" towards a hard break with Brussels.\n\n\"Could I ever see myself joining with like-minded people who want to save our country from such an appalling fate? And has that moment arrived yet?\" she wrote.\n\n\"The answer to the first question is 'it is not impossible'; the answer to the second is 'no'. But I would be betraying my principles if I did not make it clear that country must always come before party.\"\n\nHer comments came as Labour former foreign secretary David Miliband issued a call for politicians on all sides to fight back against the \"worst consequences\" of last year's vote for Britain to leave the EU.\n\nMr Miliband, who narrowly lost out to his brother Ed in the 2010 Labour leadership contest and who now heads the International Rescue Committee relief agency in New York, described the outcome of the 2016 referendum as an \"unparalleled act of economic self-harm\".\n\nWriting in The Observer, he said the country should have the chance to vote on any Brexit deal in a second referendum with a straight choice between remaining in the EU and the negotiated alternative.\n\n\"In Britain, the implementation of the EU referendum decision has been rash and chaotic. The timing and content has been governed by factions in the Tory party. Our negotiating position is a mystery -- even on immigration,\" he wrote.\n\n\"So the fightback against the worst consequences of the referendum has the opportunity and responsibility to get its bearings fast.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-03-", "textEnd": 228, "textStart": 218}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T10:22:00Z", "sim": 0.729411780834198, "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "title": "The Irish Times", "id": "1154"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "11:48:00", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/uk-ministers-say-brexit-transition-will-not-be-back-door-to-staying-in-eu-1.3185126", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8910018", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3185125.1502619640!/image/image.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "10:22:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

This will be the subject of further discussion in due course.\"\n\nThe European Commission, the Brussels-based executive arm of the EU where a special team is negotiating with London on behalf of the other 27 states, said divorce negotiations should start with addressing the uncertainty caused by Brexit.\n\n\"That includes the financial settlement and the uncertainty that surrounds the rights of EU citizens in the UK and of UK citizens in the EU,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\n\"This should be agreed on the principles of continuity, reciprocity and non-discrimination,\" she said, adding that the triggering of the exit clause by Britain \"does not change the right to free movement\".\n\nShe added: \"Nor should it affect the rights of citizens who have made life choices on the basis of EU law and EU membership.\"\n\nAfter the first full round of talks last month, chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier said there was \"a fundamental divergence\" between the two sides on how to protect the rights of expatriates after Brexit.\n\nBritain set out proposals in June to allow current immigrants from the EU to retain healthcare, work rights and other benefits that are more generous than those given to migrants from elsewhere.\n\nIt said those who had lived in Britain for five years by an as yet unspecified cut-off point could acquire \"settled status\" similar to permanent residency. Those more recently arrived would be allowed to stay until they achieved this status.\n\nThe next round of Brexit talks is due to take place in the last week of August.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: Brexit EU", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-09", "textEnd": 47, "textStart": 33}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-09T16:58:00Z", "sim": 0.7215686440467834, "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "title": "The Indian Express", "id": "1155"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "16:58:00", "url": "http://indianexpress.com/article/world/uk-says-eu-offers-restricted-post-brexit-residency-rights-to-britons-4789688/", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8235175", "image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/06/uk-and-brexit-759.jpg?w=759", "date": "2017-08-09", "time": "16:58:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-09"}

A series of papers are being published, including one this week covering what will happen to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic after the UK has left the EU.\n\nMeanwhile, former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband has called for politicians on all sides to unite to fight back against the \"worst consequences\" of Brexit. He described the outcome of last year's referendum as an \"unparalleled act of economic self-harm\".\n\nWriting in the 'Observer', he said: \"People say we must respect the referendum. We should.

\"by the back door\" and will leave both the single market and the customs union when Brexit happens in 2019.\n\nChancellor Philip Hammond, a strong Remain campaigner, and Trade Secretary Liam Fox, a leading Brexiteer, put on a display of unity with a joint pledge that echoes Theresa May's oft-repeated remark that \"Brexit means Brexit\".\n\nWriting in the Brexit-backing Telegraph, the ministers said there would be a \"transition period\" if the UK leaves the 28-country block as expected in March, 2019, to avoid an economic \"cliff edge\" which many businesses and economists fear.\n\nBut they added the transition period would be just that, and would not be used as an attempt to prolong membership or to delay the inevitable.\n\nThe jointly penned article appeared designed to reassure those in favour of a clean break, but will do little to comfort those fearing the consequences of a so-called \"hard Brexit\".\n\n\"We will leave the customs union and be free to negotiate the best trade deals around the world as an independent, open, trading nation,\" the article said.\n\n\"We will leave the single market, because there was a vote for change on 23 June and that is what we will deliver.\"\n\nIt added that businesses should be assured there would be no \"cliff edge\" despite fears expressed that the UK could crash out of the EU without reaching a deal, which would see UK-EU relations revert to World Trade Organisation rules.\n\n\"That is why we believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty - but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU,\" Mr Hammond and Mr Fox wrote.\n\nMr Hammond had previously ruffled feathers in Brexiteer camp by suggesting he hoped the UK would be able to continue free trade with the EU for as many as four years after leaving.\n\nThe old divisions in the Tory party over Europe appeared to resurface when Mr Fox said that any such transition period would end before the next general election in 2022.\n\nWith Ms May due to return from her summer holiday, the article appeared designed to end party feuding as well as ongoing speculation that the UK might somehow be able to salvage membership of the single market through negotiations with the EU.\n\nOver the coming 10 days, a number of Government papers will be published spelling out the UK's Brexit blueprint on key issues including the customs union, the Irish border, fisheries and agriculture.\n\nFree movement for Irish citizens in and out of Britain is expected to continue after Brexit, with the establishment of a Schengen-style area between Ireland and Britain designed to resolve the border problem.\n\nThe Government has recently moved to clarify that freedom of movement between the EU and the UK will definitely end in 2019, with the three million EU citizens already in Britain having to apply for inclusion on a \"settled status\" register if they wish to remain.\n\nIn June, the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier called for \"more ambition, clarity and guarantees\" around the protection of EU citizens living in the UK.", "extractedDates": [{"amb":

Only then will it move on to talks over the future trading relationship.\n\nIn a letter updating a committee of lawmakers from Britain's upper house of parliament on the negotiations, Davis said the EU was only offering restricted residency rights to Britons.\n\n\"Their offer only guarantees residence rights in the member state in which a British national was resident at the point of our exit from the EU. It does not guarantee the holder ... any right to onward movement within the EU, for example to work or study in a neighbouring member state,\" he said.\n\n\"We have questioned whether this is consistent with the principle of reciprocity, and also with the Commission's desire to protect rights currently enjoyed under EU law. This will be the subject of further discussion in due course.\"\n\nThe European Commission, the Brussels-based executive arm of the EU where a special team is negotiating with London on behalf of the other 27 states, said divorce negotiations should start with addressing the uncertainty caused by Brexit.\n\n\"That includes the financial settlement and the uncertainty that surrounds the rights of EU citizens in the UK and of UK citizens in the EU,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\n\"This should be agreed on the principles of continuity, reciprocity and non-discrimination,\" she said, adding that the triggering of the exit clause by Britain \"does not change the right to free movement\".\n\nShe added: \"Nor should it affect the rights of citizens who have made life choices on the basis of EU law and EU membership.\"\n\nAfter the first full round of talks last month, chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier said there was \"a fundamental divergence\" between the two sides on how to protect the rights of expatriates after Brexit.

Reuters\n\n\"We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the single market and outside the customs union and will be a 'third-country' not a party to EU treaties,\" they wrote.\n\nTheir comments are being seen as an attempt to show unity between rival sides in Prime Minister Theresa May's Cabinet.\n\nThey said the UK's borders \"must continue to operate smoothly\", that goods bought on the internet \"must still cross borders\", and \"businesses must still be able to supply their customers across the EU\" in the weeks and months after Brexit.\n\nThe two leading politicians said the government wanted to ensure \"there will not be a cliff-edge when we leave the EU\".\n\nIn their article, Hammond and Fox said: \"We respect the will of the British people, in March 2019 the United Kingdom will leave the European Union.\n\n\"We will leave the customs union and be free to negotiate the best trade deals around the world as an independent, open, trading nation.\n\n\"We will leave the single market, because there was a vote for change on 23rd June and that is what we will deliver. We want our economy to remain strong and vibrant through this period of change. That means businesses need to have confidence that there will not be a cliff-edge when we leave the EU in just over 20 months' time.\n\n\"That is why we believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty, but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.\"\n\nIt comes as ministers start to set out their detailed aims for Brexit. A series of papers are being published, including one this week covering what will happen to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic after the UK has left the EU.\n\nMeanwhile, former labour foreign secretary David Miliband has called for politicians on all sides to unite to fight back against the \"worst consequences\" of Brexit. He described the outcome of last year's referendum as an \"unparalleled act of economic self-harm\".\n\nWriting in the Observer, he said: \"People say we must respect the referendum. We should. But democracy did not end on 23 June last year.\n\n\"The referendum will be no excuse if the country is driven off a cliff.\"\n\nNegotiations between Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU officials are set to resume at the end of this month.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 13, 2017 06:38 pm | Updated Date: Aug 13, 2017 06:38 pm\n\nTags :#Brexit#David davis#David miliband#European union#Newstracker#Northern ireland#Philip hammond#Theresa may", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textEnd": 1595, "amb": false, "date": "2017-06-23", "textStart": 1586, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-13", "textEnd": 2929, "textStart": 2917, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-03-", "textEnd": 1323, "textStart": 1313}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T13:28:00Z", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "title": "Firstpost", "id": "2530"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "13:28:00", "url": "http://www.firstpost.com/world/brexit-bill-uk-ministers-put-up-united-front-over-eu-talks-stress-no-deal-will-be-indefinite-3926739.html", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8920285", "image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Brexit-Britain-EU_AP3.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "13:28:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

the country voted to leave in a referendum in June 2016.\n\nAs it stands, the UK will depart the EU on 30 March 2019 but the terms of its withdrawal and the nature of its future relationship with the EU are yet to be decided. So what is being discussed and by whom?\n\nWhat's being discussed and when?\n\nIn the first phase of negotiations, British and EU officials are meeting each month for four days in Brussels, the home of the European Commission.\n\nSo far, there have been two rounds of talks. The first one, in June, was largely a get-to-know you session in which both sides sized each other up, engaged in a few official pleasantries and discussed scheduling issues.\n\nJuly's session was much more serious and detailed, with full discussions taking place in four key areas: the rights of EU citizens in the UK and Britons on the continent, the future of the 300 mile land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, general separation issues, and the question of money.\n\nMatters are at an early stage and there has been no agreement in any of these areas yet. The two sides will next meet in the last week of August.\n\nWho is doing the talking?\n\nThe UK team is led by David Davis, the veteran Conservative MP who is Secretary of State for Exiting The European Union. His EU counterpart is Michel Barnier, a former French foreign minister and EU commissioner who was chosen by the other 27 EU member states to represent them.\n\nBoth sides are deploying a Olympic-size squad of officials to work on the negotiations. Much of the spadework is being done by co-ordinators or \"sherpas\", senior officials whose job it is to pore over the nitty-gritty details and try and pave the way for a political agreement.\n\nThe lead British sherpa is Oliver Robbins, the top civil servant in the Brexit department.\n\nOther key figures on the British side include Sir Tim Barrow, the UK's permanent representative in Brussels and Simon Case, David Cameron's former private secretary who is now director general of the UK-EU partnership, which is looking at post-Brexit co-operation.\n\nMuch progress so far?\n\nThis is difficult to gauge and depends, to an extent, on which side you listen to.\n\nThe UK and EU have set out their , highlighting areas of convergence in green, disagreement in red and areas that need further discussion and \"deeper understanding\" in amber.\n\nThe UK is stressing what it regards as areas of consensus while pushing back on any suggestions that its offer is less generous than the EU's in terms of granting permanent residence, or settled status, to its three or so million EU residents, and accompanying rights, including of family reunion.\n\nThe EU has expressed mild disappointment at the UK's approach so far and there is genuine disagreement over how new guarantees will be legally enforced.\n\nDavid Davis said the EU was only offering restricted residency rights to Britons living in the EU. The UK is questioning that.\n\nTheir offer \"only guarantees residence rights in the member state in which a British national was resident at the point of our exit from the EU,\" he said in a of the parliamentary committee on Brexit.\n\n\"It does not guarantee the holder of those residence rights any right to onward movement within the EU, for example to work or study in a neighbouring member state,\" he said.\n\nNor will the EU maintain existing voting rights for UK nationals living in the EU after Brexit, he said.\n\nOn the issue of finance, reports spoke of \"robust\" discussions about the UK's so-called \"divorce bill\" and the \"need for flexibility\" on both sides can be interpreted as diplomatic-speak for the two parties not seeing eye to eye.\n\nThe UK has spoken of \"sorting out the obligations we have to one another\" but media reports of the government being handed a \"legacy\" bill of up to 100bn euros (\u00a389bn) has prompted a vociferous response from British ministers.\n\nThe reality appears to be that no detailed sums have been discussed yet and it has been widely reported any settlement is unlikely before the end of 2018.\n\nOne other running theme of the discussions so far has been the EU's constant plea for more clarity from British negotiators.\n\nThe UK has hit back, pointing out that it has been publishing position papers ahead of each round of negotiations, most recently on judicial proceedings, nuclear regulation and privileges and immunities.\n\nThe Irish dimension\n\nTalks over the Irish border and related issues are being handled at the highest level, reflecting what the EU has acknowledged are the \"unique circumstances and challenges\" facing the island of Ireland.\n\nFor months, the joint mantra from both Dublin and London has been that after Brexit, the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland should be as \"seamless and frictionless as possible\" and nothing should be done to endanger the peace process and political progress made over the past 25 years.\n\nBut cracks seems to be surfacing amid concerns in Dublin that technological solutions - such as number plate recognition and computerised trader schemes - are not sufficient in themselves to address the risk of smuggling and a wider political agreement is needed.\n\nUnionist parties in Northern Ireland have reacted angrily to suggestions that customs controls could be moved to seaports and airports, rather than anywhere near the land border, which they say would create an unacceptable divide between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.\n\nGiven the fragility of power-sharing in Northern Ireland, and the frisson caused by the Conservatives' parliamentary pact with the Democratic Unionists, there seem to be real obstacles to overcome before this most sensitive of subjects is settled to the satisfaction of all.\n\nWhat about trade?\n\nThe end of October, when EU leaders will hold their first post-summer summit, has been talked up as something of a watershed moment.\n\nIf the 27 agree that sufficient progress has been made on separation, rights and financial issues, it is possible they could agree to begin negotiations on trade and the all-important question of the UK's future relationship with its largest commercial partner.\n\nThe UK had wanted talks on divorce and trade to take place in tandem but the EU said no, also insisting that no agreement on a future trade deal - which would involve a new treaty - can be finalised until the UK has actually left the EU.\n\nMore recently, EU sources have suggested that October is not set in stone and any decision could slip until the end of the year.\n\nAs we move into 2018, there will be attention on areas vital to the British economy such as financial services, aviation and agriculture.\n\nAirlines have said agreement on the UK's future within the European Common Aviation Area and its participation in the Open Skies transatlantic system is needed by the summer of 2018 to allow them to schedule flights six months ahead.\n\nThere have been warnings of chaos and passengers not being able to travel in and out of the UK.\n\nIs the UK government united?\n\nIn a major speech in January, Theresa May committed the UK to leaving the EU's single market and the customs union, saying the UK must be able to control its own borders and negotiate its own trade agreements with other countries.\n\nAt the same time, she said the UK wanted tariff-free trade with the EU after Brexit and a new customs agreement. She also talked of an \"implementation period\" after the UK leaves the EU and an end to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the supremacy of EU law ceases.\n\nThis government line generally held firm during the general election campaign but has come under pressure since the Conservatives lost their Commons majority, with several cabinet ministers breaking ranks to emphasise what they see as their priorities for the negotiation.\n\nChancellor Philip Hammond has made it clear that economic stability and business certainty is paramount and suggested there is cabinet support for a transitional period of up to three years in which the status quo would be maintained in many areas to help business to adjust.\n\nBrexit-supporting colleagues, such as Liam Fox and Michael Gove, have indicated they have no objection to the principle of a phased transition.\n\nBut the devil will be in the detail and many Tory MPs are likely to fiercely resist any concessions which would allow the free movement of people from the EU to continue in its current form - something Downing Street has ruled out - or which would give the ECJ any interim role.\n\nWill a deal be done and by when?\n\nMr Barnier has not been slow to remind British officials that the \"clock is ticking\" on the negotiations.\n\nWhat was, by general agreement, a very tight two-year process to start off with has been further condensed by the UK's snap general election, which meant a two-month delay to the start of talks.\n\nWhile EU summits in March and June 2018 will be important staging posts, the real crunch is expected to come in the autumn of 2018.\n\nA deal will effectively have to be agreed by this point if it is to be approved by Parliament, the European Parliament and by EU states - 72% of whom will have to vote for it under super-qualified majority rules - in time to meet the Article 50 withdrawal deadline.\n\nWith the EU sticking to its mantra that \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\", this period could become what one football manager famously described as \"squeaky bum\" time.\n\nThe UK could leave before March 2019 if a withdrawal agreement is agreed earlier, although this would seem unlikely at this stage.\n\nThere also remains the possibility that the UK could simply leave without any agreement, if either of the two sides reject a deal or can't agree on one and decide against extending the talks.\n\nFor many critics of Brexit, this is the doomsday scenario but many Leave supporters are relaxed about what it would entail. The government says it is preparing for every eventuality but believes it will secure a deal that works for both sides.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "dateEnd": "2018-06-", "date": "2018-03-", "textEnd": 8955, "textStart": 8936}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-03-30", "textEnd": 175, "textStart": 162}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-06-", "textEnd": 116, "textStart": 107}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-03-", "textEnd": 9534, "textStart": 9524}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T16:16:00Z", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "source": {"uri": "headlinesnews.net", "title": "headlinesnews.net", "id": "1397"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "16:16:00", "url": "http://headlinesnews.net/brexit-negotiations-2/", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8658070", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "16:16:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

Only then will it move on to talks over the future trading relationship.\n\nSome 2.9 million EU citizens live permanently in the UK and an estimated 1.2 million UK nationals live in the other 27 member states. Currently, citizenship is not required to live permanently in another EU country but the situation may change after Brexit.\n\nAll citizens of the bloc's current 28 members hold EU citizenship, which comes in addition to national citizenship and does not replace it.\n\nEU citizenship bestows certain rights, including the freedom to move and reside within the EU.\n\nRestricted residency rights\n\nIn a letter updating a committee of lawmakers from Britain's upper house of parliament on the negotiations, Davis said the EU was only offering restricted residency rights to UK citizens.\n\n\"Their offer only guarantees residence rights in the member state in which a British national was resident at the point of our exit from the EU. It does not guarantee the holder ... any right to onward movement within the EU, for example, to work or study in a neighbouring member state,\" he said.\n\n\"We have questioned whether this is consistent with the principle of reciprocity, and also with the Commission's desire to protect rights currently enjoyed under EU law. This will be the subject of further discussion in due course.\"\n\nThe European Commission, the Brussels-based executive arm of the EU where a special team is negotiating with London on behalf of the other 27 states, said divorce negotiations should start with addressing the uncertainty caused by Brexit.\n\n\"That includes the financial settlement and the uncertainty that surrounds the rights of EU citizens in the UK and of UK citizens in the EU,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\n\"This should be agreed on the principles of continuity, reciprocity and non-discrimination,\" she said, adding that the triggering of the exit clause by Britain \"does not change the right to free movement\".\n\nShe added: \"Nor should it affect the rights of citizens who have made life choices on the basis of EU law and EU membership.\"\n\nAt the European People's Party (EPP) congress in March in Malta, a high-ranking EPP official told EURACTIV that the EU was concerned that London \"would play political games\" on the issue considering the bloc's perceived strong interest in the matter.\n\n\"The citizenship issue is easy to solve and we should create certainty for these people. We are ready to do so but the British should do the same and not use it,\" the right-wing official said.\n\nAfter the first full round of talks last month, chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier said there was \"a fundamental divergence\" between the two sides on how to protect the rights of expatriates after Brexit.\n\nBritain set out proposals in June to allow current immigrants from the EU to retain healthcare, work rights and other benefits that are more generous than those given to migrants from elsewhere.\n\nIt said those who had lived in Britain for five years by an as yet unspecified cut-off point could acquire \"settled status\" similar to permanent residency. Those more recently arrived would be allowed to stay until they achieved this status.\n\nThe next round of Brexit talks is due to take place in the last week of August.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-09", "textEnd": 169, "textStart": 161}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-10T05:40:00Z", "sim": 0.6901960968971252, "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "title": "EurActiv.com", "id": "6591"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "05:40:00", "url": "http://www.euractiv.com/section/uk-europe/news/uk-minister-eu-proposed-restricted-rights-for-brits-living-in-eu-after-brexit/", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8325615", "image": "http://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/08/24124456793_ff999fc484_z.jpg", "date": "2017-08-10", "time": "05:40:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-10"}

detailed plans for its post-Brexit relationship with the EU, building on a year of behind-the-scenes work in Whitehall, officials confirmed Sunday.\n\nAs first reported in POLITICO, the U.K. will clarify its position on a range of issues with the publication of formal strategy papers, starting this week, the Department for Exiting the European said in a statement.\n\nAmong the first to be published will be three papers that lay ground for the next round of negotiations in Brussels at the end of August, including one that sets out the U.K.'s plan for the post-Brexit border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThe other two position papers will address issues around the availability of goods for the EU and the U.K. and access to official documents following the U.K.'s withdrawal, the Brexit department said.\n\nThe series of publications will also include papers on the future relationship between the U.K. and the EU -- highlighting the U.K.'s view that so-called \"exit issues\" such as the Brexit bill and the Northern Irish border, which the EU has insisted must be settled first, are inextricably linked to future relationship issues, which the EU has said it will only discuss once \"sufficient progress\" has been reached in talks.\n\n\"I've launched this process because with time of the essence, we need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong U.K. and a strong EU,\" David Davis, the secretary of state for exiting the European Union, said in a statement.\n\n\"It's what businesses across Europe have called on both sides to do and will demonstrate that the U.K. is ready for the job,\" he said, adding that the position papers' publication was \"an important next step\" in \"getting on with the task set to us by the British public.\"\n\nThe first of the future relationship papers will set out detailed proposals for a new customs arrangement with the EU and will form the basis of a new push to inform businesses and other stakeholders, including officials in EU member country capitals, about the U.K.'s plans for the future, as POLITICO reported last week.\n\nThe new push to set out the U.K.'s position and lobby interest groups comes ahead of the October European Council summit, where EU leaders will judge whether Brexit talks have made sufficient progress to proceed to the next phase -- talks on the future relationship. This next phase will include discussion of options for a transition deal and groundwork for a future trade agreement between the U.K. and the EU.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T23:25:00Z", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "source": {"uri": "politico.eu", "title": "POLITICO", "id": "19273"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:25:00", "url": "http://www.politico.eu/article/confirmed-uk-to-publish-key-brexit-papers-this-week/", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8853991", "image": "http://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/GettyImages-823234494.jpg?w=640", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "23:25:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

time-limited and Brexit means leaving single market and customs union\n\nPhilip Hammond, the chancellor, and international trade secretary, Liam Fox, have come together to declare that a post-Brexit transition would not be a \"back door\" to Britain remaining in the EU.\n\nAfter a summer of cabinet feuding Hammond, who favours a \"softer\" pro-business Brexit, and Fox, a hardline Brexiter, said that they agreed there should not be \"cliff-edge\" break when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019.\n\nBut in a joint article for the Sunday Telegraph, they agreed that any transition would be \"time limited\" and that Brexit would mean the UK pulling out of both the EU single market and the customs union.\n\nThe article was published as a former foreign secretary, David Miliband, issued a call in the Observer for politicians on all sides to fight back against the \"worst consequences\" of last year's vote for Britain to leave the EU.\n\nThe Labour ex-cabinet minister described the outcome of the 2016 referendum as an \"unparalleled act of economic self-harm\".\n\nIn the Telegraph, Hammond and Fox said: \"We want our economy to remain strong and vibrant through this period of change. That means businesses need to have confidence that there will not be a cliff-edge when we leave the EU in just over 20 months' time. That is why we believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty - but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.\n\n\"We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the customs union and will be a 'third country', not a party to EU treaties.\"\n\nTheresa May will hope the intervention of the two ministers will cool temperatures in the Tory ranks amid divisions over Brexit and speculation of a possible leadership challenge when MPs return to Westminster in September.\n\nHowever Anna Soubrey, a leading Conservative remainer, warned the prime minister that she needed to face down the \"hard Brexiteers\" in the Conservative ranks if she wanted to hold on to her position in No 10. \"Mrs May is making a great mistake if she allows her policy to be dictated by the Brexit ideologues. They effectively brought down John Major, David Cameron and, arguably, Margaret Thatcher - and will not hesitate to do the same to her,\" she said in an article for the Mail on Sunday.\n\nThe former business minister also indicated that she could be prepared to join politicians from other parties to stop the country \"staggering recklessly\" towards a hard break with Brussels. \"Could I ever see myself joining with like-minded people who want to save our country from such an appalling fate? And has that moment arrived yet?\" she wrote.\n\n\"The answer to the first question is 'it is not impossible'; the answer to the second is 'no'. But I would be betraying my principles if I did not make it clear that country must always come before party.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-03-", "textEnd": 526, "textStart": 516}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T06:00:00Z", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "title": "The Guardian", "id": "260"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:06:00", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/13/hammond-and-fox-brexit-transition-would-not-be-way-to-remain", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8877782", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bb5835a08ff77bd4c181ec903fb2a347edd02d7/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNi8wNy9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=818e170453d587d191e416dd0bc37ce7", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "06:00:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Only then will it move on to talks over the future trading relationship.\n\nIn a letter updating a committee of lawmakers from Britain's upper house of parliament on the negotiations, Davis said the EU was only offering restricted residency rights to Britons.\n\n\"Their offer only guarantees residence rights in the member state in which a British national was resident at the point of our exit from the EU. It does not guarantee the holder ... any right to onward movement within the EU, for example to work or study in a neighbouring member state,\" he said.\n\n\"We have questioned whether this is consistent with the principle of reciprocity, and also with the Commission's desire to protect rights currently enjoyed under EU law. This will be the subject of further discussion in due course.\"\n\nThe EU Commission had no immediate comment on Davis's letter.\n\nAfter the first full round of talks last month, chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier said there was \"a fundamental divergence\" between the two sides on how to protect the rights of expatriates after Brexit.\n\nBritain set out in June proposals to allow current immigrants from the EU to retain healthcare, work rights and other benefits that are more generous than those given to migrants from elsewhere.\n\nIt said those who had lived in Britain for five years by an as yet unspecified cut-off point could acquire \"settled status\", similar to permanent residency. Those more recently arrived would be allowed to stay until they achieved this status.\n\nThe next round of Brexit talks is due to take place in the last week of August.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-09T15:13:00Z", "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "source": {"uri": "dnaindia.com", "title": "Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India", "id": "492"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "15:13:00", "url": "http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-uk-says-eu-offers-restricted-post-brexit-residency-rights-to-britons-2524463", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8215748", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-09", "time": "15:13:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-09"}

Only then will it move on to talks over the future trading relationship.\n\nIn a letter updating a committee of lawmakers from Britain's upper house of parliament on the negotiations, Davis said the EU was only offering restricted residency rights to Britons.\n\n\"Their offer only guarantees residence rights in the member state in which a British national was resident at the point of our exit from the EU. It does not guarantee the holder ... any right to onward movement within the EU, for example to work or study in a neighbouring member state,\" he said.\n\n\"We have questioned whether this is consistent with the principle of reciprocity, and also with the Commission's desire to protect rights currently enjoyed under EU law. This will be the subject of further discussion in due course.\"\n\nThe EU Commission had no immediate comment on Davis's letter.\n\nAfter the first full round of talks last month, chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier said there was \"a fundamental divergence\" between the two sides on how to protect the rights of expatriates after Brexit.\n\nBritain set out in June proposals to allow current immigrants from the EU to retain healthcare, work rights and other benefits that are more generous than those given to migrants from elsewhere.\n\nIt said those who had lived in Britain for five years by an as yet unspecified cut-off point could acquire \"settled status\", similar to permanent residency.

collision course with Dublin this week by insisting on a post-Brexit trading border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\n\nA crucial \"position paper\" is expected to stick to Britain's current plan to use smart technology and spot checks to police the flow of goods between the two countries after 2019.\n\nThe stance will anger the Irish Government, which fears the impact on the peace process in the North and has pushed for the Irish Sea to become the post-Brexit border with the UK instead.\n\nRead more Irish PM says country won't 'design a border for the Brexiteers'\n\nAlternatively, said the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, Ms May should abandon her hard Brexit policy of leaving the EU customs union, which will make a border necessary.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Taoiseach has made plain his growing frustration with Britain's failure to come up with workable proposals in the 14 months since last year's EU referendum.\n\nA failure to reach agreement on the Irish border will also throw into jeopardy the Prime Minister's hopes of an autumn start to talks on post-Brexit trade with the EU.\n\nBrussels has insisted sufficient progress must be made on Northern Ireland, citizens' rights and the so-called \"divorce bill\" before the negotiations can move forward.\n\nNevertheless, the formal position paper is not expected to give ground and will also play for time by arguing the border issue can only be resolved once the shape of a future trading deal is known.\n\nAt least three documents will be published this week, as ministers seek to rebut widespread criticism that Britain's aims for the negotiations are a muddle.\n\nAnother paper will set out how to ensure \"continuity in the availability of goods\", addressing the vexed issue of future customs arrangements.\n\nAnd a third will explore \"confidentiality and access to official documents following the UK's withdrawal\", the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) said.\n\nThe publications will show that \"intense work is underway to prepare for formal talks on the future, deep and special partnership the UK wants to strike with the EU\", a source at the department argued.\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis, said: \"Over the last year, the Government has been working with British businesses and the British people to establish exactly how our new relationship with the EU should look and feel.\n\n\"And over the coming weeks we'll advance that thinking with a swathe of new future partnership papers.\n\n\"I've launched this process because with time of the essence, we need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong UK and a strong EU.\"\u200b\n\nThe Government will hope the position papers will convince the EU Commission that it does have a coherent plan, when the exit talks resume at the end of this month.\n\nAfter the last round of negotiations, Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, was highly critical of Britain's lack of preparedness, as he announced there had been no breakthrough.\n\nThe Cabinet has been accused of \"negotiating with itself\", reflecting stark divisions over whether to pursue a lengthy transition period to avert the economic damage of crashing out of the EU with no agreement.\n\nMore about: Brexit Theresa May Leo

See photos\n\nBritain needs a transition period to soften its exit from the European Union, but it cannot be used to stop Brexit, two senior ministers said on Sunday, signalling a truce between rival factions in Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet. May's Brexit strategy has been the subject of open debate among her top team ever since a botched June election which weakened her authority and exposed differences of opinion over how Britain should manage its departure from the bloc.\n\nHowever, the pro-European finance minister Philip Hammond and ardent Brexiteer trade minister Liam Fox looked to end the debate by setting out a joint position in a newspaper article, as Britain said it was ready to push on with Brexit talks. \"We believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty - but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU,\" Hammond and Fox wrote in a joint article for the Sunday Telegraph newspaper.\n\nHammond had previously angered pro-Brexit colleagues and some voters by raising the prospect of an exit deal that saw little immediate change on issues such as immigration when Britain leaves in March 2019, and which could last until 2022. Such an arrangement was criticised by eurosceptics as a betrayal of the swift Brexit they wanted, and has even raised concerns the process would be stopped altogether after Britons voted in a referendum in June 2016 to leave the bloc.\n\nPARTY CONFERENCE\n\nBut the article said the government strategy was not being watered down and Britain would leave on schedule, albeit with a transition period. \"We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the (EU) single market and outside the customs union and will be a 'third-country' not party to EU treaties,\" they said.\n\nHowever it also confirmed that immigration controls - one of the key issues for voters who backed Brexit - would not stop all EU workers coming to Britain, saying that \"borders must continue to operate smoothly\" during the transition period. \"Once the interim period is over, we want a permanent, treaty-based arrangement between the UK and the EU which supports the closest possible relationship with the European Union, retaining close ties of security, trade and commerce,\" they said.\n\nWhile the article presented a united front for approaching Brexit, there are still signs of division in the Conservative government, which lost its majority in June's election and now relies on support from a small party in Northern Ireland. The election failure has opened May up to pressure from both sides of her party, and the Mail on Sunday reported that she would publicly apologise for the result at a party conference speech in October shore up her position.\n\nPro-EU lawmaker Anna Soubry, who has previously said that June's election result means that the party has no mandate to take Britain out of the single market, said the party could split if May gives staunch eurosceptics too much sway. \"Brexit is a self-inflicted wound; the people of this country hold the knife and they don't have to use it if they don't want to. The people, not the hardline Brexiteers, are in charge,\" she wrote in an article for the Mail on Sunday.\n\nFormer foreign minister David Miliband also said that Brexit would be an act of economic self-harm as he called for a second referendum on Britain's departure from the EU in the Observer newspaper.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-13", "textEnd": 48, "textStart": 33}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-05-18", "textEnd": 273, "textStart": 261}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-03-", "textEnd": 1791, "textStart": 1781}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-06-", "textEnd": 2041, "textStart": 2032}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T10:20:00Z", "sim": 0.658823549747467, "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "title": "The Indian Express", "id": "1155"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "10:20:00", "url": "http://indianexpress.com/article/world/brexit-transition-cannot-be-back-door-to-staying-in-eu-philip-hammond-liam-fox-4794931/", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8901203", "image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/philip-hammond.jpg?w=759", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "10:20:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Only then will it move on to talks over the future trading relationship.\n\nIn a letter updating a committee of lawmakers from Britain's upper house of parliament on the negotiations, Davis said the EU was only offering restricted residency rights to Britons.\n\n\"Their offer only guarantees residence rights in the member state in which a British national was resident at the point of our exit from the EU. It does not guarantee the holder ... any right to onward movement within the EU, for example to work or study in a neighbouring member state,\" he said.\n\n\"We have questioned whether this is consistent with the principle of reciprocity, and also with the Commission's desire to protect rights currently enjoyed under EU law. This will be the subject of further discussion in due course.\"\n\nThe EU Commission had no immediate comment on Davis's letter.\n\nAfter the first full round of talks last month, chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier said there was \"a fundamental divergence\" between the two sides on how to protect the rights of expatriates after Brexit.\n\nBritain set out in June proposals to allow current immigrants from the EU to retain healthcare, work rights and other benefits that are more generous than those given to migrants from elsewhere.\n\nIt said those who had lived in Britain for five years by an as yet unspecified cut-off point could acquire \"settled status\", similar to permanent residency. Those more recently arrived would be allowed to stay until they achieved this status.\n\nThe next round of Brexit talks is due to take place in the last week of August.

That means businesses need to have confidence that there will not be a cliff-edge when we leave the EU in just over twenty months' time,\" the pair write.\n\n\"That is why we believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty -- but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.\n\nHammond and Fox have previously been seen to be sitting on two different sides of the Brexit fence. Hammond, who campaigned to remain in the EU prior to last June's vote, has publicly made clear that he favours a softer Brexit numerous times, and is believed to have frequently clashed with May over her approach to leaving the bloc. Fox on the other hand, is a staunch Brexiteer.\n\nHowever, Sunday's joint article appears to be an attempt to put to bed rumours and reports that May's cabinet is deeply divided on what kind of Brexit Britain should be looking at.\n\nIn recent weeks numerous newspapers have reported cabinet splits, with ministers leaking confidential details of meetings in what appeared to be the first stages of a battle to succeed May as PM.\n\nContinuing, the pair write that any transition \"must ensure a smooth and predictable pathway for businesses and citizens alike. We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the single market and outside the customs union and will be a 'third-country' not party to EU treaties.\"\n\n\"But we are also clear that during this period our borders must continue to operate smoothly; goods bought on the internet must still cross borders; businesses must still be able to supply their customers across the EU and our innovative, world-leading companies must be able to hire the talent they need, including from within the EU.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T07:11:00Z", "sim": 0.6509804129600525, "source": {"uri": "au.finance.yahoo.com", "title": "Yahoo7 Finance", "id": "1422"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "14:00:00", "url": "https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/hammond-fox-try-present-united-213440788.html", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8923711", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cPAgNnMzKGraKhVLfumwiA--/aD0xNTA7dz0yMDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-AU/homerun/y7.businessinsider/e5d33bd0f0a30b0ec1f864a48eb62e19", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "07:11:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

not remain in the single market or customs union.\n\nThe Chancellor and International Trade Secretary wrote a joint article in the Sunday Telegraph underlining that any post-Brexit transition would not be a 'back door' to remain in the EU.\n\nDavid Miliband is back and he wants a second EU referendum\n\nAfter a summer of cabinet funding, the pair agreed there should not be a cliff-edge break when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019.\n\nHowever, they affirmed that any such arrangement would be 'time-limited\" and therefore temporary.\n\n'We want our economy to remain strong and vibrant through this period of change. That means businesses need to have confidence that there will not be a cliff-edge when we leave the EU in just over 20 months' time,' they wrote.\n\n'That is why we believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty - but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.\n\n'We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the customs union and will be a 'third country', not a party to EU treaties.'\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg has been pondering a Tory leadership bid\n\nFrom this week, the Government is to start publishing a new series of detailed papers setting out its negotiating position on a range of key issues, amid criticism from Brussels of a lack of clarity about what it wants.\n\nThe first will focus on the issue of the border between Northern Ireland the Republic of Ireland.\n\nMinisters hope it will be enough to persuade the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier that sufficient progress has been made on the opening issues of the Irish border, the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and Britain's 'divorce bill' to move on to the second phase of talks including a new trade deal.\n\nMORE: Prince Harry sent Ant McPartlin a handwritten note thanking him for speaking out on depression\n\nMORE: Satellite images 'show North Korea is preparing for a submarine missile launch'", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-13", "textEnd": 116, "textStart": 105}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-03-", "textEnd": 860, "textStart": 850}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T11:39:00Z", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "title": "Metro.co.uk", "id": "218"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "11:39:00", "url": "http://metro.co.uk/2017/08/13/philip-hammond-and-liam-fox-pour-cold-water-on-hopes-for-a-soft-brexit-6849029/", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8909248", "image": "https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/pri_49423146.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "11:39:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

the government's negotiating position.\n\nThe first set of position papers, to be published from this week, will include one covering the Border between Northern Ireland and the Republic after the UK has left the EU.\n\nA second batch of papers, to be released in the run-up to the October meeting of the European Council in Brussels, will look at \"future partnership\" arrangements between the UK and the EU, including the UK's proposals for a new customs arrangement with the bloc.\n\nOfficials said the papers would show the British government was ready to \"broaden out\" the negotiations and move forward towards a deal that worked for both sides.\n\nThe disclosure comes as Britain's Brexit secretary David Davis prepares to embark on a third round of talks with the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, in the Belgian capital at the end of August.\n\nMr Barnier is reported to have warned EU ambassadors that the first two rounds had failed to produce sufficient clarity on the opening issues of the Irish Border, the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and the UK's \"divorce bill\".\n\nHis gloomy assessment cast doubt on whether the talks will have made enough progress to begin discussions in the autumn on a new free-trade deal between the UK and the EU.\n\nTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has recently expressed his frustration at the failure so far of the British government to come up with firm proposals to ensure that there is no return to the \"hard\" Border between the North and the Republic.\n\nOn his first official visit to Northern Ireland earlier this month, the Taoiseach even put forward his own suggestions for a \"soft Brexit\" -- including the possibility of creating a new EU-UK customs union.\n\nSources at Britain's department for exiting the EU said the \"future partnership\" papers would show that the British government was ready to move on to the next stage of the negotiations.\n\nThey insisted the issues in the opening stage of the talks -- including the divorce bill the UK will have to pay in respect of its outstanding liabilities -- remained \"inextricably linked\" with negotiations on its future relations with the bloc.\n\n\"The approaches outlined in these papers have been carefully formulated following months of work and consultation,\" one source said.\n\n\"We've been crystal clear that issues around our withdrawal and our future partnership are inextricably linked, and the negotiations so far have reinforced that view.\n\n\"These papers show we are ready to broaden out the negotiations. Businesses and citizens in the UK and EU want to see the talks progress, and move towards discussing a deal that works for both sides.\"\n\nAs well the issue of the Irish Border, the first set of position papers will also cover continued availability of goods for the EU and the UK, and confidentiality and access to official documents following the UK's withdrawal.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T23:00:00Z", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "title": "The Irish Times", "id": "1154"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:26:00", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/british-government-to-outline-aims-in-brexit-talks-1.3185089", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8854073", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3185088.1502565972!/image/image.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "23:00:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

suspicion as British and European Union negotiators ready to identify even apparently trivial oversights as ways to gain the upper hand.\n\nAccording to a British government worker writing anonymously for a London political magazine, the failure of European negotiators to ensure water was available at a recent Brussels meeting was later viewed by the British team as evidence of \"unsporting tactics.\"\n\n'Blood on the floor'\n\nFor weeks now, EU and British officials have been warning that already complex talks on Britain's exit from the European Union are being hampered by deep-rooted mistrust.\n\nBritish lawmakers accuse their erstwhile European partners of wanting to extract revenge for last year's referendum; their European counterparts and officials say the British must agree to a divorce bill of upwards of $50 billion before Brussels will negotiate on a possible trade deal for post-Brexit Britain.\n\nIn an interview this week with a British newspaper, former European Commission president Roman Prodi warned that talks between Britain's Brexit minister, David Davis and Michel Barnier, the EU chief negotiator, had started badly with \"blood on the floor.\"\n\nHe urged both sides to make compromises -- especially over Britain's future trade arrangements with Europe -- saying there was an imprecise grasp of the real economic consequences of Brexit. \"The weight of damage is probably heavier on the UK side, but there is damage on both sides,\" said Prodi.\n\nAnd a former top British diplomat, Simon Fraser, says the formal talks, which began only two months ago, hadn't started well. Speaking on BBC Radio, Fraser, who campaigned in the run-up to last year's Brexit referendum for the country to retain EU membership, said, \"I don't think they have begun particularly promisingly, frankly, on the British side.\"\n\n\"We haven't put forward a lot because, as we know, there are differences within the [British] Cabinet about the sort of Brexit that we are heading for and until those differences are further resolved, I think it's very difficult for us to have a clear position.\"\n\nFraser's comments were rejected by a spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May, who said talks were moving quickly. He said Downing Street believed the Brexit bill Brussels says Britain will owe in outstanding financial obligations, as well as the future status of Britons living in Europe and Europeans living in Britain, would be settled by October, opening the way for talks to begin about a future trade deal.\n\nThat, however, is not the view of Brussels negotiators. And Ireland's prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has warned even if the Brexit bill is settled, he will veto moving on to trade talks if he is unsatisfied with the cross-border arrangements between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nDublin and politicians in Northern Ireland, which voted against Brexit, oppose the return of a hard border between the north and south of the island, Britain's only land frontier with the EU.\n\nEU officials say the British government is not being clear about what it wants in terms of future relations with Europe. \"The United Kingdom still has to come to terms with its negotiating mandate,\" warned the EU commissioner for agriculture, Phil Hogan.\n\nBritain's Cabinet is sharply divided over whether the country should remain a member of the EU's single market and customs union after Brexit. The increasingly powerful chancellor of the exchequer, (finance minister) Phil Hammond, backed by some of the country's top business people, is trying to maneuver the ruling Conservatives away from a so-called 'hard Brexit.'\n\nEconomic danger to Britain\n\nOn Wednesday, the deputy governor of the Bank of England, Sam Woods, issued a warning about the economic danger to Britain of leaving the EU without any trade deal. Even a transitional one, would cause \"significant issues\" for Britain's private banks and could threaten the country's financial stability, he said.\n\nHardline Brexiters in the Cabinet want a sharp break with the EU, arguing single market membership would prevent them from negotiating bilateral trade deals with non-EU states, stop Britain from ending free movement of Europeans into the country and force London to abide by the rulings of EU courts.\n\nBritish voters appear to be increasingly worried about Brexit negotiations. In an opinion poll this week, 60 percent said they disapproved of the government's handling of Brexit, up 17 percent from April.\n\nJitters about the possible economic fallout from Brexit appear to also be impacting Britain's property market, which bounced back quickly from the 2008 financial crash.\n\nOn Thursday, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said the growth of home prices and market activity had stalled in London and the southeast and that there was a lack of momentum, with low levels of buyer inquiries.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-10T22:00:00Z", "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "source": {"uri": "newdelhitimes.com", "title": "New Delhi Times - India's leading opinion based newspaper", "id": "561"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "11:26:00", "url": "https://www.newdelhitimes.com/distrust-suspicion-harbored-by-both-sides-in-brexit-talks/", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8907943", "image": "https://www.newdelhitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/28CAFFB9-F67B-4506-94EE-175CF720C20E_w1023_r1_s-e1502442306864.jpg?w=640", "date": "2017-08-10", "time": "22:00:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

the public should be given a straight vote between EU membership and the alternative thrashed out in negotiations.\n\n\"The case against the EU depends on avoiding a discussion of the alternative,\" he wrote in the Observer.\n\n\"It is the equivalent of voting to repeal Obamacare without knowing the replacement. It is a stitch-up.\n\n\"That is one reason it is essential that parliament or the public are given the chance to have a straight vote between EU membership and the negotiated alternative. That is a democratic demand, not just a prudent one.\n\n\"People say we must respect the referendum. We should. But democracy did not end on 23 June 2016.\n\n\"The referendum will be no excuse if the country is driven off a cliff.\"\n\nMr Miliband, now president and chief executive of the International Rescue Committee in New York, urged politicians of all stripes to fight against the \"worst consequences\" of Brexit, and praised Tory chancellor Philip Hammond, whose demands for a transitional deal have sparked rifts in the Cabinet.\n\n\"I never thought I would say this, but Philip Hammond is also playing an important, even valiant, role,\" he wrote.\n\nMr Miliband's comments came as Mr Hammond and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox came together in a show of unity to declare that a post-Brexit transition would not be a \"back door\" to Britain remaining in the EU.\n\nAfter a summer of cabinet feuding, Mr Hammond, who favours a \"softer\" pro-business Brexit, and Dr Fox, a hardline Brexiteer, said that they agreed there should not be \"cliff-edge\" break when Britain leaves the EU in March 2019.\n\nBut in a joint article for The Sunday Telegraph, they agreed that any transition would be \"time limited\" and that Brexit would mean the UK pulling out of both the EU single market and the customs union.\n\n\"We want our economy to remain strong and vibrant through this period of change.

put herself on a collision course with Dublin this week by insisting on a post-Brexit trading border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.\n\nA crucial \"position paper\" is expected to stick to Britain's current plan to use smart technology and spot checks to police the flow of goods between the two countries after 2019.\n\nThe stance will anger the Irish Government, which fears the impact on the peace process in the North and has pushed for the Irish Sea to become the post-Brexit border with the UK instead.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Taoiseach has made plain his growing frustration with Britain's failure to come up with workable proposals in the 14 months since last year's EU referendum.\n\nA failure to reach agreement on the Irish border will also throw into jeopardy the Prime Minister's hopes of an autumn start to talks on post-Brexit trade with the EU.\n\nBrussels has insisted sufficient progress must be made on Northern Ireland, citizens' rights and the so-called \"divorce bill\" before the negotiations can move forward.\n\nNevertheless, the formal position paper is not expected to give ground and will also play for time by arguing the border issue can only be resolved once the shape of a future trading deal is known.\n\nAt least three documents will be published this week, as ministers seek to rebut widespread criticism that Britain's aims for the negotiations are a muddle.\n\nAnother paper will set out how to ensure \"continuity in the availability of goods\", addressing the vexed issue of future customs arrangements.\n\nAnd a third will explore \"confidentiality and access to official documents following the UK's withdrawal\", the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) said.\n\nThe publications will show that \"intense work is underway to prepare for formal talks on the future, deep and special partnership the UK wants to strike with the EU\", a source at the department argued.\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis, said: \"Over the last year, the Government has been working with British businesses and the British people to establish exactly how our new relationship with the EU should look and feel.\n\n\"And over the coming weeks we'll advance that thinking with a swathe of new future partnership papers.\n\n\"I've launched this process because with time of the essence, we need to get on with negotiating the bigger issues around our future partnership to ensure we get a deal that delivers a strong UK and a strong EU.\"\u200b\n\nThe Government will hope the position papers will convince the EU Commission that it does have a coherent plan, when the exit talks resume at the end of this month.\n\nAfter the last round of negotiations, Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, was highly critical of Britain's lack of preparedness, as he announced there had been no breakthrough.\n\nThe Cabinet has been accused of \"negotiating with itself\", reflecting stark divisions over whether to pursue a lengthy

Reuters\n\nLONDON -- Chancellor Philip Hammond and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox have attempted to quell any accusations of a divide within the government over the UK's approach to Brexit.\n\nWriting in a joint article in the Sunday Telegraph, two of Prime Minister Theresa May's most senior ministers said that the UK will seek a transition deal for leaving the EU, but that any deal will not be a \"back door\" to staying in the bloc and would be limited in its time period.\n\n\"We want our economy to remain strong and vibrant through this period of change. That means businesses need to have confidence that there will not be a cliff-edge when we leave the EU in just over twenty months' time,\" the pair write.\n\n\"That is why we believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty - but it cannot be indefinite; it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.\n\nHammond and Fox have previously been seen to be sitting on two different sides of the Brexit fence. Hammond, who campaigned to remain in the EU prior to last June's vote, has publicly made clear that he favours a softer Brexit numerous times, and is believed to have frequently clashed with May over her approach to leaving the bloc. Fox on the other hand, is a staunch Brexiteer.\n\nHowever, Sunday's joint article appears to be an attempt to put to bed rumours and reports that May's cabinet is deeply divided on what kind of Brexit Britain should be looking at.\n\nIn recent weeks numerous newspapers have reported cabinet splits, with ministers leaking confidential details of meetings in what appeared to be the first stages of a battle to succeed May as PM.\n\nContinuing, the pair write that any transition \"must ensure a smooth and predictable pathway for businesses and citizens alike. We are both clear that during this period the UK will be outside the single market and outside the customs union and will be a 'third-country' not party to EU treaties.\"\n\n\"But we are also clear that during this period our borders must continue to operate smoothly; goods bought on the internet must still cross borders; businesses must still be able to supply their customers across the EU and our innovative, world-leading companies must be able to hire the talent they need, including from within the EU.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T07:58:00Z", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "title": "Business Insider", "id": "711"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "07:58:00", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/hammond-and-fox-try-to-present-united-government-front-over-brexit-2017-8", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8887340", "image": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/599001273ce5e9152958a705-1190-625/hammond-and-fox-try-to-present-united-cabinet-front-over-brexit-by-penning-joint-telegraph-article.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "07:58:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

navigation\n\nU.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond and Trade Secretary Liam Fox made a joint declaration that calling for a transition period after Brexit isn't a way for Britain to stay in the European Union \"through the back door,\" as they confirmed the U.K. will leave the customs union and the single market.\n\nThe statement, by the ministers seen as representing the opposing visions of Brexit in Prime Minister Theresa May's cabinet, confirmed the government will be pushing for a period of transition so businesses can avoid a \"cliff edge.\" But they sought to quash criticism by some Brexit supporters that this amounted to trying to prevent Britain from departing the bloc.\n\n\"We will leave the customs union and be free to negotiate the best trade deals around the world as an independent, open, trading nation,\" Hammond and Fox wrote in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper. \"We believe a time-limited interim period will be important to further our national interest and give business greater certainty -- but it cannot be indefinite, it cannot be a back door to staying in the EU.\"\n\nThe decision to pen a joint article comes amid reports May's cabinet has split three ways on how to navigate Britain's exit form the bloc. While Hammond has since June's election sought to re-focus Brexit on the needs of the economy, calling for as smooth a departure as possible, Fox is seen as taking a more hard-line approach. He has, however, compromised by agreeing to a transition period, albeit as short a one as possible.\n\nSunday's intervention will seek to reassure both voters and the EU that the government is adopting a united front.\n\n\"We are both clear that during this period the U.K. will be outside the single market and outside the customs union and will be a 'third-country' not party to EU treaties,\" Fox and Hammond said.\n\n\"But we are also clear that during this period our borders must continue to operate smoothly; goods bought on the internet must still cross borders; businesses must still be able to supply their customers across the EU, and our innovative, world-leading companies must be able to hire the talent they need, including from within the EU.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T23:30:00Z", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "source": {"uri": "bloomberg.com", "title": "Bloomberg Business", "id": "1749"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:30:00", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-12/hammond-fox-say-transition-won-t-be-back-door-to-staying-in-eu", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8854263", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iyGXs3y9xkBA/v0/1200x800.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "23:30:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

May has had the temporary excuse of being on holiday to explain away the continuing churn over Brexit inside and outside the government. No more. She returns from holiday this week. Little to comfort her awaits. Rather than a produce a rallying cry the promised publication of several major Brexit policy documents by midweek is likely to give both sides of the debate more ammunition to throw at each other.\n\nBy themselves they cannot constitute a coherent strategy. But taken together, will they persuade the EU commission that enough is on offer from the British to allow the negotiations to move on to the crucial issues of trade, without which no border solution and much else can be settled? This is surely the crucial point.\n\nOn the border, the Sunday Telegraph has received the traditional Sunday advance\n\nAfter Brexit EU nationals will be allowed to come on holiday in Ireland and not show passports to get into the UK. But they will not be allowed to work in the UK because they will not have a work permit.\n\nThe source said: \"Irish citizens will fundamentally have better rights than other EU nationals.\"\n\nAn estimated 20,000 people every year from the Irish Republic come to work on the British mainland.\n\nThe Irish border will be policed by \"very advanced\" CCTV cameras at border points such as automated number recognition systems which are commonly used by police in Britain.\n\nThe Government will also develop a trusted trader scheme which will allow goods to be carried north and south from established firms.\n\nIf the debate in Dublin in advance of the British proposals is any guide, the response of the Irish political class to this will be very cool indeed. They will respond with a resounding chorus of \" big deal\" on free movement and \" it won't work\" to technological solutions to the border problem.\n\nBut equally keenly awaited will be the response of the EU Commission. If the Commission receives the British proposals positively, the UK government will have taken its first effective initiative. The proposals on the border and the rest would be taken as work in progress and not the last word. Brussels' and Dublin's responses would be cautiously framed accordingly. If not, where do we go from there?\n\nMeanwhile, the debate on a second referendum has been hotting up. Following on from May's election disaster the political case was made earlier this week by the leading constitutional thinker, Vernon Bogdanor.\n\nThe election re-opens the issue of Europe - for four reasons.\n\nFirst, there is probably no Commons majority for May's version of Brexit. Indeed, there is probably a stronger representation of remain MPs in parliament today than before the election.\n\nSecond, Labour's electoral gains raise the question of whether the decision in the 2016 referendum is final: for, although Labour was not a remain party this year, the British Election Study found that the party's \"soft Brexit\" policy played a large part in its substantial gain in votes. In constituencies where over 55% voted remain, the party achieved a swing of around 7%. The election was the revenge of the remainers.\n\nThird, the election intensifies internal divisions in both major parties. If the eventual deal is too \"hard\", Conservative remainers may join with their opposition counterparts to defeat it; if too \"soft\", Tory Eurosceptics could ensure its rejection. There may be no majority for any of the forms of Brexit on offer, with the Commons deadlocked.\n\nFourth, the House of Lords - in which the pro-remain Liberal Democrats and crossbenchers hold the balance of power, and the proportion of remainers is probably even higher than in the Commons - will feel emboldened to reject a hard Brexit, arguing that a minority government has no mandate for it.\n\nWhen he thought he was going to lose in 2016, Nigel Farage said that a further referendum would be needed: there is no doubt that Brexiteers would have continued their campaign to take Britain out of the EU and they would have had every democratic right to do so. But so equally do those who have doubts about the decision.\n\nBrexit after all raises fundamental, indeed existential, issues for the future of the country. That is why the final deal needs the consent not only of parliament, but of a sovereign people.\n\nLabour's potential king over the water David Miliband entered the lists in the Observer.\n\nLeaving the EU was mis-sold as a quick fix. Now it looks like a decade-long process of unscrambling the eggs of national and European legislation. Ministers cannot even agree among themselves the destination, the route map or the vehicles to get us there.\n\nI never thought I would say this, but the chancellor, Philip Hammond, is also playing a valiant role. The transition he supports is vital. However, a transition postpones a rupture rather than avoiding it. Slow Brexit does not mean soft Brexit. Steve Baker, minister in the department leading the negotiations, has been refreshingly honest in saying the transition period is a \"soft landing for a hard Brexit\". We have been warned\n\nThe case against the EU depends on avoiding a discussion of the alternative. IT is the equivalent of voting to repeal Obamacare without knowing the replacement. It is a stitch-up. That is one reason it is essential that parliament or the public are given the chance to have a straight vote between EU membership and the negotiated alternative. That is a democratic demand, not just a prudent one.\n\nPeople say we must respect the referendum. We should. But democracy did not end on 23 June 2016. The referendum will be no excuse if the country is driven off a cliff. MPs are there to exercise judgment. Delegating to Theresa May and David Davis, never mind Boris Johnson and Liam Fox, the settlement of a workable alternative to EU membership is a delusion, not just an abdication.\n\nBrexit is an unparalleled act of economic self-harm. But it was a big mistake to reduce the referendum to this question. The EU represents a vision of society and politics, not just economics. We need to fight on this ground too.\n\nBut \"valiant\" Philip Hammond is reported to have reached agreement with the arch-Leaver Liam Fox on what a transition would mean.\n\nThe ministers - representing the Remain and Leave wings of the Tory party - say this will be \"time limited\" and designed to avoid a \"cliff edge\" that could damage British business.\n\nAlthough they do not say how long this period will last, it will not represent an attempt to stay in the EU indefinitely, they say.\n\nWhether this alleged compact is more than cosmetic and temporary remains to be seen. Hammond seems to be saying, \"sure, of course we'll quit the single market and the customs union\" while bidding to replace it with third nation or bilateral arrangements which amount to pretty much the practical status quo. Fox's language envisages far greater freedom and opportunity to cut deals with the wider world.\n\nAs Theresa May returns from holiday this week, we can expect she'll try to put her own stamp of authority on the publication of the Brexit papers to quell unrest in the cabinet and party. And her chances of success, according to the Mail on Sunday?", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-06-23", "textEnd": 5559, "textStart": 5547}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T11:04:00Z", "sim": 0.6000000238418579, "source": {"uri": "sluggerotoole.com", "title": "Slugger O'Toole", "id": "12226"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "11:04:00", "url": "https://sluggerotoole.com/2017/08/13/the-uk-proposals-on-the-border-likely-to-underwhelm-as-the-ref-2-debate-hots-up/", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8905637", "image": "https://sluggerotoole.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/slugger-logo-colour-square-55ccc4bbv1_site_icon-256x256.png", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "11:04:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

But should the UK move away from the EU?\n\n\"Brexit has caused a lot of uncertainty, a lot of confusion,\" Emanuel Adam, director of trade and policy at British American Business, says. The transatlantic network, which represents more than 2,000 companies, asked its members if they thought Britain should leave the EU - 95% said no.\n\nFourteen months after the referendum, they are trying to adjust to an uncomfortable political reality.\n\nSome of its American members have been working to anticipate the different types of Brexit and what they would mean. \"That costs a lot of time and effort,\" Adam adds. \"That has, at least in certain cases, delayed investment decisions.\"\n\nBrexit is ambiguous. The UK could, as now weakened Prime Minister Theresa May still aims, leave the Single Market and the Customs Union and restart its trading relationship with the world. Or it could stay in both and remain party to EU deals.\n\nWhether politicians are for or against Brexit, they have come to understand its success or failure by how fast the UK can agree trade deals once it leaves the EU.\n\nThe US is its biggest trading partner outside Europe. Barack Obama warned in 2016 that voting for Brexit would put Britain \"at the back of the queue\" for a trade deal with the US. Trump said the UK would be at the front of any queue. Last month, he said that he and May were working towards a \"powerful\" deal to be completed \"very, very quickly\".\n\nVoices from the UK-US business community have told HuffPost UK Brexit's threat to existing arrangements looms larger than any opportunity for better trading it might present. Adam says, despite potential advantages of a new US/UK deal after a Hard Brexit, BAB's members \"more and more\" would prefer Britain remain in the Single Market and Customs Union.\n\nHe says: \"If we could take out the uncertainty that's being created by Brexit; especially when it comes to the future access to the Single Market and Customs Union, that would be the perfect scenario for US business. But we do acknowledge the political situation is currently different one.\"\n\nNo two countries in the world invest in each other as much as the US and UK - more than a trillion dollars a year. But part of Britain's attractiveness to US industry is that it is a gateway to the EU which is a larger and \"much more important\" market, Adam says.\n\n\"There wouldn't be any interest in the UK moving away from the EU. There's certainly the feeling among the US businesses that trade agreements... couldn't make up for the importance of the EU as a trading partner,\" he says.\n\nAdam says a UK/US trade deal could bring the City of London and Wall Street closer together. Britain and the US are more aligned in their economic thinking and TTIP, the EU-US trade deal Trump pulled out of, did little for financial services, he adds. But Brexit still poses a grave risk to Britain's financial sector.\n\nOne EU rule that makes Britain attractive to Wall Street investment is the \"passporting\" that allows banks registered in an EU country to operate in the whole bloc. Andrew Henderson, a financial services lawyer with international firm Eversheds Sutherland, says losing this could mean US banks leave London.\n\nWhen asked whether Wall Street thought the benefits of the UK being in the EU outweighed any potential gains from Brexit, Henderson said they did, largely because of the value of passporting.\n\nDr Adam Marshall, the American-born director general of the British Chamber of Commerce, says his American members with operations in Britain are \"just as keen\" to learn what Britain's trading relationship with the EU will be as what its one with the US will.\n\nHe said: \"They use the UK as a base for accessing other European markets. So the terms of trade between the UK and the EU is as much a priority for lots of American companies we see here as it is for UK companies.\"\n\nAfter Trump pledged to do a deal with the UK quickly, Marshall wrote in The Observer that Britain's inexperience in such negotiations could only hurt it. Britain hasn't done a trade deal since 1973.\n\nMarshall says trade agreements can take more than a decade to benefit smaller businesses and advocates focussing on \"technical, not very sexy things\" like simplifying customs procedures rather than rushing to a deal.\n\n\"Businesses feel much more keenly what they could lose... than worry about what they could gain hypothetically from a new deal,\" he tells HuffPost UK.\n\n\"We've heard Mr Trump talking about a very big, very exciting deal but there are some very important practical realities that need to be taken into consideration.\"\n\nThe US has a track record for doing trade deals quickly. It struck a deal with Jordan in just 18 months and one with Israel after 29. For context, Canada and the EU began negotiating Ceta in 2009 and signed it in 2016.\n\nOne political analyst, whose Brexit commentary went viral on Twitter, agreed a quick deal would be bad for Britain.\n\n\"Steve Analyst\", who lives in Washington and prefers to be anonymous, wrote a thread of tweets about how Britain was the architect of many EU policies and institutions over the decades, only to walk away from the whole project.\n\n1. Hello, United Kingdom, it's the United States of America here, and we need to talk. -- Steve Analyst (@EmporersNewC)\n\nJuly 10, 2017\n\nHe quotes Simon Evenett, professor of international trade at the University of St. Gallen who said: \"I can't think of a more brutal way for novice UK trade negotiators to learn the ropes than negotiating with the Americans.\"\n\n\"I hate to contradict him, but learning the ropes negotiating with the Americans and the EU at the same time, or one after the other, is going to be more brutal,\" Steve Analyst tells HuffPost UK.\n\n\"If the UK go into this looking for a 'quick' trade deal, then it is very likely they will come out with a bad deal.\"\n\nAs an example of a quick deal, he pointed to the AUSFTA, the deal between Australia and the USA that, according to one study, reduced both countries' trade with the rest of the world by $53 billion over seven years. It was particularly bad deal for Australia's sugar industry.\n\n\"It was reported that not a single grain of Queensland sugar had made it onto American soil,\" Analyst said. \"This is a real possibility if the UK wants a quick completion.\"\n\nEmanuel Adam says the US \"will not be the easiest negotiation partner\" and it tends to apply \"a certain template\" to its deals. He is keen for the UK to do what it can to preserve UK-based companies' ability to move employees around their European offices for temporary work. He adds US business would struggle to adjust if post-Brexit Britain had a system of regulation very different to the EU's.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to see a lopsided deal. If we rush, our inexperience could be a liability,\" Adam Marshall says. \"A free trade agreement is not a trophy... It's not the single most important thing you could do.\"\n\nHe says many US businesses have operations in the M4 corridor, where Heathrow and the EU give them easy access to the continent.\n\nIf a theoretical post-Brexit US deal were pitched to businesses operating in the UK, he says, they would likely respond: \"Yeah, that's great but I'm more worried about the fact my house is burning down in the mean time.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-07-10", "textEnd": 5340, "textStart": 5327}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {"liCnt": 9}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T19:26:00Z", "sim": 0.5764706134796143, "source": {"uri": "huffingtonpost.co.uk", "title": "The Huffington Post", "id": "2080"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "19:26:00", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/brexit-trade-deal-us-uk_uk_598b2bfce4b0d793738c0284", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8687820", "image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/598c6fed15000021008b6020.jpeg?ops=2000_1000", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "19:26:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

'bewildering and reckless' approach of Brussels to the negotiations and their 'obsession' with the divorce bill.\n\nJeremy Browne said the bloc have woefully failed to properly prepare themselves for the negotiations.\n\nHe said the bloc is 'affronted by the idea of London remaining brazenly unaffected' by quitting the union.\n\nAnd he revealed that countries outside the EU have criticised the bloc as 'bureaucratic' and 'protectionist' and see Brexit as an opportunity to foster closer relations with Britain.\n\nThe revelation rubbishes claims from Eurocrats that Britain will suffer by quitting the Brussels club.\n\nAnd he said that Poland has a 'myopic obsession with the size of Britain's exit fee'.\n\nThe City of London's Brexit envoy Jeremy Browne was highly critical of the approach taken by Eurocrats in Brussels to the Brexit negotiations in a series of scathing dispatcher sent back to London (file photo)\n\nHis scathing assessment of the EU's failure to properly assess Brexit was revealed in a series of colourful dispatches sent back to London.\n\nThe memos, which were quietly published online, are a major boost to Britain and emerged just days before the Government is due to publish a series of position papers detailing our negotiating positions.\n\nIn one, Mr Browne, a former Lib Dem home office minister, said many countries see in Brexit an opportunity to 'act together on the global stage'.\n\nIn once memo he tore into the EU for briefing that Britain could face a Brexit divorce bill of \u00a391billion (100bn euros) describing the aggressive approach as 'oddly cack-handed'.\n\nHe wrote: 'Some brinkmanship is inevitable, but it requires good judgement about where the brink is.\n\n'The inability of Brussels to comprehend British politics, or read the British character at the most elementary level, is bewildering; reckless even.'\n\nHe said that Switzerland 'see opportunities' in Britain quitting the bloc as it will mean they have a 'much bigger non-EU kid in the European playground'.\n\nThe envoy added: 'They are excited about \"Global Britain\" as a concept and what it could mean for them.\n\n'They strongly feel that there is the scope for enhanced UK-Swiss relations when these do not have to be routed through Brussels.'\n\nHe said that a number of countries have talked about their hopes to work with 'Global Britain' after our exit.\n\nAnd he said that many moan that the EU is too 'bureaucratic', protectionist, and tries to force through a 'one size fits all' approach.\n\nAnd he criticised the EU for trying to punish Britain for Brexit by issuing a threat to move London's \u00a3747billion-a-day euro-clearing business out of the Square Mile.\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis, pictured with EU negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels last month, has held a series of talks with the bloc. There have been rows over the Brexit divorce bill, EU citizens rights and the Irish border. But the dispatches reveal that despite this bluster countries are keen to have a close relationship with Britain after Brexit\n\nHe said there is no doubt the current system works well, but the EU is 'affronted by the idea of London remaining brazenly unaffected'.\n\nAnd in a boost for post-Brexit Britain, Mr Browne said countries around the world are keen to maintain the closest of ties with the UK.\n\nHe said Switzerland wants to create a so-called 'F4' alliance with London, Hong Kong and Singapore.\n\nWhile Estonia and Latvia's desire for the UK to remain 'a bulwark against Russian aggression' and Poland's 'myopic obsession with the size of Britain's exit fee'.\n\nHe also found that Finland and Sweden's hearts are in the right place, although 'their herbivorous nature prevents them from grabbing the steering wheel'.\n\nItalians, meanwhile, 'retain a sentimental affinity for Britain' and are judged to be more 'conciliatory than the French or Germans'.\n\nMr Browne said he thinks the negotiations will 'ultimately succeed'.\n\nBrexit Secretary David Davis and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier have held a several round of Brexit talks since Artcile 50 was triggered in March.\n\nThey have been hit by a number of early stumbling blocks, with rows over the divorce bill, EU citizens rights and the Irish border, have all triggered rows.\n\nA City of London Corporation spokesperson said: 'These memos are the corporation's key points from meetings across member states with government representatives, financial institutions and a host of trade bodies.\n\n'These reports, published regularly as part of our policy and resources committee, are intended to make sure UK policymakers and businesses are kept informed of our discussions at these meetings.'", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T12:34:00Z", "sim": 0.5686274766921997, "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "title": "Mail Online", "id": "214"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "12:34:00", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/~/article-4781886/index.html", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8613557", "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/11/13/0F2D8A2100000578-0-image-a-6_1502453951006.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "12:34:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

stay in your adopted country, or return to the UK.\n\nMr Davis wrote: \"We have questioned whether this is consistent with the principle of reciprocity, and also with the Commission's desire to protect rights currently enjoyed under EU law.\"\n\nMr Davis added the EU's offer would also scrap the rights of British citizens who live abroad to vote in certain elections.\n\nThe dilemma was first revealed by senior anonymous sources after the talks last month.\n\nAt the time, EU officials told the Guardian they couldn't meet the demand because Britain's offer was not good enough.\n\nThe 3.2million EU citizens who live in Britain are being offered 'settled status', but this will expire if they move back home for just two years.\n\nIn his letter to the House of Lords Brexit Committee, Mr Davis also tried to hit back at criticism of his male-dominated top negotiating team.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now\n\nDespite just two of 13 staff on the top team being women, he insisted his department was 52% female and 48% male overall.\n\nAnd he said 40% of the full negotiating team involved in the July Brussels talks was female.\n\nMr Davis was left red-faced last month after a Lords committee asked how many women were on the team and he replied: \"I can't remember.

But this list was, and is, impossible to achieve because it neither took account of WTO rules nor of the fact that commerce can only be free if the rules governing it remain reasonably uniform.\n\nMrs. May said at the occasion that, on the day the UK leaves the EU, it will retain all of the then-existing EU rules for goods and services, but would be free to change them, whether by order, by Act of Parliament or by legal reinterpretation from then on.\n\nThis implies a gradual, surreptitious, hardening of the border in Ireland, as UK standards begin to diverge from EU standards.\n\nTo the extent that the UK diverges from EU standards, UK businesses will forthwith have to apply two sets of standards: one for the UK market and another for the 45% of UK exports that go to the EU.\n\nEU border controls\n\nMeanwhile, the EU side will have to institute border controls to ensure that nothing enters the EU that does not comply with EU standards.\n\nIrish officials will thus find themselves controlling a border they would prefer was not there at all. This will be politically difficult in domestic politics, but is a known outcome of the UK's decision to leave the EU.\n\nOnce the UK has left the EU, goods coming from the UK into the EU (hence including those going into Ireland) will also be subject to checking under \"Rules of Origin\" requirements, in order to ensure that they do not contain impermissible non-UK content to which a higher tariff ought to have applied.\n\nFor example, there might have to be checks that UK beef burgers do not contain Brazilian beef.\n\nIncreased bureaucracy\n\nThese \"Rules of Origin\" checks will increase, not reduce bureaucracy. This will be especially onerous for small firms.\n\nOne study estimated that the need to apply \"Rules of Origin\" checks could reduce trade volumes by 9%. The EU/Canada trade Agreement has 100 pages on \"Rules of Origin\" alone.\n\nIt will not be done cheaply. A House of Lords Committee already said that \"electronic systems are not available to accurately record cross-border movements of goods.\"", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T22:00:00Z", "sim": 0.5058823823928833, "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "title": "Salon", "id": "2555"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "11:26:00", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2017/08/12/a-visit-to-the-brexit-world_partner/", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8907934", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2017/03/britain_brexit_78248.jpg-1280x960.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "22:00:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

compared with 48 per cent who want to resign early, the poll for BMG Research found.\n\nRead more Tory MP threatens to quit party if May pursues hard Brexit\n\nAnd 58 per cent said they were unhappy with her leadership, with 42 per cent satisfied, giving her a personal rating of minus 16 -

and with key members of the Cabinet \"on manoeuvres\" to shift Brexit policy.\n\nIn her absence, Downing Street has attempted to hold the line that \"nothing has changed\" - that the hardline aims for the EU talks remain as set out in Ms May's Lancaster House speech, in January.\n\nBut Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, has broken ranks to argue publicly for an \"off-the-shelf\" transitional deal for up to three years, which would delay full withdrawal effectively.\n\nBritain would keep current trading arrangements and rules on movement of workers, while leaving the EU single market and customs union on Brexit day in March 2019.\n\nHis key ally is Amber Rudd, the Home Secretary, who abandoned the idea of new immigration rules in 2019. The only immediate change would be the registration of EU citizens moving to Britain.\n\nBut Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, made plain he would accept a transition period only if he is able to seek and sign trade deals with non-EU countries from day one.\n\nA joint article by Mr Hammond and Dr Fox, insisting Britain would not seek to remain in the EU \"by the back door\" in any transition, did little to paper over the cracks.\n\nMeanwhile, in a critical week for the Brexit negotiations, the Government will publish \"position papers\" on the Northern Ireland border and future customs arrangements, among others.\n\nThe documents are crucial to persuading the EU that the UK is serious about meeting its tests on the divorce settlement - allowing negotiations on a post-Brexit trade deal to begin.\n\nThe BMG Research shows that Mr Corbyn is more popular with the public than Ms May. The Labour leader has a two per cent approval rating, with 51 per cent satisfied with his performance, while 49 per cent are unhappy.\n\nHowever, the Conservatives have bounced back in the head-to-head between the parties to enjoy a three-point lead in voting intention, by 42 per cent to 39 per cent.\n\nAnd, in a further boost to Ms May's chances of survival, a staggering 56 per cent of the public refuses to back any of her rivals to succeed her.\n\nAsked who would \"make the best Prime Minister\", 16 per cent named Boris Johnson, while both Mr Hammond and David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, achieve only a miserable five per cent.\n\nBMG Research interviewed 1,512 people online, between 7 and 11 August.\n\nMore about: Theresa May Brexit Jeremy Corbyn Boris Johnson Philip Hammond David Davis Reuse content", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textEnd": 3375, "amb": false, "dateEnd": "2017-08-11", "date": "2017-08-07", "textStart": 3360}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-03-", "textEnd": 1678, "textStart": 1668}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T11:49:00Z", "sim": 0.5058823823928833, "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "title": "The Independent", "id": "3441"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "12:40:00", "url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/prime-minister-popularity-unpopular-rating-tories-conservatives-jeremy-corbyn-brexit-a7890801.html", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8915387", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/25/19/theresa-may.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "11:49:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Karim is a Conservative member of the European Parliament for the north west. Here he explains why he believes the nation is on a path to 'disaster' and argues his colleagues need to change their approach to leaving the EU.\n\nConcerns are growing at every level about what sort of Brexit we are going to end up with. Senior politicians, businessmen and residents alike are all voicing increasing fears.\n\nLast week former Foreign Secretary, William Hague spoke out about the manner in which our government is approaching the task of negotiating our exit.\n\nHague has been consistent in his view that the UK is better off as a member of the EU and his warnings have become increasingly stark until, speaking out in the media, he clearly spelled out why he believes continuing to travel on this current path will be a \"disaster\" for the UK.\n\nThis week he was joined by Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke MP. The former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Home Secretary, Health Secretary and Education Secretary's parliamentary career has spanned nearly half a century. In his inimitable way He has been clear on his views on Europe and still believes the UK should not leave the EU. He has now called for other pro-EU MPs to follow his lead.\n\nI agree totally with their position. We were part of the 48 per cent who wanted a Remain vote in last year's referendum, but although a close result, we accept the democratic outcome. However, the devil is in the detail and in the year since the referendum and the four months since Article 50 was invoked, we have seen nothing from our EU negotiations that can give any hope to those who want to see a truly negotiated deal which will give the UK the best possible outcome in the circumstances.\n\nWhen the likes of William Hague and Ken Clarke speak people listen. They listen because they are unique individuals and having held public office at the highest level, are respected cross political party and internationally.\n\nHague supports the Chancellor's proposal for a three year interim period of transition as our best hope of salvaging something positive from this ridiculous mess we are in, as indeed I do, describing it as \"a plan to rescue Brexit from an approaching disaster\".\n\nYet within days of Philip Hammond's announcement a statement was released contradicting this position, giving the impression that divisions are growing and the right hand doesn't know what the left is doing. This does nothing to strengthen our negotiating hand.\n\nAt the end of June the British Chambers of Commerce conducted a post General Election snap poll of their members on Brexit objectives. The results showed that while there is a range of views on the preferred objectives for UK negotiations, there is almost no support to Brexit without any trade deal and by more than three to one, businesses want a transition period before the final agreement with the EU: 46 per cent want a three year transition period and 22 per cent said a transition period of longer than three years. This is critical to prevent firms facing the prospect of repeated, costly adjustments to new trading conditions.\n\nTalking to people across my North West constituency, across the UK and from ordinary folk to large companies, I am picking up a change in mind set. Many who voted to Leave, having seen where this path is taking us and the resulting economic disaster, are changing their minds. I have lost count of the number of times I hear \"I didn't vote to Leave to be worse off!\" Travelling back to Lancashire from Brussels recently, I met a lady while on the train to Preston.\n\nHer northern based family company employs more than 800. We got chatting about Brexit and she told me she had voted for Leave but had now changed her mind and the company is very worried about the effect of Brexit on both the economy and jobs. We are still a strong economy on the global stage; we are still a powerful nation helped by our seat on the United Nations Security Council.\n\nBut there are ambitious new rivals on that global stage whose workforce are growing in skills and education and whose economies are growing stronger and richer.\n\nContinuing down the path we are currently pursuing will see the hardest possible Brexit with no deal. We are already seeing large businesses planning to move jobs to mainland Europe and the overall negative effects of leaving the EU with no deal will see the UK become the \"sick man of Europe\" again with immediate effect post Brexit.\n\nTossing our toys out of the pram and leaving with no deal is the worst possible option. We need to make this work. Stumbling towards the exit door fumbling to find a solution is not a plan. We have to grasp the rapidly diminishing timescale to ensure that in around just 600 days we are ready to do business. We do need to honour the commitments we made to Europe and it would be wrong to Brexit without paying a penny but this should be a balanced representation of our fair share. EU negotiators on both sides must also work towards free trade.\n\nThere is an opportunity for a compromise for a Brexit deal as talks continue this summer. The European Free Trade Association is an existing model that gives Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway access to free trade. If there is a will for political negotiation this model could well be adapted to our situation, with compromise on both sides.\n\nI know that as an MEP who supported remaining in the EU my voice will get little hearing. But we only have one chance to get this right. We can't mess up, throwing our country into recession for generations and dividing the United Kingdom with potentially Scotland and Northern Ireland leaving the Union.\n\nNow, perhaps more than ever before in the collective more than 80 years that they have been serving this country, people need to listen to Lord Hague and Kenneth Clarke MP and trust their judgement.\n\nTheir parliamentary colleagues, our Government and Cabinet and most importantly the electors of the UK, please just open your ears!", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T11:13:00Z", "sim": 0.5058823823928833, "source": {"uri": "burnleyexpress.net", "title": "Burnley Express", "id": "2269"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "11:13:00", "url": "http://www.burnleyexpress.net/news/opinion/tory-mep-britain-s-ridiculous-brexit-mess-1-8698133", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8599135", "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_300,f_auto,ar_3:2,c_fill/http://www.burnleyexpress.net/webimage/1.8698131.1502449656!/image/image.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "11:13:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

end in June last year. It is essential MPs have a say on the future or the country may be driven off a cliff\n\nFor many years Britons and Americans have been proud of the quality of their governance. Yet today our politics and government are setting new standards for dysfunction. Rather than stability and global leadership there is confusion.\n\nThe US is suffering from a serious inability to legislate. There is a genuine risk of the country defaulting on its debts. Jeb Bush called Donald Trump the \"chaos candidate\", but as the American writer Jonathan Rauch has pointed out the Trump candidacy was the product of political chaos - in campaign finance, for example - not its cause.\n\nMeanwhile, Britain is suffering its own governability crisis. Leaving the EU was mis-sold as a quick fix. Now it looks like a decade-long process of unscrambling the eggs of national and European legislation. Ministers cannot even agree among themselves the destination, the route map or the vehicles to get us there.\n\nThis transatlantic malaise has a common root: politics based on what you are against, not what you are for. Look at the campaigns against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and against the EU. There is a common trope: the politics of grievance.\n\nComplaints about individual policies became attacks against a whole institutional architecture. There were outright lies in both campaigns. And there was a complete (and effective) refusal to describe, never mind debate, what would replace the status quo.\n\nHealthcare makes up nearly a fifth of the US economy - about $1tn larger than the whole UK economy. Support for Obamacare is growing, dramatically, because the alternative has finally been spelled out. It turns out that populism is popular until it has to make decisions.\n\nIn Britain, the implementation of the EU referendum decision has been rash and chaotic. The timing and content has been governed by factions in the Tory party. Our negotiating position is a mystery - even on immigration.\n\nSo the fightback against the worst consequences of the referendum has the opportunity and responsibility to get its bearings fast. Recent calls from Stephen Kinnock, Heidi Alexander and William Hague for Britain to embrace the European Economic Area are sensible. Nick Clegg's point that a reformed Europe centred on the euro implies outer rings which Britain should consider also makes sense.\n\nI never thought I would say this, but the chancellor, Philip Hammond, is also playing a valiant role. The transition he supports is vital. However, a transition postpones a rupture rather than avoiding it. Slow Brexit does not mean soft Brexit. Steve Baker, minister in the department leading the negotiations, has been refreshingly honest in saying the transition period is a \"soft landing for a hard Brexit\". We have been warned.\n\nThe case against the EU depends on avoiding a discussion of the alternative. It is the equivalent of voting to repeal Obamacare without knowing the replacement. It is a stitch-up. That is one reason it is essential that parliament or the public are given the chance to have a straight vote between EU membership and the negotiated alternative. That is a democratic demand, not just a prudent one.\n\nPeople say we must respect the referendum. We should. But democracy did not end on 23 June 2016. The referendum will be no excuse if the country is driven off a cliff. MPs are there to exercise judgment. Delegating to Theresa May and David Davis, never mind Boris Johnson and Liam Fox, the settlement of a workable alternative to EU membership is a delusion, not just an abdication.\n\nBrexit is an unparalleled act of economic self-harm. But it was a big mistake to reduce the referendum to this question. The EU represents a vision of society and politics, not just economics. We need to fight on this ground too.\n\nThe Europe of Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel stands for pluralism, minority rights, the rule of law, international co-operation - and not just a single market. In fact, the real truth about the single market has been lost in translation.\n\nIt is not just a market. It is a vision of the good society. Rights (and holidays) for employees, limits on oligopolies, standards for the environment are there to serve the vision. The single market stands against a market society.\n\nThis is all the more important in a world where autocratic leadership is on the march. This is not just about China or Russia. The democratic world is itself splitting into authoritarian and pluralist camps. We can see Venezuela has taken a repressive turn. Within the EU, there is a battle to hold Hungary and Poland to their commitments, and Brexit weakens that effort.\n\nAnd the US is not immune. John Cassidy of the New Yorker has coined the notion of \"democratic erosion\" - gerrymandered congressional districts, voter suppression and attacks on the media. Half of Republican voters say they would support the decision if President Trump postponed the next election.\n\nThe EU is not just a group of neighbouring countries. It is a coalition of democratic states which pledge to advance human rights, the rule of law and democratic rules. That is not a threat to Britain; it is the team we should be in.\n\nSo Britain's choice about its institutional future is not just about pounds and pence. I favour the closest possible relationship with the EU, not only for economic reasons. The EEA does not just make business sense. Europe represents a vital and historic alliance of democracies, founded on the idea that social, economic and political rights go together and that countries best defend them in unison not isolation.\n\nHistory makes the point. The post-second world war commitments to rights for individuals have their immediate political origins in the Atlantic Charter, agreed between Churchill and Roosevelt in Newfoundland in 1941. It set out the terms of postwar peace - notably human rights, national self-determination and international co-operation. It was called the \"birth certificate of the west\" by the former German foreign minister Joschka Fischer.\n\nThe insight was simple. Globalisation without rules and institutions would not mean more control for ordinary citizens. It would mean less. And less control means more risk to the living standards of those in greatest need. International co-operation was and is a force for social justice and against turbo-capitalism.\n\nPresident Eisenhower said when you had an insoluble problem, enlarge it. The debate about transitional arrangements and institutional design of our relationship with the EU craves a broader framework. There is nothing more fundamental than the economic, social and political rights that looked like the norm at the end of the cold war. Now they are in retreat. Europe is their bastion. And that is the side we should be on.\n\nDavid Miliband is president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, a humanitarian aid, relief and development NGO based in New York.

And she urged Theresa May to avoid it by refusing to let \"Brexit ideologues\" dictate government policy.\n\nSoubry, who has become the most vocal pro-European among Tory MPs, has never before been quite this explicit about how Brexit could lead to her quitting the party. However, in her article in the Mail on Sunday, she was careful to avoid saying what would constitute the \"hard Brexit\" that she says she cannot accept.\n\nThe term \"soft Brexit\" was used to describe Britain staying in the single market or the customs unions, options that the government has now very firmly rejected. The government wants the UK to instead have a free trade deal with the EU, an outcome that many would describe as a \"hard Brexit\", although not the hardest Brexit of all, which would involve leaving with no deal at all.\n\nIn her article, Soubry urged May to side with \"sensible, moderate wise owls in the cabinet\", like Philip Hammond, the chancellor, \"who appreciate that we need a sensible Brexit transition period to avoid plunging this country headlong into an economic nightmare.\"\n\nSoubry went on: \"But if the prime minister or her successor (in the event of Theresa standing down) is not prepared to confront the ideologues, I gravely fear that the party could split - and that would change Britain's political landscape completely.\n\n\"Many remainers like me have been true to our promise to respect the result of last year's referendum.\n\n\"However, we must face up to the Brexit reality: it is fantasy to think we are going to get a good deal from the EU based on our current negotiating strategy. People will soon see how they have been conned by the Brexiteers. All options must go back on the table.\"\n\nIn the past Soubry has said a good Brexit deal would have to involve the UK remaining in the customs union. Her Mail on Sunday article coincided with Hammond and Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, publishing a joint statement ruling this out, even as part of a transitional deal.\n\nIn her article, Soubry said that, if she were to resign, it would be because she was putting country before party.\n\nShe said: \"People have asked me two questions, if the worst happened and we staggered recklessly towards a 'hard Brexit' that would destroy the lives and livelihoods of my constituents: could I ever see myself joining with like-minded people who want to save our country from such an appalling fate? And has that moment arrived yet?\n\n\"The answer to the first question is 'it is not impossible'; the answer to the second is 'no'. But I would be betraying my principles if I did not make it clear that country must always come before party.\"\n\nLast week James Chapman, who served as a special adviser to George Osborne when he was chancellor and then to David Davis, the Brexit secretary, until the general election, claimed that at least two cabinet ministers agreed with him that there is now a vacancy in British politics for a pro-European party.\n\nChapman wants MPs opposed to Brexit to form a new party called the Democrats, but Soubry is about the only MP in parliament, from any party, who has publicly expressed any interest in the idea.\n\nOn Sunday, David Miliband, the Labour former foreign secretary, used an article in the Observer to urge politicians from all parties to work together to oppose a hard Brexit. Miliband also said either parliament or the public should be given the chance in a vote to choose between the final Brexit deal and staying in the EU.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T12:40:00Z", "sim": 0.4549019634723663, "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "title": "The Guardian", "id": "260"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "12:44:00", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/13/hard-brexit-could-split-tory-party-says-anna-soubry", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8915715", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf85ec69a676d72b72e6cfd72f44c4b04a179ce5/246_147_2788_1672/master/2788.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNi8wNy9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=0b64d5c09969a662658cf23e32284d5f", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "12:40:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

One passenger described London's Heathrow airport as \"honestly the angriest place I've ever seen\". The actual outage lasted just 15 minutes, but it grounded the entire British Airways fleet, inconvenienced more than 75,000 customers, and has so far cost \u00a380m in compensation.\n\nFast forward to August and there is more disruption. Tens of thousands of holidaymakers face queues of up to four hours - longer than the flight in many cases - across European airports due to stricter border checks.\n\nAlthough the two events are unrelated, the chaotic scenes witnessed may be a harbinger of things to come at UK airports and beyond if Brexit negotiators do not afford some level of priority to the aviation sector.\n\nPlane sailing\n\nThe liberalisation policies of the EU over the past two decades have facilitated substantial growth in both air passengers and cargo. Today, approximately one billion passengers support 5.5m jobs and contribute \u20ac110 billion to EU GDP.\n\nFor the UK - where one in every two departing passengers are travelling to an EU destination - the aviation sector contributes some \u00a352 billion to GDP, supports almost one million jobs, and pays about \u00a39 billion in tax. Plus, two out of three visitors to the UK arrive by air and 40% of its trade by value is by air.\n\nCurrently, EU regulations govern how airlines registered in the UK can operate services between the UK and other EU member states, between non-UK EU states, internal flights within some EU states, and between the UK and non-EU members. Hence, more than 35 pieces of EU legislation (excluding the labyrinth of labour law) govern the workings of UK-registered airlines. Among other things, this includes how they are licensed, where they can fly, how they can market products, how passengers are compensated, and what safety precautions they must observe.\n\nTurbulence ahead\n\nAt its most dramatic, the consequences of failing to agree an aviation agreement would mean no legal basis for flights to operate at UK airports from April 1, 2019. When the UK leaves the EU, it also leaves key agreements and agencies like the European Common Aviation Area and the European Aviation Safety Agency. And, unlike other sectors (such as trade), there is no fallback agreement that the UK can rely on.\n\nIf no agreement is reached on trade, WTO provisions could be brought into operation; no similar arrangements exist for aviation. This means there would be no legal framework to fly; \"no deal is better than a bad deal\" simply cannot apply. Traditionally, air services agreements are negotiated on bilateral or multilateral bases and set out the key terms in respect of access and capacity. Hence, the UK needs to conclude bilateral air services agreements with the EU and with all of the non-EU countries currently covered by EU agreements.\n\nWhile such agreements normally take considerably less time to negotiate than trade agreements, these are not normal circumstances. Some EU members may see an opportunity to curb the impact of low fare carriers on their domestic markets. Some US airlines may consider it an opening to restrict long-haul, low fare operators such as Norwegian from accessing US airports via EU registrations.\n\nAnother reason to grant aviation special status in the Brexit negotiations is because airlines sell their product up to 300 days in advance and travel agents sell holidays up to 18 months ahead. Hence, seats on flights scheduled to operate on April 1, 2019 might normally be available for sale on many airlines by the middle of 2018 with the respective date for holidays fast approaching.\n\nSuch advanced planning (alongside its revenue-generating appeal) is necessary to ensure that the required infrastructure, such as aircraft, hotels and crew, are available. EasyJet's application for an Austrian base and Ryanair's call for a clear legal framework by September 2018 reflect the urgency of the matter.\n\nNext steps\n\nWhile both the UK and EU negotiators have publicly adopted a \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\" mantra, the unprecedented nature of these negotiations may provide scope to reach agreement in principle on aviation before other areas. They can then ratify it when all else is agreed.\n\nCalls to afford aviation preference have been forthcoming from several sources.

such as Chancellor Philip Hammond - who appreciate that we need a sensible Brexit transition period to avoid plunging this country headlong into an economic nightmare,\" Soubry writes.\n\n\"In other words - the wise owls should be ruling the roost.\"\n\nMay must stand up to the so-called \"ideologues\" within the Tories, or risk further alienating the large proportion of the parliamentary party that wanted to stay in the European Union and now want a softer Brexit with a long transition period, Soubry added.\n\n\"If the Prime Minister or her successor (in the event of Theresa standing down) is not prepared to confront the ideologues, I gravely fear that the party could split - and that would change Britain's political landscape completely,\" she said.\n\nSoubry's threats of a split in the Tories come on the same day that Chancellor Philip Hammond and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox attempted to quell any accusations of a divide within the government over the UK's approach to Brexit by publishing a joint column in the Sunday Telegraph.\n\nIn the article two of May's most senior ministers said that the UK will seek a transition deal for leaving the EU, but that any deal will not be a \"back door\" to staying in the bloc and would be limited in its time period.\n\n\"We want our economy to remain strong and vibrant through this period of change. That means businesses need to have confidence that there will not be a cliff-edge when we leave the EU in just over twenty months' time,\" the pair wrote.\n\nSoubry has a record of being outspoken when it comes to Brexit and in an interview with Business Insider last year, described the idea that Britain could leave the single market and arrange a better trade deal as \"stuff of the fairies.\"\n\n\"I am beginning to wonder whether some of the people in charge of Leave actually understand the value of the single market,\" she said in October 2016.\n\n\"The idea that we will leave the EU and then negotiate some excellent free trade deal with the rest of Europe and not take the free movement of labour is the stuff of the fairies.\"\n\nSoubry also told the prominent left-leaning magazine the New Statesman in March that she would consider joining a new \"moderate, sensible, forward-thinking\" political party.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-10-", "textEnd": 2534, "textStart": 2522}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T09:24:00Z", "sim": 0.4196078479290009, "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "title": "Business Insider", "id": "711"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "09:24:00", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/anna-soubry-one-of-the-tories-most-anti-brexit-mps-threatens-to-quit-2017-8", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8895618", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/59900f323ce5e9153a645114-1190-625/my-country-must-come-before-my-party-one-of-the-tory-partys-most-anti-brexit-mps-threatens-to-quit.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "09:24:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Applications can be made online via the www.howtostayin.eu website and cost 100 euros ($112).\n\nJust over 22,000 people from 138 countries across the globe have become e-residents so far, including around 1,200 Brits and last year's Brexit vote triggered a boom in applications from the UK.\n\nBefore it, only three British citizens applied per week, but that shot up to over 50 in its aftermath. There was also a 75 percent spike in UK traffic on the website after Prime Minister Theresa May triggered the Article 50 EU exit clause in March.\n\nA \"soft Brexit\" would mean that Britain could retain access to the European single market like non-EU member Norway. But the \"hard Brexit\" option that has prevailed so far would see Britain leave the European single market and the customs union, creating a nightmare scenario for UK businesses as there would no longer be free movement of goods and services.\n\n\"The UK may have chosen to leave the EU, but its entrepreneurs can still choose to remain inside the EU's business environment\" through e-residency, programme director Kaspar Korjus told AFP.\n\nE-residency spokesman Arnaud Castaignet explaind that if a British entrepreneur becomes an Estonian e-resident and establishes a company producing goods in Estonia then they \"will have the same access to the EU market as any EU company.\"\n\nSo far the majority of companies established by e-residents are in consultancy services, IT programming, web developing, business support services.\n\n- 'Insurance policy' -\n\nWinners of the Mayor of London's 2017 Entrepreneur competition say they signed up for e-residency to mitigate the risk Brexit poses for their business, a startup making environmentally-friendly wet wipes.\n\nEllenor McIntosh and Alborz Bozorgi both live in London but say they took up e-residency in order to be able to keep their company, Twipes, inside the EU's single market.\n\nBilling Twipes as \"the future of toilet paper\", its owners say they have registered it both in the UK and Estonia to boost investor confidence.\n\n\"We had discussions with many investors from across Europe, Cyprus and Estonia in particular, and they view the uncertainty of Brexit as a huge risk,\" Bozorgi told AFP via email.\n\n\"We had to incorporate in both the UK and EU as a method of hedging risk,\" he added.\n\nIf Britain loses access to the single market, however, the company would need to source materials and produce Twipes inside the EU to keep duty free access to the bloc.\n\nBrit Dirk Singer established his Rabbit digital marketing agency six years ago in the UK, but wary of Brexit he digitally relocated it to Estonia last year thanks to e-residency.\n\n\"I applied for e-residency shortly before the EU referendum last year. Essentially, I was not so optimistic that we would vote to stay and so I saw this as an insurance policy,\" Singer told AFP.\n\n\"Two of my five biggest clients are from the EU. I'm concerned that as a small UK service-based business, Brexit could start to make life difficult for me.\"\n\nBritish writer Will Mawhood who runs the \"Deep Baltic\" culture website says he jumped at the opportunities and flexibility e-residency offers, especially having his company registered in a eurozone member.\n\n\"I split my time between the UK and Latvia, but since all my work is online, I often spend prolonged periods of time in other countries,\" he told AFP.\n\n\"People involved in my company are based in a variety of countries, so having to sign important documents in person would be unnecessarily time-consuming and complicated,\" he added.\n\n- Digital banking -\n\nAn upgrade to the e-residency programme in May saw Finnish fintech company Holvi team up with Estonia to launch , eliminating the need for e-residents to travel to take care of business banking.\n\nKorjus told AFP that there are signs that this uniquely Estonian digital innovation is catching on abroad.\n\n\"We've had interest from governments around the world who are keen to understand the programme and even introduce their own versions of e-residency.\"\n\nHe insists that safeguards are in place to prevent the programme from being abused for tax evasion or money laundering, including police checks of applicants.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3349185", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T03:56:00Z", "sim": 0.4117647111415863, "source": {"uri": "citizen.co.za", "title": "The Citizen", "id": "4613"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:56:00", "url": "http://citizen.co.za/lifestyle/your-life-technology/1609724/estonia-britain-brexit-it-economy-trade/", "storyUri": "eng-3349185", "id": "8869446", "image": "http://citizen.co.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2017/08/bf1961c770f6c58f39c6626507499f79b8be6a4c-389x259.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "03:56:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Um Schaden von der Wirtschaft abzuwenden, wolle man aber mit Br\u00fcssel \u00dcbergangsfristen von unbestimmter L\u00e4nge aushandeln. Mit dieser Botschaft wandten sich am Sonntag zwei wichtige Kabinettsmitglieder an die \u00d6ffentlichkeit: Finanzminister Philip Hammond galt bisher als Vertreter einer weicheren Brexit-Linie, Au\u00dfenhandelsminister Liam Fox ist eingefleischter EU-Feind.\n\nDie gemeinsame Verlautbarung soll offenbar einen Strich unter die brutalen Positionsk\u00e4mpfe ziehen, die in den vergangenen Wochen im Kabinett tobten. Noch zu Monatsbeginn hatte Fox \u00f6ffentlich einer \u00c4u\u00dferung Hammonds widersprochen, wonach das Land eine dreij\u00e4hrige \u00dcbergangsfrist bis 2022 brauche. Aus Sicht der EU-Feinde soll der Bruch mit dem Br\u00fcsseler Club m\u00f6glichst rasch und vollst\u00e4ndig erfolgen, Hammond sowie Wirtschaftsminister Greg Clark pl\u00e4dieren hingegen f\u00fcr gr\u00f6\u00dftm\u00f6gliche N\u00e4he zum gr\u00f6\u00dften Binnenmarkt der Welt.\n\nF\u00fcr die n\u00e4chste Verhandlungsrunde in Br\u00fcssel muss die Regierung in den n\u00e4chsten Tagen detaillierte Positionspapiere vorlegen. Dabei wird es auch um die Landgrenze zwischen Nordirland und der Republik im S\u00fcden der gr\u00fcnen Insel gehen. Sie ist derzeit kaum noch sichtbar, m\u00fcsste aber aufger\u00fcstet werden, wenn die Briten neue Zollschranken errichten.\n\nDas k\u00fcnftige Verh\u00e4ltnis zu Irland, die Stellung von mehr als drei Millionen EU-B\u00fcrgern auf der Insel sowie britische Zahlungen an Br\u00fcssel bilden die wichtigsten Probleme, die gel\u00f6st werden m\u00fcssen. Dass dies gelingt, halten viele Vertreter unterschiedlicher Parteien f\u00fcr unm\u00f6glich.\n\nDer fr\u00fchere Labour-Au\u00dfenminister David Miliband nannte den Brexit einen \"beispiellosen Akt \u00f6konomischer Selbstverst\u00fcmmelung\". Ein enger Ex-Mitarbeiter des konservativen Brexit-Ministers David Davis spricht von einer Katastrophe, deren wirtschaftliche Konsequenzen v\u00f6llig unabsehbar seien. James Chapman, bis Juni Stabschef im eigens f\u00fcr den EU-Austritt gegr\u00fcndeten Ministeriums DexEU, deshalb tr\u00e4umt sogar von einer neuen Anti-Brexit-Gruppierung: \"Manchmal ist die Nation wichtiger als die Partei.\"\n\nDie Idee einer neuen politischen Kraft geht in Gro\u00dfbritannien schon seit Monaten um. \u00dcberzeugte Anh\u00e4nger des EU-Verbleibs stellen sowohl bei den Konservativen als auch in der Oppositionspartei Labour unter ihrem EU-skeptischen Parteichef Jeremy Corbyn nur eine Minderheit dar. Weder die schottische Nationalpartei SNP mit 35 Mandaten noch die landesweiten Liberaldemokraten (12) sind stark genug, um die Sache jener 48,1 Prozent zu vertreten, die vor Jahresfrist f\u00fcr den EU-Verbleib gestimmt hatten. In Umfragen h\u00e4lt zwar inzwischen eine Mehrheit den Austritt f\u00fcr falsch, pl\u00e4diert aber gleichzeitig daf\u00fcr, die getroffene Entscheidung umzusetzen.", "timeCrawl": "17:55:00", "sim": 0.8235294222831726, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8949585", "categories": [], "details": {}}], "page": 1, "pages": 241, "totalResults": 241}}}
